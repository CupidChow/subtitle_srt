Enjoy the video!

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm not sure if I can do it

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't know if I can do it.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm not sure if I can keep this in my mind.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You're right.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What is a senior's decision?

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I think when he serves us as servants,

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
He is the biggest surprise

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,500
in the world.

40
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,940
Just like that one

41
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,660
You can play

42
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,860
This is a real piece of mystery

43
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,460
Ji Yun

44
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,580
Are you faking it again?

45
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,060
So what

46
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,980
Although master sounds

47
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,140
but still remembers

48
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,940
They don't care

49
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,320
Where'd you go?

50
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,460
It's not good on me to be famous now.

51
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,740
No need to be rude.

52
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,460
That year, the master spent only 300 years

53
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,340
to reach the top 3 of the station ì§§ies

54
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,840
They were more than several years apart

55
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,200
With Marchizers and Peaches, the master must succeed algÃºn

56
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,980
Sir, have you forgotten?

57
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,800
Are you asking for that master?

58
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,240
Then tell me

59
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,740
How was the master in G leurs ì…° in the palace

60
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,880
to find him?

61
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,880
Father?

62
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,620
We must find a way to restore the master's power.

63
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,620
The master never says a word.

64
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,120
Even if you say so, you're actually not capable of doing anything.

65
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,620
I...

66
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,620
Then you have a way.

67
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,620
Let's go grab the Soul Tower of the Manly Magical Qi.

68
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,020
That treasure is not only able to catch the missing soul,

69
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,020
but also the soul-grabbing symbol.

70
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,520
It's also good to save the trouble of the Three-month-old Chen You-hu.

71
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
Okay.

72
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,760
Can you grab it?

73
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,760
No.

74
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,260
The master of the whole world can't beat the man.

75
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,260
You're the one to follow.

76
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,260
For the master, I will do anything.

77
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
Got it?

78
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,520
Ha!

79
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Come, boss.

80
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
Eat.

81
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,520
These bad guys can help you get a great master.

82
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,520
Thanks to my treasure, the soul-grabbing symbol,

83
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,520
it can also make the evil soul look like a fairy.

84
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,520
It's so fragrant and beautiful.

85
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,520
It must be delicious to eat.

86
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,520
What is this?

87
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,520
It's so hard to find.

88
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,520
The spirit of the king.

89
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,520
These years, Ji Yun has been in charge of summoning the spirit.

90
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,520
He will help you to regain your body.

91
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,520
And I and Bei Bei are gathering the evil soul everywhere.

92
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,520
It's convenient for the boss to use it at any time.

93
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,520
That's really hard work.

94
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
So much?

95
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
You should have a bigger meal.

96
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,520
Actually, I...

97
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,520
My treasure!

98
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,520
Who is it?

99
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,520
Grandpa, go out.

100
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
Go out.

101
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,520
Bei Bei!

102
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,520
Oh no, the spirit of the god has arrived.

103
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,520
The master is crazy again.

104
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
He is the god of the world.

105
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
Jian Su.

106
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
The king has been missing for a hundred years.

107
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
How could he leave here?

108
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,520
Go!

109
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,520
Go!

110
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,520
What a trouble.

111
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,520
I will kill you.

112
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,520
You are the master of the god.

113
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
Master!

114
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,520
I will kill you!

115
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,520
Master, go!

116
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
Master! Master!

117
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,520
For Master, I will do everything I can.

118
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,520
I am sorry, Master Fengshen.

119
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
The boss is out of his mind.

120
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,520
When you wake up, don't be so cruel.

121
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
Master!

122
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,520
Oh no, I am going to die.

123
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
Master!

124
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,520
The power of the master!

125
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
What's going on?

126
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
Control him.

127
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
You are?

128
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,520
I...

129
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,520
am...

130
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
Shhh!

131
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
Master!

132
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,520
Master!
