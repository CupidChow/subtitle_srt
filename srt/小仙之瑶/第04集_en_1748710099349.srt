00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,260
Ahh, that's a Broch 해셈

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,680
I'm overly from these days,

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,440
I'm glad that you can watch this.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,720
Master,

35
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,120
if you can behave,

36
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,720
you have no preferred act.

37
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
You...

38
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
Wow, you're really the boss.

39
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,720
You can't even dare to think of such a thing.

40
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,720
My legs are soft.

41
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,720
How can I run?

42
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,720
Why is my body so soft?

43
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
Time to pass.

44
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
What's going on?

45
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,720
Why are you here?

46
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,720
Soon, how will the male lead come to the human world?

47
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
He's here.

48
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
So the male lead didn't come.

49
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
It's Dongbao Chen.

50
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,720
He doesn't want to see his old friend.

51
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
He's chasing us.

52
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
Why is he so fast?

53
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,720
But we didn't know how to get him.

54
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
That's the power.

55
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
Master, you're weak.

56
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,720
We can't risk our lives.

57
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,720
We can't take the revenge for ten years.

58
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
Or we'll run away.

59
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
What's going on?

60
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
Go and steal him!

61
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,720
So it's the demon group.

62
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
Let's see.

63
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
He's still not running.

64
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
The male lead is here.

65
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
I know.

66
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
What's wrong?

67
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
I'm not running.

68
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
I know.

69
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
You've found it?

70
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,720
You didn't know?

71
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,720
My mission is to find the soul.

72
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,720
I'm not a spy.

73
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
What a nice god.

74
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
I'm not a spy.

75
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
I'm not a spy.

76
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
I'm not a spy.

77
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
I'm not a spy.

78
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,720
I'm not a spy.

79
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
I'm not a spy.

80
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
I'm not a spy.

81
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
I'm not a spy.

82
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
I'm not a spy.

83
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
I'm not a spy.

84
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,720
I'm not a spy.

85
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
I'm not a spy.

86
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
I'm not a spy.

87
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
I'm not a spy.

88
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
I'm not a spy.

89
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
I'm not a spy.

90
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
I'm not a spy.

91
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
I'm not a spy.

92
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
I'm not a spy.

93
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
I'm not a spy.

94
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
I'm not a spy.

95
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
I'm not a spy.

96
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
I'm not a spy.

97
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
I'm not a spy.

98
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
I'm not a spy.

99
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
I'm not a spy.

100
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
I'm not a spy.

101
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Boss.

102
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,720
Have you forgotten your current state?

103
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
Even if you want to go,

104
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
I won't go.

105
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
I'm not here to fight.

106
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
I only want her.

107
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Don't disturb me.

108
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
I'm not here to fight.

109
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
I'm not here to fight.

110
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
I'm not here to fight.

111
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,720
I'm not here to fight.

112
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
I...

113
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Take the master away.

114
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
I don't want you to leave.

115
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
You can't leave me alone.

116
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
We're not stupid.

117
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
We're fighting with a god.

118
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Don't be stupid.

119
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Yes, yes.

120
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,720
It's very troublesome to save my old friend.

121
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,720
It's a smart choice to avoid trouble.

122
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,720
Let me go back.

123
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
Follow the instructions.

124
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,720
We should not let Ji Yun's sacrifice go away.

125
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
How can I hear the god of war?

126
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
How can I breathe?

127
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
You can use your courage.

128
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
You'll die anyway.

129
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
Play it like this again.

130
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,260
Throw it!

131
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
It's god of war.

132
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:26,140
Fay did!

133
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,940
The most dangerous place is the safest place.

134
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,940
It's dangerous, it's dangerous.

135
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,140
I'm going to vomit.

136
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,940
If you feel uncomfortable,

137
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,340
if you can use your waist,

138
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,140
I'll help you to recover.

139
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,340
No, you can leave.

140
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,740
Boss,

141
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,140
I've been following you for so many years,

142
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,540
and I've been loyal to you.

143
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,140
I even invited you here to remember his spirit.

144
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,540
It's really a bad moment.

145
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,540
I don't know if there will be someone bullying him down there.

146
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,140
He's more stupid than me.

147
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,340
Someone will bully him.

148
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,140
I have a acquaintance who can take off the mask.

149
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,740
I can ask him to drink and take care of Yi'er.

150
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,540
It's not easy to make money.

151
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,340
I'm going to die.

152
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,940
I have three bamboo shoots.

153
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:33,940
I have the most.

154
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,940
You bastard.

155
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,340
How could you hate a dog's skin?

156
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,340
If he comes again, I'll...

157
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,540
What's your name?

158
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,540
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,940
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,340
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,340
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,340
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,340
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,340
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,340
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,340
I'm sorry.

167
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,340
I'm sorry.

168
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,340
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,340
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,340
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,340
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,340
I'm sorry.

173
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,340
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,340
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,340
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,340
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,340
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,340
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,340
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,340
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,340
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,340
I'm sorry.

183
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,340
I'm sorry.

184
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,340
I'm sorry.

185
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,540
I'm sorry.
