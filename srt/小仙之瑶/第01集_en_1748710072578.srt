1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Should all the otherpiric stars be true or false?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Okay then.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This video is honestly the worst I could have done yesterday...

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
if magen didn't appear to have properly transcribed to the original script.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
As of today, I suppose more than only two will appeared to組 up management.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,500
Episode 18

7
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,300
theani's two has done it for a long time

8
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,040
so the master signed the War Pavilion

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,020
and commanding him to land the ground

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,220
So 불�et to seek only for peace

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,260
The gods stand tall like a bird

12
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,040
her service and great deal

13
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,820
So I'll swing by those people

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
I will repeat my words.

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,820
Qingluan.

16
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,820
Di Jiao.

17
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,820
Zheng Yu.

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,820
I will fight you.

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,820
He is the He Wan of the Shadow Lord.

20
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,820
I have never seen someone so arrogant.

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,820
No.

22
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,820
Lord Shen.

23
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,820
Great.

24
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,820
Lord Shen is here.

25
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,820
He Wan is dead.

26
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,820
He Wan is here.

27
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,820
Kill him.

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,820
Go.

29
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,820
Wan Xiang Guixu.

30
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,820
Qian Kun Suo Hun.

31
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,820
Wan Wan.

32
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,820
Zheng Xin Lian, you go and fight him.

33
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
How can you be so weak?

34
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,820
Lord Cheng Shui.

35
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,820
He is a demon.

36
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,820
He is dead.

37
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,820
Be careful.

38
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,820
Don't be afraid.

39
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,820
He Wan's daughter Cheng Xin.

40
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,820
Kill her.

41
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,820
I will kill her.

42
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,820
Di Jiao.

43
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,820
There must be a secret.

44
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
I will ask the truth.

45
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,820
Dan Ze.

46
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,820
The Shadow Clan is in trouble.

47
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,820
You must find out the consequences.

48
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,820
Zheng Shui.

49
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,820
Wan Wan.

50
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,820
No wonder I can't find you.

51
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,820
You are the Lord Shen.

52
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,820
Wan Wan, go.

53
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,820
Don't be afraid.

54
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,820
Wan Wan.

55
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,820
Wan Wan.

56
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,820
I am the King of the world.

57
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
I am the King of the world.

58
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,820
I am the King of the world.

59
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
I am the King of the world.

60
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
I am the King of the world.

61
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,820
I am the King of the world.

62
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,820
I am the King of the world.

63
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
I am the King of the world.

64
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
I am the King of the world.

65
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
I am the King of the world.

66
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,820
I am the King of the world.

67
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,820
I am the King of the world.

68
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,820
I am the King of the world.

69
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,820
I am the King of the world.

70
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,820
I am the King of the world.

71
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,820
Wan Wan.

72
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,820
I am...

73
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,820
dead?

74
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,820
Master.

75
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,820
Master.

76
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,820
Master.

77
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,820
Welcome back to Xiyun.

78
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,820
I am back.

79
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,820
Revenge?

80
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,820
Wait.

81
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,820
Xiyun?

82
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,820
Isn't he the guard of the Shadow Zong?

83
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,820
What...what's going on?

84
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
Did I get caught in the Shadow Zong's body?

85
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,820
He said he knew I was not...

86
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,820
and he would keep me alive.

87
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,820
He would keep me alive.

88
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
You are so arrogant.

89
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,820
You are so shameless.

90
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,820
I deserve to die.

91
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,820
I am the one who is responsible for the death of the Soul-catching Fan.

92
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
I am the one who is responsible for the death of the Soul-catching Fan.

93
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,820
Please give me a chance to be punished.

94
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,820
You call me Master.

95
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
Then you should know who I am.

96
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,820
Why am I in this place?

97
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,820
Yes, Master.

98
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,820
Why did you die?

99
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,820
Ten thousand years ago,

100
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,820
the Xiheng Clan was arrested.

101
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
They took the Seven-leafed Wings to the Shadow Zong.

102
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,820
They fought countless battles.

103
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,820
Until Master's death...

104
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,820
Say it.

105
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,820
Yes.

106
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,820
Master became the Shadow Zong.

107
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
He beat the Nine-leafed Heaven and killed the Shen Clan.

108
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,820
But he was attacked by the Zong.

109
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,820
So I was lucky to get the Soul-catching Fan.

110
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
I was able to re-revenge Master's body.

111
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
I was born with the time.

112
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,820
I am blessed with the jade.

113
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
Is it because of the Soul-catching Fan

114
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,820
that I got caught?

115
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,820
I am lucky.

116
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,820
Master's shadow.

117
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
The Shen Soul is not strong enough.

118
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,820
It needs to be re-reached.

119
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,820
I need to get the Soul-catching Fan.

120
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,820
I need to get the Soul-catching Fan.

121
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,820
I need to get the Soul-catching Fan.

122
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,820
Why does he look like a dream to me?

123
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
I am not a dreamer.

124
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
I am now the Shadow Zong.

125
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,820
No matter what the punishment is,

126
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
I am not able to get the Soul-catching Fan.

127
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,820
I am not a dreamer.

128
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
The Nine-leafed Heaven is definitely dead.

129
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
And the Moon-leafed Heaven is being torn apart.

130
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,820
What should I do?

131
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,820
What should I do?

132
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,820
Is he suspecting me?

133
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,820
Master doesn't even want to see me.

134
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,820
That's not the case.

135
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,820
No way.

136
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
I really have a bad feeling about you.

137
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,820
Master!

138
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,820
I will come back.

139
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
I don't think I can escape.

140
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,820
Let's go.

141
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,820
Master, be careful.

142
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,820
Master, don't be afraid.

143
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,820
What's this?

144
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,820
Master's soul is stable.

145
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,820
He can live.

146
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,820
I am sorry.

147
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,820
Please forgive me.

148
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
The Seven-leafed Heaven is in trouble.

149
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,820
It's really him.

150
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,820
Master!

151
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,820
I am so lucky that we have the magic treasure.

152
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,820
We can move in an instant.

153
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,820
I beg you to save me.

154
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,820
Master, the Yin-leafed Heaven is completely restored.

155
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,820
It's not a good time to take revenge.

156
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,820
Let's wait for the time to come.

157
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,820
When the other three of us are in the level,

158
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,820
we can fight with them.

159
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,820
So we will definitely be defeated by Master Zhanshan.

160
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,820
No.

161
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
If we can really go to the Sky Hall,

162
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
we will be able to escape the Sky.

163
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,820
That's weird.

164
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,820
Xiang Xishi should have brought us to Bai Lan Yan.

165
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,820
Why didn't he see his shadow?

166
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,820
Come on.

167
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,820
You...

168
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,820
It's him.

169
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,820
No, Master.

170
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
Bai Lan Yan can be a great human being.

171
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,820
And this spirit is the four-leafed spirit of Bai Lan Yan.

172
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,820
How dare you lie in front of Master Zhanshan?

173
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,820
Do I still have a chance to escape?

174
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,820
Master is shocked.

175
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,820
Xu Shi...

176
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,820
Cute.

177
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,820
Weimu?

178
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,820
You are Bai Lan Yan.

179
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,820
You are a beast.

180
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,820
You can't be so rude in front of Master.

181
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,820
Hit me.

182
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,820
Hit me.

183
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,820
Hit me.

184
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
Who dares to touch my boyfriend?

185
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,820
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,820
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,820
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,820
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,820
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,820
