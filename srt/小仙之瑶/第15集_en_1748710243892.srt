00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,580
I think we agreed on that, because we may have to vieläver excess energy fromnicon other acceptance resistions, anymore.

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,900
Tom душel, we have influenced you so much, the two of you.

3
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:28,480
What is your reason behind Venetian creation, thanks to you, President Games?

4
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:28,480
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the wind

5
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:50,380
Two elements were born togetherstarlight or defeats archery or victory, but they are not our emotions, and they are anyhow reborn into the huge galaxy now, then, it's time for the destiny to Square-b propellant forward.

6
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,480
Episode 1

7
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,480
I'm late.

8
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
I'm sorry.

9
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,480
Stop being a hero.

10
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,480
My poison has already started.

11
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,480
And I'm in your body.

12
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,480
I'm not a sister.

13
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
I'll wait for you.

14
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,480
I'll wait for you until I die.

15
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,480
What do you mean by that?

16
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
No!

17
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
No!

18
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,480
No!

19
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,480
I've already prepared for my sacrifice

20
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,480
a hundred years ago.

21
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
No!

22
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
What?

23
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,480
Heaven!

24
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,480
Father! Mother!

25
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,480
Help! Help!

26
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,480
The poison is coming!

27
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,480
How could it be?

28
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
You...

29
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,480
The killing is not easy.

30
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,480
But I still want to kill you.

31
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
I'll kill you!

32
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,480
I really want to kill you.

33
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,480
We're willing to sacrifice our lives.

34
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
Let's go!

35
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
Let's go!

36
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,480
We're willing to sacrifice our lives.

37
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Let's go!

38
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
Let's go!

39
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
We're willing to sacrifice our lives.

40
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
Let's go!

41
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
Let's go!

42
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,480
We're willing to sacrifice our lives.

43
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
Let's go!

44
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
No need to do that.

45
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
Even if there's a murder,

46
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,480
you can't just rely on the gods.

47
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
You're so hard-working.

48
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
Who are you?

49
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Who are you?

50
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
How could you be here?

51
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
Sister!

52
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
How dare you!

53
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,480
I want to keep my dignity in front of me.

54
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Tell me.

55
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
Where is my dignity?

56
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,480
You're not worthy of my respect.

57
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
What are you doing?

58
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,480
You're not qualified to be my wife.

59
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,480
I have the patience to be with you.

60
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,480
I just don't know if they

61
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
have this life.

62
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
I'm not dead.

63
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
Let them go.

64
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,480
You know that I'm not dead.

65
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,480
Who are you?

66
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,480
I'm the god of the gods.

67
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
I'm the god of the gods.

68
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
Lu Chengui.

69
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,480
Why did you leave the gods at the right time?

70
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
I just want to ask you.

71
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,480
The demons and the gods have never fought.

72
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Do you really want to kill the gods for me?

73
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
I'll do my best.

74
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,480
But with the gods,

75
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
I want to ask Honorable Honorable Sun

76
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
to discuss something.

77
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
Go ahead.

78
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,480
My demons are obedient and calm.

79
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,480
There's still a lack of a demon

80
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
in the world.

81
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,480
I'm not good at it.

82
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
You care about my goddess?

83
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
I'm just saying

84
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,480
that I want to ask for your permission.

85
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
I promise you.

86
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,480
The gods are making fun of me?

87
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
My mental state

88
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
will leave a deep desire.

89
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,480
Since we all want to find He Wan,

90
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
we'll let the people in your hands

91
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
find He Wan for three times.

92
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
He is the key.

93
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
You think I'll believe you?

94
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,480
I'm willing to open the Soul Tower in Jingyuan

95
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,480
just to find He Wan for three times.

96
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
You should believe me to find He Wan's heart.

97
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,480
What's the relationship between him and me?

98
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
The demons will soon call the line.

99
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
If we drag it down,

100
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,480
everyone will die, including you.

101
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Lu Chengui.

102
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,480
Let her go.

103
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,480
Do you know that because of your loneliness,

104
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
you killed so many innocent people?

105
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,480
What is the mystery in your eyes?

106
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,480
Don't be so reckless.

107
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,480
The purpose of the gods

108
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,480
is to make them all die here.

109
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,480
The murder will be over soon.

110
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
No matter what you do,

111
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
it's useless.

112
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
I will find you

113
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
as long as I can.

114
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,480
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
You're welcome.

116
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Let's go.

117
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,480
I'm sorry.
