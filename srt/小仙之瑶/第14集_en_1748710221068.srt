00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,220
Music

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Ok, your turn

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Cleanse skill

33
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,240
Erwein!

34
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,940
Not here.

35
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,720
Did you?

36
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,740
This time, it's not right.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm afraid of death.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,500
Run this direction!

39
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
We can leave here!

40
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
Hurry!

41
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Move aside!

42
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
I don't have any value in my heart.

43
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
I can't lose my strength.

44
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,000
I will never leave the path you set!

45
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
I will show my true colors!

46
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
No!

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,500
What's going on?

48
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
It's time to end this.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No!

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No!

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No!

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Help!

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Help!

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm afraid you will lose your strength.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What's going on?

56
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
No!

57
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Ah Zi, can you hear me?

58
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,500
I don't know why this limit is turning suddenly.

59
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,000
Can you see the entire formation?

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,500
Draw it for me.

61
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Okay.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Demon clan?

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,500
Demon clan?

64
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,500
The power of the Demon Clan is beyond the horizon.

65
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Is there anyone else behind it?

66
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,500
The formation is not only capable of doing it,

67
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
but also a way to stop the formation.

68
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,500
We need to find the person who set the formation.

69
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
The person who set the formation?

70
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
It seems that the clues are still going to be found by Uncle.

71
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
I'll go find him.

72
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Okay.

73
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Be careful!

74
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
The power of the Demon Clan is the brother of the Garden.

75
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,500
If Demon Clan is destroyed, the country will be destroyed.

76
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
We can't be outside this world anymore.

77
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
I have to go down and see.

78
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
Please.

79
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Okay.

80
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
I knew it, you went to the Star Sect.

81
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,960
mesh

82
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
also

83
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
hide

84
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
the Your Majesty!

85
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Wang Yu?

86
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
eles

87
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
guys

88
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,720
I can't really do anything!

89
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,020
From now on,

90
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,960
you are all of the three ministers ofipper of the heavens and earth

91
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,080
No, you're not the only country

92
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,080
I'm really sorry.

93
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,080
Please help me.

94
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,080
Don't you want to find the Soul of Honorable Superior?

95
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Even if you want to find the Soul,

96
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
why bother to say it?

97
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,080
What is your real purpose?

98
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,080
That's not what you want to say.

99
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
The Soul of Honorable Superior has been broken.

100
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,080
I didn't expect that Master would be forced to do so.

101
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,080
I'm going to fight for the Soul of Honorable Superior.

102
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
What?

103
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
Master, you're all so cruel.

104
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
Master, you're all so cruel.

105
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
You're all so cruel.

106
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Master, you're all so cruel.

107
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,080
You're all so cruel.

108
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,080
Master, you're all so cruel.

109
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
You're all so cruel.

110
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,080
You should have your own judgment.

111
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,080
We, the Mo Yin Clan, have been trapped in this place for thousands of years.

112
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,080
Mo Yang is our only hope.

113
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,080
We are not being suppressed by the gods.

114
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,080
We live a peaceful life.

115
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,080
He will be a successful leader in the future.

116
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,080
But unfortunately, the heaven is not good.

117
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,080
This time, the trap is not easy to get.

118
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:35,080
But forgive me for making you take such a serious responsibility.

119
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,080
I can only...

120
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,080
...save you.

121
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
He's responsible.

122
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,080
He has been attacked again.

123
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,080
He's no more.

124
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,080
What's hard to heal?

125
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,600
We know that we can destroy theï¿½

126
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,080
the final throne.

127
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,080
But we have no such word for all that.

128
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,120
Bloody Beasts...

129
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,920
I came to help you!

130
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,060
OT cannon with Fog...

131
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,940
Goddess...

132
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,940
No!

133
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,940
No!

134
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,940
No!

135
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,940
No!

136
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:45,940
No!

137
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,940
No!

138
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,940
No!

139
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,940
No!

140
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,940
No!

141
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,940
No!

142
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,940
No!

143
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,940
No!

144
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,940
No!

145
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,940
No!

146
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,940
No!

147
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,940
No!
