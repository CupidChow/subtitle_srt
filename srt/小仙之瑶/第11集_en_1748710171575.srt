1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
I getup is a diffcult dream than I expected.

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:25,960
...

3
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,960
The End

4
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,960
Episode 1

5
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,960
The End

6
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,960
Episode 1

7
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,960
Run! Run!

8
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,960
Run!

9
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Run!

10
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,960
Brother Mo Yang.

11
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,960
Run! Run!

12
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
Xinyuan!

13
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
Brother Mo!

14
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,960
Don't come over.

15
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
I'm fine.

16
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Tell me, why?

17
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,960
We didn't do anything.

18
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,960
We need to be locked up here for hundreds of years!

19
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
Zi Lu.

20
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
The left side is guilty.

21
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
The right side is guilty.

22
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,960
The right side is guilty.

23
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,960
When the crime is committed,

24
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,960
the punishment will be over.

25
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
I'll help you.

26
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,960
Where are the other villagers?

27
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,960
You're asking why only Mo Yang is in the family?

28
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,960
We can't do it.

29
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Thanks.

30
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,960
But leave the things that you can't do to me.

31
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
You...

32
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
You're a coward.

33
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
You're a coward.

34
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
Mo Yang is a man of the past.

35
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
He can only be under the protection of the gods.

36
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,960
He can only be a man who can use his power to protect the world.

37
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
You...

38
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Successful!

39
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
Brother Mo!

40
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
Mo Yang.

41
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,960
The funeral is not a problem.

42
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
I understand.

43
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,960
There's a fate in Wanwu Street.

44
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,960
Our goal is to find the soul of the three souls.

45
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,960
We can't do anything about it.

46
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
The gold vein is in chaos.

47
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,960
It seems that the magic has intensified.

48
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,960
His body is already in great danger.

49
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,960
Let's go and find the exit.

50
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
I'll go find the exit.

51
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
I'll go find the exit.

52
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,960
I'll go find the exit.

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
I'll go find the exit.

54
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
I'll go find the exit.

55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
I'll go find the exit.

56
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
I'll go find the exit.

57
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
I'll go find the exit.

58
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
Take them back.

59
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,960
Yes.

60
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,960
Leave it to me.

61
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,960
I've already made up my mind about the matter you asked for.

62
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
With the fire rain,

63
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
please help me open the formation.

64
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Good.

65
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,960
This used to be the important place for us to get water.

66
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
Now it's like this.

67
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,960
You try it.

68
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,960
Okay.

69
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,960
The sky is dark.

70
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Listen to me.

71
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
The soul is shaking.

72
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
The formation is in a hurry.

73
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,960
What's going on?

74
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
It's okay.

75
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,960
Since we don't have a soul,

76
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,960
we must go to the next secret place as soon as possible.

77
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
Sister Qiu,

78
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,960
can you think of any clues about the exit?

79
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,960
We were in a hurry to get water

80
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,960
and came from the forest.

81
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,960
So we suspect that

82
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,960
the river has another secret place.

83
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,960
But we didn't get any clues

84
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,960
after we got the water.

85
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,960
What's the point of you getting water?

86
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
Nothing special.

87
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,960
The moon in the autumn is very round.

88
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,960
It's the full moon.

89
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
Could it be that the entrance

90
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,960
opens after the full moon?

91
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
This is...

92
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,960
Stop!

93
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
I'm threatening you!

94
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,460
This must revenge.

95
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
Step aside.

96
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Why don't you follow me?

97
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Go forward...

98
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
Yifeng, I have my own opinion.

99
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
They won't thank you.

100
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
I'll wait for you in the altar.

101
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
The altar?

102
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,960
Could it be...

103
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
I heard that a magic poet came.

104
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,960
As long as the magic needle is in the city,

105
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,960
we can leave this place.

106
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
I wonder if my wife

107
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,960
can live until the day she leaves.

108
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
I'll take you to see the outside world.

109
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Suyu, tell me.

110
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
If I can really send this power to the altar,

111
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,960
can my father recognize me?

112
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
Suyu!

113
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
I'll kill you!

114
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Wake up!

115
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,960
Qingyue!

116
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
What's the difference between this and the magic?

117
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Get up!

118
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,960
Suyu, one day,

119
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
I'll kill the gods

120
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,960
and lead all the people to leave this place with you.

121
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,960
But can you control yourself?

122
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,960
Look at what you've done!

123
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,960
Suyu!

124
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,960
You have to protect her!

125
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Suyu!

126
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
Suyu!

127
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,960
Suyu!

128
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,960
Why did the barrier appear again?

129
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
When I come back,

130
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
my body is all wet.

131
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,960
How long have you been out there?

132
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,960
Brother Mo!

133
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,960
I have a move!

134
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
Hurry and go inside.

135
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
I'll go get it back.

136
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,960
Let's start.

137
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,960
Suyu,

138
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,960
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,960
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,960
I'm sorry.

146
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
I'm sorry.
