00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,680
REACTION

7
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,480
I'm so lucky

8
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,080
I can't find the right place to hide

9
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,560
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,960
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

11
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,560
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,400
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,240
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

14
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,800
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,280
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

I'm a fool, I'm a fool

18
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,080
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

19
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,080
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,080
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,080
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,080
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

23
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,080
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

24
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,080
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,080
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

26
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,080
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

27
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,080
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

28
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,080
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

29
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,080
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

30
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,080
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,080
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

32
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,080
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

33
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,080
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

34
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,080
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,080
Village Chief, didn't the man say that as long as the line goes through

36
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
he can strengthen the power of the Mo Yang

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,080
and make the archery of the Gunggong

38
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,080
he can make the archery of the Gunggong

39
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,080
Village Chief

40
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080
You're back

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
This trip was a success

42
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,080
The situation is obviously less

43
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,080
There are not many magic weapons that can be trained

44
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,080
Then you don't care about those useless hidden powers

45
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,080
Is it because you can only train the magic weapons

46
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,080
and our Baijiaozi?

47
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,080
Chief

48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,080
Why are you calling us?

49
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,080
Without the hidden powers

50
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,080
the barrier will be broken sooner or later

51
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
Since you're born in the desert

52
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,080
you must have the courage to be the desert

53
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,080
If you want to sacrifice your life for the people

54
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,080
I'd rather die now

55
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,080
I thought the place of evil is the path of the poor

56
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,080
I didn't expect it to be so ancient

57
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,080
I misunderstood him before

58
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
Village Chief Mo

59
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,080
The hidden powers that the Mo Yang has for the barrier

60
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,080
There are guests

61
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
The ears are so sharp

62
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,080
I met them in the desert

63
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,080
I brought them back

64
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,080
Why are they looking at this woman?

65
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
They're a bit familiar

66
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
I remember

67
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
This is not a night

68
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,080
I brought a man back

69
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,080
This man looks so angry

70
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
Where did he come from?

71
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
He Wan, you've been coming back

72
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
Did you bring us together?

73
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,080
He is He Wan

74
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
But he has lost his memory

75
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,080
Don't make him feel bad

76
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
The hidden powers are always there

77
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
Let him make up for it

78
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,080
I have a bad feeling about this

79
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,080
That's just a normal person

80
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,080
You're talking nonsense

81
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,080
You're not going to use the useless things

82
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,080
You're going to stay in the village?

83
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,080
Get out of here!

84
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,080
You bastard!

85
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,080
We can't interfere in the village

86
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,080
We'll leave if we learn something from the past

87
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Do you know how to get out?

88
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,080
I don't know

89
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,080
You can use the hidden powers under the barrier

90
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,080
These two are not simple

91
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Father

92
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Why are you not at home?

93
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
Take good care of yourself

94
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,080
It's rare to see him bring his friends back

95
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,080
So he came out to pick them up

96
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,080
I thought they were going to eat

97
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,080
Go

98
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Then we won't disturb you

99
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,080
Thank you for today

100
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
You're welcome

101
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,080
We just asked you to find the exit

102
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,080
If you need any help, please call me

103
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,080
Who is that?

104
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,080
The wife of the village

105
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
Su Yu

106
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,080
Yuan Yu?

107
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
It's the first female warrior in the world

108
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,080
The Yuan Yu princess has arrived here

109
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,080
I heard that the Yuan Yu princess had a engagement with Ziwei

110
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,080
But Ziwei is a female member of the Yin Clan

111
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,080
I'm sorry

112
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,080
It's your fault

113
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,080
You don't need to blame yourself

114
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,080
If I see Yuan Yu again

115
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,080
I won't leave with the previous one

116
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,080
I've already said it

117
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,080
He said it?

118
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,080
I don't know

119
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,080
I heard that after you and master left

120
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,080
I heard that you were dead

121
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,080
Love is a word

122
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,080
It's right and wrong

123
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,080
It's hard to say that you lost your memory

124
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,080
Or I can tell you something

125
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,080
I'll remind you of it

126
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
Listen

127
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,080
The first time I saw you

128
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,080
I was out in the desert

129
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,080
You were in a coma

130
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,080
You had a bad time

131
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,080
I took you back to the old town with Song Yi

132
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
But you didn't talk

133
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,080
You were looking for the exit

134
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
Song Yi?

135
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
Is it Ziwei's new army?

136
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
The female warrior Song Yi?

137
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
You were out for the first time

138
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,080
You didn't come back

139
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,080
Song Yi was afraid that he would be in danger

140
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,080
So he stopped me and went to you

141
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,080
But you were attacked by the demon

142
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,080
You were bleeding

143
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,080
He hurt your hand to protect you

144
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
After that

145
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,080
You were in the way of Song Yi

146
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,080
You were a little quiet

147
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
You disappeared for a while

148
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
When you appeared

149
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,080
You had a powerful power

150
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,080
You lost your memory

151
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,080
You didn't suffer from the fire

152
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,080
But you were in the fire

153
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,080
I've never seen you since then

154
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,080
Why did he suddenly have a secret?

155
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,080
I don't know

156
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,080
Where is Song Yi now?

157
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,080
He is the doctor of the stars

158
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,080
He will protect you if you give him life

159
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,080
If you turn into a human, you won't be in trouble

160
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,080
Thank you

161
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,080
We came here for the sake of finding the river

162
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,080
But we didn't find the soul

163
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,080
What did you think of this place?

164
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
We've been using the water source for hundreds of years

165
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
To get it together

166
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,080
It's hard to say

167
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,080
We should go to the scene

168
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,080
I'll take you there tomorrow morning

169
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
Qiu Shijie

170
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
When we find the exit

171
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,080
You can leave with us

172
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,080
What is this?

173
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,080
It's fire

174
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,080
It's getting more and more common

175
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,080
Wang Yang is fighting again

176
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,080
Run away

177
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,080
Run away
