1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,660
The challenge continues

2
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,900
The anyone who canหม

3
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,320
The someday

4
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:05,900

5
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,780
You

6
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,800
Achy

00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,940
ath

8
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,200
No

9
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,200
I brought him here!

10
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,200
You think you can betray me?

11
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
How can I betray you?

12
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Master, it's hard to say.

13
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
I can help you to find the right place for you.

14
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
That's why I brought him here.

15
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,200
As a exchange,

16
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,200
I have something important to ask him.

17
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,200
You...you want to kill me?

18
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,200
You can leave now.

19
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
This...

20
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
You...you're not even human.

21
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Go away!

22
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Don't fall in love with the gods.

23
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,200
I will be sad.

24
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Madam!

25
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
If I really want to kill you,

26
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
who can stop me?

27
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Don't be angry.

28
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,200
I want to see you.

29
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Don't be angry.

30
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,200
I want to see you.

31
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,200
Something is wrong.

32
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
I know.

33
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Lin Yan, I can't help but have another purpose.

34
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,200
But I can't hear what you're talking about.

35
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Master, you're not doing anything to me.

36
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
You think I can't do it?

37
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Yes.

38
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
I said that Nan Ze is a bad guy.

39
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
What should I do to him?

40
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Then you can take him.

41
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
It's okay.

42
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Nan Ze wants to use the Soul Tower to explore the Three Souls.

43
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
He will surely consume the essence of his life.

44
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
The essence of his life is not to be born again.

45
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
What is so important?

46
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
He has to sacrifice so much to help?

47
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
No matter what,

48
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
when master takes the Soul Tower back,

49
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
the answer will be revealed.

50
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
When Nan Ze is the master of the cultivation,

51
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
we can kill him without having to do anything.

52
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
I'm here to see you.

53
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Master, you finally come to save me.

54
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
You scared me to death.

55
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
What did you call me?

56
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
Oh, right.

57
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
I'm the little fairy of the Shrine of the Shrine of the Shrine.

58
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
At that time, the night was dark and the wind was high.

59
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,200
I was running around with a small trick.

60
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,200
But I bumped into you and entered the Yuge.

61
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,540
What?

62
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,860
Long time no see, Shi Yue.

63
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,560
Luckily, I'm entirely350セ!

64
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,360
www.го-tang motel

65
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,860
I saw nothing

66
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,700
If you want the lifeline

67
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,700
Take me to the Yubi Hall

68
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
You can't use it as my identity.

69
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
You can only use it as my identity.

70
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Are you going to shut up?

71
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
I know.

72
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
It's written all over the world.

73
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Yuge is surrounded by the Fire City.

74
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Only Yuge can enter and out.

75
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,200
We can attack the fire.

76
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
You're here to get your own jade pendant, right?

77
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
I'll take you there right away.

78
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
I'm going to take you there.

79
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
I'm going to take you there.

80
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,200
How did you know I'm here to get jade pendant?

81
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,200
We don't have anything else to offer.

82
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,200
The jade pendant is a jade pendant that is made of the essence of the essence of the essence.

83
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,200
The jade pendant is made of jade and it can be used to heal the spirit.

84
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,200
If you take it out, it's useless.

85
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,200
So you can take it with you.

86
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,200
So I'm bold enough to make a guess.

87
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,200
You want to show off your skills.

88
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,200
You have to help me with the rules.

89
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,200
Lord Zhanshan is a hero of our tribe.

90
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
The world's first demon.

91
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
How could he have a bad mind?

92
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Besides, Lord Yin has sent us a book.

93
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,200
You must want to use your skills to make a poem.

94
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,200
I can't believe the immortal god of fairytales.

95
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Instead, I used my body to cover my nose.

96
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,200
That isn't the best way to支持 me when I'm in a war.

97
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,200
I'm very slow and bold.

98
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,200
If only I伊cestral and quantity high daddy.

99
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
I wonder if J environments are bad enough.

100
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:21,440
Red 잠깐만 text

101
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,640
我自己

102
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
I'm afraid.

103
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
Well...

104
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
Don't be afraid.

105
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
You may be in trouble,

106
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
but I'm here.

107
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,640
I won't hurt you.

108
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
I'm here.

109
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
I'm here.
