1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
What war have you won?

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,020
First come is first served.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,060
Finally, all work is done.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,140
Yinesima died in July.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,700
YOU CAN'T TÃ¼rktersk

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,040
Why have you been forced to fight in such a Crow

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,340
I wanted to lead you toyt

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,600
Why won't life continue.

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
I can't find the answer

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

29
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

35
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
I'm not sure if I can find the answer

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
music

38
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
facts

39
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Cover the room

40
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Leave it alone

41
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,920
After the war, a good man brought me here

42
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,440
You didn't come again

43
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,280
Sit

44
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,600
Good boy

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,560
You want to try this too?

46
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,120
Thanks

47
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,720
How's that?

48
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,720
If you still want to eat something,

49
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,720
I'll send you off immediately.

50
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
Thanks.

51
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
Why would he listen to you?

52
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,720
Because I raised Xiao Bai.

53
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,720
Don't think that Xiao Bai is so naive.

54
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,720
He's actually very young.

55
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,720
When the young man was killed,

56
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
he hasn't been able to break the shell yet.

57
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,720
He's been holding the big one for a long time.

58
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,720
I can't break the formation.

59
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
Otherwise, I'll be in the whole Cicada.

60
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,720
This pattern is so familiar.

61
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Have you seen it?

62
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,720
It's the jade pendant that the Master gave me.

63
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,080
It's time to take the

64
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,720
I'll cut it.

65
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
No.

66
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,720
You and the Master of the Ling Yu Pavilion have a secret plan.

67
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,720
I'm afraid that they'll find out before they get close.

68
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,720
What should we do?

69
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,720
A man and a woman can never let you steal.

70
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
The cakes are gone.

71
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
I'll bring them to you tomorrow.

72
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
Okay?

73
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
I'll go get them.

74
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
It's open now?

75
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,720
Xiao Bai, you're so great.

76
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,720
The Master actually put the jade pendant here.

77
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,720
Boss.

78
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,720
How did the jade pendant get so dark?

79
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
I've been injured.

80
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,720
How could you repeat the same thing?

81
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
If I can't stop the jade pendant,

82
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
the God Clan will definitely destroy the jade pendant.

83
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
Let's start.

84
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
Master.

85
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
Master.

86
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
I feel so uncomfortable.

87
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
I can't control it.

88
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
It means that the jade pendant is dead.

89
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
I can't control it.

90
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Don't be hit by the jade pendant.

91
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
Thank you.

92
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
Sorry.

93
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Sorry.

94
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
I didn't take it.

95
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Are you okay?

96
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
I'm fine.

97
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,720
You've recovered the jade pendant of the Dian Feng period.

98
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,720
But you're still in a big trouble.

99
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
I'll feel better after eating it.

100
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,720
How could you have the jade pendant?

101
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,720
This is the jade pendant of the Dian Feng period.

102
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
I'll take it if I can.

103
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
When the war is over,

104
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
I'll explain to Ge Zhou.

105
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
I'll implore you.

106
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,720
I was worried about you.

107
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,720
I was afraid that the jade pendant wouldn't be effective.

108
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Then why did you run to Master Yin?

109
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Maybe because I was in a relationship with Master Yin.

110
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,720
We got married and got married.

111
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,720
We got married and got married.

112
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
But I was the master of the body

113
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
after I was in the prison.

114
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
What did you say?

115
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,720
That he wasn't dead.

116
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
He would appear in my body

117
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
and call me a ghost.

118
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
He even used his magic.

119
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,720
Do you think this is his magic?

120
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,720
He made me feel the power

121
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,720
and then I became a big bad guy

122
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,720
like him.

123
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,720
He was with me.

124
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,720
What's more amazing is

125
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,720
that He Wan is exactly the same as me.

126
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
Do you think

127
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,720
he will be the same kind of knight as me?

128
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,720
We absorbed the same kind of jade pendant.

129
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,720
That's why the human form is the same.

130
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Where is your birthplace?

131
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,720
A place called Mount Puxi.

132
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
Mount Puxi?

133
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,720
Master Zhang, what's wrong?

134
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,720
He Wan's life is not a knight.

135
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,720
He used to live in Mount Puxi.

136
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,720
You should have seen him often.

137
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,720
Maybe this is the reason

138
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,720
that he will be the same as me.

139
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,720
I see.

140
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,720
I really have no idea

141
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,720
what other people think.

142
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Master Zhang,

143
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,720
why do you know He Wan so well?

144
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,720
He used the Soul-Giving Master.

145
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Only He Wan's memory

146
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,720
can have a second soul-giver.

147
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,720
The problem is that

148
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,720
he can't be combined with the soul-giver.

149
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,720
Could it be?

150
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Could it be?

151
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
Master Zhang, are you all right?

152
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Is that Yin Sun's soul-giver?

153
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,720
He is too stupid.

154
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,720
We should report him to the Heaven Hall

155
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,720
and get rid of this evil.

156
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
This body is indeed He Wan.

157
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,720
But now,

158
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,720
you are already

159
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,720
in the Soul-Giving Master.

160
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,720
You can't feel any He Wan's breath.

161
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,720
He won't come out again, will he?

162
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,720
Then I'll have to leave this body

163
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,720
and be able to be the last fairy again.

164
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,720
It's not too late.

165
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,720
You still have a fairy.

166
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
If you forcefully break your soul,

167
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,720
I'm afraid you will die because of this soul-giver.

168
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,720
Don't worry.

169
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
I thought you had no soul

170
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
and no soul-giver.

171
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
When I get He Wan's missing soul,

172
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
I'll find a way to get rid of your soul

173
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
and re-release the body.

174
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Really?

175
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
You have helped me a lot.

176
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
I should protect you from the evil.

177
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
You...you...

178
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
Be careful.

179
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
It's all right.

180
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Master Zhang!

181
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,720
Master Zhang!

182
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,720
Master Zhang!

183
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,720
Master Zhang!

184
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Master Zhang!

185
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,720
Master Zhang!

186
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Master Zhang!

187
