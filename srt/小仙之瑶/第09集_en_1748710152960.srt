1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
Come on.

2
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:28,420
That's, I'll be sure to win,

3
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:28,420
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the rain, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the

4
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:46,220
wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind, Classroom.

5
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,420
You

6
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:35,540
Wake up, why am I in the temple?

7
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,540
Where is this?

8
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,300
This should be the place of the evil.

9
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,540
This entrance?

10
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,020
No wonder the owner didn't find it for so long.

11
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,100
Speaking of which, where did the other people go?

12
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,980
They may have gone to different places.

13
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,980
It doesn't matter. Let's go.

14
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,860
I'm worried about you,

15
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,140
I'm just afraid that you might talk nonsense.

16
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,500
I've already finished reading.

17
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,020
powers pack

18
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,300
It's time to take a good care of my house.

19
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,020
You.

20
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,020
This is...

21
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,020
The God's...

22
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,020
It's me.

23
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,020
Who are you?

24
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,020
Unless there's a limit to the law,

25
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,020
I only need three silver powers

26
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,020
to defeat you.

27
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,020
Brother Bo, it's your turn.

28
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,020
Brother Bo, it's your turn.

29
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,020
What's going on?

30
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,020
Why is this hand-to-hand?

31
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,020
Then it's the first move.

32
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,020
You should be on this side.

33
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,020
What?

34
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,020
They seem to be against the God's will.

35
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,020
Don't use your power.

36
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,020
Okay.

37
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,020
The God's will is not limited by the law.

38
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,020
You're the king's little man.

39
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,020
Wait here.

40
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,020
It's my turn.

41
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,020
You two, stop.

42
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,020
Let's talk.

43
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,020
I have nothing to say.

44
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,020
What are you trying to do?

45
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,020
You're not going to fight back.

46
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,020
If you don't defeat them,

47
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,020
we won't be able to make a decision.

48
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,020
You're strong.

49
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,020
Tianwen,

50
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,020
you're the best.

51
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,020
Stop.

52
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,020
Why are you with my master?

53
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,020
Be careful.

54
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,020
It's okay.

55
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,020
I'm afraid I'm too sensitive.

56
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,020
You're the new king of Ziwei.

57
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,020
Ziwei?

58
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,020
Is he doing well?

59
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,020
Are you

60
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,020
the woman that master knew in the mortal world?

61
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,020
Sorry, I'm a bit too busy.

62
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,020
I can't even tell her where the new king is.

63
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,020
What?

64
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,020
Master Chacha, are you okay?

65
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,020
He Huan?

66
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,020
You know me?

67
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,020
Didn't we live here together?

68
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,020
What?

69
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,020
How did He Huan come here?

70
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,020
He lost his memory.

71
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,020
We need to find out the cause.

72
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,020
Master...

73
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,020
No, he's here.

74
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,020
We need to leave.

75
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,020
We'll talk about it later.

76
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,020
He killed the king this time.

77
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,020
He's in the past.

78
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,020
It's not the first time that the gods brought disaster.

79
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,020
I believe he's not a bad guy.

80
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,020
Please keep this a secret.

81
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,020
Don't use the power again.

82
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,020
You can call me after that.

83
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,020
I'm afraid someone will recognize you.

84
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,020
So...

85
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,020
I'll call you Ze.

86
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,020
Okay?

87
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,020
Okay?

88
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,020
I'll follow you.

89
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,020
The snake?

90
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,020
This sand is the prison for the gods.

91
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,020
The water source is short.

92
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,020
Sometimes there's fire.

93
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,020
Fortunately, you have the ring.

94
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,020
The range is small.

95
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,020
But thanks to him,

96
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,020
we can survive.

97
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,020
The ring?

98
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,020
You won't see it after you set it up.

99
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,020
Now you're safe.

100
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,020
Don't worry.

101
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,020
We're here.

102
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,020
The King of the Gods

103
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,020
The King of the Gods

104
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,020
The King of the Gods

105
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,020
The King of the Gods

106
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,020
The King of the Gods

107
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,020
The King of the Gods

108
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,020
The King of the Gods

109
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,020
The King of the Gods

110
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,020
The King of the Gods

111
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,020
The King of the Gods

112
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,020
The King of the Gods

113
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,020
The King of the Gods

114
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,020
The King of the Gods

115
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,020
The King of the Gods

116
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,020
The King of the Gods

117
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,020
The King of the Gods

118
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,020
The King of the Gods

119
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,020
The King of the Gods

120
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,020
The King of the Gods

121
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,020
The King of the Gods

122
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,020
The King of the Gods

123
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,020
The King of the Gods

124
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,020
The King of the Gods

125
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,020
The King of the Gods

126
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,020
The King of the Gods

127
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,020
The King of the Gods

128
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,020
The King of the Gods

129
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,020
The King of the Gods

130
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,020
The King of the Gods
