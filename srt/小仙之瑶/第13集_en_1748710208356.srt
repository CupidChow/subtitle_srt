00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,200
What's That.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,560
What?

00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

I'm not sure if I can do it.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I can't believe it!

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But I can't believe it.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I can't believe what you have said!

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah!

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Not sure if I can do it.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,500
Hey, big brother,

47
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,500
maybe we should go to the temple,

48
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,000
and that's the start.

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,500
We can't do everything!

50
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,500
прав núénom Kwok hòu성~~~

51
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
The rest of the items are also arranged in the same way.

52
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
He's back so soon.

53
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Yang Xiao Xue.

54
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Sun Xiao!

55
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
He's back!

56
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Stop him!

57
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,500
You're not to pay for this.

58
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Over there!

59
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Brother Wang!

60
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Look at our hero.

61
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,500
What did you see?

62
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,500
So anxious.

63
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
You guys...

64
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
It's too late!

65
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,500
Why?

66
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,500
The taste of losing your hand is not good.

67
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
You...

68
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Watch out!

69
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Sorry?

71
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,500
You're just a little bit more sincere than death.

72
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
You should die.

73
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
No matter who tells you,

74
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
you'll be in trouble.

75
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
You're a poor mother.

76
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
You're also a bad person.

77
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
You're a bad person.

78
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
The day he lost his legs,

79
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
the pain and the pain were all gone.

80
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
And he's still in my ear.

81
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,500
You're a bad person.

82
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,500
Qi Yong.

83
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,500
You're a bad person.

84
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Oh no!

85
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
You should think it over.

86
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Help me.

87
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
This is my own choice.

88
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,500
If the world is in danger,

89
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
I will bear all the consequences.

90
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Moreover,

91
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,500
the world is in danger.

92
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
I can't do anything.

93
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
I'll go.

94
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Paz, wait here.

95
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
I'll tell you what I'll do.

96
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
It's time to end this.

97
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
I'll give you an explanation.

98
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Stop this!

99
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Su Yun!

100
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Damn it!

101
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
There's still some of my power left.

102
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Let's break this barrier first.

103
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
No!

104
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
You're going to kill me!

105
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
I'm not a man!

106
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
I'm a man!

107
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
I'm a man!

108
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
I'm a man!

109
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,500
I'm a man!

110
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
I'm a man!

111
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
I'm a man!

112
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
You're a god.

113
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
But you can't believe

114
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
this one.

115
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Huo Huo, stop!

116
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
What a powerful power!

117
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Yan Yao,

118
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Soul Fire Blood!

119
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
I don't want to live!

120
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Soul Fire,

121
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
your power

122
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
should protect the village.

123
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Instead, you're here to fight me!

124
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
I want to protect the village.

125
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,500
And she wants to protect me too!

126
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Damn it!

127
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
He's gone too far.

128
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
We must fight him.

129
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,500
What's going on?

130
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
After he returned from the riverbank,

131
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Huo Shi was caught.

132
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
I can't believe

133
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
he's been buried

134
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
for Su Yun.

135
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
It's strange.

136
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
My father's power

137
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
is completely different from the past.

138
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
What do you mean?

139
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,500
It seems

140
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
he's got some kind of power.

141
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
He's got some kind of power.

142
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
I'm telling you.

143
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
There's no way to get down.

144
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
He Wan, leave it to me.

145
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
I'll leave it to you.

146
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Okay, don't worry.

147
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
I'll save him.

148
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Watch out!

149
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
They were locked here.

150
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
I have to use him.

151
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
The man is blind.

152
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Go.

153
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Xia Bin,

154
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
you can't stop.

155
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Otherwise, you'll be in trouble.

156
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
You're dead.

157
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
What?

158
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
You're all dead.

159
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
You should have done it

160
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
when you were out.

161
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
You're here

162
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
to fight me.

163
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
What's the use of that?

164
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
What else did you do?

165
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
I've warned you.

166
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Even if you break the barrier,

167
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
you'll be punished.

168
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
Don't try to get close to him.

169
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
I...

170
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
To be continued...
