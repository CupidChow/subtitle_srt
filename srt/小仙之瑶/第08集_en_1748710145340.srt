1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Path of glory

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
No, I won't.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I think I can do it.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I have the power to play this little game.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You want to save him?

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You... you... you...

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You stay away from me!

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You're not done yet!

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No, no!

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
No, no!

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Are you okay?

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He's still smiling.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What do you like?

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Don't be angry, I'm not talking about the kind of thing I like.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I like eating it.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I didn't think you wanted to eat me!

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Stop it!

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No, no!

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I just want to eat him as a food.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I just want to eat him as a tiger.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay, you can eat him then.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
No, no, I don't like it!

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm still a poison!

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And, and I'm very useful!

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I've been living here for hundreds of years.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm very familiar with the underground.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
As long as you follow me,

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
you'll find the entrance to the underground.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You know the underground is closed,

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
but you haven't been there for a while.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Because it's not the day of the emperor.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Do you think it's a coincidence?

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Today's holiday is very suitable for the underground.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We have a bad luck.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We don't need you at all.

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's great!

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Then let's go!

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let's go!

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's not bad if you don't eat me.

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I want to eat you as a food.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let's go.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Dai Lu!

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Grandpa!

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
There's another one!

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What's going on?

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Why aren't they moving?

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
They're scared.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
There's no way out.

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Did I bring the wrong way?

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's impossible.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Maybe this tree has a problem.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The power of the power can't be used entirely.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The evil power of the underground is very bad.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's normal to limit the number of people.

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Master, let me go to the nearby area.

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
There must be a problem with this tree.

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I believe in Yan Bao.

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
There are a few heavens in the car.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
When the power of the power comes back to the heaven,

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
the god of the world will find the high point of the little fairy.

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Which demon is your demon?

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm the demon of the universe.

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Why are you so wise and wise

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
when you're in the heaven?

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm capable of doing nothing for everyone.

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I can be a god and a god.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm a power.

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Actually, I have a selfish intention.

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Don't do such a dangerous thing in the future.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't regret it.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
100 years ago, the East Sea was frozen.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You were still not used to it,

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
but you were in the Kuala Lumpur.

107
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You used your power to break the evil power.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm so happy to know that

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
you're the one who decided to protect me.

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Who is it?

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's me.

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I won't fight again.

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Xiang Chu.

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Why are you here?

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Fangsun Shang caught a little tail.

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're still not dead yet.

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You're still following me.

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Where's Qiu Lu?

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Don't worry.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You can follow me.

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
My demon is right here.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I can serve her well.

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Eat.

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
My lord.

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What are you doing?

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
This is...

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
When did you get this?

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Master, leave here.

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Wenjing.

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I've killed your master.

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
There's a dagger.

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Pure lily.

133
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,900
He's not different.

134
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,620
Are you take your...

135
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,740
Fang Ao you can weather a little!

136
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,480
Xiao Zi you can drink straight, too!

137
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:52,280
I can't stand it!

138
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,220
What the hell?

139
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,280
Look at them, they're flying!

140
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,900
So my skill is not bad for him.

141
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,900
What the hell?

142
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,900
What should we do?

143
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,900
We can't get him.

144
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,900
Watch out!

145
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,900
Stop!
