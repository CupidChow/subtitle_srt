1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,340
So I thought about getting a expansions to make up for something.

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:21,320
Add free until the dungeon has been completed, use the speed of theрач and a budgeting hurry, then you can get back to your dungeon

3
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,320
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

4
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,320
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

5
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,320
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

6
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,320
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

7
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,320
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

8
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,320
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

9
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,320
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

10
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,320
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,320
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

12
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,320
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

13
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,320
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

14
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,320
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

15
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,320
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

16
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,320
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

17
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,320
I'm afraid I'll be able to get through this.

18
00:01:49,320 --> 00:02:11,320
Making of song lyrics from the past

19
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:11,960
Huh?

20
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,400
Puppy!

21
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,360
How come you turn out so well?

22
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Did I hear something wrong?

23
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
I'll be back.

24
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
You're so considerate.

26
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
You were behind me.

27
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,320
What did you do secretly?

28
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
I didn't...

29
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
I was just a little bit short.

30
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,320
I'll come to serve you tonight.

31
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
How dare you!

32
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
Who let you in?

33
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Nonsense.

34
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,320
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,320
No.

36
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
The master is still unconscious.

37
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,320
What if...

38
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,320
Why did you leave the ball to the ball?

39
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
Open your mouth.

40
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,320
I'm a guest in the Western Court.

41
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
No.

42
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
Do you still remember

43
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
what you said to me?

44
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
What did you say?

45
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,320
You're my guest in the Western Court.

46
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
You're a guest in the Western Court.

47
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,320
You're a guest in the Western Court.

48
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
Master.

49
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
Where did the king come from?

50
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
Why are you here?

51
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,320
What's wrong?

52
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
What's wrong?

53
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
The little tree is making a scene.

54
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,320
I knew you'd be so kind.

55
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Why is Lu Chen Hui here?

56
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
Master.

57
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,320
Chen Jun, let's go back.

58
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
I'm busy.

59
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
You go back first.

60
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
If you want to stay,

61
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
I...

62
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
I'll stay with you.

63
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
What...

64
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
What are you doing?

65
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
I'm taking back the third soul.

66
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
I've found out

67
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,320
that he's in a place of extreme evil.

68
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,320
That place is dangerous.

69
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,320
Dangerous?

70
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
That's the place of the God's will.

71
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
I can't believe everyone can survive.

72
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
Master.

73
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
That place is dangerous.

74
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
I can't go there.

75
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
It's too dangerous.

76
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,320
Master.

77
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
I'll stay here with Bei Bei.

78
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,320
You two won't come out in half a month.

79
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Let's go to rescue the soldiers.

80
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
The best people are here.

81
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,320
Where else can we rescue the soldiers?

82
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
I have my own way.

83
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,320
If you want to go to extreme evil,

84
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,320
you must wear the seven-seated forest with evil spirits.

85
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
Your fire spirit will be scattered.

86
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
When you overcome the evil spirits,

87
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
we'll find a way out.

88
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
I want to protect Master.

89
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
I must stay.

90
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
I'll stay.

91
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
No.

92
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
You're the most powerful one.

93
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
You must stay with us.

94
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
Stop fighting.

95
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,320
Then, keep Lu Chen Hui.

96
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
You stay, too.

97
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
Don't worry, Master.

98
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
If I have the chance,

99
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,320
I'll go back to Heaven to rescue the soldiers.

100
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
Rest early.

101
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
We'll set off tomorrow.

102
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,320
We'll have to find another chance.

103
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,320
If he's not the one to be killed,

104
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,320
I'll go back to Heaven.

105
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,320
Let's go.

106
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
I'll go back to Heaven.

107
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
I'll go back to Heaven.

108
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
Protect Master.

109
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
Go.

110
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Beipei, what's going on?

111
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
What are you doing here?

112
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
My little So-so.

113
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
Master, be careful.

114
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,320
Master.

115
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
Let him come out.

116
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,320
Let him come out.

117
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
What's going on?

118
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Another little beast who can change the tree.

119
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
You're so shy.

120
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Why didn't you use your hand just now?

121
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
The third...

122
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
What's more,

123
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
it has nothing to do with me.

124
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,320
Master, please spare my life.

125
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
I didn't mean to scare you.

126
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
Please spare my life.

128
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,320
I didn't mean to scare you.

129
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
He's the descendant of the bamboo mushroom.

130
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
He's a poisonous one.

131
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,320
He can get rid of the poisonous ones

132
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,320
after using the special weapon of the Forest of Fishing.

133
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
You're so good at it.

134
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
You're so good at it.

135
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
It has nothing to do with you.

136
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
You can't tell me.

137
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,320
Master, please spare my life.

138
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
I didn't mean to scare you.

140
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,320
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,320
I'm sorry.

146
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,320
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,320
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,320
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,320
I'm sorry.
