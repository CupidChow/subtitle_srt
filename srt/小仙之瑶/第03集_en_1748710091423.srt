1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
The end

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,800
I'm not sure

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
if I can do it.

36
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm not sure.

37
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,600
What,

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,000
that means that...

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,360
you are...

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I...

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I...

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This is the side of the chain.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's a pity that it's too much for someone else.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Come.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Control it.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is a bit too late.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No!

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I hope that when you see him again,

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
you will be strong enough.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He's not dead.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
His consciousness is still there, just in this body.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He is...

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Why did he give me the Five Realms?

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No matter what,

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I must tell Tian Ting this news.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You crazy bastard!

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You're hurt, Bei Bei!

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You're so serious!

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're so weak.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Do you have any conscience?

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Are you angry with the master?

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Sorry, this soul is not very useful.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You hit my man,

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and you still want to save my baby?

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're a good friend and sister.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Uncle Jian,

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
are you being fooled?

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You don't even know your father.

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I think he's just a fool.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He's a coward for the Shadow Clan.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He's even a coward?

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If he wasn't the best fighter,

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
he wouldn't have been able to beat his father.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He's a coward.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He's not a coward.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You know how to speak?

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Bei Bei is a thousand year old cat demon.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Of course he knows how to speak.

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But Yan Yan likes Bei Bei better.

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're so mean.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You and I are in a relationship.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I've been under pressure for a while.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I've done something.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What do I need to do now?

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's go find the master's missing soul.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Master,

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Lu Cheng Gui's soul-seeking skill is unparalleled.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
With his help,

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
he can steal the soul-seeking skill.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Why don't we find him first?

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Heavens,

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
the three Shadow Guards are in the south.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
An Man.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But,

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
it's important to keep it in mind.

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You must...

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's been a long time since I saw you.

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I miss you.

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You're so sweet.

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I miss you too.

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Not only you.

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I miss you too.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This place is a great place.

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Lu is so thoughtful.

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What's so funny?

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's a place for fun.

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Why are you hiding?

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Don't be shy.

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
As the saying goes,

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
there are zero words and no words in a woman's mind.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
How about this?

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Sister,

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
do you have any idea?

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Why don't you come to the building with me?

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's have a drink.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Listen to the song.

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If...

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Let go of me, master.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Don't be so fierce.

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't move.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're so fierce.

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's hard to bear.

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's hard to bear.

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Bai Lan Yan, you're so mean.

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You...

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Enough.

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Stop it.

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But Jian Shu refused to come in.

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He even wanted to see his makeup.

130
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I've heard it all.

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I've heard it all.

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You're my boyfriend.

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You're so cute.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's Lu's wedding.

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He said he'd be a good man.

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He's been here for a long time.

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Bebe, don't think about it.

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This is a place that's so beautiful.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He likes to be loved by many people.

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He's not afraid.

141
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He's just a little bit of a man.

142
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He's the reason.

143
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
He's not afraid of being loved.

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He's just a little bit of a man.

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But he's not afraid of being loved by many people.

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He's just a little bit of a man.

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're so cute.

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You're so cute.

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You can do it.

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You can do it.

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, I don't know how to be a man.

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You can do it.

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,660
It ruined our journey back to Fel głos.

154
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,660
Old man, you are a genius Won out aggressive person!

155
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,500
Senior Lu's marginalized?

156
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,500
We've scare them!

157
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,140
I can hardly get out of today.

158
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,540
запhale

159
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,300
quickly

160
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,820
hurry

161
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,700
it is possible

162
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,420
powder

163
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,820
Lu Chen Gui, greet him

164
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,700
Mount Jin is not our only gold structure in this world.

165
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,560
I can still walk?

166
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,680
I knowшь

167
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,520
very well

168
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,380
So slow

169
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,800
I would enjoy

170
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,980
Happiness

171
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,520
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

172
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,520
I'm not sure.

173
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,520
I'm not sure.

174
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,520
I'm not sure.

175
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,520
I'm not sure.

176
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
I'm not sure.

177
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
I'm not sure.

178
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
I'm not sure.

179
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
I'm not sure.

180
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,520
I'm not sure.

181
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,520
I'm not sure.

182
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,520
I'm not sure.

183
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,520
I'm not sure.

184
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
I'm not sure.

185
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,520
I'm not sure.

186
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,520
I'm not sure.

187
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,520
