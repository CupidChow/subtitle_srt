1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,160
Time for the worst before

2
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,720
I'm not afraid of the stars, I'm not afraid of the stars

3
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,320
I'm not afraid of the mountains, I'm not afraid of the clouds

4
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,720
I'm not afraid of the mountains, I'm not afraid of the clouds

5
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,400
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm not afraid of the trees, I'm not afraid of the clouds

6
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:20,640
I'm not afraid of the stars, I'm not afraid of the clouds, I'm not afraid of the mountains, I'm not afraid of the clouds

7
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,040
The rain is falling, I'm in the rain

8
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,160
My heart is fluttering

9
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,800
The wind blows through the sand, I'm like a cow

10
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,360
I'm in the air, I know the silence of the sound

11
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,060
Finally, step into the sea, in aful happening

12
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,360
Episode 1

13
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,760
That's it.

14
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,960
I think we can know the exact location

15
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,640
in these two days.

16
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,440
I heard this.

17
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,040
The best news.

18
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,200
When I get back,

19
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,400
I'll tell Su Yu.

20
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,680
Then,

21
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,040
he won't have to come in first.

22
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,920
What's that place?

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,000
It's the deepest part of the sand.

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,440
The most magical place.

25
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,240
The place of the Qi.

26
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,000
Are you ready?

27
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,480
Are you ready?

28
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,400
Let go!

29
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,000
Summon the Emperor.

30
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,320
Su Yu, don't!

31
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,120
Heavenly King,

32
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,880
kill our way.

33
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,120
Send his officer in.

34
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,480
Wait for me.

35
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,560
Wait for me.

36
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,760
レイィ�

37
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,600
attend to

38
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Express

39
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,820
This way!

40
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,180
Today, I will cast my monarch

41
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,560
...

42
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,720
Let's just do our best!

43
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,120
Ah Ze! We...!

44
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,580
We can't forgive you,

45
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,920
But my Seungri is so strong that I can't finish you.

46
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,720
I know I'm not strong enough to Покаishalu check matters.

47
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,920
Is that more than enough?

48
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,940
Although you can control one charge,

49
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,740
and you have to play safe.

50
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,400
Thank you, nephew.

51
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,500
Everything will be all right

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,880
if you return with the radius sword alive.

53
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,640
Mu Karim today.

54
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,440
Wow.

55
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,480
A lot of blood.

56
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,280
No, it's a difficult task.

57
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,280
Shen Zong is helping us.

58
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,280
How many magic powers do we need to cast here?

59
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,280
We just got here.

60
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,280
Maybe we're out of it.

61
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,280
So many effects on our setup.

62
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,280
It's one of yourarin, Shen Zong.

63
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,280
What?

64
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,280
There's something in there.

65
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
Here!

66
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,280
So you're Vic traits digitally invested in this deck?

67
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
I'll see you later.

68
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
So powerful!

69
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,280
I can be as strong as you are.

70
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
I can do it now.

71
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
I'll do it.

72
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,280
I think it's the most effective move of the game.

73
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
It's the most effective move.

74
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
I'm so lucky.

75
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Thank you for your help.

76
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Thank you.

77
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
No, no.

78
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
I didn't use all my strength.

79
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,280
Don't be modest.

80
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,280
You were so brave just now.

81
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
Really?

82
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
Really?

83
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
Not only that,

84
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,280
I also thank you for bringing your man over.

85
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
Otherwise,

86
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
we wouldn't have got so many monsters.

87
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
Your man?

88
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,280
Don't think we can't see it.

89
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
You...

90
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
It's not like that.

91
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
You guys think too much.

92
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
How could it be?

93
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
All right.

94
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Brother Mo!

95
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,280
Are you all right?

96
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
I...

97
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
I'm not a regular person

98
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
because of the hunting monsters.

99
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
I know.

100
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
But I want to survive.

101
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
We have no other way.

102
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,280
Maybe we'll find it tomorrow.

103
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
The next place

104
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,280
won't be as difficult as the desert.

105
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
What if we can't find it?

106
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,280
What if the next place is more cruel?

107
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,280
If someone wants to kill us...

108
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Shut up!

109
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
Do you know what you're talking about?

110
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
I know.

111
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,280
But we have to face the reality.

112
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,280
If the people want to kill us...

113
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,280
I don't want to hear it from you.

114
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
I don't want to sacrifice

115
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
any lives of the people.

116
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
Brother Mo,

117
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,280
there's something I should tell you.

118
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
Brother Sui...

119
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
Put down the machine!

120
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,280
Why are you so fast?

121
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
What do you know?

122
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
I'm not a regular person.

123
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
I'm not a regular person.

124
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
I'm not a regular person.

125
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
What?
