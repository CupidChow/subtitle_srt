Give peace back to the martial arts world.

355
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,970
Give peace back to the martial arts world.

356

Go back to Wuyue Sect!

Go back to Wuyue Sect!

359
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,520
Seeing them so indiscriminately

361
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,010
No, I have to find a way

362
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,010
to tell the truth.

363
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,410
Only the four of us know about what Doctor Song did.

If I write a new issue,

365
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,750
I'll be exposed.

366
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,530
But if I don't write it,

367
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,380
Xingchen will continue to be slandered.

368

Should I write it or not?

369

It's so hard.

Doctor Song used mutants as test subjects.

Star-picking Sect is in control of Breaking News.

other's internal force very well, didn't you?

As the head of a sect,

465
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,060
you actually believe that

466

people can succeed easily in this world.

467
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,820
Am I wrong?

468

Do you dare to say that

469
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,900
you developed the internal force yourself?

470
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,570
Indeed.

471
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,380
My internal force doesn't belong to me.

472
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,960
But I didn't come this far

473
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,730
because of my internal force.

474
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,790
Easy for you to say.

475
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,380
If I ask you to give up your internal force now,

476
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,040
are you willing to do so?

477
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,450
After all,

478
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,320
you wouldn't dare to talk to me like this

479
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,810
without your internal force.

480
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,840
Why did you spread rumors and slander me?

481
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,260
Because I want to see what the person

482
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,200
who got the internal force for nothing

483
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,480
and messed up the martial arts world

484
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,670
looks like.

485
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,220
To put it bluntly,

486
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,010
actually,

487
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,620
you just want my internal force.

488
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,130
The multi-60-year force

489
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,460
is a waste on you.

490
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,600
You might as well give it to me.

491
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:39,950
You...

492
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,530
You are a girl.

493

I'm looking down on you.

505

No.

00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,000
Stop fighting then.

You are born lucky.

516
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,930
I worked so hard.

517
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,020
But every step I take is so hard.

518
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,160
To become the head of Star-picking Sect,

519
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,020
I gave up my identity as a woman.

520

I've been disguised as a man for more than ten years.

696
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,600
Just like when I was at Wuyue Gate,

697
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,600
when I knew my father and brother

698
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,000
were lying to me,

699
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,380
I felt bad too.

700
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,470
One for me and one for you.

701
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,050
What do you think?

702
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:47,490
Here.

703
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,390
Is it good?

704
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,820
No.

705
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,290
When I was young,

706
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,030
my master and I were like this too.

707
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,880
Here.

708
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,680
What about this?

709
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,050
Delicious.

710
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,330
I've been weak since I was young.

711
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,400
When I was young,

712
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,780
I spent most of the time with my master.

713
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,050
In my heart,

714
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,740
he is my closest family.

715
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:32,890
But he...

716
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,610
He experimented on so many people

717
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,230
and turned many people into inhumane monsters,

718
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,630
including you.

719
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,130
So,

720
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,200
you ignored me

721
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,550
for so many days because of this?

722
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,130
I don't know how to face all this

723
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,310
or

724
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,620
how to face you.

725
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,660
Master actually...

726
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,590
He developed

727
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,040
that medicine for me.

728
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,980
He let everyone down,

729
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,130
but not me.

730
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,250
Well.

731
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
Think about it.

732
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,670
Your master did experiment on me.

733
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,040
But I didn't become a monster.

734
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,650
I'm getting stronger.

735
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,930
So you don't have to feel sorry for me.

736
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,230
Really.

737
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,160
Look. I'm fine,

738
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:10,910
right?

Have some chestnuts.

740
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,020
I'll feed you in the future.

741
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:33,940
Is it sweet?

742
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,730
Are you tired?

743
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,560
No.

Okay.

I'm really going back.

750
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,670
All right, rest early.

she has other intentions?
