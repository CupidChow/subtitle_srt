These are all just testing records.

00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,770
There is no prescription at all.

6
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,730
We can only try

7
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,560
and find other clues.

8
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,060
Yes.

9
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,390
But,

10
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,350
we found something.

11
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,060
Mutant is the best entry point.

12
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,520
Yes.

13
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:04,980
Let's go and investigate.

14
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,640
Not us.

15
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,730

No.

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,060
As the future Head,

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,680
I have the obligation to contribute

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,730
to the peace of the martial arts world.

21
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,230
Where are you going to contribute?

22
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,060
Wuyue Sect.

23
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,230
You finally decided to go back to Wuyue Sect?

24
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:30,950
Yes.

25
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,920
I'm going back to Wuyue Sect

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,060
to find my father and the antidote.

27
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,140
After I take the antidote,

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,170
I'll be invincible.

29
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,180
By then,

30
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,729
all forces of evil will be trash in front of me.

31
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:47,370
Okay.

32
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,229
I'll go back with you.

Yes.

36

Whatever.

37
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,850
It's all right.

38
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,520
What are you looking at?

39
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,070
Brother.

40
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,550
Are you really going back to Wuyue Sect with Miss Huo?

41
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,430
Do you really want to be the matrilocal son-in-law of Wuyue Sect?

42
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,230
Nonsense.

43
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,430
What nonsense?

44
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,640
Don't you know

45

how you treated her?

46

Others may not know, but you don't know?

47
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,310
It's chaotic outside.

48
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,770
Huo Xingchen has no Kungfu.

49
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,480
I'll be worried if I don't send her back myself.

50
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,730
That's all?

52
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,100
She doesn't know the last pill you gave her...

53
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,020
Listen, don't tell her about this.

54

Do you hear me?

55

60
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,550
When you arrive at Wuyue Sect,

61
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,270
remember to say hello to your uncle for me.

62
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,730
Go.

63
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,060
Be careful.

64
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,600
Mother, we'll get going.

65
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,350
If we can't find Doctor Song,

66
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,480
my son won't have much time left.

67
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,680
His life will be in danger.

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,180
Actually, my father

69
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,850
is a nice person.

70
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,810
Head Huo is indeed a kind person.

71
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,770
Why are you still calling him Head?

72
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:35,820
Huh?

73
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,140
What should I call him?

74

80
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,480
Brother, what are you going to do

81
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,180
after sending Miss Huo back to Wuyue Sect?

82
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,430
Keep looking for Master, of course.

83
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,120
Alas.

84
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,480
After we arrive in Luo City, you stay outside the city

85
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,930
to look for information,

86
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,100
especially those related to mutants.

87
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,390
Okay.

88
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,810
Master's medicine can help mutants recover.

89
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,350
Do you think this is a coincidence or...

90
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,220
Master was captured by those people?

91
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,230
We have to wait until we find him.

92
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,180
If we find Master,

93
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,140
those mutants might have a cure.

94
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,890
Everything is ready?

95
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,180
Master, everything is ready.

96
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,270
Unfortunately, Huo Xingchen,

97
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,850
the daughter of the Head, was not caught.

98
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,130
That day, the daughter of the Head

99
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,930
caused the chaos at the Elixir Village.

100
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,020
But she has been bitten by mutants.

101
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,590
Maybe she's already dead.

102
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,840
What a waste.

103
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,270

The Wuyue Sect

105

attributed the case of the disappearance of heroes

106
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,520
to Pharmacist Xu's experiments on them.

107

349
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,230
I wonder if Xingchen told you or not.

350
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,310
But my master's medicine

351
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,850
can restore mutants to normal.

352
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,350
Of course.

353
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,470
Thank you for

354
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,770
giving us the medicine generously.

355
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,090
You don't have to thank me. It's my duty.

356
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,680
Thank you.

357
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:09,680
No problem.

358
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,730
Thank you.

359
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:11,430
No problem.

360
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,140
Thank you.

361
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,730
No problem.

362
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,350
Thank you.

363
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,640
What else?

364
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,560
I wonder if you know anything

365
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,270
about the man in black and mutants.

366
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,100
I hope you can share it with me.

367
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,230
Of course.

368
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,810
After all, whether mutants can be saved

369
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,180
depends on

370
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,390
when they can see your master.

371
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,430
Thank you, Head.

372
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,730
You're welcome.

373
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,430
No problem.

374
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,600
No, thank you.

375
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,640
No problem.

376
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,270
Thank you.

377
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,270
No problem.

378
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,520
Head, I really have to thank you.

379
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,230
No problem.

380
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,180
Thank you, Head.

381
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,140
No problem.

382
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,730
Thank you.

383
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,770
Have a seat.

384
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,140
Sit.

385
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,060
What are you doing?

386
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:20,640
Eat.

387
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,810
Eat more.

388
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,390
Do you really have nothing else to say?

389
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,480
I told you.

390
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,730
I will

391
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,180
promise you anything.

392
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,520
The food here is really delicious.

393
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,810
All right, let me ask you.

394
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,480
Head, please go ahead.

395
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,850
Are you willing to marry into our family?

396
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,560
Sorry, I didn't hear you clearly.

397
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,020
I said

398
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,850
when should we start to prepare

399
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,060
your wedding with Xingchen?

400
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,930
Xingchen told me

401
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,430
what you experienced on the way.

402
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,890
I knew you two couldn't be separated.

403
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,520
There's no use objecting.

404
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:36,640
Head, I...

405
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,520
Let me finish first.

406
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,520
Xingchen told me that

407
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,170
you care about her very much.

408
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,430
I won't beat around the bush.

409
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:44,810
I'll ask you this.

410
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,980
Are you willing to marry into our family?

411
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,680
Head.

412
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:01,980
The relationship between Xingchen and I

413
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,520
is not what you think.

414
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,300
Just answer me with yes or no.

415
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,640
I don't have much time left.

416
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,270
Why waste her time?

417
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,770
I don't want to.

418
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,780
You...

419
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:24,730
Xingchen.

420
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:25,560
Follow me.

421
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:29,640
Where are you going?

422
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,680
He doesn't want to? I don't care.

423
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,140
Why don't you want to?

424
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,430
You asked me

425
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,420
to give you a proper title.

426
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,730
I took you home.

427
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,230
But now you refused my dad.

428
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,600
I've been thinking all the way home.

429
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,060
If you proposed to my dad, but my father refused.

430
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,980
How can I comfort you when you are sad?

431
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,350
I thought

432
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,980
I'll arrange everything for you

433
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,640
so that you won't have any worries.

434
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,310
I convinced my dad.

435
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,100
But you refused.

436
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,430
Why?

437
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,560
Xingxing.

438
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,890
I did say that before.

439
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:10,900
But...

440
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,850
I was just kidding.

441
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,730
What did you say?

442
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,810

520
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,350
Xingchen.

521
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,270
Give me the antidote.

522
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,680
What antidote? Xingchen.

523
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:22,890
Look.

524
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,560
Your eyes are red again.

525
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,600
Did Jiang Buting bully you again?

526
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,890
I'm going to get even with him.

527
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,760
Dad.

528
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,480
Don't mention him to me.

529
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,810
I didn't want a matrilocal husband in the first place.

530
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,430
Give me the antidote.

531
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:37,310
No.

532
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,640
Xingchen,

533
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,810
why do you want the antidote?

534
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,560
I want him to know that

535
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:44,980
I can travel the martial arts world alone

536
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,310
without him.

537
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,180
Okay.

538
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,520
Don't worry, Xingchen. I'll find the antidote for you.

539
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,770
I'll find the antidote for you.

540
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,770
Xingchen.

541
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,310
Open your mouth.

542
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,600
Dad, I'm leaving.

543
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,430
Xingchen, where are you going?

544
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,290
To travel the martial arts world.

545
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:11,970
[Sounding the Universe]

546
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,730
Xingchen, calm down.

547
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,640
Let's think long and hard about it.

548
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,850
Stop her. She took the antidote.

549
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,290
[Sounding the Universe]

550
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,140
Young Miss.

551
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,350
Hurry!

552
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,560
Young Miss.

553
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,430
Let me go.

554
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,060
Young Miss! Young Miss!

555
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:57,020
Young Miss! Young Miss! Young Miss!

556
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,730
Young Miss!

557
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,730
I can find the mastermind

558
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,890
on my own.

559
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,980
I don't need any friends.

560
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:13,730
Get lost!

561
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,600
Young Miss! Young Miss! Young Miss!

562
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,480
Move! Let me go!

563
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,230
Young Miss! Young Miss!

564
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,180
Let me go!

565
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,430
Young Miss! Young Miss! Young Miss!

566
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,230
Enough!

567
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:31,560
Stop it.

568
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,020
Who are you to lecture me?

569
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,270
Because you can't defeat me.

570
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,020
What a joke.

571
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,180
Stop trying.

572
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,020
You can't touch a hair of mine.

573
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:31,770
Impossible.

574
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,770
What happened?

575
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,180
I don't know why.

576
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:36,980
Xingchen.

577
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,270
Young Miss.

578
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:39,980
Xingchen.

579
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,730
Young Miss.

580
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,840
Dad.

581
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,230
Why?

582
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,260
Why can't I use my internal force?

583
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,100
Well, you...

584
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,140
Tell me.

585
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,330
I...

586
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,810
Why?

587
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:54,680
You won't tell me?

588
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,310
Let me tell you.

589
00:28:58,850 --> 00:28:59,930
Jiang Buting, how dare you!

590
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,140
Mr. Jiang, you can't say it.

591
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,350
You can't.

592
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,180
Listen carefully.

593
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,730
Because your internal force

594
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,350
has never been sealed.

595
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,600
You don't know martial arts at all.

596
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,370
♫Wow, baby♫

597
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,310
♫I can touch the clouds in fairy tales♫

598
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,100
♫When I reach out♫

599
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,140
