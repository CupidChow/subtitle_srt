Is the elixir ready?

00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,470
Not yet.

I can't believe you still haven’t made any progress.

When can I conquer the martial arts world?

The pharmaceutical department
has got a new batch of mutants.

I think you're here to ask me for money

38

the one behind him?

513
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,640
Jianwa!

514
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,270
Gather your men

515
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,480
and follow the trail!

516
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:38,700
Alright.

517
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,520
Follow me.

518
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,060
Yes.

519
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,600
Brother.

520
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,390
Don't work so hard.

521
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:54,770
Take a rest.

522
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:55,640
No.

523
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,730
I promised to protect her.

524
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,230
She must be scared now.

525
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,100
I’ll look around again.

526
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,100
The Circle Man
went into the Elixir Village for me.

527
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,890
Now there are corpses everywhere.

528
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,890
I wonder how he is now.

529
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,230
He risked his life to take my place.

530
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,390
If I can't save him,

531
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,200
I...

532
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,180
How can I live?

533
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,100
Here. Let's go!

534
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:57,930
Xingchen.

535
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,180
Today's treatment is

536
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,230
acupuncture.

537
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,140
Wow.

538
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,350
You really have skill.

539
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,390
But you still have to believe me.

540
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,020
Pain is the only way to keep you sober.

541
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,060
Baihui acupoint.

542
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,850
Shenting acupoint.

543
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:23,480
Renzhong acupoint.

544
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,230
Fengchi acupoint.

545
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,890
Renying acupoint.

546
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:25,730
Qihai acupoint.

547
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,430
Qugu acupoint.

548
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,350
Today's training.

549
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:38,930
Lu Ban Lock.

550
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:55,430
By the way,

551
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,990
use your hands more.

552
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,060
Use your brain more.

553
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,230
Then you won't degenerate into a mutant.

554
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:03,480
Great.

555
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,020
I quit.

556
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,100
You're right.

557
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,630
You can’t even make it

558
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,350
when you're normal.

559
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,060
Sorry.

560
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,350
I overestimated your IQ.

561
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,140
IQ?

562
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,980
You're the idiot here!

563
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,430
All of your family are idiots!

564
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:12,889
Xingchen.

565
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,260
Like you said,

566
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,520
you must stay sober
so that you won't become a mutant.

567
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,929
Look at my fingers.

568
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,889
Up, down, left, right.

569
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,610
Left.

570
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,580
Yes.

571
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,350
Again.

572
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,850
Up, down, left, right.

573
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:30,639
That’s right.

574
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,179
Come on.

575
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:32,480
Come on. Go on.

576
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:33,730
Up, down, left, right.

577
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:34,120
Left.

578
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,179
Up, down, left, right.

579
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:37,670
Right.

580
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,100
Up, down, left, right.

581
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:40,530
Down.

582
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,810
Up, down, left, right.

583
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,179
Up.

584
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:51,560
It's okay.

585
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:53,230
I'll stay away from you.

586
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,350
You'd better leave.

587
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:57,760
Leave me alone.

588
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,060
I’m starting to lose control of  myself.

589
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:16,350
Xingchen.

590
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,270
Don't say that.

591
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,890
It's not time to give up yet.

592
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,230
Alright.

593
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:31,800
Get some sleep.

594
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,020
Jiang Buting.

595
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,560
Don't worry.

596
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,020
I'll always be with you.

597
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,310
I won't go anywhere.

598
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,060
I'm afraid if I fall asleep,

599
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,560
I’ll completely become a mutant.

600
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:48,350
Don't be afraid.

601
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,390
I’ll observe your patterns.

602
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:51,550
If it gets worse,

603
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:52,890
I'll wake you up right away.

604
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,770
Okay?

605
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,520
Don't forget.

606
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:57,430
I won’t.

607
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:43,410
[The mutants are extremely dangerous. They are irreversible.
They might turn rigid and lose their consciousness.]

608
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:43,410
[They can be controlled with the Holy Medicine.
Behead the mutants once they’re abandoned.]

609
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,730
The mutants are irreversible.

610
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,890
Behead the mutants once they’re abandoned.

611
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,560
How could it…

612
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:50,810
How could it be?

613
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,290
♫Wow, baby♫

614
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,220
♫I can touch the clouds in fairy tales♫

615
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:15,090
♫When I reach out♫

616
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,060
♫A calm heart starts♫

617
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,890
♫Feeling excited and nervous♫
