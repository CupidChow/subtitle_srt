There's no turning back.

5
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,810
Xingchen.

6
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:11,730
I've made

7
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,560
delicious porridge with vegetables.

8
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:14,600
Have some.

9
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,600
You'll get better.

10
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,320
Ah.

11
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:23,890
Here.

12
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:25,360
Ah.

13
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,270
It's really good. Try it.

14
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,600
I said no.

15
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:40,729
Jiang Buting.

16
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,479
You know what?

17
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,979
I've been unlucky since I first met you.

18
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,680
I'm sick of seeing you now.

19
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,729
I feel like vomiting.

20
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:53,930
In my dying hours,

21
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,310
can you leave me alone?

22
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,520
So get out!

23
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,640
Get out!

24
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,350
Do you know my name?

25
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,600
My name is Jiang Buting.

26
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,810
If you ask me to get out,

27
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,180
I won't.

28
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,350
Listen.

29
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,880
No matter what you'll become,

30
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,060
I'll always be by your side.

31
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,230
Don't you want to bite me?

32
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,270
Come on. Bite me. Bite me.

33
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,520
Bite me.

34
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,680
What do you think?

35
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,390
I have a golden armor. Isn't it awesome?

36
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,100
Yes.

37
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,810
Oh no.

38
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,380
I was careless.

39
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,140
I've got three taels of gold hidden

40
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,890
in the red wood cabinet.

41
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,050
Three taels of gold.

42
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:14,810
Well.

43
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,770
That brat is lucky.

44
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,140
By the way,

45
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,310
the tea cake I took from you last time

46
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,520
is hidden in the blanket.

47
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,350
What a great tea cake.

48
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,310
Well.

49
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,770
I tore half of your new pants

50
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,480
to sew the dog's nest.

51
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,520
I made a tea pillow with your Longjing Tea

52
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,560
picked before the rainy season.

53
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,390
The pillow.

54
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,260
Alas.

55
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,010
Alas.

56
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,520
My goodness.

57
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,020
Let's stop crying

58
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,730
and be strong, okay?

59
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,560
Okay.

60
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,350
Alright, stop crying.

61
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,810
I was just scared out of my mind.

62
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,270
How about this?

63
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,560
Let's tear the suicide note apart, okay?

64
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,120
Okay.

65
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,520
It's all my fault.

66
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,850
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,730
You're still young.

68
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,480
You still have a lot of time

69
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,390
and many things to do.

70
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,350
Do you feel sorry?

71
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,310
Idiot.

72
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,770
No regrets.

73
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,100
Let me tell you a secret.

74
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,060
Do you want to hear it?

75
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,620
Okay.

76
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,350
I've been weak

77
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,350
since I was a kid.

78
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,020
I almost died on the first day I was born.

79
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,520
If it weren't for my master,

80
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,640
I wouldn't have survived a year.

81
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,480
From then on,

82
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,130
every day I lived,

83
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,560
I feel like I've stolen a day from God.

84
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,770
I think I've made a fortune from God.

85
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,020
I've already made a fortune.

86
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,100
You are so miserable.

87
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,310
Yes, why am I so miserable?

88
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,810
What about you?

89
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,760
I...

90
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,980
I'm fine.

91
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,100
I mean,

92
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,980
if we did die from the mutant's poison,

93
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,980
wouldn't you have any regrets?

94
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,560
Of course I have.

95
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,270
I haven't got my father's approval.

96
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,890
I haven't travelled the world with Fork Man.

97
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,430
And I haven't inherited the head of Wuyue Sect.

98
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,880
I've never been loved.

99
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,980
Spend my whole lifetime with only one person.

100
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,310
Your whole lifetime?

101
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,850
With only one person?

102
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,170
Yes.

103
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,270
As an ancient poem goes,

104
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,390
"I listened to Sheng playing 
and fell asleep at night."

105
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,680
“I felt like I was either under the moon 
or before the flowers.”

106
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,810
What would this feel like?

107
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,770
I thought you were devoted to

108
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,380
go into the martial arts world.

109
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,680
What?

110
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,170
Couldn't I?

111
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,920
Fine.

112
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,560
Let me ask you again.

113
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,010
What do you think

114
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,810
the perfect love

115
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,980
is like?

116
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,350
How would I know?

117
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,100
I've never been loved.

118
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,730
But in storytelling scripts,

119
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,520
lovers often date

120
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,310
before the flowers or under the moon.

121
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,180
These are moments of beautiful scenery.

122
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,890
That's the perfect love.

123
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,810
Why am I telling you this?

124
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,230
You can't understand.

125
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,600
"I listened to Sheng playing 
and fell asleep at night."

126
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,520
“I felt like I was either under the moon 
or before the flowers.”

127
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,600
This place would be beautiful tonight.

128
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:51,930
Alas.

129
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,390
I have to try. I have to try.

130
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,680
What kind of surprise are you giving me?

131
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,390
Don't open your eyes.

132
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,640
You can only open your eyes when I tell you.

133
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:24,710
Hey.

134
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,930

you don't want to become a monster.

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:44,600
How about

176
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,930
we take this bamboo raft

177
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,350
and go wherever we can?

178
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:52,890
Okay?

179
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,480
You said

180
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,430
your most regretful thing

181
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,140
was that you hadn't met the perfect love.

182
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,890
To be honest, I haven't either.

183
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,100
I even don't know

184
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,980
what it looks like.

185
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,230
But today,

186
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,060
I suddenly realized.

187
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,640
Huo Xingchen.

188
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,060
Are you willing to stay with me

189
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,350
in the beautiful landscape forever?

190
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,510
Well.

193
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,980
how can I find one for you now?

194
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,060
How about

195
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,980

so that I could use it in case of emergency.

341
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,140
I didn't expect

342

00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,140
I'm afraid for

347
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,850
your brother's

348

life.

349
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,380
Hello, aunt.

350
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,810
I'm Buting's friend, Huo Xingchen.

351
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,480
Xingchen.

352
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,730
Aunt, I'm sorry.

353
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,020
He became like this because he protected me.

354
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,770
Don't mind it.

355
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,600
Buting has always been independent.

356
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,850
What he thinks is right must be right.

357
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,730
How is he now?

358
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,770
He's almost recovered.

359
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,390
Don't worry.

360
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:06,100
Buting, you're awake. How do you feel?

361
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,100
Not bad.

362
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:10,630
I won't die.

363
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,640
Mother, why are you here?

364
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,810
If I didn't come, how could you be fine?

365
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,680
Looks like you've stabilized.

366
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,890
I'll cook some medicine with Buying.

367
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:36,310
Please take care of him for me, Xingchen.

368
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,250
Okay.

369
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,270
Hey, brother.

370
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,890
Are you feeling better?

371
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:32,750
Come on.

372
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,100
I'll do it myself.

373
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:42,520
Come on.

374
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,020
Come on. Have some more.

375
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,140
Get yourself tucked in.

376
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,930
I'm going to be an invalid.

377
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,890
It's okay. If you have anything to do,

378
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,020
just tell me. I'll help you.

379
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,270
One more sip.

380
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,480
I have a question for you.

381
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,230
What is it?

382
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,230
At that time,

383
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,650
I was already unconscious

384
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,810
and turned into a mutant.

385
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:12,850
How did you save me?

386
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:32,850
In that case,

387
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,270
your master's medicine detoxified my poison?

388
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,430
Yes.

389
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,520
Great.

390
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,180
Then mutants will be saved.

391
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,140
Let's hurry and find the prescription.

392
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,020
Where did your master put the prescription?

393
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,170
Let's go.

394

In order to cure my illness,

402
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,480
Master had developed many medicines.

403
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,140
These medicines

404
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,980
were all tested by himself.

405
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,140
Your master was great.

406

for me.

408

Look.
