Young Miss.

346

Don't stop me.

347
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,910
I must go out today.

348

351
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,080
Madam Zhou, I didn't even touch you.

352
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,380
Why did you fall? Are you all right?

353
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,160
Young Miss, have you gained more power?

354
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,950
Even if I was not in front of you,

355
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,930
I couldn't even stand it on your side.

356
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,820
That's right.

Dad, what did you give me?

372
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,200
Xingchen, what did I give you?

373
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,500
I gave you

374
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:03,780
the Kungfu-locking Pill.

375
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,090
Ah!

376
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,330
Hey.

377
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,520
The medicine is called

378
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,370
Kungfu-locking Pill.

379
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,490
Uncle has sealed your passages

380
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,580
with the pill.

381
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,880
In a short time,

382
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,310
you won't be able to use your kungfu.

383
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,300
Yes.

384
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,370
I don't believe

385
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,290
there's any medicine called Kungfu-locking Pills.

386
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,080
Uncle Fu.

387
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,490
Let her try.

388
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:38,730
Okay.

389
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,130
Young Miss, try hitting me.

390
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,050
Be careful.

391
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:44,770
Come on.

392
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,990
Dad, why did you seal my kungfu?

393
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,860
Go back

394
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,640
and reflect on

395
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,700
the responsibility and duty as the Head of Wuyue.

396
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,000
Pretty.

397
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,550
Yes.

398
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,500
Take her back.

399
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:28,920
Yes.

400
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,330
No, I'm not going back.

I'm not going back.

Let's go back, Young Miss.

409
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,770
Young Miss, let's go back.

410
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,530
Drag her back.

411
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,110
I'm not going back.

412
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,720
Why won't you listen?

413
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:42,990
Fine.

414
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,130
Humph.

415
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,870
You want to trap me?

416
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,620
In your next life.

417
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,060
I'm going to explore the martial arts world.

418
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,490
When did they raise the wall?

419
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,540
You want to stop me with this?

420
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,680
You underestimated me.

421
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,330
Fortunately, I have the Fork Man Quotations written by Fork Man.

422
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,830
According to Article 43,

423
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,160
the path to success

424
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,280
is try to build a ladder.

425
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:25,750
Humph.

426
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,760
The Fork Man really doesn't lie.

427
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,370

Can we stop taking

00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,510

Okay.

She jumped out of the Wuyue Sect.

Miss Huo, I'm exhausted.

461
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,730
To be honest, I've been weak since I was young.

462
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,390
Hurry up and get rid of them.

00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,200
Thank you.

518
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,440
May I know your name?

519
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,750
I am

It's Wa, not Hua.

Goodbye.

536
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,130
Wait.

537
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,490
The reason I worked so hard for the selection

538
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,230
is just to get in the Wuyue Sect.

539
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,380
I can't waste this opportunity.

541
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:56,750
What's wrong?

542
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,080
Are you okay?

543
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,440
No.

Brother Wow.

545
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,160
I was frightened

546
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,060
when sending Young Miss home.

547
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,990
In order to escape,

548
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,430
she threw a few punches at my chest.

549
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,560
Anyway,

550
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,350
I'm so excited.

551
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,340
I can't help myself.

552
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,480
Young Hero.

553
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,300
You look badly injured.

554
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,230
Since you saved Xingchen and sent her back,

555
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,620
we're in debt to you.

556
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,890
I'll ask someone to send you to the clinic.

557
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,870
I have to tear down the announcement.

558
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,940
I have to go to the selection for the matrilocal son-in-law.

559
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,100
Hey.

560
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,410
Since you saved Xingchen,

561
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,110
you don't have to tear it down yourself.

562
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,840
Can we go to the clinic now?

563
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,060
I don't think I can make it there.

564
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,650
Hey.

565
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,120
Help! Help!

566

Junior made someone sick.

567
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,360
She made him sick.

568
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,770
She made him sick.

569
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,820

La...

573
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,470
Your pulse is so strange.

574
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,480
It's sometimes strong and sometimes weak,

575
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,140
as if you were born weak.

576
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,490
I'll prescribe some tonic

577
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,230
for you.

578
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:35,900
Thank you, doctor.

Goodbye.

580
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,560
Since we've entered the Wuyue Sect,

581
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,010
let's start the investigation.

582
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,830
Close the door

583
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,510
to prevent thieves.

584
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,350
Are you crazy?

585
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,560
Brother, you're really something.

586
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,490
You managed to sneak in here.

587
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,170
Humph.

588
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,550
How did you come up with

589
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,140
such a stupid trick?

590
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,450
Watch your mouth!

591
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:44,520
Enough.

592
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,380
We've been investigating the case of the missing hero.

593
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,990
Have you found any other clues?

594
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,540
Another hero went missing tonight.

595
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:53,850
The location is

596
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,040
near Wuyue Sect.

597
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,760
Is there really something wrong with the Wuyue Sect?

598
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:02,980
How about this?

599
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,450
I'll search for clues

600
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,730
when i pretend to be sick.

601
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,040
You go to the city and find other information.

602
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:10,620
You go.

603
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,330
You go.

604
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:12,940
You go.

605
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:13,679
You go.

606
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,159
You go.

607
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:14,719

Old Master Huo is so polite.

613

He served me with good food and good wine.

614
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,060
Did he really regard me as his son-in-law?

615
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,190
There are many candidates.

616

Why did the Head keep him?

617

Yes.

618
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,210
Isn't Mr. Mu the real son-in-law?

or climb over the wall.

You thought I couldn't find other ways?

627
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,090
You would never expect

628
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,770
I would break into the forbidden area, right?

629

Don't be afraid, Xingchen.

677
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,010
Brother Mu will always stand in front of you.

678

You run away first if there are bad guys.

679

Brother Mu, you're so nice.

680
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:37,960
But father said

681
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,060
girls can't travel the martial arts world.

682
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,400
They can only stay at home.

684
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:46,100
That's because those girls don't have protection.

00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,060
and be a great couple of female and male heroes.

689
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,090
Female and male heroes? Sounds a bit weird.

690

But Xingchen, don't worry.

691

We will be able to travel the martial arts world together

692
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,730
and be the best heroes.

693
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,480
Yes.

694
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,870
Brother Mu knows me best.

695
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,850
If he knows I'm trapped here,

696
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,950
he will find a way to get me out.

697
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,130
Brother Mu.

698
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,730
Long time no see. How are you?

699
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,240
I am now trapped in the Wuyue Sect.

700
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,250
Please come and save me.

701
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,630
Bye.

702
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,710
Brother Mu, a single day apart seems like three years.

703
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,750
I haven't seen you for years.

704
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,670
I miss you very much too.

705
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:56,280
I miss you so much, and there is no cure for it.

706
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:57,810
Brother Mu,

707
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,510
I don't want to marry anyone else.

708
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,810
I want to spend the rest of my life

709
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,420
with you.

710
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:08,650
So,

711
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,800
you must win the selection.

712
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,220
I'll wait for you

713
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,230
at Wuyue Sect.

714
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,860
It's been seven years.

715
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,140
I didn't expect Xingchen to be the same like me.

716
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,480
Her heart has never changed.

717
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,480
Xingchen.

718
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:26,740
Don't worry.

719
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,890
I will definitely win.

720
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,340
I won't let you down.

721
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:38,780
Wait for me.

722
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:48,500
Smells good.

723
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:52,730
Brother.

724
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,390
You altered her letter

725
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,810
and ate her pigeon.

726
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,420
You're so bad.

727
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,540
Huo Xingchen wants Mu Binghe

728
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:02,560
to help her escape from Wuyue Sect.

729
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,680
If this letter was sent,

730
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:06,260
Mu Binghe

731
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,210
might really help

732
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,180
his childhood sweetheart escape.

733
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,150
If this couple of childhood sweethearts want to elope,

734
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,550
let them.

735
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,950
What does it have to do with us?

736
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:20,870
Do you

737
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:23,300
like her?

738
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,350
♫Wow, baby♫
