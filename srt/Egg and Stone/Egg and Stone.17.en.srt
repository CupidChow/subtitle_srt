4
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,320
Oh.

5
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,400
Brother, why are you in such a hurry?

6
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,100
All right. All right.

7
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,440
Humph.

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,110
Ah.

9
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:54,680
Oh.

10
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,430
Brother, why did you fall down?

11
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:03,930
Hurry up.

12
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,519
Ouch!

13
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,390
Ouch! Ouch!

14
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,440
Don't be angry.

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:07,690
Don't be angry.

16
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,610
Don't be angry.

17
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,770
Don't be angry.

18
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,280
It's fake?

19
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:18,770
It's fake!

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,600
It's fake.

21
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,020
It's all fake.

22
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,770
Well.

23
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:37,650
Brother.

24
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,940
So you are a toy boy.

25
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,690
No.

26
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,729
What else is true about you?

27
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,060
I won't talk to you anymore.

28
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,430
Don't go.

29
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,680
Hey.

30
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,690
I won't dislike you.

31
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,400
A toy boy is good too.

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,440
A toy boy is quite popular.

33
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,060
Hey.

34
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,730
Well.

35
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,100
Our master said

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,060
young people would have cars and beauties.

37
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,440
Here you are.

38
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,770
Mr. Jiang.

39
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,230
I'm here to serve you.

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,560
No, I...

41
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,150
A talented man

42
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,360
should match a beauty.

43
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,180
This is really...

44
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,520
It's shameful.

45
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,810
A gentleman should stay out of danger.

46
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,980
Now you're found in a suspicious position.

47
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,110
I'd better avoid it.

48
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,270
Bah!

49
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,480
Don't be shy.

50
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,110
Master asked me to come here.

51
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,850
He said you...

52
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,860
No, I didn't.

53
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,520
Don't talk nonsense.

54
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,190
You still don't admit it?

55
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,860
You just did this to me...

56
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,810
One, two, three.

57
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,730
I did this

58
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,440
because we were practicing dancing.

59
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,600
I wasn't interested in you.

60
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,100
You're bad.

61
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,150
Go, go, go. Hurry up.

62
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,190
Let's dance together another day.

63
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:18,900
Yo.

64
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,560
One, two, three.

65
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,730
Show more steps for me.

66
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,520
Come on.

67
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,270
One, two, three, four.

68
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,150
No, I...

69
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,980
Uncle Hao misunderstood me.

70
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,020
He misunderstood you?

71
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,020
What?

72
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,150
I think he knows you well.

73
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,810
You're perfect.

74
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,400
Hey, Xingxing.

75
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,310
You wronged me.

76
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,520
I wronged you?

77
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,400
Now you're acting weird

78
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,770
when it comes to Fork Man.

79
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,480
You're still brazen.

80
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,980
You have double standards.

81
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,150
No.

82
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Speaking of Fork Man,

83
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,440
I have something to say.

84
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,810
Just say it.

85
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,320
Since Fork Man appeared,

86
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,820
you've become more and more unscrupulous.

87
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,070
You provoked me in front of me.

88
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,020
Yes.

89
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,180
Wasn't this good?

90
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,440
I provoked you and you didn't follow me.

91
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,690
Let's play our own games.

92
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,100
You...

93
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,860
Shame on you.

94
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,070
No.

95
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,769
I won't follow you.

96
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:20,769
I'll still do that.

97
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,310
Brother.

98
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,560
Don't cry.

99
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,650
Don't feel inferior.

100
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,140
Even if you don't have any beard

101
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,900
or leg hair,

102
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,310
I won't dislike you.

103
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,440
You're so annoying.

104
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,850
Just leave me alone.

105
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,350
Can you leave me alone?

106
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,430
How can I leave you alone?

107
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,980
I won't give up on you.

108
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,520
Ah.

109
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,810
You're so annoying.

110
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,820
All right. All right.

111
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,070
Don't be angry.

112
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,560
I can't say anything positive.

113
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,820
But I really treat you as my own brother.

114
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,440
Then why did you make me angry?

115
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,730
Alright. Don't be angry.

116
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,430
Come on, smile for me.

117
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,980
I'm a pro at taking care of a cripple.

118
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,360
Put me down.

119
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,930
You're double-faced.

120
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,690
I know it clearly.

121
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,440
I don't need your care.

122
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,270
Hey.

123
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,940
What?

124
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,360
Look.

125
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:56,900
Wow.

126
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,900
So many stars.

127
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,630
Stars only look pretty

128
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,650
when you look at them like this.

129
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,980
I get drunk and forget that the stars 
in the water are just reflections.

130
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,270
I fall asleep on the boat, 
and I lie down on the Milky Way in my dream.

131
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,270
What does it mean?

132
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,730
It means I like the scene very much.

133
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,770
I'm a rough man.

134
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,770
I don't understand what you scholars say.

135
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,180
All I know is that the scene pretty.

136
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,480
If you like it, say you like it.

137
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,770
Is the scene pretty?

138
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:21,770
Yes.

139
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:24,980
Do you like it?

140
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,350
Yes.

141
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,650
I get drunk and forget that the stars 
in the water are just reflections.

142
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,480
I fall asleep on the boat.

143
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,140
I fall asleep on the boat.

144
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,900
I lie down on the Milky Way in my dream.

145
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,440
I lie down on the Milky Way in my dream.

146
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,640
Today,

147
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,020
you and I

148
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,270
are lying in the deep woods,

149
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,940
looking at the stars.

150
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,350
What the beautiful scenery.

151
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,390
One word.

152
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,440
Beautiful.

153
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,280
Two words.

154
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,940
Very enjoyable.

155
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,059
Three words.

156
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,520
Okay.

157
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,940
This is great.

158
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,030
Look, there are green stars.

159
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
I see it too.

160
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,600
Why do I feel

161
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,270
they're getting closer to us?

162
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,600
They're wolves.

163
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,730
Brother Bu Ying.

164
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,520
Brother, don't be afraid.

165
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,020
It's morning.

166
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,900
Wait.

167
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,230
Brother Mu.

168
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,230
Why are you here?

169
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,180
Xingchen.

170
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,110
After we parted in the forest last time,

171
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,730
we still have a lot to talk about.

172
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,730
Oh, but...

173
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,310
It's late.

174
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,690
It's about Fork Man.

175
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:01,730
Fork Man?

176
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,400
That's right.

177
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,730

Alright.

352
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,520
-Brother. -Let's go. Don't be afraid.

353
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,770
Aren't you worried at all?

354
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,440
All right.

355
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,270
Don't be angry.

356
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,020
Why should I be worried?

357
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,730
You're not pretty anymore.

358
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,860
Turn around.

359
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,690
Oh.

360
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,440
Not bad.

361
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,190
Don't worry.

362
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,940
Go practice your swordplay.

363
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,860
Your hair is longer.

364
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,060
You don't worry, but I do.

365
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,140
Am I fat?

366
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:05,900
No.

367
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,570
Brother, let's go practice swordplay.

368
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,520
I have something to say to Xingchen.

369
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,020
Exactly.

370
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,140
Xingchen. Xingchen.

371
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,400
No.

372
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,770
Why are they so close?

373
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,980
It's not okay.

374
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,400
He...

375
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,600
It seems that

376
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,650
he doesn't know

377
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:30,520
his brother is a girl.

378
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,310
You...

379
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,900
How did you know?

380
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,060
Because she used to wear a beard,

381
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,440
it's normal that I didn't recognize her.

382
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,980
Look at her now.

383
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,060
She is obviously a girl.

384
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,430
You can get it.

385
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,810
Why can't your brother get it?

386
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,320
Maybe my brother only cares about swords.

387
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,070
Do you think we should tell your brother

388
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,440
that Yaoguang is a girl?

389
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,640
She'll tell him herself

390
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,770
if she wants to.

391
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,440
If she doesn't say anything, stay the same.

392
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,070
Okay.

393
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:01,980
You're right.

394
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,560
Come on, baby.

395
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,190
Miss.

396
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,810
I'm coming.

397
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,060
Xingchen.

398
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,140
I miss you so much.

399
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,230
I miss you too.

400
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,270
We haven't seen each other for a few days.

401
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,360
But it feels like it's been a long time.

402
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,570
Yes.

403
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,980
One day apart is like three years.

404
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,610
We haven't seen each other for days.

405
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:35,900
It's like a lot of three years passed.

406
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:36,860
Hey.

407
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,190
I didn't tell you in detail during the day.

408
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,970
What happened to you on the mountain？

409
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:40,980
What took you so long?

410
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,190
It was all because of Jiang Buying.

411
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,030
Don't mention it.

412
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,480
He was so annoying.

413
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,350
Oh.

414
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,110
He was really annoying.

415
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,020
Come on.

416
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,770
Alright, I understand you.

417
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,670
Although it looks like Bunting and I

418
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,020
got along well today,

419
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,400
we just had a quarrel a few days ago.

420
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,690
I managed to coax him.

421
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,360
How?

422
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,320
I just shook his arms

423
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,890
and he was not angry anymore.

424
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,600
How could it be so fast?

425
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,100
Oh.

426
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,940
Just shake his arms.

427
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,270
Why are you laughing?

428
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,480
Have you ever heard a saying?

429
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,850
"Love begets worry,

430
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,270
and worry begets fear."

431
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,640
He was too afraid to lose you.

432
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,860
When you were angry, he was afraid

433
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,440
that if he didn't follow your words,

434
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:33,730
you would ignore him.

435
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,400
You really know a lot, don't you?

436
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,770
Of course! I've read all the scripts

437
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,350
in the martial arts world.

438
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,600
There's nothing I don't understand.

439
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,100
Oh, I see.

440
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,810
So, what's the deal between you and Buying?

441
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,230
He and I...

442
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,890
We are...

443
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:55,900
What?

444
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,020
Huo Xingchen!

445
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,680
Yes.

446
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,890
You're teasing me,

447
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,850
despite me helping you out！

Well.

I've prepared some ordinary items

451
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,690
from Xiaoyao Palace for you all.

452
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:15,690
Nothing special.

453
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,770
It's hardly presentable.

454
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,730
Enjoy them on your journey.

455
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:23,400
Thank you, uncle.

It's time for us to leave.

460
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:30,890
OK.

461
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:33,940
See you again.

00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,480
OK.

Seventh Master.

474
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,060
Take care of yourself.

475

Sure!

00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:14,980

Oh.

Stick it back up.

affects the entire ambiance.

The gold itself

is naturally beautiful

when exposed.

491
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,900
It's too vulgar to show gold.

492
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,520
It's not elegant at all.

493

I don't know.

00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,360
Not presentable?

Is that food?

512

I remember that day

513
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,520
you used my belt to fight the enemy.

514
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,150
You seemed quite adept at it.

515
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,860
So I made you this belt

516
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,520
that can replace weapons.

517
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,480
Try it.

Yes, I do.

00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,390
It's you.

527
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:22,980
No.

528
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,360
Come here.

529
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,190
I haven't told you yet.

530
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,350
Please.

531
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:27,680
I've already

532
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,230
let her go.

533
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:32,980
Now,

534
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,190
I'm just fulfilling my old wish.

535
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,110
Really?

536
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,350
Of course.

537
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,820
Silly girl.

538
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,600
Brother, come here.

539
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,230
Go.

540
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,350
Hurry.

541
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,430
Try this.

542
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:03,230
Delicious.

543
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:03,730
Really?

544
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:04,110
Yes.

545
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:05,730
It's all yours.

546
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,730
...two, three.

547
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,530
Turn.

548
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,610
Are you OK?

549
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:12,730
I'm fine.

550
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,930
Come on. Have a rest.

551
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,030
OK.

552
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,860
Great!

553
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,060
He finally realized the reality

554
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,020
and let go of Xingchen.

555
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,980
Otherwise, he would still follow us,

556
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,940
watching Xingchen and Jiang Buting

557
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,570
That would have been so painful.

558
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,860
What are you doing?

559
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:04,770
Brother.

560
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,650
You shouldn't write your romance novel

561
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,270
so blatantly.

562
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,600
What are you writing about them every day?

563
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,360
Stop watching.

564
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,100
Fine, I won't watch.

565
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,360
Xingxing, it's time to take medicine.

566
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:50,520
OK.

567
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,610
You should eat this today.

568
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,600
Open your mouth.

569
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,690
Why are the colors different every day?

570
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,600
There are white, pink, purple, yellow.

571
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,440
It's green today.

572
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,520
Maybe my master

573
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:05,640
has a girlish heart.

574
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,690
How are you feeling?

575
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,520
Are you feeling unwell?

576
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,730
Xingchen, what's wrong?

577
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,070
Nothing.

578
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:34,110
Xing...

579
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,680
Why are you staring at me?

580
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,020
Why are you laughing?

581
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,520
What's wrong with you?

582
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:44,980
Little cutie.

583
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,220
Little cutie?

584
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,190
Oh.

585
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,810
Little cutie.

586
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,650
You are so cute!

587
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,230
Oh.

588
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,140
Oh.

589
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,270
You're so cute!

590
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:54,940
Ah.

591
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,480
Why are you so cute?

592
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:56,980
No.

593
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,230
No, no, no. Let go of me.

594
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,110
What's wrong with her?

595
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,480
I don't know.

596
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,650
Ugly thing.

597
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:19,480
You are ugly thing!

598
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,680
Ugly thing.

599
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,060
They are so ugly.

600
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:37,400
Xingchen.

601
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:40,850
Horse.

602
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:43,730
Horse?

603
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,070
Yes.

604
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,690
A horse can speak?

605
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,440
Hey.

606
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,650
This horse can speak!

607
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,360
This is Transmutation Pill's side effect.

608
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,440
Please forgive us.

609
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,900
Ugly thing, why are you looking at me?

610
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,810
Who are you calling ugly thing?

611
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:54,810
Hey.

612
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,520
Ugly thing, why are you so mean?

613
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:57,430
Brother.

614
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,360
You think you're right for being ugly?

615
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,270
Let's go.

616
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:00,690
Why are you calling me ugly thing?

617
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,520
Ugly thing.

618
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,440
Let's go.

619
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,100
You're just an ugly thing,

620
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,360
both ugly and dark-skinned.

621
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,770
I finally understand

622
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,280
Her aesthetic sense is badly distorted now.

623
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,270
I think the effect of that medicine

624
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,060
has reached her brain.

625
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,730
She's like a six-year-old girl now.

626
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,480
But she can't call me ugly thing.

627
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,570
She even called me ugly thing.

628
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,520
Only you two are ugly.

629
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,060
I am...

630
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:29,860
horse.

631
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,350
Why didn't she call my brother ugly thing?

632
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:35,940
They look like pig ears.

633
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,020
Really?

634
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,840
[Xiaoyao Palace] [Sophora Town]

635
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,520
Xingchen seems to have gotten worse.

636
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,270
Who is the Xingchen?

637
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,270
Brother, what are we doing here?

638
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,060
My master's scrolls say that the fog in the

639
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,480
Sophora Town Forbidden Zone can stabilize

640
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,030
one's mind, which should help Xingchen.

641
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,310
Let's go in and have a look.

642
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,310
Hey, brother.

643
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,310
Why is this road

644
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,610
so eerie?

645
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,930
Is the Forbidden Zone here?

646
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,770
Logically speaking,

647
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,060
it's so foggy here.

648
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,640
The Forbidden Zone should not be far.

649
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,520
Take a look at the map.

650
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:27,900
Why is it so frightening here?

651
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,690
Where are we?

652
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:32,480
Buting.

653
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,230
Look what I've brought you?

654
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,560
Don't shout.

655
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,060
No.

656
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,140
So adorable like this.

657
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,430
Look at them.

658
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,850
They like you so much.

659
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:47,890
Let's go and say hello.

660
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,430
Stop.

661
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,930
What have you brought?

662
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,070
Go back now.

663
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,390
Let go of your hands.

664
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:58,560
Xingchen is holding a monster.

665
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,190
Xingchen, danger, danger, danger!

666
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,440
Let the monster disappear!

667
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,230
Shut up.

668
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,310
Don't scare them.

669
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,730
They all like you very much.

670
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:09,270
See?

671
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,139
He's greeting you.

672
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:10,900
Come on.

673
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,850
Stop.

674
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,350
L-L-Let go!

675
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:13,730
Monster!

676
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,020
Danger, danger, danger!

677
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,690
It's OK. Don't be afraid.

678
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,820
Back off!

679
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,560
Xingxing! Xingxing!

680
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,270
I saw him. He's cute.

681
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,360
You come here first.

682
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,440
Let's play with him later, OK?

683
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,810
Why don't you shake hands first?

684
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,020
No, no. You come here first.

685
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,610
Later,

686
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,230
we will play with him later, OK?

687
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:35,850
Come here.

688
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,480
Hurry up. Come here.

689
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,310
We will play with him later.

690
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:39,690
Come.

691
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,480
Stand still.

692
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,230
So cute.

693
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,100
Come on.

694
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,650
Oh.

695
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,730
Cutie.

696
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:48,770
All right, all right.

697
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:49,810
Let him come back.

698
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:50,520
Let him come back!

699
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,230
Let him come back.

700
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,310
You little brat! Come back here.

701
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,110
Let's fight.

702
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:54,440
Oh my god!

703
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,940
Oh my goodness, it's so scary!

704
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,360
My cutie is gone.

705
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,070
It's OK.

706
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,230
Xingchen, are you OK?

707
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,610
It's gone. Forget it.

708
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,820
This Sophora Town

709
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,360
is indeed strange.

710
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,560
Everyone, follow closely.

711
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,730
Don't get separated.

712
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:13,770
OK.

713
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,610
There seems to be a house ahead.

714
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,520
Let's find out where the Forbidden Zone is.

715
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,180
Brother, hold on to Xingchen.

716
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,110
Hurry up!

717
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:42,940
Oh god.

718
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,440
Don't be afraid.

719
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:45,140
Yes.

720
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,680
Little cutie, don't run.

721
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,060
Hey, Xingchen.

722
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,230
Xingxing, where are you going?

723
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,350
It's OK. I'll get her back.

724
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:15,730
No one is here.

725
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,440
It's so strange.

726
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,440
The lanterns are still on.

727
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:21,820
But why is no one answering?

728
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,020
Brother.

729
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,110
How about I go inside and take a look?

730
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,140
That works.

731
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,720
But there must be many villagers

732
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,940
inside this village.

733
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,940
Keep your voice down. Don't disturb them.

734
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,020
Don't worry.

735
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:50,890
Hey.

736
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:54,650
Let's go inside.

737
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,560
Xingxing. Brother.

738
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,520
Let's go.

739
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,230
Coming.

740
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,150
This table is clean.

741
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,230
Someone was embroidering here just now.

742
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,270
What's that smell?

743
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,310
Wow.

744
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,480
Smells good. It's braised pork!

745
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,360
Xingchen, this is noodles.

746
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:45,480
No. Stop it.

747
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,210
You...

748
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:47,430
What are you doing?

749
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:48,520
Horse.

750
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,390
This place

751
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,610
feels like

752
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,310
there are countless unseen eyes

753
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,390
watching you from the shadows.

754
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,310
There were so many people just now.

755
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,640
The moment we came in,

756
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,070
it became a ghost town

757
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,850
with no sign of anyone

758
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,190
Brother.

759
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,480
Don't be afraid.

760
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:08,680
I'm here.

761
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:11,560
I'm not afraid.

762
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,190
You're the one who's shaking.

763
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,650
Don't panic.

764
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,560
Look.

765
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,020
The fire in the stove hasn't extinguished.

766
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,520
The noodles in the pot are not soggy.

767
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,680
The candles outside

768
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,100
are still burning.

769
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,810
Here.

770
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:34,890
There must be someone just now.

771
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:43,820
Mom!

772
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,770
Mom.

773
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:47,970
What's wrong?

774
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,780
Let's see if dad's noodles are ready.

775
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,270
Yes.

776
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,230
It's ready.

777
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,600
You're sweating.

778
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,100
It's OK.

779
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,560
We can have dinner soon.

780
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,190
Mom.

781
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,150
There must have been residents here,

782
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:11,770
they've just temporarily hidden.

783
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,070
How about this?

784
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,270
Let's split up.

785
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:16,690
and search separately.

786
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:17,980
Find the Forbidden Zone as soon as possible.

787
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,980
OK. OK.

788
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,350
OK.

789
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,570
Cutie, didn't you say

790
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,310
you'd take me to catch butterflies?

791
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:27,280
Yes.

792
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,890
I want to take you to catch butterflies.

793
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,110
But we...

794
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,610
we're going there to catch butterflies.

795
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,150
You must follow me closely.

796
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,560
The fog over there seems to be thicker.

797
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:38,730
Hey...

798
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:40,810
Xingxing!

799
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,810
Huo Xingchen!

800
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:45,890
Huo Xingchen!

801
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,020
Xingxing!

802
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:56,520
Xingxing!

803
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:58,650
Xingxing!

804
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,140
Little cutie!

805
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:02,980
Xingchen!

806
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,480
Little cutie, slow down!

807
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,230
Cutie.

808
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:05,850
Oh no.

809
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,560
Brother.

810
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,730
Are you scared?

811
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,100
No.

812
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,320
I have no right to be afraid.scared

813
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,100
I must protect you.

814
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:28,860
Alright.

815
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:30,270
Brother.

816
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:31,730
With your words,

817
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,320
I'm not afraid either.

818
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,690
Actually, I'm still afraid.

819
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,770
My legs aren't listening to me anymore.

820
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,230
A-A-Aren't you brave?

821
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:47,230
What honest child wouldn't be afraid?

822
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:47,930
My god!

823
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,390
Brother,

824
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:50,900
are we really unlucky?

825
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,440
Have we actually met...

826
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,980
No, no.

827
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,690
No.

828
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,390
Little cutie.

829
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,640
Little cutie, slow down.

830
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,480
Little cutie!

831
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,730
Xingchen!

832
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,110
Xingchen, watch out!

833
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,020
What's your name?

834
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,690
Let me touch you.

835
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,270
Xingchen, come here!

836
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,650
Horse?

837
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,390
I'll tell you,

838
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,070
even if you are a horse,

839
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,730
I won't give you my little cutie.

840
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,860
Because I want to give it to Buting.

841
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:41,610
Little cutie.

842
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,230
Little cutie, don't run!

843
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:43,860
Xingchen!

844
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,520
Little cutie!

845
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,060
Little cutie!

846
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,940
Little cutie.

847
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:49,360
Xingchen.

848
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,020
Little cutie.

849
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,600
Little cutie.

850
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,520
Little cutie.

851
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,640
Little cutie!

852
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,810
Little cutie!

853
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,320
Little cutie, where have you been?

854
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,060
Why is there so much smoke?

855
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,780
What's that smell?

856
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,810
It smells so good.

857
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:44,520
Xingchen.

858
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,600
There's a butterfly.

859
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,180
Star, it's OK now.

860
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,480
I'll take you home.

861
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,230
Xingchen.

862
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:54,940
Xingchen!

863
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,130
♫Wow, baby♫

864
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,060
♫I can touch the clouds in fairy tales♫

865
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,860
♫When I reach out♫

866
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,920
♫A calm heart starts♫

867
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,480
♫Feeling excited and nervous♫

868
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:49,350
♫The sky in front of me is also painted♫

869
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,500
[The fluttering pink]

870
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,800
Please

871
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,880
Tell me it's not a dream
