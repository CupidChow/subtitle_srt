You're so ugly.

173
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,950
Why would I be jealous?

Brother, tell me.

175

What's there to be jealous of?

176
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,020
Xingxing bought it for me.

177
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,330
You are jealous

178
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,380
that Xingxing only cares about me.

179
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,250
You said you gave up,

180
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,260
but we all know what's going on.

181
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,740
What a joke.

182
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,950
Why would I be jealous of a dying guy

183
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,750
who only knows how to live off a woman?

184

186
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,220
I heard the conversation between you

187
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,230
and Sixth Elder that day.

188
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,850
Who are you to eavesdrop on us?

189

Whatever you say.

190

There's nothing you can do

191
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,380
with your cheap life.

192
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,580
And there's no cure.

193
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,440
Isn't that true?

194
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,500
Don't you think you're despicable?

195
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,780
At this point,

196
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,470
why haven't you told Xingchen?

197
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,600
Does she know
that you can't give her a future?

198
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,620
You don't have to worry

199
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,330
about Xingchen and me.

200
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,010
Does she know you can't give her a future?

201

You know you won't live long.

Xingchen.

203
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,120
Didn't you want to prove that there's
something wrong with the breaking news?

204
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,160
So...

205
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,320
What's wrong?

206
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,500
Why do I feel like someone is calling me?

207
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,390
There's no one.

208
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,050
What did you say?

209
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,980
I said, didn't you want

210
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,280
to prove that there's
something wrong with the breaking news?

It went well.

Besides, he's different now.

After all,

Since you know it's difficult for me,

why do you ask?

320
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,670
It's just

that I don't want
Jiang Buting to misunderstand.

322

342
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,450
The most ridiculous part is

343
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,830
that I did hesitate

344
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,690
for a second.

345
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,550
At first, I thought

346
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,370
you were just self-willed and ignorant.

347
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,650
But overall, you're still a good person.

348
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,790
But now I realize

349
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,460
that you are a liar full of lies.

350
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:17,950
What?

351
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,090
You're a liar! You're a liar! Bah!

352
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,870
I know it's hard to believe,

353
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,700
but this is the truth.

354
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,490
I'm the Fork Man that Xingchen
has been looking for all her life.

355
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,760
She didn't tell you before

356
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,210
because I asked her to keep it a secret.

357
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,410
Don't blame her.

358
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,010
You asked her not to tell?

359
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,410
Mu Binghe, you're so thick-skinned.

360
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,730
How dare you

361
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,060
pretend to be the Fork Man?

362
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,350
Stop it!

363
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:44,690
You...

364
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,070
Brother Mu, I'm sorry.

365
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,530
No, he is...

366
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,100
Come here.

367
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,360
I...

368
00:22:59,290 --> 00:22:59,790
Wait.

369
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,090
Why are you taking me away?

370
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,060
He is a liar!

371
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,200
Let me argue with him.

372
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,830
When will you stop messing around?

373
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,650
You...

374
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,920
You yelled at me because of him.

375
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,040
Let's talk nicely.

376
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,120
I know you think this is ridiculous,

377
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,980
but it is the truth.

378
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,730
Brother Mu is the Fork Man.

379
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,830
He can't be the Fork Man.

380
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,730
Why are you so sure?

381
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,210
I...

382
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,640
Huh?

383
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,150
At this point,

384
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,740
I won't hide it from you anymore.

385
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,860
Actually,

386
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,360
I'm the Fork Man.

387
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,250
You...

388
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,080
Stop it.

389
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,830
I said you could be willful and get jealous.

390
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,000
But you can't lie.

391
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,010
I'm not lying. I'm really the Fork Man.

392
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,050
You're really...

393
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,790
What?

394
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,550
Take it out.

395
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,730
What is it?

396
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,520
The jade pendant that represents
the identity of Fork Man.

397
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,400
I lost it.

398
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,080
And you happened to lose it at this time?

399
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,730
No, it's true…

400
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,400
Enough.

401
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,850
I've doubted you before.

402
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,820
But I tested.

403
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,630
It's not you.

404
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,610
You should calm down and think about it.

405

00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,060
Do you trust me or not?

410
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,280
I do.

411
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,360
There is indeed a dragon in the sky.

412
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,180
There is no dragon in the sky!

413
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,950
I'm asking if you believe that I'm Fork Man.

414
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,520
I believe.

415
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,640
I believe everything you say.

416
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,510
But don't say it again next time.

417
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,660

Xingchen.

419
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:56,610
Brother Mu.

420
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,740
Why are you here?

421
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,930
Did Jiang Buting bully you again?

422
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,780
Stop!

423
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,360
Apologize to Brother Mu.

424
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,490
He'll forgive you as long as you say sorry.

425
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,860
Why should I apologize to him?

426
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,770
Oh, stop it, Jiang.

427
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,410
Alright?

428
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,570
Is it fun to believe your own lies?

429
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,090
What's wrong with you?

430
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:32,830
Huh?

431
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,350
You want me to say sorry?

432
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,430
Impossible.

433
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,100
Fine.

434
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,020
Since Mr. Jiang said I'm a fake,

435
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,320
what evidence do you have?

436
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,610
You're an imposter,
and yet you're so arrogant.

437
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:44,140
Just because there are few clues
about the Fork Man,

438
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,180
it doesn't mean
that you can pretend to be him.

439
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,150
You don't look like the Fork Man at all.
All you know is to put on an act.

440
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,480
Why should I be?

441
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,980
I'm the real Fork Man.

442
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,480
It's a waste that
you're wearing such a smart outfit.

443
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,360
My bangs

444
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,980
look better than yours.

445
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,440
What's wrong with my bangs?

446
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,020
She believes that I'm the real Fork Man.

447
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,270
Look at your clothes.

448
00:26:59,270 --> 00:26:59,860
Then ask…

449
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,810
I like you!

450
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:18,460
So if I have to choose

451
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,440
between you and the Fork Man,

452
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,240
I'll choose you.

Let me analyze it for you.

572
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,290
She must be in a bad mood
because of the marriage.

573
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,610
She's senseless because she doesn't like

574
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,320
the Holy Son of the Western Region.

575
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,930
And she wants to grow her beard. Why?

576
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,100
Because she misses us.

577
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,720
She missed the days

578
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,040
when she disguised herself as a man and travelled
the martial arts world with us,

579
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,420
right?

580

Well, she did lie to you
and hid her identity.

600

But our friendship along the way

601

She's the legitimate daughter

She was spoiled
and raised in a wealthy family.

But why must she marry herself
into the Western Region?

636
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,060
The Mu family

Ah.

and have had all the people laughing at us.

644
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,150
Also, Yaoguang wouldn't have to marry herself
into the Western Region

645
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,080

How can she suffer in the Western Region?

656

As a member of the Mu family,
being soft-hearted is a weakness.

848
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,790
♫All the clouds floated to the side♫

849
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,670
♫They refused to disturb it all♫

850
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:54,320
Xingxing.

851
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,300
I have something to tell you.

852
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:58,090
What's wrong?

853
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:02,670
When we were

854
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,160
at the Star-picking Sect,

855
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,590
Sixth Elder said that I was dying.

856
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:09,850
I...

857
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,120
actually thought about giving up.

858
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,500
Jiang Buting.

859
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,190
But I don't think so anymore.

860
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,760
You're right.

861
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:32,950
In life,

862
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,520
even if tomorrow is the last day,

863
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,810
I want to be with the one I love.

864
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,920
I will always be with you.

865
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:23,840
Yaoguang.

866
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:24,580
You...

867
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,640
Some people

868
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,750
are so ruthless
that they don't even save their own sister.

869
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:31,490
Enough. Stop talking.

870
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,390
Were you blaming it on me too?

871
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:23,520
I didn't blame you.

872
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,030
A liar.

873
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:29,650
I really didn't blame you.

874
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,930
Since we were young,

875
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:35,130
we've been taught to be obedient.

876
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,550
You're just

877
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:39,940
following their words.

878
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:42,210
But Brother,

879
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,640
I hope

880
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:49,690
you can live

881
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:51,830
for yourself.

882
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:13,920
I wish I could live for myself too.

883
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,540
♫Wow, baby♫

884
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,500
♫I can touch the clouds in fairy tales♫

885
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:43,220
♫When I reach out♫

886
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:45,330
♫A calm heart starts♫

887
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:47,910
♫Feeling excited and nervous♫

888
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:50,750
♫The sky in front of me is also painted♫

889
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,890
♫Heart-warming pink♫

890
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:54,340
♫Oh, please♫

891
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,880
♫Tell me it's not a dream♫
