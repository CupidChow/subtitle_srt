4
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,730
I've always wanted to ask you,

5
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,140
why did you leave Wuyue Sect

6
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,310
to explore the martial arts world?

7
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,140
Because of

8
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:55,430
one person.

9
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:03,180
Help me.

10
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,850
Stop.

11
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,019
Let go of that girl!

12
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:15,880
Go.

13
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,270
Don't be afraid.

14
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,140
I'll protect you.

15
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,880
Run.

16
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,100
Are you okay?

17
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,180
Wait.

18
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,560
What's your name?

19
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,640
The moon is beautiful tonight.

20
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,930
It's so round.

21
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,430
Just call me Fork Man.

22
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,670
He's the best hero I've ever seen.

23
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,520
So I made a vow

24
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,100
that I will train hard in martial arts

25
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,020
and when I grow up, I will find him

26
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,680
and wander the martial arts world with him,

27
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,020
becoming a partner who can assist

28
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,060
and fight alongside him.

29
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,270
And together,

30
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,980
we will uphold justice,

31
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,600
help the weak, and fight against the strong.

32
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:21,430
Wow.

33
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,310
What an ambitious goal.

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,060
I think so too.

35
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,180
What about you?

36
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,890
Yeah, why do you wander the martial arts world?

37
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,640
I know.

38
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,350
Just like me, it's because of someone, right?

39
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,480
My dear disciple.

40
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,230
Well,

41
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,850
you said you'd take care of me and treat me well.

42
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,770
I've run out of money.

43
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,770
If we don't have money to pay the rent tomorrow,

44
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,390
we'll be homeless.

45
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,930
Do you think I'm stupid?

46
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,430
I just gave you money.

47
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,230
Young Miss,

48
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,140
the money you gave me

49
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,980
is not enough to cover yesterday's overdue rent.

50
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,060
How about this?

51
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,140
You sneak back to Wuyue Sect

52
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,770
to get enough money and then come to me.

53
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,770
We can't wander the martial arts world without money.

54
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,390
Right?

55
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,850
You're right.

56
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,850
After all, I am the head of the family,

57
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,480
and should be responsible for family expenses.

58
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,270
Okay then.

59
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,600
I'll go home tomorrow and get some money.

60
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:31,030
Yeah.

61
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,600
I've been carrying this medicine

62
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,390
and have asked all the doctors in the city,

63
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,350
but none of them know what it is made of.

64
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:47,980
By the way,

65
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,730
two doctors who smelled it

66
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,810
experienced the exact same symptoms as Huo Xingchen.

67
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,180
But

68
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,230
I consulted a pharmacist from the Western Regions,

69
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,480
and he recognized it.

70
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,640
What did he say

71
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,680
was in it?

72
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,980
There is an ingredient in it

73
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,850
which comes from the Western Regions,

74
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,680
called "Seven Leaves, One Flower".

75
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,100
"Seven Leaves, One Flower".

76
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,019
"Seven Leaves, One Flower".

77
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:24,790
Okay.

78
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,560
This medicine has extremely demanding requirements

79
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,230
for its growing environment,

80
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,430
It's rarely planted by people in the Central Plains.

81
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,430
This herb can cause hallucinations.

82
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,770
Seven Leaves, One Flower,

83
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,480
I seem to...

84
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,060
have heard Master talk about it.

85
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,350
Yes, Master is the top pharmacist in the world.

86
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,390
If only Master were here.

87
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,270
Master, I'm back.

88
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:05,850
Hurry up.

89
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,020
Master.

90
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:10,890
Let's go.

91
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,270
Master.

92
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,140
Master.

93
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,680
Don't worry.

94
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,980
Master is so powerful.

95
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,310
He'll definitely be safe.

96
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,100
But

97
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,060
we have followed the clues of the men in black

98
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,980
and still haven't found their hiding place.

99
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,890
Where did they hide Master?

100
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:58,580
Brother.

101
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,020
You only have one lifesaving pill left,

102
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,140
which Master left for you.

103
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,100
If we can't find Master soon,

104
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:06,980
I'm afraid...

105
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,850
I'm fine.

106
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,100
Buying,

107
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,890
we have to follow this clue

108
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,680
and continue to investigate.

109
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,230
As long as we can find where this medicine is in Luo City,

110
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,980
we will find the men in black.

111
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,460
Okay.

112
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,220
Okay.

113
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,810
Why don't you go?

114
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,770
I don't have to go this time?

115
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,890
You mean...

116
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,640
Let's compete.

117
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,480
Sure.

118
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,090
I win.

119
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:54,480
Go.

120
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,180
Once you enter the Elixir Village,

121
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,810
your whole family won't go hungry.

122
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,640
You'll have buns to eat until you're full,

123
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,480
and even some spare change in your pocket.

124
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,930
The benefits of the Elixir Village are so good.

125
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,730
Since I am already the head of the family,

126
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,810
I should do something for those two weaklings.

127
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:15,770
No.

128
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,930
My dream is to wander the martial arts world.

129
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:18,960
Yes.

130
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,270
I'd better go home and get the money.

131
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,520
Can't you talk about dreams?

132
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,120
Huh?

133
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,480
Once you enter the Elixir Village,

134
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,350
you'll become a talented person who helps others.

135
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,520
Petty profits are nothing.

136
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,890
Everyone will love and respect you.

137
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,390
Fork Man is mine.

138
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,270
Fork Man's peripherals.

139
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,310
Excuse me.

140
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
Stand in line.

141
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,100
Let me have a look.

142
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,350
Come on, line up.

143
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,060
Don't rush. Line up.

144
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,770
Give it to me.

145
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,850
Back then,

146
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,520
the first step for Fork Man to enter the martial arts world

147
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,140
was the Elixir Village.

148
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,560
Fork Man said...

149
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,350
You just said the first step of the Fork Man

150
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,520
was to the Elixir Village?

151
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,560
Yes.

152
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,730
Welcome back, Miss.

153
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,730
Yeah.

154
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,350
You...

155
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,679
Why are you back?

156
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,230
I’ve decided.

157
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,180
I want to stay and work in the Elixir Village.

158
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,430
What?

159
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,140
Don’t you want to wander around the world?

160
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,050
Why do you want to go to the Elixir Village now?

161
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,180
Fork Man took his first step

162
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,430
in the Elixir Village

163
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,350
back then.

164
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,480
And I, Huo Xingchen,

165
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,350
have proudly become a janitor

166
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,130
in the Elixir Village.

167
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,600
Janitor?

168
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,560
Young Miss.

169
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,230
Those are all tricks to deceive the poor and force them into hard labor.

170
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,810
You are the hope of the martial arts world

171
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,100
and will inherit the sect leader.

172
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,180
How can you go there to be a janitor?

173
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:16,950
No.

174
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,730
Fork Man said,

175
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,730

Okay. Let's go and clean the Elixir Village now.

No, what did you say about a flower?

What he said

189
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,680
is this flower that I prepared for you with all my heart.

190

00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,600
Let's eat.

348
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:31,720
[Wuyue Sect]

349
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,890
Everyone,

350
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,850
this is the Mingqian tea

351
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,350
I specially prepared for you today.

352
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,180
Please enjoy it.

353
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,270
Come on. Please.

354
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,890
Please.

355
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,730
Father-in-law.

356
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:51,810
Rise.

357
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,770
Come, Xingchen.

358
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,390
Uncles and elders,

359
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,180
righteous heroes,

360
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,930
after the selection of son-in-law,

361
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,180
I took Xingchen to pay respects to my deceased mother

362
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,980
without informing you.

363
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,980
We feel sorry for that.

364
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,640
Don't be, Mr. Mu.

365
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,020
Miss Huo, as the next head of the sect,

366
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,430
must have her own reason.

367
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,770
Everyone.

368
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,930
Let me propose a toast to you.

369
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:29,860
Ah.

370
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,680
Thank you for coming all the way here.

371
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,020
I apologize for

372
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,020
any inconvenience caused.

373
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,230
Head Huo,

374
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:42,600
shouldn't the prospective sect leader unveil her face?

375
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,230
After all, Miss Huo escaped from the marriage in front of everyone's eyes.

376
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,140
Now she appears but refuses to show her face.

377
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,140
Who can prove that under this veil,

378
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,560
it must be Miss Huo herself?

379
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,140
Yes.

380
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,390
Master Huang,

381
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,980
you're wrong.

382
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,810
My daughter is not married yet.

383
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,890
How can she easily reveal her face in front of others?

384
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,060
People here are all men.

385
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,020
I don't think it's appropriate.

386
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,640
My daughter's reputation

387
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,850
cannot be violated.

388
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,350
Everyone,

389
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,520
why don't we make a compromise?

390
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,230
Since it's improper to show her face before the marriage,

391
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,140
why don't we just set the date

392
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,850
for Miss Huo's wedding today?

393
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,640
By then,

394
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,600
she can surely reveal her face.

395
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,270
What?

396
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,980
This won't do either?

397
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:46,680
How could it be?

398
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,850
Three months from now,

399
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,430
is the auspicious day set by our Head.

400
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,890
Xingchen and Binghe

401
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,230
will hold their wedding at that time.

402
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,930
By then, everyone will see.

403
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,170
Okay.

404
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,890
Then we will come to

405
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,730
attend their wedding banquet.

406
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,930
Okay, enjoy yourselves. Please.

407
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,230
What are they doing

408
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,430
in the middle of the night?

409
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,680
Where did you go?

410
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,560
Coming. We're waiting for you.

411
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,380
Are you ready?

412
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:03,850
Yes.

413
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,400
Let's go.

414
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:04,990
Okay.

415
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,050
So mysterious.

416
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Oh no, he's awake. Hurry.

417
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:02,850
Hold him.

418
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,060
Don't move.

419
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:09,430
Are you hurt?

420
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,140
No, I scratched it before.

421
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,270
Hurry, kill her!

422
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,890
No, don't kill me.

423
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,060
I can be cured. I can be cured.

424
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,850
You're hopeless.

425
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:18,930
If you get scratched, you'll lose your mind.

426
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,730
There's no cure at all.

427
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:20,810
Hurry, hold him down.

428
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,980
Hurry up.

429
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,430
Help! The mutant is awake!

430
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,430
Fork...

431
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,100
The mutant is awake.

432
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,850
Something happened inside. Go and take a look.

433
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,270
Sorry about earlier. I'm...

434
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,270
Even if you turn to ashes,

435
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,060
I would still recognize you.

436
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,310
That night,

437
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,770
the moon was beautiful.

438
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,020
The moon is even more...

439
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,270
Fork Man.

440
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,770
Why are you standing there?

441
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:10,680
To see if there are any pursuers.

442
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,850
It's me.

443
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,180
Don't you remember me?

444
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,230
You saved me when I was young.

445
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,100
I saved you?

446
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,600
I wander the martial arts world now because of you.

447
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,180
Because of me?

448
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:33,650
Yes.

449
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,390
You were the first person to believe in me

450
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,680
and the first one who told me

451
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,850
that I could rely on myself.

452
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,560
Since then, I dream of you every day.

453
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,730
I've been looking for you all this time,

454
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,930
but I couldn't find you.

455
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,020
And later you became

456
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,640
the famous Fork Man.

457
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
So I bought all your books.

458
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,770
I have all your peripherals.

459
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:04,890
So I have something to tell you.

460
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,100
Actually...

461
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,310
Now that things have come to this,

462
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,730
we don't have time for talk.

463
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,390
We can talk about it later.

464
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,360
Right.

465
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,350
We haven't solved the problem of Elixir Village.

466
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:16,620
Yes.

467
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,100
Elixir Village is in danger now.

468
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,850
I can go alone.

469
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,420
You're safe now.

470
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,350
You go first.

471
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,230
I can't leave. I'm skilled in martial arts now.

472
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,020
It's my responsibility to fight evil and promote justice.

473
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,680
Didn't you tell me before?

474
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,390
How can one clean the world without cleaning one's own house?

475
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,810
Did I say that?

476
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,180
Yes. That's why I can't leave.

477
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,810
And my friends are still inside.

478
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,850
Let's split up.

479
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,510
You go to Wuyue Sect and inform Head Huo.

480
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:49,940
Okay.

481
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,890
Don't worry.

482
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,430
Your friend will be safe, I promise.

483
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:56,140
There's no need for a sledgehammer to kill a chicken.

484
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,390
You just let me send a message.

485
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,930
Isn't it too easy for me?

486
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,890
Sending message is very important.

487
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,140
I want you to let Wuyue Sect know

488
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,350
there's a problem in Elixir Village.

489
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,810
But I don't want them to come and fight,

490
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,640
so as not to alert the enemy.

491
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,680
It's quite challenging.

492
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,060
So I trust you

493
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:19,730
with this mission.

494
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,600
Right. I'll go now. Don't worry.

495
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,420
I can do it.

496
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:24,910
Okay.

497
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,020
Till we meet again.

498
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,310
Till we meet again.

499
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,980
Bye.

Fork Man.

502
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:33,900
Yes?

503
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,520
When will we meet again?

504
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,810
We will meet again

505
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,520
when time comes.

506
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,420
Okay.

507
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,400
[Elixir Village]

508
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,230
Where is my sister-in-law?

509
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,700
[Whoever enters is an honored guest]

510
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,600
I don't know

511
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,020
where Xingchen is.

512
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,270
How is it going with the news?

513
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,350
The latest news has been posted.

514
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,140
Now the entire martial arts world knows that

515
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,730
Xingchen has returned to Wuyue Sect.

516
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,810
Even if she is outside,

517
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:54,930
she will be safer now.

518
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,930
