Now that I think about it,

524
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,450
it's probably because he failed to protect you

525
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,560
when he was young.

526
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,710
He kept blaming himself.

527
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,720
Since my brother came back,

528
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,700
he started to be afraid of the dark.

529
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,420
But that day at Elixir Village,

530
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,850
he still

531
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,330
mustered up his courage to walk into the darkness

532
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,950
to protect you.

533
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,300
Xingchen.

534
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,950
My brother is so obsessed with you.

535
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,400
I thought it was because of 
your childhood friendship.

536
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,650
But now I finally understand

537
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,930
that he wants to marry you.

538
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,920
Because that's the only way

539
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,100
he can keep you by his side forever.

540
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,410
Then he can protect you.

541
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,500
Only in this way

542
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,390
could he dare to face himself,

543
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,830

544
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,710

Thanks to Chen Jie.

558

He took Doctor Song back to Changqi Village.

559
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,740
He just wanted to lock Doctor Song up

and not let him to hurt anyone again.

suddenly changed his mind and cured us.

Because that medicine

647

grows at the peak of the snow mountain.

648

there are hurricanes and steep hills.

652

Then,

656
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,450
how did the previous people get them?

657
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,810

669
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,280
Grandma, don't keep me guessing.

670
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,750
If you want to practice it,

672
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:03,470

680
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,250
Let's think of another way.

681
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,660
You can't practice that.

682
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,370
But...

683
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,550

00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,310
do you know what it means?

686
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,260
Don't worry. I won't be impulsive.

687

00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:56,610
Yes.

698
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,140
I've thought it over.

699
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,000
Let's go.

700
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:15,640
Heavenly Scroll is right here.

701
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:30,200
Why didn't you persuade me?

702
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:33,490
Your grandma said you were independent.

703
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,650
You have your own ideas.

704
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:37,580
As long as you are sure you can 
bear the consequences of choosing,

705
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:39,390
why should we persuade you?

706
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:55,520
[Heavenly Scroll]

707
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,890
[Heavenly Scroll]

708
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,990
Heavenly Scroll is a masterpiece of martial arts.

709
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:03,490
If you master Heavenly Scroll successfully,

710
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,260
you'll be protected by the magic power.

711
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:08,440
It can dissolve the extremely cold 
ice crystals of Ice Herbs

712
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:09,730
without hurting yourself.

713
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:14,300
It's just that practicing Heavenly Scroll is easy to be demonic.

714
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,710
Over hundreds of years,

715
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:17,840
nearly no one made it.

716
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:21,100
The losers' meridians were all broken.

717
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,790
And they eventually died.

718
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,360
Auntie Zi.

719
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:37,260
This is my own choice.

720
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:39,240
Thank you.

721
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,350
Xingchen.

722
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,970
Does he know

723
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:51,600
the decision you have made?

724
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:06,850
[Heavenly Scroll]

725
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:13,670
Huo Xingchen.

726
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:26,660
♫Wow, baby♫

727
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,700
♫I can touch the clouds in fairy tales♫

728
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,490
♫When I reach out♫

729
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,400
♫A calm heart starts♫

730
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,870
♫Feeling excited and nervous♫
