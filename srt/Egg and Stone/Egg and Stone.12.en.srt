4
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:47,760
Hey.

5
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,270
Yes.

6
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,980
What are you afraid of?

7
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,020
Follow me.

8
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,680
Walk forward.

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,100
Come on.

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,550
One, two, one.

11
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,940
One, two, one.

12
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,320
One…

13
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,520
Brother!

14
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,520
Let go of me!

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,100
Don't worry, Buying.

16
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,390
I will get you out of here.

17
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,480
The Circle Man said

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,100
that we can't just stand by
and watch when someone's in need.

19
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,020
I must pull you up.

20
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,430
Brother!

21
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,350
Stop it.

22
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,430
I won't let you go.

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,430
Since you call me “brother”,

24
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,980
we are a family with different parents.

25
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,890
No.

26
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,560
Stop it.

27
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,310
I'll get you out of here.

28
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,850
Let him finish.

29
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,520
He might be trying to tell you
that the pit is not that deep. Just let go.

30
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,680
Are you okay?

31
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,500
Are you hurt?

32
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,050
We're fine.

33
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,140
Miss,

34
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,350
we're lost.

35
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,890
Where are we?

36
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,770
Just call me Yu.

37
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,980
Yu?

38
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,980
We finally got rid of them.

39
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,350
I'm exhausted.

40
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,350
But we're finally safe.

41
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,180
We've been out for so long.

42
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,680
Will they worry about us?

43
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,140
We should have told them in advance.

44
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,850
You only care about him.

45
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,100
You keep talking
about him on the way here.

46
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,980
You're exaggerating.

47
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,020
I'm not.

48
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,140
I know how many times you've mentioned him.

49
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,100
I've been counting.

50
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,810
You've been counting?

51
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,640
W-What are you doing?

52
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,250
Are you jealous?

53
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,030
Me?

54
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,680
Who am I jealous of?

55
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,730
That bearded guy?

56
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,850
Are you kidding me?

57
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,140
He's nothing compared to me.

58
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,600
Why would I be jealous of him?

59
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,600
Just say it if you're jealous.
Why are you so flustered?

60
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,430
I'm not.

61
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,770
Okay, you're not.

62
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,680
I was blind.

63
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,970
Alright. Let's get down to business.

64
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,850
Where's Yin Fengmian?

65
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,320
Hey.

66
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:53,250
Ah.

67
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,730
What are you waiting for?

68
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,020
I'll go get some more mushrooms.

69
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:56,740
Okay.

70
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,560
What are you looking at?

71
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,300
Hurry up. It's done.

72
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:12,540
Oh.

73
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,140
You're pretty good.

74
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,020
Do you really know how to cook?

75
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,350
Of course.

76
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,980
In order to survive
in the martial arts world,

77
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,560
you need to be a jack-of-all-trades.

78
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
It tastes good.

79
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,730
You're the first man

80
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,060
I've ever met who can cook.

81
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,390
Usually, the woman cooks for the man.

82
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,890
People like you

83
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,850
are extremely rare.

84
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,650
Well.

85
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,770
I'm not that good.

86
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,810
I made it for you.

87
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,060
I don't care about others.

88
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,640
Why?

89
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,060
Because you are my brother.

90
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,390
You know me.

91
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,850
You are my confidant.

92
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,820
Hey.

93
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,020
People used to say you should have

94
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,100
a female confidant or something.

95
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,390
In my opinion,

96
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,980
a woman will only affect my practice.

97
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,480
But you're different.

98
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,400
Here.

99
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,520
Let's snuggle.

100
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,480
Good buddies snuggle.

101
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,480
I think he's here to catch us.

102
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,140
The man in black said

103
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,060
that Hou Qiong
had just arrested Yin Fengmian.

104
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,730
And he's locked here.

105
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:38,980
Be careful.

106
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,430
There's a mutant.

107
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,140
Hide yourself. I'll go.

108
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,770
Jiang Buting.

109
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,100
What?

110
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,310
Do you trust me?

111
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,800
What?

112
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,560
Trust me.

113
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,420
Hey.

114
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,140
Be careful.

115
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,480
Where did you get the medicine bag?

116
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,560
Wasn't the man in black
chasing after us earlier?

117
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,890
I dragged it down from him

118
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,560
when we were running away.

119
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,230
Weren't there mutants
in Elixir Village before?

120
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,270
And Yin Fengci had also become a mutant.

121
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,600
So I thought there must be mutants here.

122
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,140
Well done.

123
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,230
Okay, you go in. I'll stay here.

124
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:06,930
Together.

125
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,060
What took you so long?

126
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,350
Two, four.

127
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,680
Why are there so many mutants?

128
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:26,930
Someone is coming.

129
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:40,850
Why is the door open?

130
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,350
It's okay. Let's go.

131
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,020
Okay. Let's go. Let's go

132
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,930
Hey, someone is here again.

133
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,350
Master.

134
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,560
Master!

135
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,520
Master, I'm Buting.

136
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,560
Let me check your pulse.

137
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,150
Hey.

138
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,510
This is not a place to talk.

139
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,390
Let's get out first.

140
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,430
Yin Fengmian, you stay at the back.

141
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,020
Your brother is counting on you to save him.

142
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,780
Okay.

143
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,680
Come on.

144
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,890
Come hit me!

145
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,390
Catch him!

146
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,390
Don't let him escape!

147
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,230
Master, Buying is waiting for us outside.

148
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,310
Let's go. Hurry up.

149
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,810
I haven't finished checking your pulse yet.

150
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:02,770
Let's go.

151
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,520
The monkey steals peaches.

152
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,350
The white crane flashes its wings.

153
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,720
Poke, poke, poke.

154
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,480
I poke, I poke, I poke.

155
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,850
I poke, I poke.

156
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,390
The black tiger rips a heart out.

157
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:28,850
Oops.

158
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,140
I missed.

159
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,470
My goodness.

160
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,020
He's the famous Doctor Song.

161
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,480
Does it hurt?

162
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,180
Are you okay?

163
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,600
Did I trick you?

164
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,980
You did.

165
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,270
Is it tickling?

166
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,480
Is it tickling? Is it tickling?

167
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,310
I got you! I got you!

168
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,060
Brat.

169
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,890
I'll write it down for you.

170
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:07,770
Buting.

171
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,980
What is your Master writing?

172
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,130
He's holding a grudge.

173
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,930
I just sprinkled tickling powder on him.

174
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,480
He's writing it down.

175
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,560
He will definitely
take revenge in a few days.

176
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,560
Oh, my good disciple.

177
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,890
Why did you come out

178
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,100
instead of staying in Wangyou Valley?

179
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,150
What?

180
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,640
Master,

181
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,670
please forgive me for being unfilial.

182
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,100
I found you so late.

183
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,100
I'm fine. I'm doing good.

184
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:41,600
By the way, Master,

185
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,520
what did they kidnap you for?

186
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,890
Did they kidnap you to produce the pills?

187
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,020
I saw the pills there.

188
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,310
You're right.

189
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,810
Oh, I was locked in the dark,

190
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,930
damp room,

191
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,980
and I had been making pills day and night.

192
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,810
Oh, my weary old bones

193
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,850
were almost broken.

194
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,020
I'm sorry.

195
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,560
Are you scared?

196
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,520
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

197
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,350
I'll pet your hair
so that you won't be scared.

198
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,270
Master.

199
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:18,770
Xingchen.

200
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,730
Why are you here?

201
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,310
Jiang and I were worried about your safety.

202
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,050
So we came to have a look.

203
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:25,850
Doctor,

204
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:27,930
I beg you.

205
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,300
Please save Jie.

206
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,310
Jie?

207
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,520
Doctor, please save my brother, Fengci.

208
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,060
He is a good boy.

209
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:41,680
Please, Doctor.

210
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,140
Buting.

211
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,480
Yes.

212
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,430
What's going on?

213
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:51,430
Master.

214
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,680
It's a long story.

215
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,180
Let me tell you slowly.

216
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,270
Report!

217
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,140
The back-mountain formation
has been destroyed.

218
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,060
The people from Wuyue Sect are here.

219
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,270
Doctor Song was also saved.

220
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:04,900
Alright.

221
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,520
I heard you.

222
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,060
Let's activate
the closed-mountain formation.

223
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:10,790
Yes.

224
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,810
That's what happened.

225
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,850
I was already a mutant at that time.

226
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,560
And after I took the pill that Buting…

227
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,980
that you gave Buting,

228
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:22,730
I turned normal again.

229
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,810
Is my explanation

230
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,180
not clear enough?

231
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,890
That's strange.

232
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,180
How could that little red pill from Buting

233
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,560
cure the mutant's poison?

234
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,100
Her pulse is stable and strong.

235
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,640
She's indeed recovered.

236
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,020
Master, is there

237
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,310
anything wrong?

238
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,680
Don't you care about me?
Why won't you admit it?

239
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,310
This girl was poisoned by the mutant

240
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,060
and took the little red pill
I gave Buting at the same time.

241
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,520
Normal people
would either die or get injured.

242
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,060
This girl ate it and nothing happened.

243
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,230
Does she have a special physique?

244
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:41,890
That won't do.

245
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,230
I have to study it.

246
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,640
Master, what happened?

247
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,270
It's really weird. It's weird.

248
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,100
Girl,

249
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,230
did you turn normal

250
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,270
after taking the red pill?

251
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,180
Yes.

252
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,770
Something's wrong.

253
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,890
You have to follow pharmacology
for medication intake.

254
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,270
That pill wasn't made

255
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,980
to be an antidote.

256
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,390
It was made
to improve Futing's weak body.

257
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,230
It was made
to improve Futing's weak body.

258
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,090
This...

259
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,270
This...

260
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,020
W-What's going on?

261
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,430
What's going on?

262
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,680
I also find it strange.

263
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,310
I saw the handbook at Elixir Village.

264
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,430
It said the mutants are irreversible.

265
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,520
They are incurable.

266
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,810
But I was cured after taking that red pill.

267
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,180
And I'm fine now.

268
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,560
Why?

269
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,230
Girl.

270
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:42,510
Yes.

271
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,640
Maybe the medicine
is not thoroughly studied yet.

272
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,680
Would you like me to study it?

273
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,350
Sure.

274
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,890
How are you going to study?

275
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,800
Let me touch your bone.

276
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,640
What are you doing?

277
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,140
What are you doing?
Why do you want to touch my bone?

278
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,270
M-Master!

279
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,100
Bone, bone.

280
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,810
Touch my bone?

281
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,230
You're no different from the mutants!

282
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,310
Master! Master!

283
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,230
Master.

284
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,180
I took the pill too.

285
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:09,930
Study me instead.

286
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,020
You've never become a mutant.

287
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,390
Only this girl can help with my study.

288
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,530
I...

289
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,930
Someone from Wuyue Sect is here.

290
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,450
Dad.

291
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,520
Daughter.

292
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,350
Mu Yaoguang.

293
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,480
There's so many people.

294
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,230
Brother,

295
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:41,670
I want to go to the bathroom.

296
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,180
Let's go. I'll cover you.

297
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,350
Let's investigate.

298
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:51,640
Okay.

299
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,560
Xingchen!

300
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,830
Dad!

301
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,060
Why are you here?

302
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,350
Xingchen.

303
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,180
Someone from Yinling Valley sent me a letter.

304
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,600
So I rushed here.

305
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,810
Let me see. Let me have a look.

306
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:24,810
Don't.

307
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,080
Teeth.

308
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,640
I'll give you the bone later.

309
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,600
Let's go.

310
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,730
Dad.

311
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:35,880
I tell you what.

312
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,560
After we entered Yinling Valley,

313
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,060
there were men in black everywhere.

314
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,310
Fortunately,

315
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,100
we saved Doctor Song.

316
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,640
Isn't your daughter amazing?

317
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,080
What?

318
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,230
Nonsense.

319
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,730
Do you know

320
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,140
that you were risking your life?

321
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,560
And that Jiang Buing.

322
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,630
You two have got a lot of nerve!

323
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,180
There are dangers
everywhere in Yinling Valley.

324
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,430
Have you ever thought
about

325
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,560
what to do
when you were in danger before entering?

326
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,430
Don't be angry.

327
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,730
How can I not be angry?

328
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,270
Calm down.

329
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,810
Don't blame him.

330
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,060
It's all my fault.

331
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,100
I insisted to go in.

332
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,850
It had nothing to do with him.

333
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,060
But, Dad,

334
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,230
I'm fine now.

335
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,390
I'm not hurt at all.

336
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,600
I'm all good, right?

337
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:25,050
You should be proud of your daughter.

338
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,430
Xingchen,

339
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,520
I don't want you to do anything big.

340
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,020
I just want you to be safe.

341
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,540
Okay?

342
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,600
Dad, I understand.

343
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,560
But since the day you allowed me

344
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,100
to leave Wuyue Sect,

345
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,730
you should've been mentally prepared

346
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,810
that I might be in danger.

347
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,390
Besides,

348
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,180
I'm the future Head of Wuyue Sect.

349
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,640
It was nothing.

350
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,230
Yes.

351
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,350
My Xingchen is the best.

352
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,020
My Xingchen is the best.

353
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,230
Dad, don't worry.

354
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,020
Don't worry.

355
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:07,980
Don't worry.

356
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,810
You guys, go inside and search!

357
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,730
I thought you were going to fight.

358
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,310
Thank you

359
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,260
just now

360
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,140
for defending me in front of the Head.

361
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,430
No need to thank me.

362
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,060
This is what I should do.

363
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,180
Since ancient times,

364
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,560
the mother-in-law
and daughter-in-law relationship

365
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,560
has always been a big problem.

366
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:32,980
Of course, I have to defend you.

367
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,180
Mother…

368
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,090
Yes?

369
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,740
I'm serious.

370
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:39,990
Stop joking.

371
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,180
Isn't this a serious matter?

372
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,430
I wasn't kidding.

373
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,430
Listen.

374
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,980
After you're married into my family,

375
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:49,310
I'll never let you suffer.

376
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,520
Alright, let's get down to business.

377
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,480
If it were in the past,

378
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,430
I would have quarreled with my Dad.

379
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,930
Then why is it different now?

380
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,810
Because I've grown up.

381
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,140
So don't look at me

382
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,680
the way you used to.

383
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,850
You see, along the way,

384
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,560
I've grown a lot.

385
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,600
I'm no longer the caged,
spoiled canary of Wuyue Sect.

386
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,640
I believe

387
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,560
that today's me

388
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,350
must be better than yesterday's me.

389
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,730
And tomorrow's me

390
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,270
will be better than today's me.

391
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,230
I will let you,

392
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:32,390
my dad,

393
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:33,560
and Wuyue Sect...

394
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,060
No.

395
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,310
I'll let the whole martial arts world knows

396
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,270
that one day,

397
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,640
I will fly up the branches

398
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:39,730
and become

399
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,100
an eagle.

400
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,980
An eagle?

401
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,850
Do you trust me?

402
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,480
I...

403
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:51,980
Xingchen.

404
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,350
I need to talk to you.

405
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,820
Ah?

406
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,020
Then I'll go there and help.

407
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:01,850
Okay.

408
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,430
I trust you.

409
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,980
Everyone, listen to my order.

410
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,020
Surround Yinling Valley

411
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,850
and destroy the closed-mountain formation!

412
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,100
Xingchen.

413
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,350
Did Yaoguang follow you all the way?

414
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:17,890
Yes.

415
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:20,680
Do you know her?

416
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,930
She's my sister.

417
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,970
S-She's your sister?

418
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,560
Yes.

419
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,270
I saw her just now.

420
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,060
Maybe she was afraid of being scolded by me,

421
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,060
so she hid away.

422
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,170
Also,

423
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,430
don't take such a risk next time.

424
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,640
Hey, I'm going to be the Head in the future.

425
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,480
Okay.

426
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,730
Next time,

427
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:45,890
I'll go with you.

428
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,160
What?

429
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,310
No need.

430
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:49,890
It's not dangerous.

431
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:51,610
Okay.

432
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,100
You must have had a hard journey.

433
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:56,890
It's not that bad.

434
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,230
Uncle,

435
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,560
the road in front
of the Yinling Valley's entrance is too broad.

436
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,600
The formation is too difficult to solve.

437
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,430
I'm afraid it's hard to break it.

438
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,480
Ask everyone to stay alert.

439
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:10,940
Okay.

440
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,270
We have no choice

441
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:14,770
but to do it for Fengci.

442
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,430
Senior Huo.

443
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,430
Greetings, Head. I'm Yin Fengmian.

444
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,890
Get up.

445
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,480
You're the one who sent the secret letter.

446
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,480
You informed us about the great change

447
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,640
in Yinling Valley.

448
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:26,930
You've contributed a lot.

449
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,060
You don't have to bow like this.

450
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,270
Head,

451
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,020
I have a request.

452
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,350
I beg you

453
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,100
to spare me and my brother, Yin Fengci,

454
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,060
when you liquidate
the sin of Yinling Valley later.

455
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,840
All these years,

456
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,850
we have never done anything evil,

457
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,060
and have never colluded with those people.

458
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,930
Get up, child.

459
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,100
If what you said is true,

460
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,310
you and your brother, Yin Fengci,

461
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,640
will not be punished.

462
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,350
Don't worry.

463
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,020
Thank you, Head.

464
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,190
Alright.

465
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:55,810
Head,

466
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,590
I can solve the formation

467
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:58,560
at Yinling Valley's entrance.

468
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:07,880
Qian and Kun.

469
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,350
Direct the North and South.

470
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,770
Kan and Li.

471
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,430
Direct the East and West.

472
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,640
So the eye of the formation
is actually the Eight Trigrams.

473
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,680
Follow the orders of the South and North,
Heaven and Earth.

474
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,640
He's just solving
the Eight-Trigrams Formation.

475
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,680
Isn't this a bit too much?

476
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,390
Wow.

477
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:50,730
Head Huo,

478
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,020
stand in the Li position.

479
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,390
Brother Buting.

480
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:57,770
Stand on Kan.

481
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:00,770
Uncle Fu.

482
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,850
Two circles to the left of Qian.

483
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:03,810
Stand on Qian.

484
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,430
Brother Huo.

485
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,390
One circle to the right of Qian.

486
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:09,480
Stand on Dui.

487
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,230
The formation has been solved.

488
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:31,980
Everyone,

489
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,980
we'll split up after we go in.

490
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,350
Be careful.

491
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,010
Yes.

492
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,230
Yo.

493
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,060
Young Master is back.

494
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,770
And you bring some guests along.

495
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,770
Why didn't you inform me about the guests?

496
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:17,930
Everyone,

497
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,430
since our Young Master
is not entertaining you well,

498
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,480
let me, his senior,

499
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,730
entertain you in his place.

500
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,730
Head Huo.

501
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,770
You go first.

502
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,850
Leave it to me.

503
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,520
There are many traps here.

504
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,810
You must be careful.

505
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,370
Okay.

506
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,340
Uncle Fu, stay and help.

507
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,430
The rest of you, come with me.

508
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,890
Your opponent is me.

509
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:27,890
Go help Head Huo.

510
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,100
Leave it to me.

511
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,060
Young Master.

512
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,520
You are still so confident.

513
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,680
Hou Qiong.

514
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,480
In the end, I still have to face you.

515
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,100
Since I can't run away from you,

516
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,060
let's settle
the old scores and the new ones together.

517
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,980
Is that so?

518
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,550
What are these?

519
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,140
Xingchen, be careful.

520
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,680
Why are there so many medicines?

521
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,600
Here too.

522
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,730
Here too.

523
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,730
These pills

524
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,270
are exactly the same as
the one Yin Fengmian brought out.

525
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,980
Why does Yinling Valley

526
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,730
need so many medicines?

527
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,180
Stay still.

528
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,890
Just ask them, and we'll know.

529
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,140
So these pills

530
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,640
were made by the Yinling Valley's owner

531
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,270
to control these men in black.

532
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,770
I have to tell my Dad about this.

533
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,230
Head Huo has been in the martial arts world
for many years.

534
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,640
He won't easily fall for it.

535
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:26,950
Okay.

536
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:27,770
Brother,

537
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,310
leave with your buddy first

538
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,350
and keep her safe.

539
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,480
Okay.

540
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:32,890
Go. I'll stay here.

541
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:33,890
Okay.

542
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,310
Xingchen.

543
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,020
Go.

544
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,390
Hurry.

545
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,890
Yin Fengmian.

546
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,230
You and I, we've been fellow disciples

547
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,600
since we were kids…

548
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,640
But no matter how hard I try,

549
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,770
I'm never as good as you.

550
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:05,890
Why?

551
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,770
I can't accept it.

552
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,040
I...

553
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,850
I was wondering who it was.

554
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,810
It's you, Head Huo.

555
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,480
Welcome. Please forgive me

556
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,230
for my bad hospitality.

557
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,930
Yinling Valley is suspected to be involved
in the mutants' case.

558
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,930
As the head of Wuyue Sect,

559
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,020
it's my duty to find out the truth

560
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,810
and bring peace
to the martial arts world again.

561
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,140
No matter how unhappy you are,

562
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,100
you shouldn't make such a fuss

563
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,430
to attack us.

564
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,410
What?

565
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,310
Please forgive us

566
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,270
if you find anything offensive.

567
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,060
Listen to me.

568
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,640
Try not to kill them.

569
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,480
Instead, try to control them.

570
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:54,580
Yes.

571
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,680
I didn't expect the Head of the Wuyue Sect

572
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,730
to treat the mutants equally,

573
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,230
even though they're not human.

574
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,810
Why are you so nice to them?

575
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:08,350
Aren't you afraid
that the mutants will hurt you?

576
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,640
What a coward.

577
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,680
Don't hide behind if you dare.

578
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,100
Xingchen.

579
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,470
You have no right to criticize my Dad.

580
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,660
Xingchen!

581
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,390
Xingxing!

582
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,230
Save Xingchen!

583
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,930
Buting.

584
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,020
Jiang Buting!

585
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,170
Dad!

586
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,520
Jiang Buting.

587
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:21,680
Xingchen!

588
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:23,260
There.

589
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,360
Dad!

590
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:27,980
Jiang Buting!

591
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:29,850
Help!

592
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:30,430
Xingxing!

593
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,560
Save Xingchen!

594
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:31,960
Hurry!

595
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,270
Help!

596
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,810
-Xingxing. Xingxing! -Xingchen!

597
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,060
Dad!

598
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,890
Xingchen!

599
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,850
Xingxing.

600
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,640
Buting, smashes it harder!

601
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,520
Jiang Buting!

602
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,520
Help!

603
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,100
Xingxing.

604
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,680
Stop wasting your energy.

605
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,430
You can't open it.

606
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,560
Even if you open it,

607
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,480
it's too late.

608
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,560
No one who fell down

609
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:03,060
has ever come out alive.

610
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:05,820
Go!

611
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,100
Xingxing.

612
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,640
I'll make you my fodder!

613
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:48,970
Xingxing.

614
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,430
You've eaten my effort for decades.

615
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:31,230
It's a poison pill formed by
the internal forces of thousands of heroes.

616
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:37,850
Xingxing.

617
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:43,730
Don't move!

618
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:46,520
Xingxing.

619
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,180
How are you?

620
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,230
Xingxing.

621
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:53,390
Xingxing.

622
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:55,890
Xingxing.

623
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:56,890
Xingxing.

624
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,060
Xingxing.

625
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,140
Xingxing!

626
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,300
Xingxing!

627
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,020
♫Wow, baby♫

628
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,030
♫I can touch the clouds in fairy tales♫

629
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,840

630
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,870
