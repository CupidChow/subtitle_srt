Brother.

6
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,430
Why did you let her go?

7
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,910
Should I kidnap her?

8
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,930
You should try to persuade her.

9
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,440
A young miss like her has never experienced

10
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,039
hardships of the martial arts world.

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,250
It's useless to persuade her.

12
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,270
How about let her

13
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,870
feel the danger of the martial arts world?

14
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:26,310

We've checked all the four city gates.

18
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,670
There's no record of Xingchen leaving the city.

19
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,200
It's inappropriate for us to report that

20
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,979
Young Miss has ran away from the wedding.

21
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,140
We could only search secretly.

22
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,780
But there's no sign of Xingchen anywhere.

23
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,890

24

Do you already know where Xingchen is?

Not yet.

Don't worry.

Although she was inexperienced,

37
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,120
she was always asking us about

38
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,300
interesting things in the martial arts world.

39
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,180
With her intelligence,

40
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,050
I think

41
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,329

Yes, Young Hero. Don't be fooled by her.

In that case,

How about you

177
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,190
lend me some money?

178
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,220
Well.

179
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,020
It's not about money.

180
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,380
I heard

181
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,520
the city was not peaceful recently.

182
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,070
It's very dangerous.

Do you know

184
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,620
there's a case

185
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,160
called Heroes Missing Case?

186
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,470

187
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:23,990
Heroes Missing Case?

188
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,480
Yes.

189
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:25,990
Recently,

190
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,840
there's a mysterious force

191
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,980
covering the whole city

192
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,130

196
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,580
How dare them!

197
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,030
How dare them kidnap someone in my territory?

198
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,560
How dare them

199

ignore me,

200
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
the prospective head of Wuyue Sect?

201
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,320
Young Miss.

202
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,190
I just wanted to describe

203
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,230
the danger of the martial arts world.

204
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,330
Don't stray from the point.

205
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,650
To come early is not

206
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,390
as good as to come in time.

207
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,650
I have a clear goal

208
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,640
to go into the martial arts world.

209
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,320
That is to find the missing heroes

210
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,920
and catch the real criminals.

211
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,090
No need.

Fork Man said

213
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,540
the more capable you were,

214
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,730
the more responsible you should be.

215
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,550
Since I'm so capable,

216
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,340
I should take such a big responsibility.

217
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,440
Yes.

218
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:21,660

So I should take a big responsibility.

222

At this time,

00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,270

00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,080
What are you looking at?

352
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,700
A dragon.

353
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,680
There's a dragon.

354
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,250
Where is the dragon?

355
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:56,720
I'm looking at the man in black.

356
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,250
The man in black? Where?

357
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,190
Huo Xingchen could say those words.

358
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:07,640
How could the man in black not come?

359
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,630
Fine.

360
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,090
Can't we beat him?

361
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,890
The men in black will come for Huo Xingchen.

362
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,160
She will be the one to suffer.

363
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,910
I'll keep an eye on the gate tonight

364
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,170
in case something happens to her.

365
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,390
Sweet boy.

366
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,970
Get lost.

367
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,570
Okay.

368
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,010
I dare not get sleepy.

369
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,170
Are you walking a horse?

370
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:08,580
Hello.

371
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,460
Can you change the song?

372
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,500
No hero will come out with this song.

373
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,310
Oh no! Someone is kidnapped!

374
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,190
Huo Xingchen?

375
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:36,970
Huo Xingchen!

376
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,770
Tell me, who has been kidnapped?

377
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,230
I really don't know.

378
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,340
Stop asking.

379
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,980
Then tell me something you know.

380
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,950
I saw

381
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,520
some men in black

382
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,400
carried two heroes in Room 2 of the Tian

383
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,500
from here

384
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,890
and then jumped onto the wall.

385
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,590
I got it wrong.

386

I live in Room 1 of the Tian.

388
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,040
He went to catch the people in Room 2.

389
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,290
Do you think the man in black

390
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,880
couldn't tell the number?

391
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,490
Oh.

393
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,530
Where did you get the confidence?

394
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:15,480
Hey.

395
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,750
I don't know why the guy

396
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,270
often plays the erhu at midnight

397
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,240
and sleeps in the daytime.

398
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,420
Some person may seem lazy.

399
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,320
But in fact, he uses his laziness

400
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:25,820
to cover his fear.

401
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,240
Hey.

402
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,780
In fact,

403
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,900
In fact, I'm protecting you.

404

Yes. Yes.

415

If you're right, they will kidnap you.

416
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,640
You have to hide.

417
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,640

Why did you tut?

421
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,350
I tutted to show my attitude.

422
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,670
Just because of what I said during the day,

423
