1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,070
Sir,

3
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,820
Let me put your luggage on the boat.

4
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,030
To be honest,

5
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,110
actually,

6
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,030
I tend to get seasick.

7
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,530
Actually, I'm feeling a little seasick too.

8
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,150
I'll take the mountain road with you.

9
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,030
This isn't the only way to Mei Town.

10
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,280
Since you were little,

11
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,820
I've never heard you get seasick.

12
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:20,740
Fine.

13
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,150
Let's split up.

14
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,780
We'll meet at the remote palace.

15
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,820
Uncle Yuwen has written me back.

16
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,320
You mean our father's brother?

17
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:29,990
Wait a minute

18
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,440
What's your father's last name?

19
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,610
Needless to say,

20
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,440
of course, our father's surname is Jiang.

21
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,440
Why is your uncle's last name Yuwen then?

22
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:41,570
Buying,

23
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,190
why don't we have the last name Yuwen?

24
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,150
It sounds great.

25
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,400
Yeah.

26
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,650
Yuwen Buting.

27
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,240
Yuwen Buying.

28
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,610
Yuwen Buying.

29
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,990
Yuwen Buting.

30
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,650
It sounds so beautiful.

31
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,440
-Ah! -Ah! -Ah!

32
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,110
Sir,

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,490
Is Shang Huaiyu from Nanshan on the list?

34
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:06,940
Shang Huaiyu?

35
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,150
I've waited for four batches,

36
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,650
but I haven't found my husband

37
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,820
The list of healers and list of patients

38
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,400
undergoing treatment don't contain his name.

39
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,940
Impossible.

40
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,280
I sent him here myself.

41
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,940
How could his name not be on the list?

42
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,070
Let me see.

43
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,360
Madam, you can't do this.

44
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:22,780
Madam.

45
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,780
Physician Song is here.

46
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,240
-Madam -Let me see.

47
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,400
Madam! Madam!

48
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,240
Divine Physician,

49
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,240
I've checked every outsider who visited

50
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,150
in great detail.

51
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,030
They haven't stopped taking medicine.

52
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,570
As long as they can be cured,

53
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,240
they will be released successively.

54
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,940
Everyone,

55
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,070
don't be anxious.

56
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,860
As long as the medicine is supplied in time,

57
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,070
give me some time,

58
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,360
and I will

59
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,280
definitely formulate

60
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,860
different medicines.

61
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,400
Alright?

62
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,570
We shall rest assured.

63
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,900
We'll trust the Divine Physician and wait.

64
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,400
We can't disappoint him any further

65
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,780
Yes.

66
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,070
The Divine Physician is such a kind soul.

67
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,740
Let's go.

68
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,940
Let's not impose on the Divine Physician.

69
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,530
That's right.

70
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:06,940
Let's go.

71
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,070
W-What are you doing?

72
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,360
There should be blisters on your feet.

73
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,150
They'll get bigger if you don't fix them.

74
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,990
It will affect your walking.

75
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,440
We still have a long way to go.

76
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,240
Our schedule can't be delayed.

77
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,070
Leave me alone. I'm fine.

78
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,280
How can I leave you alone?

79
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
How can you be fine?

80
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,570
Buddy,

81
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,440
if you don't poke your blisters,

82
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,490
your feet will hurt badly.

83
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,190
Rest assured,

84
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,320
I'm very experienced.

85
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,490
I can fix it for you quickly.

86
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,650
I'm really fine.

87
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,150
You can't move, can you?

88
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,320
Buddy,

89
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,940
you're a man but why are your feet

90
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,400
smaller than my hands?

91
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,740
No wonder you keep hiding them from me

92
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,570
and you wouldn't let me see them.

93
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,320
But don't worry, it'll be fine.

94
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,860
I won't laugh at you.

95
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,570
Shameless!

96
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,280
What's wrong, buddy?

97
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,440
Why are you scolding me? I'm trying to help.

98
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,780
Stay away from me in the future.

99
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,400
You pervert!

100
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,240
Pervert?

101
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,030
What a groundless accusation!

102
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,240
We're finally ashore.

103
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,610
Uncle Yuwen's house is just right ahead.

104
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,150
Huo Xingchen,

105
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,940
hand over the Magic Elixir

106
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:37,570
and I'll spare your life.

107
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,110
Again?

108
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,490
X,

109
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,860
you've improved a lot.

110
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,150
Strike according to my instructions.

111
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,110
You can totally beat him.

112
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,490
Are you really not going to help me?

113
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,650
Trust yourself.

114
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,190
You can do it.

115
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,280
Give me your belt.

116
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,110
It's quite useful.

117
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:17,690
X,

118
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
I'll drop you off here.

119
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,360
Forkman.

120
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,400
Protect yourself.

121
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,280
I hope the next time I see you,

122
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,610
you won't be in such a disheveled state.

123
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,150
Forkman.

124
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,360
Wait.

125
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,280
I'm fine.

126
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,240
Forkman, um,

127
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,780
Mu!

128
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,400
Mu

129
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,030
Why are you here?

130
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,780
You're still wearing

131
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,150
Forkman's clothes.

132
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,530
Are you surprised

133
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,820
to see me here?

134
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,110
Have you ever thought

135
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:31,820
why

136
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,110
I'm in Forkman's clothes?

137
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,150
Oh.

138
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,030
I know.

139
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,780
You must be carrying out some

140
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,530
secret mission.

141
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,860
So you have to pretend to be Forkman.

142
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,990
You know I admire him,

143
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,150
and I want to see him.

144
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,820
However, I never got the chance to see him,

145
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,240
so you dressed like Forkman

146
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,440
to make me happy, right?

147
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,690
No.

148
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,900
Or

149
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,820
do you admire him?

150
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,190
Yes, I admire him as much as you do.

151
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,030
You have great taste.

152
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:17,740
No.

153
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,190
Well,

154
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,280
has it ever crossed your mind

155
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,610
that I'm him?

156
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:39,570
No.

157
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,690
You two are worlds apart.

158
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,400
How so?

159
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,150
You two are different in every aspect.

160
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,610
In this case, I'm sorry.

161
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,110
I have to let you down.

162
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,280
I'm indeed Forkman.

163
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,110
This fish pendant.

164
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,780
Yes.

165
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,190
This is for you.

166
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,780
Thank you for saving me just now.

167
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,150
No, I can't take it.

168
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,030
No, please accept it.

169
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,320
If we meet again,

170
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,280
and you don't remember me,

171
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,190
we can reconcile with this fish pendant.

172
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,150
That little girl

173
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,740
is you.

174
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:43,690
Xingchen

175
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,360
You...

176
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,860
Are you really Forkman?

177
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,400
Why didn't you tell me?

178
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,190
You know I've been looking for him.

179
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,240
Actually, I hinted to you.

180
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,440
But at that time,

181
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,530
you really loathed me.

182
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,610
When did you hint to me?

183
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,990
On the day of the succession ceremony,

184
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,820
I was wearing

185
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,820
this fish pendant.

186
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:17,150
-Great! -Excellent! -Hooray!

187
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,030
Ugh, it's all my fault.

188
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,900
I didn't even notice that day.

189
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:23,900
No.

190
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,900
When you saved me seven years ago,

191
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,320
why did you hide your face?

192
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,070
At that time, my father didn't allow me

193
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,940
to use my martial arts freely at will.

194
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,900
I was afraid he would find out.

195
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,280
But you could have told me.

196
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,440
I wouldn't have told anyone.

197
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,650
I didn't dare to.

198
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,360
Well, you admire Forkman so much.

199
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,990
What if you get disappointed

200
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
after learning of my identity?

201
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,240
Why would I be disappointed?

202
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,570
I just find it strange.

203
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,320
That's worse.

204
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,820
What's strange?

205
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,990
Forkman told me

206
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,820
I could rely on myself.

207
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,570
He said that women can travel the world too.

208
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,440
But you keep asking me to stay at Wuyue Sect

209
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,320
and you said you want to take care of me.

210
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,320
so that I won't get hurt.

211
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,530
Xingchen,

212
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,360
at that time,

213
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,570
I treated you as a friend.

214
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,740
I thought I could uphold justice with you

215
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,490
But later I thought

216
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,610
you would become my wife.

217
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,400
A friend is different from a wife.

218
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,900
I hope my wife

219
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,190
will never experience any hardships.

220
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,740
Well,

221
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,820
It's all Jiang Buting's fault.

222
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,030
He intercepted my letter.

223
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,280
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

224
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:32,650
No.

225
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,150
Actually, I should be the one apologizing.

226
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,780
In the past, I didn't think about

227
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,150
what you really needed.

228
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,070
For my wilful behavior in the past,

229
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,440
I'd like to apologize to you.

230
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,860
No, no, no.

231
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,900
I-I should apologize.

232
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,030
When we were kids, we agreed

233
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,280
to travel the world together.

234
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,990
But because of a misunderstanding,

235
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,190
I stood you up

236
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,150
and excluded you.

237
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,990
I'm sorry.

238
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,610
No.

239
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,070
Huo Xingchen, I'm sorry.

240
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,030
Mu, I'm sorry.

241
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
I'm even more sorry.

242
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,360
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,110
Huo Xingchen!

244
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:18,820
Xingchen,

245
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,570
from now on,

246
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,780
I'll be exclusively yours

247
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,610
and I will roam the world with you.

248
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,110
What do you say?

249
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,440
No.

250
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,570
Why?

251
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,030
Forkman belongs to the world at large.

252
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,070
In everyone's eyes,

253
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,240
Forkman represents faith that helps the weak

254
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,440
and the last glimmer of hope in despair.

255
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,900
You wanting to be exclusively mine

256
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,780
makes me touched, of course.

257
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,490
But I can't be so selfish.

258
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,360
If this is what you want,

259
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,440
I'll do just that.

260
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,650
No, this is just my personal opinion.

261
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,150
I can't change your mind.

262
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,610
Got it.

263
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,400
For everything that happened today,

264
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,570
keep it a secret for me.

265
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,240
Don't worry.

266
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,400
I won't tell anyone.

267
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,820
Not even Jiang Buting

268
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,360
will hear of this.

269
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,820
Well then, this is

270
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,440
our secret.

271
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,070
X, where are you?

272
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,150
X.

273
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:27,940
See you later.

274
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,780
Huo Xingchen!

275
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,940
Huo Xingchen, where are you?

276
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,110
Huo Xingchen!

277
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,190
Huo Xingchen!

278
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,940
Huo Xingchen, where are you?

279
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,860
Huo Xingchen!

280
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,990
Where are you, Huo Xingchen?

281
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,320
Huo Xingchen!

282
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,070
Huo Xingchen!

283
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,240
Jiang Buting!

284
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,650
Why are you so happy?

285
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,490
You scared me to death!

286
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,650
What if they are out to harm you?

287
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:39,940
Well,

288
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,780
you have no idea

289
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,530
how superb my martial arts skills are now,

290
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,280
right?

291
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,990
What if you're in danger?

292
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,820
It's always better to be careful.

293
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,690
Alright, I know you're worried about me.

294
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,030
Don't be angry, okay?

295
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,650
I'm not angry.

296
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,320
I was just worried about you.

297
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,860
Okay, fine, I promise

298
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,940
I won't do it again.

299
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,280
Look, what's this?

300
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,110
Did you catch that Forkman imposter?

301
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,240
He wasn't an imposter.

302
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,320
I've tested him. He's the real deal.

303
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,400
Tested?

304
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,320
How?

305
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,150
Of course,

306
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,490
I promised him not to tell you.

307
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,400
Huo Xingchen,

308
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,490
don't...

309
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,190
Don't defend the person who fooled you.

310
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,610
He can't be the real Forkman.

311
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,780
Why do you say he's an imposter then?

312
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,990
Because he is lecherous.

313
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,280
He... He held your waist.

314
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,360
Come on!

315
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,110
He was saving me.

316
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,650
He's not a pervert, alright?

317
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,530
Why are you still defending him?

318
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,070
He's totally a pervert!

319
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,150
He's also an imposter!

320
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,360
No.

321
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,610
Enough.

322
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,440
understand

323
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,860
At the mention of Forkman,

324
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:01,990
you tend to get

325
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,190
really jealous.

326
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,820
You shouldn't attack him personally, right?

327
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,690
It's not good to do that.

328
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,030
I'm jealous?

329
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
I'm attacking him personally?

330
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,820
Huo Xingchen, stop being brainless.

331
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,780
Why do I find that

332
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,940
whenever it comes to Forkman,

333
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,900
you'll lose your rationality?

334
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,070
I'm brainless?

335
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,990
You said I was brainless?

336
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,650
Why are you scolding me and Forkman?

337
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,320
Jiang Buting, that's enough!

338
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,190
What's wrong?

339
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,530
I'm telling the truth.

340
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,240
When I first met you,

341
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,240
you've been talking about finding Forkman.

342
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,400
You're always talking about Forkman, saying

343
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,070
you spent money on him and his merchandise.

344
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,360
You said that you remember clearly

345
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,400
every single word of his.

346
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,490
Now you're arguing with me over an imposter.

347
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,570
Jiang Buting,

348

are you trying to get back at me?

349
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,490
Since the day we met,

350
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,440
I've been like this.

351
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,940
What's the point of saying this now?

352
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,690
I'm boring, indeed.

353
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,070
I'm not as interesting as your Forkman.

354

X.

355

Don't be angry.

356
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:27,319
I'll apologize.

357
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,360
I'm sorry.

358
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,320
X.

359
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,360
The next time you're angry,

360
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,780
you don't have to look back,

361
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,990
because

362
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,490
I will always be waiting in front of you.

363

364

Fine.

368
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,230
I misunderstood you.

Hang in there.

385

We'll arrive at
my uncle's Xiaoyao Palace soon.

386
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,100
Xiaoyao Palace?

387
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,680
What a grand name!

388
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,310
What's its story?

389
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,470
Back then,

390
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,230
when my uncle left Wangyou Valley,

391
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,140
he was determined to be

392
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,640
the First Hero in the martial arts world.

393
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,930
He asked someone to make a sharp sword

394
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,020
and dueled with the First Hero.

395
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,640
On that day,

396
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,230
lightning flashed

397
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
and swords fought.

398
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,590
What a danger!

399
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,560
At that moment,

400
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,560
in a flash,

401
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,520
that hero suddenly—

402
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,390
Fell?

403
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:41,680
Said—

404
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,560
Please spare my life.

405
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,600
He said,

406
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,980
"What a sharp sword!"

407
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,020
"Where did you buy it?"

408
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,730
Just like this,

409
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,930
my uncle earned the first money

410
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,180
with that sword

411
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,230
and became rich.

412
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,570

413
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:00,640

Hey.

Don't change your attitude towards me

419
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,730
because I'm rich.

420

523
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:41,680
just nine people.

524
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,060
The Seventh Master went hunting.

525
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,770
He will come back at night.

526
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,100
Uncle,

527
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,390
has his Soul-separating Disease
been treated?

528
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,340
This disease

529
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,680
can't be cured easily.

530
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,100
I, the Fourth Master, know it best.

531
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,310
You need to add Mongolian milkvetch root to
Sini Decoction.

532
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,180
Sijunzi Decoction is used for
warming and nourishing energy.

533
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,730
Drgonsbones and common oyster shells
can calm the nerves

534
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,810
and converge spirit.

535
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,680
Wulin Powder warms yang for diuresis.

536
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,100
Rhizoma atractylodis and Agastache rugosa
can resolve dampness and exorcise evils.

537
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,770
With all these herbs
that can ward off evil spirits,

538
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:14,640
the d-d-disease

539
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,390
can be cured.

540
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,480
How is the effect?

541
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,270
It's very good.

542
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,770
It cured us.

543
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,520
The Fourth Master is amazing.

544
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,980
He treated the three of us.

545
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,140
And the seven of us

546
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,600
came back together.

547
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,520
That's good.

548
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,810
I'm happy that three brothers work with me

549
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,100
every day.

550
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:45,480
You are right!

551
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,060
Joyous and crowded, right?

552
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,810
So many people here!

553
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,730
Dig in!

554
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,390
Let the nine of us enjoy the meal.

555
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,600
Come on, have some cucumbers!

556
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,020
Bro,

557
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,850
are we back again?

558
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,560
Bro,

559
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,520
do you think this road

560
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,390
leads to the east or west?

561
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,930
It should be east.

562
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,270
Bro,

563
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:19,730
you can't tell the way, right?

564
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,140
Don't worry.

565
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,020
I learned to

566
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,930
differentiate directions following the sun.

567
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:25,920
Let's go.

568
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,180
Why can't I see the sun?

569
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,100
We're back again.

570
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,640
Bro, you can't blame me.

571
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:47,850
This is

572
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,310
a natural disaster.

573
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:53,730
Actually,

574
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,850
you don't have to tie a rope.

575
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,890
Look!

576
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,140
These are firs.

577
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,270
Those are pines.

578
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,350
We can tell the direction from the trees,

579
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:06,980
right?

580
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,420
Let's go.

581
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,270
Why did I come back again?

582
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,230
I get it.

583
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,270
The two types of trees appear alternately.

584
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,810
This is a circulation!

585
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,480
I'm so smart.

586
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,890
I quickly figured it out.

587
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,770
This is a man-made disaster.

588
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:54,730
Bro,

589
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,560
are you thirsty?

590
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,270
I'm thirsty too.

591
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,850
I'll go get some water.

592
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,050
Why would I be angry with him?

593
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:13,600
Although I ignore him,

594
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,100
he answered himself

595
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,270
happily.

596
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,310
Bro,

597
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,310
are you hungry?

598
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,600
A little.

599
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,430
Look.

600
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,310
This is for you.

601
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,230
I didn't eat it.

602
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,930
I kept it for you.

603
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:56,770
Thank you.

604

you've gone too far.

607

such a small steamed bun.

609

Do you think I'm disgusting?

614
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,350
No.

615
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,560
Why do you care about this?

616
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:38,980

I understand you.

618
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:41,890
As an educated person,

619
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,390
it's normal for you to have a bad temper.

620
