Hey.

I was so worried about you.

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,020
Knowing that you haven't come out of Elixir Village,

Have you discussed it with your family?

87

It's useless.

88

He won't discuss with me.

what do you know?

93
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,100

I know this too well.

95

He thinks he cares about you.

96
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,600
But that's not what you think.

97
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,060

98
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,430
Right?

99
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:52,780
Yes.

101
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,600

Who knows what will happen in the future?

103
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,350
Yes.

104
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,310
Sometimes,

105
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,760
don't look at

107
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,350
and how romantic his promise is.

108
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,760

how he treats you

110

Yes.

118

119
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:28,710

You can stay here

Let him sleep with me.

138

It's none of your business.

You met him not long after you came out.

145

Let me tell you.

146
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,430
People in the martial arts world

147
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,600
know how to read people by their looks.

148
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,350
I've observed him carefully.

149
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,560
His eyes are wretched.

150
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,020
He's in a weird shape.

151
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,310
He's also easy in his morals.

152
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,140
He must be a bad guy.

153
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,980
How can you say he looks wretched

154
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,390
just because he has a beard?

155
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,520
You're so mean.

156
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,200
This...

157
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,810
Are you...

158
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,850
Are you jealous?

159
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,180
Impossible.

160
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,730
Xingchen.

161
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,730
I really don't understand.

162
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,850
If you don't even like

163
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:21,770
a man like me,

164
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,430
what kind of man do you like?

165
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,140
Mu.

166
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,390
I told you,

167
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,600
you have to

168
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,770
be like me.

169
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,930
I don't want a romantic relationship now.

170
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,270
I just want to focus on my career.

171
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,680
Xingchen,

172
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,390
no matter what you want to do,

173
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,980
I'm willing to do it with you.

174
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,890
If you want to explore the martial arts world,

175
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,130
I'll go with you.

176
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,020
As long as I'm by your side,

177
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,430
you won't get hurt.

178
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,180
This is the promise

179
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,730
I made to you.

180
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,130
Brother.

181
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,140
Brother.

182
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,560
We have news, Brother.

183
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,220
Tell me.

184
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,480
A family has just moved in

185
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
at the bottom of the east hill in Xicao Village.

186
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,230
It's said that the surname of the man of the house is Chen.

187
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,560
He got some strange disease and stayed at home.

188
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,670
His wife always goes out to buy things.

189
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,060
Everyone calls her Lady Yu.

190
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:28,970
Brother.

191
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,890
I remember you said that

192
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,020
a hero was bitten by a mutant

193
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,980
in the dungeon of Elixir Village.

194
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,520
Chen Jie.

195
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,230
has a childhood sweetheart.

196
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,010
Yu?

197
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:39,470
Yes.

198
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,679
They are not on the list of mutants

199
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,480
in the list of Elixir Village.

200
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,770
They must have escaped.

201
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:50,650
[Luo City] [Xicao Village]

202
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,810
Where did Chen Jie and Yu go?

203
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,710
[Luo City] [Xicao Village]

204
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,770
We went through so much trouble to get here, but they're not here.

205
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:55,580
Brother.

206
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,200
Brother.

207
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,560
Have you found Chen Jie?

208
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,850
They've got help.

209
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,730
They're out of danger now.

210
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,140
But I don't know where they went.

211
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,350
Maybe

212
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,140
the clue is still there.

213
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,930
Have you found anything? Brother.

214
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,560
Think about it.

215
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,430
Xingchen

216
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,390
was back to normal after taking the medicine.

217
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:17,770
Chen Jie didn't take any medicine.

218
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,520
How did he stay clearheaded?

219
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,930
Are these people related to men in black again?

220
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,100
But no one has been here since yesterday.

221
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,680
What a coincidence. We meet again.

222
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,800
Well...

223
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,770
I was worried about Xingchen.

224
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,850
I was worried too, so I followed.

225
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,300
Did I cause you trouble?

226
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,270
Humph.

227
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,890
You

228
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,680
just arrived?

229
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,730
Yes.

230
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,310
I have a question.

231
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,790
How

232
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,890
did you know we are here?

233
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,930
I asked people on my way.

234
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,520
Xingxing.

235
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,100
Let's go

236
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,770
and see if there are any other clues.

237
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,620
Hey.

238
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,980
Sir,

239
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,590
you don't have to go.

240
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,930
We don't need that many people.

241
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,770
It's okay.

242
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,180
Have a good rest.

243
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:20,980
Who are you?

244
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,560
Why did you tie us up?

245
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,930
Yin Fengmian,

246
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,670
Young Master of Yinling Valley.

247
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,390
Sir,

248
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,100
please.

249
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,980
Please let us go.

250
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,430
Since you are conscious,

251
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,310
you can understand me, right?

252
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,930
Why can you stay clear-minded?

253
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,560
We really don't know.

254
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,100
The point

255
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,560
should still be Huo Xingchen.

256
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,370
Brother.

257
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38,770
Why are you still up?

258
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,770
Is something bothering you?

259
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,890
Let me ask you a question.

260
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,260
What kind of person

261
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,430
do you think

262
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,430
the Big Beard is?

263
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,230
Brother,

264
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,390
I think he's nice

265
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,350
and loyal.

266
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,940
Well.

267
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,350
One time at the inn,

268
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,520
he understood the new move I created.

269
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,060
He even shouted.

270
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,140
What did he shout?

271
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,390
Pull

272
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:02,660
the mountain

273
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,350
and the river.

274
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,520
My move

275
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,350
used Xiang Yu's momentum not to cross the river.

276
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,100
It's tragic and majestic.

277
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,980
Is this what I was asking you?

278
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:17,320
What?

279
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,180
What did you want to say?

280
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,310
I mean this person.

281
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,430
Don't you think

282
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,730
he is a little weird?

283
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,760
Weird?

284
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,280
Yes.

285
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,580
Oh.

286
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:30,680
I see.

287
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,030
Brother.

288
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,310
Do you think Miss Huo's eyes

289
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,980
are staring at his beard every day?

290
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,040
Brother.

291
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,390
Don't worry.

292
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,270
No one can steal my brother's woman.

293
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,180
When you practice swordsmanship,

294
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,810
can you also train your mind?

295
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,980
I was talking about

296
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,730
how he often appears out of nowhere.

297
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,220
Didn't you notice?

298
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,230
Keep an eye on him.

299
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,020
It's not because of Huo Xingchen.

300
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,520
You're still so stubborn.

301
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:09,810
You just think

302
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:10,930
they are too close.

303
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,300
Get lost.

304
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,020
Okay.

305
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:21,810
I knew it.

306
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,560
Huo Xingchen and the others are still here.

307
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,310
Jiang Buying,

308
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:50,730
who ranks third in the martial arts world,

309
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,730
was caught?

310
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,270
Why are you practicing at night?

311
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,630
Since I can't attack by force.

312
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,140
I'll use my wisdom.

313
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,810
Run! Run!

314
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,230
Many mutants came from the woods behind the village.

315
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,770
So scary.

316
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,100
Hurry up! Run!

317
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,730
Xingxing, wait.

318
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,680
I don't think it's that simple.

319
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,390
Don't you think

320
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,980
the news came at the right time?

321
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,180
How about this?

322
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,560
Xingxing and I

323
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,850
go to the woods for a check first.

324
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,880
Buying,

325
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:01,680
you stay here with him.

326
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,600
You stay here.

327
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,230
If men in black come, you can deal with them.

328
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,560
Can we change groups?

329
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,890
I'll team up with Xingchen.

330
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,230
Is it better for people who know each other well to team up?

331
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,680
I think you're right.

332
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,680
What are you talking about?

333
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,730
I grouped like that for a reason.

334
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,850
You have to keep an eye on Big Beard.

335
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,770
[You have to keep an eye on Big Beard. If anything is unusual about him, please tell me later.]

336
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,880
If anything is unusual about him,

337
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,930
please tell me later.

338
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,230
Xingchen and I

339
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,480
used to work together.

340
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,140
We have a tacit understanding.

341
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,590
Can you understand that?

342
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,140
Fine.

343
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:50,950
[Xicao Village] [Yinling Valley]

344
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,210
[Yinling Valley]

345
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,560
Something is wrong with the fog.

346
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,810
Someone must have

347
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,890
lure us into the woods on purpose.

348
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,560
Could it be the mastermind?

349
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,770
It's possible.

350
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:20,430
What are you doing?

351
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,020
I'm afraid there might be a trap.

352
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,270
We should hold hands to prevent accidents.

353
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,180
What accident can there be?

354
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,270
Listen.

355
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,170
You agreed me to keep the promise.

356
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,230
What are you doing?

357
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,310
Since we can't hold hands, I'll just hold a branch.

358
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,730
Huo Xingchen!

359
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,980
Huo Xingchen!

360
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,640
Xingxing, stop it. Come out.

361
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:11,520
Who are you?

362
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,180
Why did you tie me up?

363
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,560
What about the person who was with me?

364
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,020
You two really love each other.

365
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,180
Your life is at stake.

366
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,480
But you're still thinking about your lover?

367
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:25,640
Here.

368
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,560
What did you do to him?

369
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,270
You were bitten by a mutant.

370
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,730
How did you go back to normal?

371
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,850
Huo Xingchen!

372
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,020
Huo Xingchen!

373
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,680
Since you don't have the antidote,

374
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,640
then die with Ci.

375
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,730
Xingxing.

376
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,430
Xingxing.

377
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,730
Xingxing.

378
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,390
Buting, are you all right?

379
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,170
Let her go!

380
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,450
You...

381
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,560
Why are you here?

382
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,810
Don't you dislike me?

383
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,850
Leave now.

384
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,640
Who said I dislike you?

385
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,390
If I dislike you, why would I be willing to be buried with you in water

386
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,350
twice?

387
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,060
Are you stupid? Leave!

388
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:20,770
Leave!

389
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,480
Why should I leave?

390
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,410
Leave!

391
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,560
I was wondering who it was.

392
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,560
It's so dazzling.

393
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,350
Today,

394
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,980
no matter what,

395
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,640
I will kill you.

396
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,350
Who do you want to kill?

397
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,020
If you want to kill me, why didn't you put me in?

398
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,480
Are you stupid?

399
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,310
Open the door.

400
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,890
Why do you want the door open?

401
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,390
You want to come in?

402
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,140
Fine.

403
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,270
I'd like to see

404
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,980
how you lovers

405
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,810
die in front of me?

406
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:50,560
Come on, open it.

407
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,510
Blah, blah...

408
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,850
What are you yelling about?

409
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:53,520
Stop fighting.

410
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,730
Who's a couple with him?

411
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,740
What?

412
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:58,520
Who said that?

413
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,520
He's always following me.

414
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,570
I hate him.

415
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,060
I...

416
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,560
I don't like him at all.

417
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,730
What couple?

418
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,850
Jiang Buting, let me tell you.

419
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:05,850
Let's agree on a three-point law.

420
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,180
First, stay away from me.

421
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,230
Second,

422
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,980
we're in the martial arts world.

423
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,100
We shouldn't talk about love.

424
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,390
Third, let me tell you.

425
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,350
A melon twisted off its stem before it's ripe doesn't taste sweet. (Forced love does not last.)

426
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,810
I don't like melons.

427
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,340
Why would I twist one off?

428
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,520
Yeah.

429
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,020
Cut the crap.

430
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,390
Go to hell!

431
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:29,600
Xingxing!

432
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,230
Don't come over.

433
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,100
Be careful.

434
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,020
No.

435
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,930
Xingxing, be careful.

436
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:26,350
Ci.

437
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,560
Take care of yourself, Xingxing.

438
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,810
Xingxing, are you hurt?

439
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,600
I told you to leave. Why didn't you leave?

440
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,880
Oh.

441
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,140
Are you worried about me?

442
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,730
Who's worried about you?

443
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,520
I was worried about the twisted melon.

444
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,100
I wouldn't know if the melon is sweet

445
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,430
until I twist it off.

446
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,140
Are you two done?

447
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,100
Jianwa.

448
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,810
Binghe.

449
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:49,850
Binghe.

450
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,680
I've been waiting for you here for a long time.

451
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,810
What happened?

452
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,430
Your sister disappeared

453
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,180
on the day you went to Xicao Village.

454
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,680
But my men found out that

455
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,680
your sister also went to Xicao Village.

456
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,670
[The Doctrine is High and Mighty]

457
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,270
Binghe.

458
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,640
Mutants are not incurable.

459
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,680
You shouldn't have killed them.

460
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,020
Uncle!

461
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,730
Jianwa.

462
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,100
Emergency report from Yinling Valley.

463
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,680
It's from the Young Master of Yinling Valley.

464
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,890
Yinling Valley is under control.

465
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,930
He requested the Wuyue Sect to eliminate villains.

466
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,560
This is outrageous.

467
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,350
Pass my order down.

468
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,850
Gather our men

469
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,100
to Yinling Valley.

470
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:30,440
Okay.

471
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,350
This is the first batch of elixir

472
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,810
made with the new furnace by the master hand.

473
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,300
It is more effective than before.

474
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,810
Thank you for the medicine.

475
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,600
I'll work with utter devotion

476
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,230
for you.

477
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,380
Circle Man and Jiang Buting

478
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,680
have been out for so long

479
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,310
and hasn't come back yet.

480
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,230
Are they in danger?

481
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,850
Should I go out and look for them?

482
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,600
No, I have to find him.

483
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,020
Trying to escape?

484
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,180
He's sneaking around.

485
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,100
No, I have to keep an eye on him.

486
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,140
I didn't know

487
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,180
he's a Kungfu maniac just like me.

488
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,180
I heard that there are heroes who bind their limbs

489
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,310
to increase their power invisibly.

490
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,350
Is he training himself

491
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,060
like that day and night?

492
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,230
I really admire him.

493
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,060
Come on.

494
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,140
Buying.

495
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,520
If you're really worried,

496
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,480
we can go and have a look.

497
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,060
Seeing you walking around

498
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,350
makes my eyes blurry.

499
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,180
Don't play tricks.

500
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,730
Although I think you are a nice person,

501
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,730
my brother asked me to take precautions against you.

502
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,060
I have to listen to him.

503
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,600
What are you doing?

504
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:25,600
Look.

505
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,560
I can't beat you.

506
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,270
I can't outrun you either.

507
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,600
We're tied together.

508
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,520
Even if I'm a bad guy,

509
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:34,980
I can't run away.

510
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:38,980
Brother.

511
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:39,710
What?

512
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,600
I didn't expect

513
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,630
I feel ashamed by your side.

514
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,020
You're upright. I shouldn't have suspected you.

515
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,810
We don't have to tie our hands together.

516
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,230
If you're worried,

517
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,390
we can hold hands.

518
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,640
Why?

519
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:00,520
Just tie them together.

520
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:01,850
Two men...

521
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,100
Done, Brother.

522
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,560
Shameless!

523
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,310
What happened?

524
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,230
How did your brother become a mutant?

525
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:29,230
Fengci and I were adopted by Yinling Valley since childhood.

526
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,180
We uphold the principle that the strong should be the head.

527
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,930
But people of Yinling Valley

528
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,230
are extremely dumb in martial arts.

529
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:38,810
In order to protect ourselves,

530
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,680
we practice formations and traps as our main priority.

531
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,270
Many people in the martial arts world disdain it.

532
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,810
I've heard about it.

533
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,350
But recently,

534
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,090
many people in our valley

535
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,680
have greatly improved their martial arts.

536
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,760
My position in the valley is also in danger.

537
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,560
Hou Qiong, come forward.

538
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,770
This is the elixir given by the Master.

539
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,520
Thank you for the medicine.

540
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,930
Fifth Senior Brother, take it now.

541
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,020
It's such a good thing.

542
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,090
Don't let others have it.

543
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,930
Yeah, take it now.

544
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,350
Congratulations, Fifth Senior Brother.

545
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,600
Fifth Senior Brother, don't mind it.

546
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:56,850
I have one too.

547
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,730
What is this?

548
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,180
It's a symbol of glory.

549
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,060
We all have the elixir

550
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,090
given by the Master.

551
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,060
It is so magical.

552
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,730
It's just a tiny vein.

553
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,100
Don't mention it.

554
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:09,850
Yes.

555
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,180
Yes.

556
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,550
Junior Feng was the first one to be given the medicine by the Master.

557
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,310
He has the most prominent vein.

558
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,520
This is also the symbol of trust of the Master.

559
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,390
I hid a so-called holy medicine.

560
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:29,890
Untie me.

561
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:30,480
I'll get it for you.

562
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,100
Do you need me to get it for you?

563
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,680
Don't smell it.

564
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,770
But according to what you said,

565
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,890
after taking the medicine,

566
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,890
they will become more powerful.

567
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,640
There will also be veins on their bodies.

568
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,600
Isn't that the condition of mutants?

569
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,480
How many people in Yinling Valley

570
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,020
have taken this medicine?

571
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,600
A lot.

572
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,850
Almost all of them.

573
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,270
But I didn't take it.

574
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:07,730
It's right that you didn't take it.

575
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,430
This black pill should be the same as the poisonous powder

576
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,270
that controlled mutants in the Elixir Village.

577
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,890
If they are really the same thing,

578
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,060
then Yinling Valley

579
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,430
is the mastermind.

there were mutants nearby?

Tracing Butterfly can help us.

there is a mutant here.

00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:25,560
Master.

698
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,350
Young Master sneaked in with evil-doers.

699
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,100
Fifth Senior Brother has taken people to arrest them.

700
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:34,640
A traitor is not qualified to be Young Master.

701
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,180
Pass my order down.

702
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,890
Make sure to eliminate all of them.

703
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,060
We're at a critical moment.

704
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,390
Anyone who ruins my plan

705
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:46,890
will be killed.

706
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:47,800
Yes.

707
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:01,930
Master.

708
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,020
Useless trash

709
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,060
can only be my fertilizer

710
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,220
and help me achieve great success.

711
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:35,480
Master hand,

712
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,520
the new furnace has been activated for days.

713
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,180
It has absorbed many people's power.

714
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,980
When will the elixir be made?

715
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,980
His Highness is waiting for your elixir.

716
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,480
Calm down.

717
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,640
Those who achieve great things

718
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,640
must be calm.

719
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:55,730
You're right.

720
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,520
Why are there so many men in black?

721
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,930
Did we poke into the lair of men in black?

722
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,810
Maybe you are right.

723
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,560
This place is nothing

724
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,100
compared with Elixir Village.

725
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:20,850
Useless!

726
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,270
Keep searching.

727
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,600
Yes.

728
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,850
Why are you so afraid of him?

729
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:29,980
If he kills me,

730
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,520
he'll be the Young Master.

731
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,270
How can I not run?

732
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:34,770
The competition of Yinling Valley

733
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:35,930
is so fierce.

734
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,230
The reason why Yinling Valley had such a bad reputation,

735
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,560
besides not facing the enemy head on

736
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,770
which is sneaky,

737
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,230
was that the competition mechanism was cruel and ruthless.

738
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:48,480
Being able to sit firmly in the position of Young Master

739
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,720
also shows that you are a talent.

740
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:52,770
It might not be the case

741
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:54,850
in the future.

742
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,600
Run!

743
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,870
♫Wow, baby♫

744
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,890
♫I can touch the clouds in fairy tales♫
