[Episode 9]

4
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:46,930
So none of you will tell me?

5
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:50,600
Let me tell you.

6
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,230
Jiang Buting, you'd better not!

7
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,850
Mr. Jiang, you can't say it!

8
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,350
Listen carefully.

9
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,980
It's because your internal force

10
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,810
has never been sealed.

11
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,930
You don't know martial arts at all.

12
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,480
Stop it, Young Master! Stop it.

13
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,020
Why did you lie to her?

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,560
Why did you
let her live in a lie all this time?

15
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,180
Do you know

16
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,100
that it will only
put her in a more dangerous situation?

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,289
No.

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
That is impossible.

19
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,560
It can't be true.

20
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,110
Dad.

21
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,180
Explain to him.

22
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,020
Xingchen, I...

23

Huo Xingchen.

24
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,310
Wake up.

25
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,770
Open your eyes and see the truth.

26
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,259
Since young,

27
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,140
you've been living under

28
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,600
the protection of the Huo family.

29
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,770
They said you're an ultimate Kungfu master.

30
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,229
Then why can't you even defeat me?

31
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,070
No.

32
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,130
You are a liar.

33
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:03,560
Dad.

34
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,980
Tell him.

35
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,680
Tell him that I know martial arts!

36
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,730
Xingchen.

37
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,180
Tell him, aunt.

38
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,889
Tell Jiang Buting that I know martial arts!

39
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,060
Say something!

40
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,310
Didn't I just...

41
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:20,890
No!

42
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,140
So all of you

43
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,890
have been lying to me.

44
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,910
Dad.

45
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,930
I'll only ask you once.

46
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,230
Do I really have no martial arts skills?

47
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,180
Xingchen,

48
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,060
listen to me.

49
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,020
So...

50
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,270
You really lied to me, dad.

51
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,310
Why?

52
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,680
Why did you lie to me for so long?

53
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,850
All these years,

54
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,180
did I look like

55
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,980
a fool to all of you?

56
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,230
I thought I was
the future Head of Wuyue Sect,

57
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,140
and I even wanted
to explore the martial arts world.

58
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,350
That is the funniest joke I've ever heard.

[Pure in Heart and Spirit]

60
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,680
Young Miss, you should eat something.

61
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,560
You haven't eaten since yesterday.

62
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,270
It's bad for your health.

63
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,230
Does she still refuse to eat?

64
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,180
She hadn't eaten since yesterday.

66
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,480
Why are you so depressed?

67
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,560
Tell me.

68
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,220
I have nothing now.

69
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,390
Even everything I had before

70
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,850
was fake.

71
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,980
How would you have nothing?

72
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,600
Aren't you still Wuyue Sect's Junior?

73
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,100
And everyone still loves you.

74
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,730
Most importantly,

75
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,380
you have

76
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,390
someone all the girls dream of,

77
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,730
Brother Mu.

78
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,050
I'm talking about myself.

79

I don't even have Kungfu now.

What's the meaning
for me to be in the martial arts world?

81

Hey.

82
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:08,980
Xingchen.

83
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,390
From now on, what belongs to me

84
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,180
is also yours.

85
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,730
As long as you

86

stay by my side,

87
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,680
I'll take care of everything for you.

88
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,310
Isn't that meaningful?

89
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,430
Then how am I different from a loser?

90
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,230
No. No.

91
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,179
You and I are a perfect match.

92
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,679
You will be the happiest woman

in the martial arts world from now on.

94
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,140
Brother Mu, please leave.

95
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,180
I want to be alone.

96
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,810
Okay, I'll sit here for a while.

97
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,770
Get out.

Okay.

99
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,930
Remember to eat.

100

Wow,

102
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,310
the mutton is so tender.

103
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,680
It smells so good.

104
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,270
In this world,

105
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,230
there is nothing
more important than eating and drinking.

106
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,350
But some people

107
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,810
keep making
their lives difficult themselves.

108
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,760
Such delicious mutton.

109
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,020
It's a pity if you don't eat it.

110
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:04,480
Have a taste.

111
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,430
It smells so good.

112
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,350
What are you doing?

113
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,230
Don't you always think I am trouble?

114
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,180
Now you finally get rid of me.

115
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,930
You can travel the martial arts world alone.

116
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,600
Why are you still here?

117
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,520
Who said you were trouble?

118
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,920
You

119
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,230
are my most important…

120
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,020
friend.

121
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,140
How can I ignore my friend?

122
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
So we're just friends?

123
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,140
You should go.

124
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,770
You have to eat something.

125
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,430
It'll get cold if you keep it for too long.

126
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,430
Did sister-in-law kick you out?

127
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,890
Why didn't you just tell her?

128
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,130
If she knew

129
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,520
that you gave her
such an essential medicine,

130
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,890
she would never question you again.

131
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,680
Why bother?

132
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,310
When are we leaving?

133
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,310
Xingchen.

134
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,770
I brought you a gift.

135
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,770
Look.

136
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,230
This is...

137
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,600
Do you like it?

138
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,810
Xingchen.

139
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,230
This silver hairpin is very valuable.

140
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,730
It's my ancestral treasure.

141
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,060
It's only passed down to the Mu family.

142
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,890
Think about it.

143
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,430
There will be
children surrounding you later.

144
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,850
You can do gardening when you're free.

145
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,230
No matter what happens,

146
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,890
Brother Mu will protect you.

147
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,390
Here.

148
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,190
What?

149
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,140
But...

150
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,950
[Pure in Heart and Spirit]

151
00:12:58,930 --> 00:12:59,770
Hey, Mr. Jiang.

152
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,730
Where are you going?

153
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,350
I'm here to visit your Young Miss. Also...

154
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,270
To say goodbye.

155
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,930
No need.

156
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,520
Young Miss is very touched now.

157
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,020
I advise you not to disturb her.

158
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,560
Touched?

159
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,930
For what?

160
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,230
Mr. Mu sent things

161
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,480
like rouge, hairpin and so on.

162
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,670
They are all
from the Imperial Merchant Store.

163
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,310
Young Miss is so touched

164
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,270
that she's been quiet all afternoon.

165
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,140
She's been quiet all afternoon?

166
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:25,500
Yes.

167
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,560
Did Mr. Mu say anything unpleasant?

168
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,890
Mr. Mu is so much better than you.

169
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,430
Mr. Mu said he would

170
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,520
spoil her like a princess,

171
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,140
and let her stay at home every day.

172
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,390
She doesn't need to worry about anything.

173
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,840
Nonsense.

174
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,040
Hey.

175
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,270
Hey, where are you going?

176
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,230
Come with me.

177
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:57,680
Come with me.

178
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:03,380
Look at you.

179
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,850
Stop wasting your time here.

180
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,680
A loser will always be a loser.

181
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,520
Someone has to be a loser.

182
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,430
Why can't it be me?

183
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,810
Why you?

184
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,680
You are healthy and able-bodied.

185
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,890
Get what you want.

186
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,230
Do whatever you want.

187
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,350
You know nothing.

188
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,810
Stop being sarcastic.

189
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,180
Why don't you understand?

190
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,350
Is this small room all you have?

191
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:29,880
Yes.

192
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,480
This is all I have.

193
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,270
You're right.

194
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,480
I know nothing.

195
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,020
I don't even have Kungfu.

196
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,230
Later,

197
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,550
I'll get married.

198
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,730
I'll wear beautiful clothes,

199
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,560
eat delicacies every day,

200
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,230
and have a child like everyone else.

201
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,680
You're right.

202
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,390
I'm a loser.

203
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:54,930
Xingxing.

204
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,480
Let me ask you a question.

205
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,770
Do you think

206
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,850
your body is weaker

207
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,520
or mine?

208
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,310
Of course, it's yours.

209
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,350
See? That's right.

210
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,090
I'm weaker and poorer than you.

211
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,100
And I was protected by you all the way.

212
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,770
Should a loser like me

213
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,020
be ashamed to die?

214
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,310
You're shameless. You won't feel that way.

215
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,380
Okay, let's think about it.

216
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:25,600
Think about it.

217
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,480
When I first met you,

218
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,800
you were brave and resourceful.

219
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,980
Although, sometimes,

220
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,060
you can be a little reckless.

221
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,810
But you will always step up bravely

222
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,180
for your future.

223
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,140
Right?

224
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:49,930
Look.

225
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,520
You met so many swindlers.

226
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,770
But you could clearly distinguish

227
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,430
between the bad guy

228
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,020
and the good guy that was forced to do so.

229
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,420
It means you are very insightful,
like a hero.

230
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:05,930
Also,

231
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:07,930
without you,

232
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,099
Buying and I wouldn't have survived

233
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,390
those days.

234
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,270
I was so weak.

235
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,890
And now I'm strong
and healthy because of you.

236
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,849
Look.

237
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,980
I've gained so much weight.

238
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,050
It's all thanks to you,

239
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,890
who have been providing for the family.

240
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:28,770
Besides,

241
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,430
you saved my life.

242
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,810
You said I'm the head of the family.

243
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,020
I'll protect you!

244
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,890
Back then in the prison,

245
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,350
if you hadn't

246
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,600
risked your life to save me,

247
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,310
I wouldn't be able

248
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,930
to sit here and talk to you.

249
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:01,730
Right?

250
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:05,690
Yes.

251
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,850
You seem weak,

252
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,640
but you're actually very strong.

253
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:12,860
You're

254
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,920
the real hero.

255
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,180
I look weak,

256
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,270
but I'm actually strong.

257
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,700
Yeah.

258
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,430
Look, what is this?

259
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,210
An egg.

260
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,980
In your opinion,

261
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,770
is the egg stronger

262
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,180
or the stone?

263
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,930
Jiang Buting,

264
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,730
are you mocking me by saying
that I'm hitting the stone with an egg?

265
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,230
No.

266
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,520
Everyone thinks the stone is tougher.

267
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,770
And the egg is overestimating itself.

268
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,350
But...

269
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,180
Don't you notice how brave the egg is?

270
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,930
The fact
that they accepted the impossible mission

271
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,020
in the first place is incredible enough.

272
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,020
But don't you think

273
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,230
it's foolish?

274
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,560
I don't think so.

275
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,850
You have no idea how much I admire you.

276
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,100
Xingxing,

277
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,930
you're the bravest girl I've ever seen.

278
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,850
That's right.

279
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,060
I, Huo Xingchen, will be an egg.

280
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,060
And I'll be the most special egg.

281
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,100
So what if I hit the stone with an egg?

282
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,390
Right?

283
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,600
You just need to practice hard.

284
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,980
Think about it.
There are so many masters in Wuyue Sect.

285
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,560
One day,

286
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,060
you will become a very impressive hero.

287
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,660
No.

288
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,230
I don't want to stay here.

289
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,850
I want to roam
the martial arts world like Fork Man.

290
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,090
Xingxing.

291
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,350
I have

292
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,730
made my stance clear before.

293
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,180
I can't take you together with me.

294
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,140
Who asked you to take me together?

295
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,770
It's me who wants to go with you.

296
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:14,520
How about this?

297
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,910
Just...

298
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,060
Name your conditions.

299
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,060
Well...

300
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,390
Give me seven days.

301
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,770
If I defeat you in seven days,

302
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,600
it means I don't need your protection.

303
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,730
Then we'll leave together.

304
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:43,850
Master.

305
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,140
Xingchen is not having
her meal again, right?

306
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,180
Master, don't worry.

307
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,890
Mr. Jiang made barbecue for Young Miss.

308
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,930
And she enjoyed it.

309
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,270
What about Mu Binghe?

310
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,270
Mr. Mu was there too.

311
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:58,780
What?

312
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,180
How did Xingchen

313
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,130
treat them respectively?

314
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,980
Her expression

315
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,270
was like...

316
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:09,520
Uh.

317
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,930
Like this.

318
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:11,570
And

319
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:13,980
like this.

320
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,140
Explain it in detail.

321
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,060
Explain?

322
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:21,780
Oh.

323
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,560
Okay.

324
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,180
Xingchen,

325
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,510
don't be sad.

326
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,020
Even if you know nothing,

327
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,340
it's okay.

328
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,520
You have me who can do everything.

329
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,140
But if I can't do anything,

330
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,800
I'm just a loser.

331
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,630
I won't allow you
to say that about yourself.

332
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,180
Xingchen, even if you don't do anything,

333
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,390
I'll be happy

334
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,430
to support you.

335
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,180
Tell me about Mr. Jiang.

336
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,730
On the other hand,
Mr. Jiang's words didn't sound nice.

337
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,310
She even asked him to get out.

338
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:02,240
What?

339
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
Did Mr. Jiang

340
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,390
say something unpleasant again?

341
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,640
Huo Xingchen.

342
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,560
Look at you now.

343
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,180
What's the use of complaining?

344
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,060
If they think
you're not good at martial arts,

345
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,180
then you should practice.

346
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,600
If they think you are dependant,

347
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,640
then prove it to them.

348

You...

521
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,390
You should just call me Uncle Huo.

522
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,480
It's too early
for you to call me father-in-law.

Right?

525
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,430
Those letters

526
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,980
were all misunderstandings.

What if he surrenders on purpose?

541
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,020
He's coveting Xingchen!
