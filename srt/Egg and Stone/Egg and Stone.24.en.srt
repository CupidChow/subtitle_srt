00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,260
♫I sigh when I feel the wind on my ears♫

♫Fate couldn’t make a turn in time♫

6
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,590
♫How plodding will this long road be?♫

7
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,480
One herb

8
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,940
can only save one person.

9
00:00:59,090 --> 00:00:59,900
Xingchen.

10
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,840
To save Jiang Buting or your father?

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,489
♫I couldn’t see through the fog along the road♫

12
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,160
You need to make a decision soon.

13
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,240
♫I’m most afraid of getting lost in the crowd♫

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,280
Your father needs to be detoxified as soon as possible.

15

♫Will the time be less heartbreaking?♫

16
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,920
Jiang Buting's body

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,640
is already on the verge of collapsing.

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,310
♫The memory is like a lonely sail♫

19

♫I can hear the distant shore calling♫

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,460
♫How much more turbulence do I have to endure before I reach the shore?♫

21
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,450
♫There may always be sunshine that can drive away the long night♫

♫Although tears may turn into ashes and decoct the taste of medicine♫

It's not time to give up yet.

36

♫There's no such thing as you in this world♫

I'll always be with you.

38

I won't go anywhere.

39
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,860

♫I won't regret staying with you♫

42
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,150
Young Miss Huo.

43
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,870
There is news from the dungeon

44
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,600
that the doctor wants to see you.

45
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,270
Okay.

46
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,340
You may leave.

47
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,130
Yes.

48
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,210
If only I had proposed to you

49
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,970
at Wuyue Sect.

50
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,950
But if you knew

51
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:53,070
I didn't have much time left,

52
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,250
would you kick me out of Wuyue Sect?

53
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,270
Open the door.

54
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,270
You wanna see me?

55
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,970
Yes.

56
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,530
You feel conflicted.

57
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,520
It's hard to choose.

58
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,500
Isn't it?

59
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,330
How did I know?

60
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,290
You don't have to choose between family and lover.

61
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,720
Are you happy?

62
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,330
Let me tell you.

63
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,980
Ice Herb

64
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,800
can't save Jiang Buting.

65
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,230
Only I can save him.

66
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,480
So you did

67
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,510
all this?

68
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,280
Uncle Huo.

69
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,070
How are you?

70
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,080
This...

71
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,440
This is...

72
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,330
This is Tianque Sect.

73
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,610
Tianque Sect?

74
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,710
Jiang Buting.

75
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,210
Why are you here?

76
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,840
Where is Xingchen?

77
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,770
Xingchen and I came here to ask for medicine.

78
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,500
Have you forgotten?

79
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,780
Ask for medicine?

80
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,540
Yeah.

81
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,660
Did you get the medicine?

82
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,080
Yes.

83
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,220
Xingchen has mastered the Heavenly Scroll

84
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,310
and obtained the Ice Herb for you to take.

85
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,210
Oh no.

86
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,690
Xingchen...

87
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,500
What's wrong?

88
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,930
Mu Lang did

89
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,140
all this for Xingchen.

90
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,450
Hurry!

91
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,620
Jiang Buting.

92
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,150
Take me to Xingchen.

93
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,240
Hurry.

94
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,250
Tell me.

95
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,360
When did you start scheming against me?

96
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,640
Scheming?

97
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,880
How could you say that?

98
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,450
Your talent attracted me.

99
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,880
I've always wanted to make the world's strongest.

100
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,170
But I've always failed.

101
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,410
The world's strongest?

102
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,330
There's no such thing in the world.

103
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,740
There isn't.

104
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,360
That's why I have to create it.

105
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,180
Hey.

106
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,930
Hurry up.

107
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,910
Make it quick.

108
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,880
No rush.

109
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,820
This is the final step.

110
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,800
Be careful

111
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,310
and more careful.

112
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,470
What are you up to?

113
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,430
Vessel.

114
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,820
What vessel?

115
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,880
Everyone's internal force is incompatible

116
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,580
and can't absorb other's internal force.

117
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,900
Even if those become stronger by stealing someone's internal force,

118
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,300
their meridians will be disrupted and end up incapable

119
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,170
due to the chaos of internal force.

120
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,100
What does this have to do with Xingchen?

121
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,110
Your master thinks

122
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,710
the physique of Xingchen is unique.

123
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,600
She can absorb and accommodate

124
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,230
all types of internal force.

125
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,270
If she can master the Heavenly Scroll,

126
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,390
her body will become an excellent

127
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,600
vessel for force transmission.

128
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,380
How is that possible?

129
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,840
I've never heard of such a thing.

130
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,070
Xingchen can contain the magic power pill.

131
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,890
Because she is the only one

132
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,240
who has taken both the mixed poison pill and lifesaving pill.

133
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,420
That's true.

134
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,770
Your physique is different from ordinary people.

135
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,070
You're a natural transmitter.

136
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,490
If you master the Heavenly Scroll,

137
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,340
you can transfer your force to anyone.

138
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,870
So you waited until now

139
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,410
to make your move.

140
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,290
Yes.

141
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,420
But

142
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,950
Xingchen's physique

143
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,740
is no different from ours.

144
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,280
The reason she can master the Heavenly Scroll

145
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,500
is because she has a pure heart

146
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,530
and no distractions.

147
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,850
And she has walked out of the pipe dream.

148
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,250
Her heart is even stronger now, so she won't go astray.

149
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,920
Is Xingchen in danger now?

150
00:10:59,440 --> 00:10:59,950
Yes.

151
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,040
We need to hurry.

152
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,570
Mu

153
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,100
doesn't listen to anyone now.

154
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,320
You...

155
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,030
You poisoned me

156
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,480
because I found out everything you've done.

157
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,260
Mu Lang.

158
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,820
When did you become like this?

159
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,130
I want to kill you.

160
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,360
But you have a good daughter.

161
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,880
What are you going to do to Xingchen?

162
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,730
Don't worry.

163
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,510
I won't do anything to her.

164
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,910
She is useless to me now.

165
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,950
But Huo Qingliu,

166
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,810
we’ve been brothers for years.

167
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,560
You've hidden it well.

168
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,500
Xingchen has such a special physique.

169
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,030
Huh?

170
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,060
What are you talking about?

171
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,710
What do you want to do to her?

172
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,060
With such a special physique,

173
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,580
it would be a waste if she doesn't

174
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,860
practice supreme martial arts.

175
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,830
I've chosen one for her.

176
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,790
The Heavenly Scroll.

177
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,570
What do you think?

178
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:03,680
Huh?

179
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,350
Mu Lang.

180
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,660
Xingchen has been practicing martial arts for seven years with no progress.

181
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,930
Her physique is not special at all.

182
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,240
She's even dull-witted.

183
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,550
Well.

184
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,820
Not necessarily.

185
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,520
Jiang Buting's body needs to consume the Ice Herb,

186
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,310
which is only available at the peak of Snow Mountain.

187
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,700
But you're right.

188
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,630
Love is unreliable.

189
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,400
So I found her another reason

190
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,350
to go to the peak of Snow Mountain.

191
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,750
If you dare to touch Xingchen,

192
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,410
I'll kill you!

193
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,460
Don't worry.

194
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,350
I won't let you die.

195
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,710
I want you to see

196
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,110
how I become the Supreme Master in the martial arts world.

197
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:47,620
You...

198
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,110
You...

199
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,930
Hurry!

200
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,850
Let's Go.

201
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,540
I told him clearly.

202
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,710
But he wouldn't listen.

203
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,540
He was immersed in the beautiful future

204
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,810
that Doctor Song painted for him,

205
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,140
believing that

206
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,820
Xingchen can help him become the Supreme Master

207
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,280
and dominate the martial arts world.

208
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,470
Hurry!

209
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:10,970
Hey.

210
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,760
Stop talking nonsense.

211
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,890
My dear niece,

212
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,790
you're smart.

213
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,970
If only you weren't so resistant,

214
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,390
it would be great to marry Binghe.

215
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,260
You caused his death.

216
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,240
How dare you mention him?

217
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,000
Me?

218
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,840
He could have become the best in the world.

219
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,410
If it weren't for you,

220
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,980
he wouldn't betray me.

221
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,390
Cut the crap.

222
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,240
My body is reaching its limit.

223
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,410
Hurry!

224
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,380
Ask her to transfer

225
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,930
her force to me.

226
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,510
Do it!

227
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,730
Song Changsheng,

228
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,180
I order you.

229
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,450
Who are you

230
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,260
to give me order?

231
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,120
What do you mean?

232
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,340
Huh?

233
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,990
What do you mean?

234
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,800
What do I mean?

235
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,820
I mean

236
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,300
you're useless now.

237
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,230
You're a loser.

238
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,180
A useless loser.

239
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,730
There's no need to talk to you anymore.

240
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,220
Song Changsheng,

241
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,880
I am the master.

242
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,860
You're just a pawn in my hand.

243
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,090
That's the funniest.

244
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,520
The pawn thinks of itself as the master.

245
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,270
Not only you,

246
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,590
Elixir Village,

247
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:54,760
Yinling Valley,

248
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,110
Star-picking Sect,

249
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,660
half of the martial arts world

250
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,380
and all of you

251
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,120
have become my pawns.

252
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,960
I used two poisons

253
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,150
to manipulate all of you.

254
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,690
Poison?

255
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,470
So there is no so-called lifesaving pill.

256
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,980
Then why am I fine after taking it?

257
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,530
This girl was poisoned by the mutant,

258
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,440
and took the little red pill I gave Buting.

259
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,900
Normal people would either die or get hurt from it.

260
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,160
But this girl ate it and didn't get hurt.

261
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,580
Could it be that she has a special body?

262
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,160
No.

263
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,540
I have to study it.

264
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,740
There's no lifesaving pill or magic power pill.

265
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,470
I just made them up

266
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,490
to fool Mu Lang.

267
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,050
The mixed poison pill is not some magic power pill.

268
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,120
Although it can temporarily

269
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,100
unleash one's potential to the extreme,

270
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,400
taking too much of it will kill you.

271
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,970
But

272
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,470
people always want something for nothing.

273
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,460
I made you to believe

274
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,530
with only two poisons.

275
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,720
Song Changsheng.

276
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,910
You...

277
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,440
You've been lying to me all along.

278
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,170
Buting trusts you so much.

279
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,400
He has always treated you as his father.

280
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,360
Let me tell you a secret.

281
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,330
He has always been very healthy.

282
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,750
There is no illness.

283
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,640
And he's not born with weak physique.

284
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,940
The reason why his body is so weak

285
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,319
is because of those pills he took.

286
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,390
Why did you do that?

287
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,040
If I didn't,

288
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,930
would he have taken

289
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,790
the poison I made and been used by me?

290
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,190
So,

291
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,460
you've been using him all along.

292
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,740
You've been experimenting on Buting.

293
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,310
Yes.

294
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,660
You can't gain what you want

295
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,060
if you don't give up on something.

296
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,720
What a pity.

297
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,830
He was just a little boy then.

298
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,960
I let him take the medicine.

299
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,760
He just took them obediently

300
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:00,120
and became a short-lived sick man.

301
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,770
It is a pity.

302
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,440
If anything happens to him,

303
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,990
I'll take your life as compensation.

304
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,380
No way.

305
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,480
The strongest move.

306
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,940
I should absorb

307
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,680
all her force.

308
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,750
How could it fail?

309
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,650
Because you were wrong

310
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,010
from the beginning.

311
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,860
I'm never wrong.

312
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,350
I'm never wrong.

313
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,620
My plan is perfect.

314
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,070
I've thought of every step.

315
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,660
How is it possible?

316
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,090
According to ancient books,

317
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,500
with special physique,

318
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,480
one can master the Heavenly Scroll,

319
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,550
and pass their force to others.

320
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,230
It can't be wrong.

321
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,210
It can't be wrong.

322
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,240
My physique

323
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,210
is no different from ordinary people.

324
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,600
No way.

325
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,590
If my physique is different from others,

326
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,170
how could I have studied martial arts in Penglai Island for seven years

327
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,310
and not achieve anything?

328
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,230
No way.

329
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,390
No way.

330
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,490
Then

331
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,350
how did you absorb your internal force

332
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,820
and master the Heavenly Scroll?

333
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,220
No way!

334
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,010
Xingxing, how are you?

335
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,190
Father, you're awake.

336
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,980
Dear, are you alright?

337
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,290
Father, I'm fine.

338
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,460
Buting.

339
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,800
Take Xingchen with you.

340
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,870
Leave the rest to me.

341
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,060
Okay.

342
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,310
Let's go.

343
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,060
My daughter

344
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,310
will never be a stepping stone for you to become the best.

345
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,620
Tell me.

346
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,230
When did you target my daughter Xingchen?

347

and all the unique skills in the world.

391

When I was 15,

But do you know what he said?

400
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,100
He said

401
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,060

but the strength inside.

that I have created a good medicine.

Xingchen, don't go over there.

520
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,950
You're hitting a stone with an egg.

521
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,510
Trust her.

522
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,000
Huo Xingchen.

523
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,040
What are you up to?

524
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,750
Are you going to go down the evil path?

525
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,940
First, it was the Hucang Guards, and now the Wuyue Sect.

526
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,920
When will you

527
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,560
righteous people stop pushing us?

528
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,350
Stop wasting time with her. Kill her first.

529
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:30,990
Kill her!

530
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,300
If you want to know the truth, listen to me.

531
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,270
The Wuyue Sect

532
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,380
takes protecting the martial arts world as our duty.

533
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,030
We would never do anything

534
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,720
to harm any of you.

535
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,610
What medicine did you give us?

536
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,630
Antidotes.

537
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,280
Who do you think we are?

538
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,480
You lied to us once.

539
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,710
Do you want to cheat us again?

540
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,780
What magical medicine?

541
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,150
I think it's imitating Mu Lang.

542
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,940
They want to control us with this magical medicine.

543
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,810
Are you talking about

544
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,450
the mixed poison pill?

545
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,250
Yes.

546
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,440
Let me tell you.

547
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,090
It's not magical medicine at all.

548
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,870
It's a poison that harms people.

549
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,010
What? Poison?

550
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,320
Isn't that a medicine that boosts one's force?

551
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,000
Indeed, after taking that medicine,

552
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,790
one's force can greatly increase in a short time.

553
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,050
But once consumed in a certain amount,

554
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,600
the body will explode and people who took it will die.

555
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,290
Explode and die?

556
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,100
How is that possible?

557
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,890
It's just a medicine that Mu Lang and Song Changsheng

558
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,510
used to manipulate the martial arts world.

559
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,860
What they used

560
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,560
is people's greed.

561
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,170
Indeed.

562
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,390
Everyone here

563
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,580
wants to be the best in the world.

564
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,010
But success

565
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,620
is never that easy.

566
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,350
We martial artists

567
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,250
should be down-to-earth.

568
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,810
Every progress we make

569
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,980
depends on our efforts and sweat.

570
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,080
Only in this way

571
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,720
can we step by step

572
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,100
become the person we want to be,

573
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,700
and not be controlled by anyone.

574
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,870
The medicine I give you today

575
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,530
can cure the poison of the mixed poison pill.

576
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,090
I guarantee it with my life.

577
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,640
Will you trust me?

578
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,690
Will you trust me?

579
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:56,990
Well...

580
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:02,560
Will you trust me?

581
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,800
Yes.

582
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,160
Me too.

583
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,620
Brother, get the antidote.

584
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:56,920
Sure.

585
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,520
Thank you.

586
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,590
Take it.

587
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,810
After taking this antidote,

588
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,080
your wound will heal soon.

589
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,960
The power of an egg hitting a stone is the strongest.

590
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:08,430
Yes.

591
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,710
Where there is light, there will be shadows.

592
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,740
The dark things will never disappear.

593
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,590
But I believe

594
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,870
as long as I'm here,

595
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,100
I will strive to eliminate

596
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,170
this injustice and darkness,

597
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,890
and make the martial arts world better.

598
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:22,360
Hey.

599
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,660
Junior sister,

600
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,240
when will you

601
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,590
succeed as the head of Wuyue Sect?

602
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,500
Right, Young Miss.

603
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,570
Yeah.

604
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,430
We're all waiting.

605
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,630
When?

606
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:47,010
Head Huo! Head Huo! Head Huo!

[The Heaven and Earth Share the Same Fate]

609
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,830
The heaven and earth share the same fate.

610
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,610
Today is the day I officially retire.

611
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,920
This is like the new waves move forward,

612
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,910
and the old waves die on the beach.

613
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,490
I'm old.

614
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,710
I'm old.

615
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,520
I'm old.

617
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,810
Today is a big day for Xingchen.

618
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,340
Have you invited that talented painter?

619
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,820
Make sure to paint more pictures for them.

620
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,750
I've invited him. He's currently painting.

621
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,330
Oh, that's good.

622
00:40:58,770 --> 00:40:59,900
Okay.

623
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,910
Hey.

624
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,160
Everyone, line up.

625
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,980
Xingchen will be here soon.

626
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,020
Line up. Line up.

Yes.
