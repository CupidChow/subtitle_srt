00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,490
Master Huo.

3
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,320
I'm counting on you.

4
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,400
Please!

5
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,820
I won't let you down.

6
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:40,740
Binghe.

7
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,610
Since you've come, come in.

8
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,030
Uncle Huo, I'm sorry.

9
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,320
Master Huo.

10
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,440
You should've heard my talk with my father.

11
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,190
If you're trying to persuade me
 to return to Wuyue Sect,

12
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,490
there's no need.

13
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,280
I'm not here to persuade you.

14
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,190
I have a request.

15
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,570
What is it?

16
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,780
It's about Yaoguang.

17
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,320
She doesn't want to follow me.

18
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,150
She's willing to follow you.

19
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,530
But since she was little,

20
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,900
she has never been far away from home.

21
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,780
I'm really worried about her.

22
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,780
Don't worry.

23
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,440
I will protect her.

24
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,690
She is not only your sister,

25
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,860
but also my friend.

26
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,280
Thank you.

27
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,570
Well, Xingchen,

28
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,940
take care of his sister.

29
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,570
Let's set off.

30
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,670
Okay.

31
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,690
Get on the horses.

32
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,900
Let's go.

33
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,610
What's wrong?
Are you unwilling to part with them?

34
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,740
It's not too late to catch up now.

35
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,030
Who said that?

36
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,280
By the way, I remember that

37
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,610
when I was in a coma,

38
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,530
you gave me a chance to make a wish.

39
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,900
You'll do whatever I say.

40
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,400
I don't remember. I don't know.

41
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,110
It's expired.

42
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,190
Are you okay?

43
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:42,940
Did you get hurt?

44
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:44,940
I'm fine.

45
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,990
Why is your internal force so powerful?

46
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,360
Internal force?

47
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,070
I'm now a master

48
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,490
with multi-60-year internal force.

49
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,530
But you've taken power-eliminating pills

50
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,940
Don't use force recently.

51
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,240
I don't know

52
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,320
whether those pills have any side effects.

53
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,320
Got it.

54
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,860
Jiang Buting.

55
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,650
Jiang Buting!

56
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,240
Jiang Buting!

57
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,529
Jiang Buting, are you alright?

58
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,940
Jiang Buting, wake up!

59
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,649
Wake up! Don't scare me!

60
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,610
Jiang Buting!

61
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,990
Doctor,

62
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,070
W-What's wrong with him?

63
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,650
Why did he fall down suddenly?

64
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,740
Is it because I pushed him?

65
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,610
Don't you know?

66
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,490
What should I know?

67
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,240
His physical condition.

68
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,490
What's wrong with him?

69
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,940
Buting

70
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,570
was born weak,

71
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,570
and he lost a lot of energy.

72
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,530
All these years, he has been relying on
the medicine I made for him

73
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,610
to extend his life.

74
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,690
By the way, he told me

75
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,190
he gave you the pill.

76
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,240
G-Give it to me?

77
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:06,860
Yes.

78
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,820
It's the pill that helps you recover.

79
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,110
It's the life-extending medicine for him.

80
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,570
Seemingly,

81
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,940
it should be the last one.

82
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,070
T-The last one?

83
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,360
W-What should we do now?

84
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,240
Doctor,

85
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,530
you are a miracle doctor. Save him, please!

86
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,740
You can make medicine for him.

87
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,280
Oh, my!

88
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,110
Don't worry. Don't worry!

89
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,280
The pill

90
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,820
indeed, could cure him.

91
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,490
But I just took his pulse.

92
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,610
His pulse is getting weaker.

93
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,740
I'm afraid that the pill

94
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,740
may not be able to extend his life
any longer.

95
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,440
Will he die?

96
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,360
No. H-He can't die.

97
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,490
Doctor,

98
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,030
I beg you.

99
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,490
You're a miracle doctor. Please cure him!

100
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,240
I-I've been making new medicine lately.

101
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,360
New medicine, you know.

102
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,440
But it can’t be developed

103
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,820
in a short time.

104
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,190
I hope he can hold on

105
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,110
until the day I develop the new medicine.

106
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,110
Oh my!

107
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,940
Alright, alright, alright! Leave me alone!

108
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,070
I'm going to make the medicine.

109
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,650
Be careful!

110
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,400
Buting, are you alright?

111
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,490
I'm fine.

112
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,780
Buting! Buting!

113
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:51,860
Wake up!

114
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,070
Buting! Buting!

115
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,530
Jiang Buting,

116
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,110
you risked your life

117
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,940
to save me twice.

118
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:19,940
But I...

119
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,490
But I don't know at all.

120
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,320
I always threw a tantrum at you.

121
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,360
Jiang Buting,

122
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,820
promise me.

123
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,860
You'll get better soon, okay?

124
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,740
Please.

125
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,280
You will recover soon,

126
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,780
Jiang Buting.

127
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,570
Why don't you go in?

128
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,610
Although I don't know too much about it,

129
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,780
but at times like these,

130
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,240
it's better to leave them alone.

131
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,860
I didn't realize that

132
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,360
your elder brother is so weak.

133
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,190
He has been weak since he was young.

134
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,280
No wonder he sits in a wheelchair.

135
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,360
Not necessarily.

136
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,780
He sits in a wheelchair

137
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,820
because he tends to slack off.

138
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,690
Anyhow,

139
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,360
Xingchen had just recovered.

140
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,820
but your brother fell ill.

141
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,690
This is really...

142
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,530
My brother has never been in health.

143
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,530
Plus, he has been in a mess these days.

144
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,940
He‘d fall ill sooner or later.

145
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:48,990
You're awake.

146
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,190
Do you feel better?

147
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,740
I'm fine.

148
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,360
I was too tired recently.

149
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,570
You didn't take a rest, did you?

150
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,490
You should go back to sleep.

151
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,240
Why? What's wrong?

152
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,610
I didn't offend you just now.

153
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:16,780
Jiang Buting,

154
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,650
you rejected me

155
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,820
because of your poor health, right?

156
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,820
It's too late today.

157
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,280
Let's talk tomorrow.

158
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,150
I can't wait till tomorrow.

159
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,110
Jiang Buting,

160
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,320
although you look mischievous,

161
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,110
and don't seem earnest,

162
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,190
You words can also be infuriating.

163
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,110
But...

164
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,110
I...I...

165
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,320
Anyway, I am into you.

166
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,070
Xingxing...

167
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,990
I won't take no for an answer!

168
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,990
Think carefully before you speak.

169
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,190
I don't mind whether you're healthy or not.

170
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,780
Even if you leave this world tomorrow,

171
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,690
or even the next moment,

172
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,110
but at this moment,

173
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,360
I want us to be together.

174
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,530
I attempted to give up on you many times,

175
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,240
but I failed.

176
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,490
You said

177
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,570
you don't like me.

178
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,280
but to save me,
you're willing to risk your life.

179
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,650
You've been speaking as if you dislike me.

180
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,030
but you always care about me.

181
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,320
You want me to give you up?

182
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,690
I can't do it！

183
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,900
It's all your fault.

184
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,530
Xingxing.

185
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,650
You're right.

186
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,690
Even if I have to leave this world tomorrow,

187
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
I want to cherish this moment.

188
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,360
You can't regret

189
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,400
what you said.

190
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,780
I will never regret it.

191
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,740
We have a solution!

192
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,440
He can be saved!

193
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,990
He can be saved!

194
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,320
But...

195
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,530
Save him. Hurry up!

196
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,490
How is he?

197
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,110
Why does he spit blood?

198
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,740
J-Jiang Buting!

199
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,530
Why does he faint?

200
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,690
That is why you need to hear me out?

201
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,690
What? But what?

202
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,990
Oh,

203
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,570
this medicine

204
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,740
can only relieve him for a while.

205
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,110
To cure him,

206
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,690
completely,

207
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,110
we need a famous ingredient.

208
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,690
What ingredient?

209
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,990
Ice Herb.

210
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,780
But Ice Herb grows 
on Kunlun Mountain of Tianque Sect,

211
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,440
yet Tianque Sect is now in seclusion.

212
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:51,740
T-This...

213
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,030
T-This is so annoying.

214
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,440
So, as long as we have Ice Herb,

215
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,610
he can be cured?

216
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,570
That's right.

217
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,780
You're awake.

218
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,030
Xingxing,

219
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,860
I thought I was going to lose you.

220
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,860
I have good news for you.

221
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,690
The doctor said

222
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,820
your condition is stable now.

223
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,740
As long as we can find Ice Herb,

224
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,610
your body can recover.

225
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,110
My master really said that?

226
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,440
So, you can be cured!

227
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,110
But...

228
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,190
Ice Herb

229
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,740
is not easy to get.

230
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,150
It is said that

231
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,150
it is the powerful cure of Tianque Sect.

232
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,740
The sect has been in seclusion for years.

233
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,740
Their men

234
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,490
haven't been seen in martial arts world
for a long time.

235
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,359
Don't worry. It's not a problem at all.

236
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:13,740
My grandma is the elder of Tianque Sect.

237
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,609
But the doctor said

238
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:18,940
you only have three months.

239
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,530
So we need to find Ice Herb

240
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,940
in three months.

241
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:23,819
we have to set off now.

242
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,359
We can't eat hot tofu in a hurry.

243
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,400
Ice Herb is right there.

244
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,320
It won't disappear.

245
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,190
Besides, if we're going to Tianque Sect,

246
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,280
we need to get everything settled first.

247
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,280
I'm worried, you know.

248
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,530
I’ll just go pack up.

249
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,190
The Legend of Circle Man: Yinling Valley.

250
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,940
That day,

251
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,360
Circle Man ventured into Yinling Valley.

252
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,030
But unexpectedly...

253
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,360
It's a long journey.

254
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,070
We don't know what will happen
along the way.

255
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,900
That event of Yin Fengmian

256
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,110
was very troublesome.

257
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,860
After that...

258
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,190
Stroke-writer published a new book!

259
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,440
What is it?

260
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,070
Let me have a look.

261
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,780
Stroke-writer finally published a new book.

262
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,610
His previous book The Legend of Fork Man

263
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,780
is really good.

264
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,490
Yes.

265
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,690
Is it still a story of Fork Man?

266
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,530
This is the latest serial.

267
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,990
The Legend of Circle Man,
an story of a mutant man in Yinling Valley.

268
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,780
We've reached the final crucial moment.

269
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:38,650
Bodies are scattered everywhere,
and the blood is flowing like a river.

270
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,030
But the demon is still laughing wildly.

271
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,820
At that moment,

272
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,280
in such a case,

273
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,360
Circle Man defeated the demon,

274
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,190
and saved martial arts world from danger.

275
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,530
Such an extraordinary heroine.

276
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,240
What is the background of her?

277
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,070
Circle Man is the young miss of Wuyue Sect.

278
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,110
Huo Xingchen.

279
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,360
I saw her with my own eyes.

280
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,990
Stroke-writer wrote a book for her.

281
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,650
You stooped to this, Stroke-writer!

282
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,820
That's right.

283
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,900
From now on,

284
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,780
I won't read his works any more.

285
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,900
I think the new serial is interesting.

286
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,860
Circle Man turned the tide at the critical moment.

287
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,190
Yes, she saved the whole martial arts world.

288
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,900
Nonsense!

289
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,070
Who cares about the whims of the young miss?

290
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,490
We even don't know if she did it herself.

291
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,110
If Fork Man were there,

292
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,190
it's not her turn to show off.

293
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,530
That's right.

294
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,610
Boring.

295
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,610
Let's go.

296
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:30,190
Let's go.

297
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:30,940
You're narrow-minded.

298
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,530
A master of righteousness

299
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,190
has nothing to do with strength, weakness,
or gender.

300
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,860
-That's right. -Yes. Right.

301
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,900
This is a medicine pattern.

302
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,740
It's formed by multi-60-year power.

303
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,440
Master,

304
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,990
what's this?

305
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,400
Why is the pattern like this?

306
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,490
The medicine she swallowed,

307
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,070
has gathered multi-60-year power.

308
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,530
I knew it.

309
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,070
It's not that easy to eliminate.

310
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,900
Is she at risk of

311
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,190
exploding and dying?

312
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,570
Don't panic.

313
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,530
It has faded.

314
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,820
It's lighter.

315
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,530
How can a single pill

316
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,820
e-eliminate all the power?

317
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,070
I'm going to get a batch of such pills.

318
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,740
After you leave,

319
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,360
you can take them on the way.

320
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,360
Remember.

321
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,690
Don't disturb me.

322
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,030
-Okay. -Okay.

323
00:21:59,150 --> 00:21:59,940
Thank you, doctor.

324
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,030
Master,

325
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,030
I'm leaving.

326
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,610
Take care. Take care.

327
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,990
And I have something to tell you.

328
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,190
These are all power-eliminating pills,

329
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,820
but each one is different.

330
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,360
I've never

331
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,190
encountered such cases before.

332
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,070
These pills

333
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,570
are experimental ones.

334
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,570
Experimental?

335
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,440
Master, is it okay to take them?

336
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:48,740
It won't cause much problem.

337
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,740
It may cause some minor problems.

338
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,360
She might recover soon.

339
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,190
Remember,

340
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,650
every time she takes the pills,

341
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,650
you should take experimental notes
carefully.

342
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,360
When you take a certain amount of notes,

343
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,900
send them to me, okay?

344
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,940
I see.

345
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,940
