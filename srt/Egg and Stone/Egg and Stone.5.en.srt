and sent a letter with a paper plane.

What's wrong?

14
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,270
My stomach hurts.

00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,810
You're dying. Why are you still so stubborn?

179
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:48,390
I don't have anything.

180
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:48,860
Together.

181
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:49,560
What are you doing?

182
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,140
What are you doing?

183
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:54,600
Let go of me!

184
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:55,520
Nothing left.

185
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,560
Take him away.

186
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Put down...

187
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,850
Give me everything.

188
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,220
I'll do it myself.

189
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,640
What's in your neck?

190
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,930
Nothing left. Really.

191
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,140
Give it to me.

192
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,850
I can't give this to you.

193
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,560
Behave yourself.

194
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,100
I can give you everything else.

195
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,560
This is from my fiancee.

196
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,640
I promised her

197
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,810
I'll keep it with me.

198
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,480
Stop dreaming.

199
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,850
You still want to go out of here?

200
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,560
You can't even protect yourself.

201
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,270
Take him away.

202
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,730
No!

203
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,180
Give me everything.

204
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,560
I've never seen anyone so poor.

205
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,270
Take him away.

206
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,640
Give me everything.

207
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,140
That's all.

208
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,350
Nothing else left?

209
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,680
Nothing.

210
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,770
What?

211
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,640
Go over there.

212
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:22,810
What are you waiting for?

213
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,920
You people

214
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,430
will be punished sooner or later.

215
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,520
Punish?

216
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,480
Listen, stay still

217
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,060
or you'll suffer.

218
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,020
Give me back the jade!

219
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,350
Give me back the jade!

220
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,850
Give me back the jade!

221
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,180
Let me out! Let me out!

222
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:40,940
Hey!

223
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,430
Stop howling.

224
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,390
Now that you're here,

225
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,850
live as long as I can.

226
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:46,730
What are you making a scene?

227
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,670
Let me out!

228
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,560
Let me out!

229
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:52,730
Get in!

230
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,230
Goodness.

231
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:54,520
Take him away.

232
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:55,730
I don't want to leave.

233
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,430
I don't want to go.

234
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,560
I'm not going.

235
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,640
Help!

236
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,350
Help! I don't want to go!

237
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,020
Brother! Brother!

238
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,310
No.

239
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,390
I'm the only child my father has.

240
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,850
I have to stay alive.

241
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,310
I'm indispensable to the martial arts world.

242
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,230
I have to get out first to find evidence.

243
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,850
Dig! Dig!

244
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,310
Dig a tunnel and escape!

245
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,680
Dig! Dig!

246
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,890
This spoon is so hard to use.

247
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,730
Yu.

248
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,310
We made a deal.

249
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,180
After I go back,

250
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,850
I'll marry you

251
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,020
with the grandest ceremony.

252
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,280
But now, I'm framed by a villain.

253
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,930
Yu.

254
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,720
Ah!

255
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,640
Brother, why are you yelling?

256
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,850
Do you know what time it is?

257
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,770
You can miss your Yu

258
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,480
quietly in your heart.

259
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,340
You're a little weird.

260
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,390
If you don't like me,

261
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,640
you can change to another cell.

262
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,180
Yu is so nice.

263
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,890
Why can't I miss her openly?

264
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:52,770
You're disturbing others.

265
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:53,960
Hey.

266
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,170
Sir,

267
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,770
the most important thing

268
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,640
in the martial arts world is harmony.

269
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,730
Come on.

270
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,140
Everyone is miserable.

271
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:04,890
Maybe

272
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,810
this is the last day he can miss Yu.

273
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:08,930
But

274
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,600
if you think he's annoying,

275
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,730
you can pretend not to hear

276
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,980
or pretend not to hear?

277
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,480
Right.

278
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,600
What's wrong with him missing his fiancee?

279
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,810
Can't he?

280
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,980
What if he disturbed you?

281
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,140
That's right.

282
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,590
You're alone.

283
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,310
No one loves you.

284
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,140
It's a pity that no one loves you.

285
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,230
Why are you personally attacking me?

286
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,480
Yes.

287
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,850
So what?

288
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,310
Hit me!

289
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,520
Yu, the world is cold.

290
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,100
The day we'll meet is far away.

291
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,270
Some people are still being sarcastic.

292
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,640
I'm not. I didn't.

293
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,430
Don't talk nonsense.

294
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:57,770
Sir,

295
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,600
what's your name?

296
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,600
My surname is Chen.

297
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,270
My first name is Jie.

298
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:03,960
Oh.

299
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,600
Brother Chen.

300
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,180
You have to be confident that

301
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,850
we can definitely escape.

302
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,020
When I escape,

303
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,130
I'll go to your wedding ceremony.

304
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,680
You're right.

305
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,100
I can't be dispirited.

306
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,810
Yu is waiting for me at home.

307
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,480
Your Yu

308
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,060
must be a very good girl.

309
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,480
Yes.

310
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,770
She is the best woman

311
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,560
in the world.

312
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,640
Jie,

313
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,850
when you travel the martial arts world,

314
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,140
you must always remember

315
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,890
I will wait for you in this peach forest.

316
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,060
[Yu (Jade)]

317
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,890
Don't worry.

318
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,310
Yu is waiting for me in the peach forest.

319
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,180
Why didn't you bring her out?

320
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,350
The outside world is too dangerous

321
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,140
to women.

322
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,270
I don't want her to risk her life.

323
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,480
You didn't even ask her.

324
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,810
Maybe she's not afraid.

325
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,100
Shut up!

326
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,640
Sleep.

327
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,890
Open the door.

328
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:19,890
Kid.

329
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,600
Come out with me.

330
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,810
Not bad.

331
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,520
You're quite sensible.

332
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,880
All of you should

333
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,850
learn from him.

334
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,640
Do you hear me?

335
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,680
I have to get out of here.

336
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,150
Go.

337
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:22,770
This...

338
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,140
Master.

339
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,020
Master.

340
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,180
I don't want you to test the medicine yourself.

341
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,930
As long as you're healthy,

342
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,390
I'd rather be sick.

343
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:57,930
Child.

344
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,390
If I don't try the medicine myself,

345
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,600
how would I know if it works?

346
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,180
Don't worry.

347
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,730
I will cure you.

348
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,130
Ah.

349
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,230
Master.

350
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,090
Young and handsome hero.

351
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,520
Master.

352
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,770
Is this the Gold Pill you lost?

353
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,560
Or is this the Silver Pill you lost?

354
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,140
Whether it's gold or silver,

355
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,680
the medicine can cure the disease.

356
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,770
It's good for your body.

357
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,770
You'll be the supreme hero of the martial arts world.

358
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,560
If you want that one, you'll succeed.

359
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,310
It doesn't matter if it's gold or silver.

360
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,890
Hero. Which pill do you want?

361
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,340
I want one pill after another.

362
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,890
But don't shout.

363
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,230
Come on.

364
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,680
Master.

365
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,840
Hey.

366
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,060
How much is it? Master.

367
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,360
Hello?

368
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,310
Can you be quiet?

369
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,270
We have to stay in jail in a civilized way.

370
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,180
Why are you disturbing our sleep at night?

371
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,530
Hey.

372
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,390
Can you keep your voice down?

373
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,060
Don't let the guard hear you.

374
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,980
It's none of my business.

375
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,770
I won't be taken away anyway.

376
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,770
Listen.

377
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:18,670
If you knock again,

378
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,810
I'll call all of them over.

379
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,980
Do you know we're in danger?

380
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,640
I don't know.

381
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,060
But I know

382
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,770
if you disturb me again,

383
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,180
I'll put you in danger.

384
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,230
Are you not going to stop today?

385
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,560
Fine, I won't sleep tonight either.

386
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:50,680
Let's have fun knocking.

387
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,060
Calm down.

388
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,560
Huo Xingchen, calm down.

389
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,930
Your main task now is to escape.

390
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,100
Listen.

391
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,270
Don't let me see you.

392
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,060
I'll beat you up every time I see you.

393
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,600
I don't have time to talk to you now.

394
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,700
Yo.

395
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,520
Hit me every time you see me?

396
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,140
Come and beat me, wimp.

397
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,720
Come and kill me! Please!

398
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,180
Come and hit me! Come and hit me!

399
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,140
Hold it.

Hold it. Hold it.

401
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,430
Hit me if you dare.

402
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,520
Why did you stop?

403
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,600
Come on.

404
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:30,810
Hit me!

Hit me! Hit me!

406

Fine.

407
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,680
I won't go out today.

408
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,810
I, Master Huo,

rank third in the martial arts world.

410
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,180
You think I can't deal with you?

411
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,890
Ridiculous.

412
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,020
Rank third? Master Huo?

413
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,180
Huo Xingchen!

414
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,220
What a sin!

415
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,560
Didn't she go back to the Wuyue Sect?

416
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,770
Why is she here?

417
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,060
Come on.

418
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,600
Go take a look.

419
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,730
Shut up!

420

The one with poor Kungfu

421
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,100
turns out to be the most noisy one.

422
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,430
Okay, I'll go check it out.

423
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,980
Stop arguing.

424
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,200
It's not me. It's not me.

425
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,390
Who else could it be?

426
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,350
I wanted to take you

427
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,590
to live a good life there.

428
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,930
Since you're so disobedient,

429
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,770
then forget it. I won't take you.

430
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:30,810
Hey, Brother.

431
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,560
Where are you taking me?

432
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,100
You know prisoners here

As long as anyone obeys,

435
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,180
I'll take him to a good place.

436
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,480
A good place?

437
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,060
Where is it?

438
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,310
Brother.

Come on.

441

Brother.

442
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,590
She is not suitable for

443
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,930
that kind of place.

444
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,890
Take me.

445
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,480
How can you be so despicable?

446
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,140
Brother, take me there.

447

Huo.

448
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,640
Do you know where that is?

449
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,350
Brother.

Take me with you.

I guess everyone wants to go.

In that case,

I was abducted.

477

Luckily, a hero saved me.

By the way, brother.

Yes.

that many murders occurred in Elixir Village.

528
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:17,680
Xingchen!

529
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,890
Don't come over!

530
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,390
No!

531
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,730
Don't come over!

532
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:50,390
Help!

533
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,060
Help!

534
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,850
Help! Help!

535
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:53,560
Is anyone there?

536
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,480
What are you yelling about?

537
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,390
Shut up!

538
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,350
Hurry up.

539
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,640
Brother, look.

540
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,140
Look over there.

541
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,230
Look, there's a green thing glowing.

542
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:01,850
Swish.

543
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,100
It keeps glowing. Look.

544
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,230
This is so scary. Come on.

545
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,480
Over there.

546
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,350
No.

547
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,060
Oh my!

548
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,140
No.

549
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:28,390
Oh my!

550
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,350
Help! Help!

551
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,310
Oh my god!

552
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,310
Wait.

553
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,930
Why haven't I seen this person in white robe before?

554
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,310
Hey, you...

555
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,520
Bad news.

556
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,230
The mutant's prison has been opened.

557
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,640
What? Mutants are out?

558
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,430
Forget it. They have all escaped.

559
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,180
Life is more important.

560
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:06,850
Help!

561
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,270
Oh my god!

562
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,520
Help!

563
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,810
Help!

564
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,140
Fork Man!

565
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,100
Help!

566
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,020
Oh my!

567
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:52,680
Go!

568
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,430
Go!

569
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,310
Go! Go! Go!

570
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,140
Go!

571
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,270
Don't be afraid.

572
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:34,480
Don't be afraid.

573
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,850
Come with me.

574
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,520
Xingchen, don't be afraid. Hold this door.

575
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,930
They won't be able to get in.

576
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,460
♫Wow, baby♫

577
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,490
♫I can touch the clouds in fairy tales♫

578
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,240
