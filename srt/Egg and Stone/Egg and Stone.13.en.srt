Oh.

5
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:58,720
What a pity.

6
00:00:58,930 --> 00:00:59,980
A lot of money was spent

7
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,430
to make this furnace.

8
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,060
It's not a pity.

9
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,430
It doesn't matter.

10
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,410
But...

11
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,640
This is a furnace to make magic power pills.

12

Doctor Song...

15

Go...

16
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,100
Fine.

17
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,850
Interesting.

18
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,480
Interesting.

19
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,600
Doctor,

20
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:20,960
what...

21
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,350
what happened?

22
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,140
Gosh.

23
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,930
You are so annoying. She won't die.

24
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,890
Then tell me,

25
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,430
why hasn't she woken up?

26
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,230
She inhaled the multi-60-year power
with one breath.

27
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,600
Her internal force is in chaos now.

28
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,760
She is lucky enough
not dying from explosion,

29
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,480
She just faints away.

30
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,060
She should count her blessings.

31
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,350
Dying from explosion?

32
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,230
Doctor,

33
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,270
please save Xingchen.

even a skilled martial artist
with strong internal force

36
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,140
cannot take it.

37
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,140
Doctor,

38
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,350
please save Xingchen.

39
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,600

40
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,520
All right.

Shut up!

42
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,770

43
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,640
Besides,

44

This is such an interesting phenomenon.

Before figuring out what is going on,

47
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,310
I won't let her die.

48
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,480
How could you say that?

49
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,590
Calm down, everyone.

Xingchen is fine now.

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,980
She needs further treatment.

54

Don't worry.

55

Master, I'll stay here.

73
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,260
What if I can help you?

74
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,730

to make her my sister-in-law?

80
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,640
Why do you ask?

81
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,460
Brother,

82
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,520
I'm not a child anymore.

83
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,890
I'm about the same age as Xingchen.

84
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,850
What are you trying to say?

85
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,980
What I am trying to say is

86
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,060
you should probably

87
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,140
forget it.

88
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,890
I can feel

89
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,770
the chemistry between
Xingchen and Jiang Buting.

90
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:21,440
Brother,

91
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,390
the engagement between you two

92
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,730
didn't happen after all.

93
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,810
She's not your fiance yet.

94
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,930
There must be

95
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,310
other good girls out there.

96
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,980
Enough.

97
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,440
Brother,

98
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,850
I'm serious.

99
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,310
Whose sister are you?

100
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,640
Huo Xingchen is on his side.

101
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,560
Are you siding with him too?

102
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,270
Of course I'm your sister.

103
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,480
If I were on someone else's side,

104
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,980
I wouldn't have said that.

105
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,770
I just

106
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,480
don't want you to be sad.

107
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,980
Go away.

108
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:43,980
Brother Mu,

109
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,560

110
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,390
to explore the world.

111
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,930
You can go now.

112
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,550
OK.

113
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,310

and his brother, Yin Fengci

117
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,230
Half of the people have been arranged

118
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,270
to be taken back to Wuyue Sect.

119
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,230
Alright.

120
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,140
Is he awake?

121
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,890
Not yet.

122
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,270
He’s badly injured.

123
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,980
The case of Elixir Village
has been delayed for too long.

124
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,380
Although it was reported
on the Breaking News,

125
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,890
many people

126
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,060
are discussing it stealthly.

127
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,480
Now that the case has been closed,

128
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,680
We should give everyone an explanation.

129
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:46,520
Uncle,

130
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,230
should we reveal the astonishing truth

131
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,850
to everyone?

132
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,350
Of course.

133
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,770
But we need to figure out

134
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,020
how to announce it.

135
00:07:59,230 --> 00:07:59,810
Got it.

136
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,140
Uncle,

137
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,480
how is Xingchen now?

138
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,980
Doctor Song just said she won't die.

139
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,840
The rest cannot be guaranteed.

140
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,730
This is not how we should handle it.

141
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,310
Should we seek help from other doctors?

142
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,720
There must be a way.

143
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,640
Not for now.

144
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,350
I know Doctor Song very well.

145
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,340
He hates people meddling in his business.

146
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,310
Seeking help might make things worse.

147
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,890
Let's

148
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,640
wait patiently.

149
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,600
Okay.

150
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,430
Master,

151
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,520
the medicine is ready.

152
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,570
OK.

153
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,430
How is Xingxing?

154
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,230
Well,

155
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,350
Her internal force is a mess.

156
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,850
The multi-60-year power is moving around
in her body.

157
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,770
I've used acupuncture

158
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,560
to suppress it.

159
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,060
When will she wake up?

160
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,480
How should I know?

161
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,180
Maybe she will wake up in a second.

162
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,930
Or,

163
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,140
it could take days or weeks.

164
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,480
Master, what is this?

165
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,130
The blood eliminated from her body
by acupuncture.

166
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,890
I'm going to study the case by myself.

167
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,680
I'm warning you.

168
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,100
Don't disturb me.

169
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,600
You know my temper.

170
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:33,980
If you dare to disturb me, I will...

171
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,890
By the way,

172
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,230
keep an eye on her.

173
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,810
Don't let anyone touch her.

174
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,140
And besides the medicine that you brought,

175
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,560
don't feed her anything.

176
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,020
Got it.

177
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,180
She's my most important
experiment subject now.

178
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,390
Master,

179
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,100
she's not a experiment subject.

180
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,020
She's a patient.

181
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,060
She is what I said she is.

182
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,850
You are my experiment subject too.

183
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,810
Master is still

184
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:13,850
naughty.

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,550
Here.

186
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,890
Take some medicine.

187
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:41,790
Hey.

188
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,540
♫Who is♫

189
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,520

♫And falls from the clouds♫

202

I'm the head of the family.

I will protect you.

♫I'll look for it forever♫

209

Huo Xingchen.

217

Didn't you say that

218
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,980
you want to test

219

you can wake up before sunset today,

What are you doing here?

254
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,550
I am here to see Xingchen.

255
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,560
Listen,

256
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,680
Even though she and I haven't married yet,

257
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,600
we grew up together,

258
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,140
and have been close friends since childhood.

259
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,270
My master said

260
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,770
no one can disturb her.

261
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:32,890
Please go.

262
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,390
I want to stay with her in private.

263
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,390
No.

264
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:40,680
Jiang Buting.

265
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,480
I've had enough of you.

266
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:42,950
What?

267
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
You are well aware of

268
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,390
my relation with Xingxing,

269
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,480
but still,
you have no self-awareness at all.

270
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,020
She wanted you only because
she wanted to try something new.

271
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,610
Hey.

272
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,390
Thank you.

273
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,800
I'm newer than you.

274
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,430
What are you going to do about it?

275
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,600
How are you newer than me?

276
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,980
Because I am younger than you.

277
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,520
But you look old.

278
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,390
Do you think you are so good?

279
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,310
You're blocking me.

280
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,930
Stop it.

281
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,560
♫I sigh when I feel the wind on my ears♫

282

♫Fate couldn’t make a turn in time♫

♫How plodding will this long road be?♫

284

♫I couldn’t see through

♫I’m most afraid of

♫Will the time be less heartbreaking?♫

287
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,810
♫The memory is like a lonely sail♫

288
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,320
♫I can hear the distant shore calling♫

289

♫How much more turbulence do I have to endure before I reach the shore?♫

♫There's no such thing as you in this world♫

302

♫I won't regret staying with you♫

305
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:35,810
I didn't expect

306
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,520
the small Yinling Valley

307
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,730
is as dirty as hell.

308
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,020
So far,

309
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,550
The number of proven victims

310
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,560
has surpassed one thousand.

311
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,350
They were all masters in martial arts.

312
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,730
For ten years,

313
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,380
for such a long time,

314
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,020
we knew nothing about it

315
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,230
here at Wuyue Sect.

316
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,100
Uncle,

317
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,560
You need some rest.

318
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,890
Take care of yourself.

319
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,230
Don’t be angry.

320
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,520
The head of Yinling Valley

321
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:06,849
didn't have a good reputation.

322
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,560
Anyone who was somewhat skillful

323
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,849
would never join him.

324
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,680
But Yinling Valley

325
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,060
had a culture of worshiping the strongest.

326
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:14,599
In order to be stronger,

327
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:16,140
they could do anything.

328
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,349
The longing for strength

329
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,390
made them go astray.

330
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,180
Master.

331
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:24,680
Go ahead.

332
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,730
He's awake.

333
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:35,880
Give me the medicine.

334
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,560
I can't accept it.

335
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,390
I can't accept it.

336
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,270
For all these years,

337
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:46,980
I was so close.

338
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,060
So close.

339
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,140
Look at what you have done.

340
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,770
The whole world

341
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,140
will never accept you again.

342
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,980
Success always comes with a price.

343
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,810
If I have succeeded,

344
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,730
no one would know about it.

345
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,430
It's you.

346
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,850
You ruined it.

347
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,060
To pursue this success of yours,

348
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,480
you killed so many people.

349
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,270
You are unbearable.

350
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,060
As the head of the valley,

351
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,930
you are willing to stay corrupted

352
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,270
to get stronger.

353
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,930
You don't value people's lives at all!

354
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,060
Shut up!

355
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,100
When Yinling Valley was established,

356
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,600
you drew a bug

357
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,520
on a blank flag.

358
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:31,980
Shut up!

359
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,850
Shut up!

360
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,140
You said

361
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,810
you are not suitable for
practicing martial arts.

362
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,270
You said you are like the little fireflies,

363
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,390
trying to shine.

364
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,350
A firefly

365
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,390
may be weak,

366
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:51,310
but when many fireflies gather together,

367
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,680
they will light up the night.

368
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,850
Do you remember

369
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,180
your belief back then?

370
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,060
So what?

371
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,560
I've long forgotten.

372
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,180
Being a bug

373
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,600
will only make people look down on you.

374
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,140
Look.

375
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,560
People in the martial arts world

376
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,140
despised Yinling Valley.

377
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,770
I wanted to be stronger.

378
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,270
What did I do wrong?

379
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,350
You were not wrong.

380
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,850
It has been a long time

381
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,770
since you took a careful look
of Yinling Valley.

382
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,980
Your apprentices had high self esteem.

383
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,850
They were passionate.

384
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,430
What have they become now?

385
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,980
They've become stronger.

386
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,890
Didn't you see that?

387
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,850
Every one of them

388
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,730
has become stronger.

389
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,310
It seems that

390
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,600
you will never change your mind

391
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,770
to admit your fault.

392
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,390
I will take you back to the Wuyue Sect,

393
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,100
and announce your sentence

394
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,890
under the Sword of Martial Arts

395
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,060
to give an explanation to the world.

396
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,390
An explanation?

397
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,930
No way!

398
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,350
You ruined my plan.

399
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,010
I should have become
the strongest master in the world.

400
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,390
If I had become
the strongest martial art master,

401
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,730
I should have the final say in this world.

402
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,270
If there is a next life,

403
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,520
I swear I will the strongest in the world.

404
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,730
How come he is like this?

405
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,140
The practice of all martial arts

406
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,220
requires hard work

407
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,560
and day-to-day training.

408
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,260
If anyone wants to take the shortcut,

409
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,640
there's always a price.

410
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,390
It seems like

411
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,350
the Poison Pill

412
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,310
can backfire

413
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,600
and be lethal

414
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,770
if taken to excess.

415
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,180
People taking the Poison Pill

416
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,890
include more than just our Valley Master.

417
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,100
They probably didn't know

418
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:11,770
it's fatal,

419
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:12,930
right?

420
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,350
Judging by the Valley Master's reaction,

421
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,640
he was clueless.

422
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:18,480
It seems

423
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,850
he got played too.

424
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,020
The real puppeteer lurks in the shadows.

425
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,060
We must apprehend this person promptly,

426
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,310
or more people will die

427
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,930
The calamity in martial art world must end!

428
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:33,710
Right.

429
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,310
The Yinling Valley Master's gone.

430
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,100
The Poison Pill meant for you

431
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,480
was ingested by Huo Xingchen,

432
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,220
but she survived.

433
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,960
Really?

434
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,020
We've been scratching our heads for ages,

435
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,600
trying to figure out

436
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,980
how to use this pill's power

437
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,930
without suffering the backlash.

438
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,270
What exactly sets this Huo Xingchen apart?

439
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,730
Excuse me.

play nice with Doctor Song.

I'm sorry

00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,520
that I messed up before.

00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,430

Xing,

471
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,140
it's been a whole week.

472
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,180
If you don't wake up soon,

473
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,850
it might be too late...

474
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:05,890
What are you doing?

475
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,020
Taking her with me.

476
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,850
Look at her! How do you plan to take her?

477
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,020
Who gave you the permission?

478
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,430
I did.

479
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,140
It’s already been seven days,

480
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,980
and Xingchen still hasn’t woken up!

481
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,850
I can't wait any longer.

482
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,560
I'm taking her back to the Wuyue Sect.

483
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,350
Uncle,

484
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,640
please look at Xingchen's condition.

485
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,310
What if something happens on the way?

486
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:28,560
Besides,

487
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,140
what's the point of going to the Wuyue Sect?

488
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,930
I'll send out a notice,

489
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,810
get the best doctors to help her.

490
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,560
Uncle...

491
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,430
Put her down!

492
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,020
Leave the girl be,

493
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,730
and do not disturb her.

Master.

496
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,890
Step aside.

497
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,930
Master,

498
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:55,810
you've got the antidote, right?

499
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,980
Thank you, Master.

500
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,100
She's looking better!

501
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,560
Thank god!

503
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,310
Is she...

504
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,640
Is she almost recovered?

505
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
She's getting better, right?

506
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,980
I'm not sure.

507
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:42,990
But...

508
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,180
But we have to try, right?

509
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,180
There's no one like this before, after all.

510
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,850
Doctor Song,

511
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,270
what did you give her just now?

512
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,600
Kungfu-dissolving Pill.

513
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,680
You're a living Hua Tuo, Doctor Song.

514
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,180
I'm just doing my job.

515
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,640
Just experimenting.

516
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,180
Seems the result is decent so far.

517
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,680
But as for her future state,

518
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:08,980
I can't predict.

519
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:09,480
What?

520
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,770
But Doctor Song,

521
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,060
How could you let her take it?

522
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,260
What if...

523
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,310
Young man,

524
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:16,930
You won't know if it works

525
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,810
until you try.

526
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,270
I'm telling you,

527
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,100
if anyone else had treated her,

528
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,270
she would be in

529
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,180
a much worse condition.

530
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,640
Well, Doctor Song,

531
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,230
are there any side effects?

532
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,230
What if something goes wrong?

533
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,020
He's right!

534
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,100
Side effects?

535
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,810
Just in case.

536
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,270
Shh!

537
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,430
My only concern is to treat and save lives.

538
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,180
Xing.

539
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,050
Xingchen.

540
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,270
Xing.

541
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:06,730
Xing.

542
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:15,640
Xing.

543
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,060
Xing,

544
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,020
I'm listening.

545
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,480
I've seized it...

546
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:24,810
the opportunity.

547
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,060
Keep your word.

548
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,720
I will.

549
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,480
Xingchen!

550
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,520
Xingchen, are you looking for me?

551
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,560
Xingchen!

552
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,230
Oh, Xingchen! Thank goodness!

553
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,020
You're finally awake, aren't you?

554
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,180
Daddy's been worried sick, Xingchen.

555
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,430
That's right.

556
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,810
It's good that you're awake.

557
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,640
We were all so worried about you.

558
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,060
Xingchen, it's me.

559
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,850
Do you know how long you've been sleeping?

560
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:55,140
Mu.

561
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,060
I've been so worried about you these days.

562
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,850
My daughter.

563
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,060
you really slept for a long time.

564
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:00,770
Are you hungry?

565
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,350
You gave us such a scare.

566
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,230
Talk to me, dear.

567
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:05,310
Want something to eat?

568
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,560
Get better soon and come home with daddy.

569
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:21,680
Mu Yaoguang,

570
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,310
Did you trim your beard?

571
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:27,270
Why?

572
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,600
Hurry up and get your stuff.

573
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,730
We're heading back to Wuyue Sect.

574
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:33,850
Brother.

575
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,020
I don't want to go back.

576
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,100
What?

577
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,850
I don't want to go back!

578
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,230
Do you even know what you're saying?

579
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,140
I...

580
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,430
I don't want to go back.

581
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,160
Brother.

582
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,100
I used to live a sheltered life,

583
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,480
and never ventured out into the world.

584
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,680
But now I've seen it for myself,

585
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,680
and I'm amazed

586
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,180
at how beautiful it is.

587
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,810
You've only been out for a short while.

588
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,520
What makes you so drawn to this?

589
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:32,810
What's gotten into you?

590
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,480
Are you trying to be like Xingchen now?

591
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:36,790
Brother,

592
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,260
Xingchen and I have long outgrown childhood.

593
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,100
Before I figure out what I truly desire,

594
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,090
I want to make it clear

595
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,560
what I don't want.

596
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,230
I don't want to be confined,

597
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,230
with every move and action scrutinized.

598
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,980
I don't want to be married off

599
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,680
at the behest of parents,

600
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,020
living for some other guys.

601
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
And I don't want

602
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,100
to live my life like a bird in a cage,

603
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,270
unable to spread my wings and fly.

604
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,020
So, what exactly do you desire?

605
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,180
I want...

606
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,520
I want to live for myself once.

607
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,770
even if it's just for a while.

608
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,540
Brother,

609
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,810
please.

610
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:35,560
I will come back by myself

611
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,310
when the time comes.

612
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:42,950
Brother.

613
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,600
Please!

614
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:54,910
Fine.

615
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,350
I can agree to that.

616
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,560
Really?

617
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,390
But you have to promise me one thing.

618
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,730
What is it?

619
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,980
I want you to keep a record of everything

620
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,560
that happens to Xingchen and Jiang Buting,

621
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,390
and send me a letter by pigeon everyday.

622
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:12,480
No way!

623
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,470
Brother,

624
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,640
what are you trying to do?

625
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,930
Xingchen is not even your fiancee yet.

626
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,730
How is your behavior

627
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,730
different from surveillance?

628
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,020
Yaoguang,

629
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,560
don't you know my feelings for Xingchen?

630
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,310
Even if

631
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,140
we can't be together in the future,

632
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,390
she's still my childhood sweetheart.

633
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,060
I would never do anything to hurt her.

634
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,680
I'm worried about Jiang Buting.

635
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:43,890
You know,

636
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,180
Xingchen is the daughter

637
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,350
of the Wuyue Sect's Head.

638
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,810
You have no idea how many people

639
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,520
want to put her in danger.

640
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,270
Jiang Buting definitely has some reasons

641
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,310
for being close to her.

642
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:58,770
But

643
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,350
Jiang Buting doesn't seem deceitful.

644
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,640
I've been around them

645
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,770
for a while now.

646
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,730
Yaoguang,

647
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,060
you need to remember that

648
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,230
the most terrifying thing isn't ghosts,

649
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,300
but human nature.

650
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,480
I've told you this before:

651
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,550
it's always important to be...

652
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,810
Be wary of others.

653
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:23,430
Look,

654
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:24,930
you know that

655
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,060
I'm doing all this for you and Xingchen.

656
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,640
I just want to do something

657
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,270
to protect you and her.

658
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,230
Will you do that for me?

659
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:52,950
Will you?

660
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,090
Well...

661
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,220
I guess...

662
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,310
okay.

663
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,020
I'll be waiting for your record.

664
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:15,390
Brother.

665
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:17,890
What are you doing here?

666
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,680
When did you get here?

667
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,890
I'm looking for our master.

668
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,850
The treatment of the mutants is almost done.

669
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,560
They asked when we are going to help them.

670
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,640
Our master needs to rest.

671
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,390
He's been working himself to the bone

672
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,520
trying to save Xingchen.

673
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,310
He must be exhausted.

674
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:38,430
Bro, I mean,

675
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,430
now that Xingchen is awake.

676
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,680
Why aren't you there with her?

677
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
What are you doing here?

678
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,770
Isn't she being taken care of in there?

679
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,520
Millet porridge?

680
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:00,730
Brother,

681
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,810
you're so weird.

682
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,810
What do you mean?

683
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,640
Don't you know how much you did

684
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,060
for her in the past seven days?

685
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,810
Now she's awake

686
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:08,889
and you're just here making porridge?

687
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:10,719
You have to tell her what you did,

688
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,679
or it'll all be for nothing.

689
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,060
Come on,

690
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,270
don't talk nonsense.

691
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,230
Go practice your swordplay.

692
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:16,429
Got it.

693
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,850
I'll leave you to your porridge.

694
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:18,290
Just go!

695
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,480
Hey, bro!

696
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,480
What's up?

697
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,139
Listen,

698
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,980
I just came up with a new sword technique

699
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:50,980
- Super Duper Lightning Thunder Slash!

700
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,280
Oh,

701
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,380
it's a bit tricky,

702
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,100
so don't blink!

703
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,730
Watch closely!

704
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,640
That's it?

705
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:33,770
That's it.

706
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,310
Pretty cool, huh?

707
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,730
You...

708
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,650
I...

709
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,230
You...

710
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,030
I...

711
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,430
I can explain!

712
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,020
You shaved your beard？

713
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,770
I almost didn't recognize you.

714
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,480
Your beard was more stylish before.

715
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,680
Why did you suddenly shave?

716
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,680
I just wanted to try a new style.

717
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,560
What was that new move called again?

718
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,350
You have to learn it.

719
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,170
Super Duper Lightning Thunder Slash.


720
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,680
Give it a go.

721
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:34,560
Shout it out.

722
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,810
Xingchen.

723
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:51,170
Ah.

724
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,890
How do you feel now?

725
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,520
I feel pretty good.

726
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:56,760
Dad,

727
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,020
so this is what internal force feels like.

728
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,350
It's amazing!

729
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,170
Oh you!

730
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:03,690
You're so...

731
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,390
I'm so proud of you!

732
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,140
Dad...

733
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,930
you're...

734
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,310
praising me?

735
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,810
Of course I'm praising you!

736
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,270
My daughter is so talented!

737
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,680
I thought you'd take me back to Wuyue Sect.

738
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,230
Take you back?

739
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:27,930
Oh Xingchen,

740
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:31,560
you're a heroine now.

741
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,020
You don't need protection

742
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,600
but can protect everyone instead.

743
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,020
My dear,

744
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,890
you're courageous and responsible.

745
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,480
Why would I take you back?

746
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,430
Come on, Dad.

747
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,800
I just happened

748
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,930
to be in the right place at the right time,

749
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,810
otherwise I couldn't have defeated them.

750
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:51,610
No.

751
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,640
Luck is part of your strength too.

752
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,310
And don't forget,

753
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,930
you had the wit to take down the ringleader

754
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,180
and stop the music controlling the mutants.

755
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,680
You were so brave,

756
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,680
I'm truly proud of you!

757
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,560
Dad, I'll make you even prouder.

758
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,340
Excellent!

759
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:15,560
Xingchen.

760
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,260
What?

761
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,850
Have you ever thought about

762
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:19,980
what kind of martial art world

763
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,980
you want?

764
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,020
I want...

765
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,890
a world of equality.

766
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:33,930
In this world,

767
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,560
women can be chivalrous heroes,

768
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,600
and also happily embroider at home.

769
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,350
We can duel on stage,

770
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,100
and also raise children at home.

771
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,640
We can practice swordsplay in dresses,

772
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,350
and also roam in men's clothes.

773
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,310
In this world,

774
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,890
there is only right and wrong,

775
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,230
no gender or age barriers.

776
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,310
Everyone can pursue their paths.

777
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,390
This

778
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,090
is the martial art world I long for.

779
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,380
Dad,

780
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,520
Will you think that my ideas

781
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,640
are too radical?

782
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,350
No, not at all!

783
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,060
Your dream

784
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,640
is amazing,

785
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,520
Xingchen.

786
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,180
But

787
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,270
it's difficult for many to understand,

788
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:27,770
after all,

789
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,930
changing tradition

790
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,930
is never easy.

791
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:34,980
You're right.

792
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,270
But as someone told me,

793
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,730
be the brave egg

794
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,390
against the stone.

795
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:44,930
An egg may not break

796
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:46,680
a stone in one day,

797
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,730
but what about ten?

798
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,310
A single egg may not be enough,

799
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,020
but what about thousands?

800
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,180
One day,

801
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,600
the stone will be broken.

802
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:00,480
That's right.

803
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,810
This may sounds naive,

804
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,890
but how do I know

805
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,230
they won't work if I don't try?

806
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,060
Master Huo,

807
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:23,890
I'm counting on you

808
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,180
for our Wuyue Sect's future!

809
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,780
♫Wow, baby♫

810
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,790
♫I can touch the clouds in fairy tales♫

811
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,430
♫When I reach out♫

812
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,530
♫A calm heart starts♫

813
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:01,170
♫Feeling excited and nervous♫

814
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,950
♫The sky in front of me is also painted♫

815
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,840
♫Heart-warming pink♫
