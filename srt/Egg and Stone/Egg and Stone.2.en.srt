00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,950
Xingchen tells her heart with these letters.

518
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,170
These letters alone

519
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,810
can prove that she's deeply in love with me.

520
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,290
Mr. Mu,

521
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:09,950
I'm incompetent.

522
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,110
Those letters

523
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,400
were written by me.

524
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:22,920
So funny.

525
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,210
You’d better laugh to death.

526
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,490
I really wrote this.

527
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,530
I did it for my own reasons!

528
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,060
Let me tell you.

529
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,210
Huo Xingchen doesn't love you at all.

530
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,290
She only treats you as her brother.

531
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,240
Okay, it's your turn now.

532
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,620
What evidence do you have

533
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:42,010
that you wrote this letter?

534
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:48,730
So funny.

535
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,810
Brother Mu,

536
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,610
I like you so much that I have no cure.

537
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,150
Brother Mu,

538
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,880
we love each other deeply.

539
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,570
Although we can't meet for the time being,

540
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,910
we can know
each other’s love through these letters

541
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,860
sent by the birds.

542
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:06,660
Goodness.

543
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,550
How would I know?

544
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:08,510
Hey.

545
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,680
Now you don't even warn me beforehand?

546
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:19,920
Shameless man.

547
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,890
You must be glib-tongued,

548
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,630
and tricked Xingchen into showing you

549
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,610
the letters.

550
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:25,400
Mr. Mu,

551
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,080
are you deaf or can’t think straight?

552
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,900
We are childhood sweethearts.

553
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,090
She

554
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,070
loves

555
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:31,530
me.

556
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,820
She loves you.

557
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,620
I'm shameless.

558
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,080
Take her away.

559
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,920
Xing…

560
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,910
Xingchen.

561
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,230
Good for you.

562
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:52,860
What?

563
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,050
You stopped me on purpose.

564
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,020
And now Xingchen is gone.

565
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,900
No, I...

566
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:57,780
Hey.

567
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,950
Let me tell you.

568
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,240
She has never left this place.

569
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,980
The martial arts world is so dangerous.

570
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,450
But you tricked her out.

571
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,270
You really misunderstood me.

572
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:07,840
I really didn't.

573
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,280
Get lost!

574
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,870
This is all your fault.

575
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,520
From now on,

576
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,500
the Mu family will be enemies with you.

577
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,530
Don't get any closer to Xingchen.

578
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,990
And don't let me see you again.

579
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,800
Otherwise...

580
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,340
Understood.

581
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:22,570
You’ll let me take the sword.

582
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,650
Xingchen.

583
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:29,810
Alas.

584
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,150
I got myself another strong rival
in the martial arts world.

585
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,370
Ah.

586
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,140
Nonsense!

587
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,520
I can’t believe it.

588
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,790
That Jiang Futing looks pretty

589
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,780
but he's a wastrel!

590
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,340
We provide him with a comfortable life

591
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,700
at Wuyue Sect,
since he's our sister's benefactor.

592
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:56,710
Unexpectedly,

593
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,870
he bit the hand that fed him,

594
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,110
and took her away instead!

595
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,740
I was careless.

596
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,280
Pass my order.

597
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,120
We've issued a wanted warrant.

598
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,360
Anyone who can catch Jiang Buting,

599
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,620
and send Xingchen back

600
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,440
will be greatly rewarded by the Wuyue Sect!

601
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:25,730
[Wanted]

602
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,000
Wanted?

603
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,940
Catch Jiang Buting and you'll be rewarded.

604
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,690
Who is he?

605
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,780
A cripple.

606
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:27,830
He’s on a wheelchair.

607
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,440
Look at that man.

608
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,410
Is it him?

609
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,430
He's also sitting in a wheelchair.

610
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,540
Isn't it the same guy? Look.

611
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,740
It's him, right?

612
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,570
It must be him.

613
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,450
Should we leave him alone?

614
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,250
Should we just arrest him?

615
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:44,880
Goodness.

616
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,120
He’s running away in a wheelchair.

617
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,740
No matter how good he is at martial art,

618
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,900
he's not as fast as a carriage.

619
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,940
It is said that this cripple’s mouth
sticks out and has monkey-likes cheeks.

620
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,030
And he’s a pervert.

621
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,090
He's nothing compared to Mr. Mu.

622
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,010
Is she blinded?

623
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,080
Now the Huo family of Wuyue Sect

624
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,750
and the Hucang port
of the Mu family are all after him.

625
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:03,610
Hey.

626
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,150
If we meet this cripple

627
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:08,010
in a wheelchair who has a pointed mouth
and monkey-like cheeks,

628
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:08,870
we have to catch him.

629
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:09,820
That's right.

630
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,510
Yes.

631
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,240
[Wanted]

632
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,310
Despicable!

633
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,260
Shameless!

634
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:26,750
Disgusting!

635
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,940
How dare a cripple like him

636
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,600
covet the daughter of the Wuyue Sect?

637
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,130
Is he crazy?

638
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,230
No.

639
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,340
This damn ripple.

640
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,200
What is he thinking?

641
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:41,640
How dare he?

642
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,230
Hey.

643
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,580
Brother!

644
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,660
Why are you sneaking around?

645
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,930
Don't call me. Don't call me.

646
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:53,510
Oh.

647
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,700
Jiang Buting, where is your wheelchair?

648
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:57,830
Have you seen the notice?

649
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,540
How dare I still sit on it?

650
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,360
Oh.

651
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,410
So that's you.

652
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,250
You're famous.

653
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:08,510
Oops.

654
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,440
Can your body take it?

655
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,000
I’m still okay.

656
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,170
By the way,

657
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,060
I've searched the Wuyue Sect.

658
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,810
There's no trace to be found.

659
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,650
I suspect that someone deliberately
created an illusion

660
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,630
to divert our attention.

661
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:23,520
By the way,

662
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,150
the sixth place
in the martial arts world ranking

663
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,780
disappeared in a nearby market.

664
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,000
Could it be

665
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,090
a trick to lure him away?

666
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,280
Then why are we still

667
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,860
in Luo City?

668
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,880
No.

669
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,410
We can't leave yet.

670
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,140
I’m accussed of kidnapping

671
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,130
Huo Xingchen now.

672
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,410
The Hucang port
and the Wuyue Sect are all against me.

673
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,700
We have to find Huo Xingchen quickly

674
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,260
and send her back.

675
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,710
Okay, let's split up and look for her.

676
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,880
[The Heaven and Earth Share the Same Fate]

677
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,140
Come on.

678
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,740
Let's go.

679
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,300
Hurry!

680
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:18,980
Head Huo,

681
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,139
your daughter would rather run away

682
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,880
than marry the son of the Mu family.

683
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:27,080
She must be unhappy
with the final candidate of her matrilocal husband.

684
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,600
I think we should choose again.

685
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,070
Right. Let’s choose again.

686
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:33,860
Everyone,

687
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:35,810
I'm afraid you've misunderstood.

688
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,739
Xingchen and Binghe are childhood sweethearts,
and they’re really close.

689
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:43,080
And Xingchen
is not necessarily running away.

690
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:46,110
It's just a joke between the two children.

691
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,460
Old-fashioned people like us

692
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,699
shouldn’t make meaningless speculations.

693
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:51,699
That's right.

694
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,530
Head Mu,

695
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,370
stop lying in broad daylight.

696
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,220
There were so many eyes that saw

697
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,920
the daughter of the Huo family elope.

698
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:00,980
You...

699
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,740
How can you bear such a humiliation?

700
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,210
The Mu family

701
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,800
is indeed the watchdog
of the Huo family for generations.

702
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,850
Head Huang.

703
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,170
How dare you!

704
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,280
Head Huang,

705
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,910
I advise you to mind your words.

706
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,760
Head Huo,

707
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,520
you’ve got a lot of nerve.

708
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,590
But it can’t be decided
by one family in the martial arts word.

709
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,970
It's about the Shenwu Order.

710
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,600
Why can't we be concerned about the next head?

711
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:40,010
Why not? Why not? Why not?

712
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,460
Everyone!

713
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,360
Listen to me.

714
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,320
Three days later,

715
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,970
Binghe

716
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,080
will bring Xingchen

717
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,590
back to the Wuyue Sect for sure!

718
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,880
By then,

719
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,400
the marriage between Xingchen and Binghe

720
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,450
will be put on a date.

721
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:59,060
Xingchen and Binghe

722
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,450
will be in charge
of the Wuyue Sect together.

723
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,870
No one can change that!

724
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,850
Well...

725
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,380
Take a look. Take a look.

726
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,370
It's not expensive. Come and have a look.

727
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,230
The wool pendant.

728
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:20,870
Take a look at the lantern.

729
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,500
Bah!

730
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,170
Oh, right.

731
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,100
Pack them up. I want them all.

732
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,810
Mr. Mu!

733
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,110
I have to tell you something.

734
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,460
Jiang Buting, let me tell you.

735
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,720
It better be worth my walk here.

736
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,010
I know where Huo Xingchen is.

737
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:49,970
Where?

738
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,240
Where is it?

739
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,270
Where...

740
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,530
Where is it?

741
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,120
Where have I seen you?

742
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:44,190
Where do you think she is?

743
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,730
I suddenly can't remember.

744
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,710
Where…

745
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,530
I must have lost my mind.

746
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,850
Is…

747
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,080
She?

748
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:55,710
I must be crazy.

749
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,170
Please come in.

750
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,830
What did you mean just now?

751
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,150
Nothing.

752
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,410
What do you mean

753
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,960
by “nothing”?

754
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,320
You betrayed me.

755
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,000
I was trying to let his guard down
so that you could run away.

756
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:34,950
Got it?

757
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,880
I don't want to understand.

758
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,530
Then that's your problem.

759
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:47,450
Take this!

760
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,420
Young Miss.

761
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,960
I really wanted to save you.

762
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,080
Think about it.

763
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,700
How could you escape in that situation?

764
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,470
Am I right?

765
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,000
I don't want to talk to you.

766
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:07,050
Where are you going?

767
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,260
To the martial arts world.

768
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,210
The martial arts world is dangerous.

769
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,850
It's not easy to break in.

770
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,070
Go back to the Wuyue Sect intead.

771
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:17,600
Humph.

772
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,940
I have great martial arts skill.
How is it dangerous?

773
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:21,600
Move.

774
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:35,930
Brother.

775
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,150
Why did you let her go?

776
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,550
Do you want me
to tie her up and send her back?

777
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,380
You should talk to her.

778
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,080
A Young Miss like her

779
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,650
has never experienced hardships
in the martial arts world.

780
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:47,960
It's useless to persuade her.

781
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,980
In my opinion,

782
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,330
we should let her taste
the dangers of the martial arts world.

783
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,620
♫Wow, baby♫
