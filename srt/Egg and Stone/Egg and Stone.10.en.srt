was for my own good.

the martial arts world

158
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,520

160
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,060

161

00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,390
Take care.

175
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,430
Go. Go. Hurry up.

176
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,980
It's getting dark.

177
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,140
Let's go.

178
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,680
Head, once Xingchen is gone,

179
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,640
how can we explain to the martial arts world?

180
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,560
Xingchen still need time to grow.

181
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,180
We old men will have to

182
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,680
to buy her time.

183
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,680
But Uncle,

184
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,520
Xingchen was in danger

185
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,850
when she left Wuyue Sect last time.

186
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,520
Why did you allow her to leave?

187
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,430
Do you think Wuyue Sect is safe?

188
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,230
You mean

189
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,980
there is a mole in Wuyue Sect?

190
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,730
I found something interesting

191
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,770
in Elixir Village last time.

192
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,520
I think we'll find out

193
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,850
after some time.

194
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,170
Jianwa.

195
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,640
Just say it.

196
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,350
Isn't it inappropriate

197
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,600
to let Xingchen go with Jiang Buting?

198
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,980
After all, the chosen matrilocal husband

199
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,430
of Xingchen is Mu Binghe.

200
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,100
Binghe has other things to deal with.

201
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,020
Besides,

202
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,270
although Buting

203
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,230
seems to be unruly and inexperienced,

204
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,100
he's actually warm-hearted and meticulous.

205
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,270
If Xingchen follows him,

206
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,180
she won't suffer any loss.

207
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,640
He's so biased.

208
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,430
Will my brother-in-law be changed?

209
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,850
Don't talk nonsense.

210
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,520
It's not decided yet.

211
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,390
Judging from her attitude to Jiang Buing,

212
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,060
they need to get along with each other.

213
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:08,720
Report!

214
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,680
A letter from Mu Binghe.

215
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,480
He said all mutamts in Luo City

216
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,520
had been dealt with.

217
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,560
He is going out of the city to investigate

218
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,140
and deal with all mutants as soon as possible.

219
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:22,790
Yes.

How did you ask him to deal with mutants?

222
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,430
Of course, under the premise of safety,

223
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,020
all mutants should be taken back.

224
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,310
Take them away.

225
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,400
Yes.

Let's leave.

348
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,810
Come out.

349
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:48,850
Tell me.

350
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,230
Who are you?

351
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,980
I'm Huo Xingchen from Wuyue Sect.

352
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,180
I'm here for mutants.

353
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,730
Get out of here.

354
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,060
There's nothing you want in the village.

355
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,060
Senior.

356
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,640
I'll be frank with you.

357
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,770
Since we're here,

358
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,560
we never thought of going back empty-handed.

359
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,180
Besides, you could have just stood by.

360
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,180
But you didn't.

361
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,060
Wuyue Sect

362
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,600
has fallen.

363
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,520
What do you mean?

364
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,420
You two pretend to be ignorant.

365
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,850
Everyone knows that

366
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,140
mutants are in demand.

367
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,560
Why are they trying to catch mutants now?

368
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,640
These are human-shaped weapons.

369
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,100
Qiutong Sect has caught more than 20.

370
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:54,890
What?

371
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,230
Human-shaped weapons?

372
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,050
Mutants are powerful and brainless.

373
00:24:59,050 --> 00:24:59,930
It's easy to control them.

374
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,350
Human-shaped weapons?

375
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,980
They want to confine mutants?

376
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,760
Aren't they afraid of being bitten?

377
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,560
If someone get bitten,

378
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,850
he will become a new mutant.

379
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,270
The mutant's power

380
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,850
is much better than ordinary people.

381
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,060
And it's easy to control them.

382
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,270
They will never betray.

383
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,770
So some people,

384
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,890
in order to strengthen their own sect,

385
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,810
let mutants bite more people.

386
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,100
If they can't catch more mutants,

387
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,430
perhaps...

388
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,970
We need to find the doctor urgently

389
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,230
so that we can save mutants.

390
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,130
Or the consequence will be unimaginable.

391
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,980
Do you want to save mutants?

392
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:48,820
Yes.

393
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,890
We don't know what others think.

394
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,850
But we're looking for mutants to save them.

395
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Let's go.

396
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,140
See you.

397
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,390
Wait.

398
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,140
Mutants are in Xicao Village.

399
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:12,850
Xicao Village?

400
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,810
Yes.

401
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,350
Over there.

402
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:26,930
Let's go!

403
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,460
Get them!

404
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,170
Go!

405
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,480
Don't run away! Don't run away!

406
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,930
Be concerned with facts 
and not with individuals.

407
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:56,770
There's room for two.

408
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,270
Come here.

409
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,100
We lost them again.

410
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,230
Close the city gate and search!

411
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:04,780
Yes.

412
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,480
Stay here. I'll go first.

413
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,350
Catch me!

414
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:22,130
Go!

415
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,770
Stop!

416
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,310
Go!

417
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:25,850
Hey, Jiang Buting!

418
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:26,230
Stop!

419
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,680
You're double-faced.

420
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,100
There's no wind in the well,

421
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,270
but there are waves.

422
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,390
Is there a secret passage under the well?

423
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,520
I'll distract them. Run!

424
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,390
Stop!

425
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,350
There seems to be no other exit.

426
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:57,880
Stop!

427
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,020
Stop!

428
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,770
I can't run anymore.

429
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:03,850
Stop!

430
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,850
Stop! Stop!

431
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,230
I can't run anymore.

432
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:09,930
What should we do?

433
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,230
Jump!

434
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,560
I can't swim.

435
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,330
If you couldn't swim, why did you

436
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,020
want to bury with me in the water?

437
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,980
Are you kidding me?

438
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,470
Get down! Let's see where you can go!

439
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,710
Go!

440
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,270
Get down!

441
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,110
Go!

442
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:28,850
Get down!

443
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,060
Go! Get down! Go! Get down!

444
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,810
Get down!

445
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,890
Hurry! Block the entrance!

446
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,100
We can't let them escape alive.

447
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,860
Yes!

448
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,630
Give out Colourful Poisonous Smoke

449
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,770
and poison them to death.

450
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,700
Yes.

451
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:03,390
Jiang Buting.

452
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:04,890
Jiang Buting, wake up.

453
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,100
Jiang Buting. Jiang Buting.

454
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,060
You told me you couldn't swim.

455
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,060
I thought you were joking.

456
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,870
Why did you want to bury with me

457
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,180
in the water if you can't swim?

458
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,820
Hello?

459
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,850
Wake up! Wake up!

460
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,600
He's breathing.

461
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,020
It's okay.

462
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,770
What should I do?

463
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,730
Artificial respiration.

464
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,520
What are you doing?

465
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,350
You're awake.

466
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,810
What are you doing?

467
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,060
I'm glad you're awake.

468
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,310
I'm glad you're fine.

469
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,020
Y-You stand over there.

470
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:27,920
Hurry up.

471
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,660
Okay.

472
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,770
I'm glad you're fine.

473
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:42,480
Huo Xingchen.

474
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,890
Let me tell you.

475
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,640
We have to make rules now.

476
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,880
First, it's improper for men and women

477
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,980
to touch each other.

478
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,390
We need to keep a distance.

479
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,140
That's it.

480
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:58,480
Second,

481
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,100
if we look for clues together,

482
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,560
you must discuss with me

483
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,850
before you do anything.

484
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,520
Don't act on impulse.

485
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,480
I'm impulsive?

486
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:07,930
If it weren't for me,

487
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:08,810
you would have died.

488
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:11,420
How could you sit here and make rules with me?

489
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,390
Are you insane?

490
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,390
Huo Xingchen!

491
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,770
You said you weren't impulsive.

492
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,600
But I told you I couldn't swim.

493
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,930
How would I know that?

494
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,480
Besides,

495
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,980
aren't you standing here right now?

496
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,180
I'm standing here

497
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:24,890
because nothing happened.

498
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:25,810
If anything happens,

499
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,020
we'll both die.

500
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,060
Am I that stupid?

501
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,770
I've observed here in advance.

502
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,850
There's a secret passage under the well.

503
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,310
I used my brain, okay?

504
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,430
You're right. You're not stupid.

505
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,100
You're just being irresponsible to me.

506
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,180
I'm irresponsible to you?

507
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,640
You are irresponsible to me.

508
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,020
You made me fall for you.

509
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,060
When my father asked you to marry me,

510
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,980
you said you didn't want to.

511
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,270
What made you think so?

512
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,850
Who were you? Why were you unwilling?

513
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:49,670
How could you be unwilling?

514
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,730
I made you fall for me.

515
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,210
Yes.

516
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,480
It's your fault.

517
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,980
Say it.

518
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,640
You're the unreasonable one.

519
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
I'm unreasonable?

520
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,770
