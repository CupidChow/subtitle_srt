Stop!

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,860
You pretender.

9
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,020
Who are you, really?

10
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,020
Chen Jie.

11
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,940
Thank you.

12
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,070
Miss Yu,

13
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,400
why are you here?

14
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,940
Do you know where the forbidden area of Sophora Town is?

15
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:42,479
Jie.

16
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,640
In fact, there has been

17
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,270
this kind of fog in Sophora Town since 2 years ago.

18
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,770
It comes from the forbidden area.

19
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,100
We did an experiment and found

20
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,940
that the fog was beneficial to mutants.

21
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,440
It can help mutants move freely in the room,

22
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,110
and improve their physical function.

23
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,770
However, regular humans will get poisoned

24
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,640
if they stay in the fog too long.

25
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,190
That's why Jie and the others

26
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,980
pretended they were ghosts to drive you out.

27
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,180
Is everyone in this town

28
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,520
a mutant?

29
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,440
Yes.

30
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,930
The relatives of mutants all live in

31
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,150
Changqi Village, not far from Sophora Town.

32
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,310
There are many mutants.

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,360
My master

34
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,270
has been treating them, hasn't he?

35
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,150
I can't talk about that now.

36
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,980
Oh, and Mr. Jiang,

37
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,440
we saved

38
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,810
your friends.

39
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,480
They are resting in the front room now.

40
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,270
But only Miss. Huo and Mr. Mu

41
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,600
got poisoned by the fog because they went into

42
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,360
the forbidden area in town by mistake.

43
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,610
They are still unconscious.

44
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,730
Where are they? Take me there.

45
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,230
Doctor, doesn't the fog of the forbidden area help stabilize the mind?

46
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,070
A small amount of it can remove toxins.

47
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,600
But they inhaled too much

48
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,480
and have gone lost in a pipe dream.

49
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,600
Their hands...

50
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,640
Please don't, Sir.

51
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,230
They got poisoned at the same time.

52
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,430
So poisonous fumes were linked together.

53
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,810
And they have power over each other.

54
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,520
Being poisoned at the same time has its advantages and disadvantages.

55
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,100
The poisonous fumes were linked together,

56
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,180
so the dreams are connected.

57
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:23,810
Look at

58
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,060
their hands.

59
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,980
Doctor,

60
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,270
how do you remove the toxins?

61
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,480
Their toxins are linked.

62
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,860
If I separate the toxins forcefully,

63
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,440
the backflow will likely cause Miss Huo and Mr. Mu

64
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,150
getting lost in their dreams.

65
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,780
Even though they're physically alive, they will permanently lose their consciousnesses,

66
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,400
They will be in a coma

67
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,520
and never wake up.

68
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,850
A pipe dream

69
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,690
is nothing but a void.

70
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,020
Now,

71
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,820
we can only wait for the dreamers

72
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,320
to defeat their demons

73
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,850
and find their true selves.

74
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,730
So they can eventually wake up from their dreams.

75
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,810
However,

76
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,480
their situation

77
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,640
is unprecedented.

78
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,640
I've looked up classic books.

79
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,649
There was only one person who got poisoned and lost in a pipe dream before.

80
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,560
It was not difficult for that person to wake up.

81
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,230
I also found the hypothesis that 2 people getting poisoned

82
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,480
together in medical books.

83
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,720
What hypothesis?

84
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,350
If 2 people get poisoned at the same time,

85
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,480
they will definitely have the same dream,

86
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,690
and influence over each other.

87
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,060
The person with the stronger willpower

88
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,230
will influence the weaker one.

89
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,440
The one with the stronger willpower has to be clear-headed

90
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,900
to realize all is a void.

91
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,060
Doctor,

92
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,610
in that case,

93
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,480
you have nothing to worry about.

94
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,530
Xingchen is always strong-minded.

95
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,730
Even in a dream,

96
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,390
she will still be the leader for sure.

97
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,520
Right now, Xingchen

98
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,730
must be trying hard to break free from the constraint of the dream,

99
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,650
and come back to meet me soon.

103
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:38,610
Xingchen,

104

today is the 15th day of the first lunar month.

105
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,060
The lanterns tonight must be very pretty.

106
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:45,730
Yes.

107
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,270
Let's go, Mu.

108
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,600
Okay.

109

Here.

110
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,060
What's the matter?

111
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,190
Xingchen,

112

your wedding dress is so beautiful.

The embroidery is amazing.

121

Yeah.

Yes, of course, Miss.

What is the martial arts world like?

146

Xingchen, why are you

147
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,270
suddenly interested in the martial arts world?

148

I just want to go and see it.

Mu,

157

you said you would

158
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,980
take me to explore the martial arts world.

159
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,690
You said you understood me

00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:22,780
My dream…

177
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,440
Xingchen.

178
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,230
Xingchen.

179
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,310
My dream is…

180
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,230
Xingchen.

181
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,180
Xingchen.

182
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,320
Go to bed.

183
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,480
Get some sleep and everything will be okay.

184
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,890
Doctor,

185
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:48,560
she has been sleeping

186
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,230
for a day and a night.

187
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,350
This is not going to work, isn't it?

188
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,730
Is there something else you can do?

189
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,230
Help her take this pill.

190
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,900
This is…

191
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,810
This is a detoxication pill that I cherish.

192
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,770
It can remove all kinds of poisons.

193
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:37,440
Uncle Xu,

194
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,020
go get a cape for Miss.

195
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:47,920
[Grand Dreams]

196
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:47,980
My lady,

197
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,820
there's something I have to say.

198
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,980
What's the matter?

199
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,460
My lady,

200
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,020
Wuyue Sect

201
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,730
is in deep water now.

202
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,930
But you still do embroidery and drink tea every day.

203
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,630
You are chief's wife.

204
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,020
What did you say?

205
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,770
Stop talking nonsense.

206
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,190
Guards, take him away.

207
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,350
[Grand Dreams]

My lady.

209
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,690
Now!

210
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,070
My lady.

211
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,940
The martial arts world is ending, my lady.

212
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,690
My lady.

213
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,310
My Lady.

214
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,480
Don't listen to him.

215
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,440
He is just saying terrifying things.

216
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,650
The Devil Sect is rioting, but this is

217
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,640
definitely not the end of the martial arts world.

218
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,100
So

219
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,770
things are really bad out there.

220
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,570
How come I didn't know anything?

221

[Grand Dreams]

222
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,280
Miss.

223
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:26,890
It's Mr.Mu.

224
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,270
He didn't want you to worry,

225
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,310
so he didn't let us tell you.

226
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,270
Mr.Mu said

227
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,310
he wanted you to be worry free.

228
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,560
He will definitely protect you.

229
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,400
This is how much he cares about you.

230
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,820
It's very moving.

231
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,110
I wonder

232
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,400
which one your Mr. Mu is going to choose,

233
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,940
the beauty or the martial arts world?

234
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,770
Who is talking?

235
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,650
Pretty.

236
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,020
Let's go.

237
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,440
Why did you drag a woman

238
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,060
into our business?

239
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,640
I heard that you,

240
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,520
the son-in-law of Wuyue Sect's leader

241
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,650
love your wife very much.

00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,470
Don't you dare!

243
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,480
Chief Mu,

244
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,520
how about we make a deal?

245
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,190
You choose between the two:

246
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,520
the position of chief

247
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,850
and your beloved wife.

248
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,190
Which one would you choose?

249
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,140
I choose the Xingchen.

250
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,520
Throw Shenwu Token

251
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,560
to me.

252
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,730
You bring her here.

253
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,480
And I'm giving you the token.

254
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,260
Mu, don't do it.

255
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:36,730

Oh, no.

Don't be afraid.

259
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,270
Give me your hand.

260
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,640

261
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,400
Chief, don't do this.

262
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,650
Don't do this for a woman.

263

you are the leader of Wuyue Sect.

the token so easily?

279
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,310
You are so irresponsible.

Xingchen,

281
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,780
I won't allow you to get hurt.

288
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,890
I'll certainly be responsible for myself.

289
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,790
I don't need any one of you

290
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,990
to make a choice for me.

291
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,020
Then don't blame me for being rude.

Are you okay?

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,360
How is this possible?

298
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,270
It's impossible.

299
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,570
I am a very skilled fighter as I remember.

300

Xingchen.

301
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,680
Xingchen.

302
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,190
Go to sleep.

303

You'll be fine after some sleep.

305
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:26,480
Great.

I...

309
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,900
Did I sleep for a long time?

310
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,860
I'm sorry, Xingchen.

311
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,060
It was all my fault.

312
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,770
I won't put you in danger anymore.

313

Mu,

314
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,730
it was not your fault.

315
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,070
Did you get hurt?

316
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:54,480
No, I'm fine.

317
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,060
The rest of the Demon Sect

318
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,110
has been wiped out.

319
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,900
Well,

320
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,520
would you like to go out?

321
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:00,900
I...

322
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,190
I can go outside now?

323
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,310
Yes, of course.

324
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,109
The martial arts world is safe now.

325
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,099
I'll take you

326
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,520
anywhere you want to go.

327
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:12,400
Look.

328
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:13,520
Isn't it fun?

329
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,099
Look.

330
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,690
It can fly. Look.

331
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,890
This is so moving.

332
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,319
Chief is indeed the best man in the world.

333
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:23,690
He is not only handsome,

334
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,819
but also loving.

335
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,520
Yes.

336
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,069
Exactly.

337
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,849
Miss Huo must have done

338
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:28,480
something great in her past life.

339
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,190
Otherwise, how did she win his devotion?

340
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,140
I’m so moved.

341
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,770
Do you like it?

342
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,860
It would be great if my husband is half

343
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,860
as thoughtful as Chief.

344
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,060
I really envy Chief's wife.

345
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,730
Yeah.

346
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,980
She is under Chief's protection,

347
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,350
so she doesn't need to worry about the outside world.

348
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,320
Hey,

349
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,640
what are you thinking?

350
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,060
I'm thinking…

351
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,730
Let me play for a while.

352
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,480
What my dream is?

353
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,640
Why do they always think

354
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,730
that I have no interest in anything else,

355
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,770
but only want to live a happy life?

356
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,430
This is not what I want.

357
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,190
Xingchen,

358
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,180
don't listen to what other people say.

359
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,400
They say those things because they envy you.

360
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,810
Whatever you want to do,

361
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,400
I will do it with you.

362
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,060
Let's go fly a kite, okay?

363
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,100
Sir, your tea.

364
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,940
Now, call her by her name.

365
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:37,980
Xing.

366
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,230
Xing.

367
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,730
Xing.

368
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,060
Xing.

369
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,400
Can you hear me?

370
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,360
Xing.

371
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,930
Xing.

372
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,350
Xing.

373
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,640
Xing.

374
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,390
Xing.

375
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,610
Xing.

376
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,400
Huo Xingchen.

377
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,940
Huo Xingchen.

378
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,790
Xing,

379
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,230
you're going to be the leader of Wuyue Sect.

380
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,140
How can you just sleep here,

381
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:30,810
huh?

382
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,440
You can't be like this, Xing.

383
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,940
You haven't fulfilled your dream yet.

384
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,350
How can you just keep sleeping here?

385
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,410
Xing.

386
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:40,850
Xing.

387
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,950
Xing, wake up, okay?

388
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,760
You have to fulfill

389
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,440
the promise that you make me.

390
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,810
You can't break it.

391
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,710
You said

392
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,200
you were the head of the family.

393
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,890
And you would earn money to support me.

394
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,640
Don't forget about that.

395
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,780
Xing.

396
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,750
Xing.

397
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,320
We still have many things to do,

398
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,110
and many places to go.

399
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,140
Wake up now.

400
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:13,550
Please.

401
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,680
Wake up now.

402
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,700
I'll take you to any place you want to go,

403
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,440
and eat your favourite food.

404
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:23,830
Sounds good, Xing?

405
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:25,710
Xing.

406
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:26,930
Xing.

407
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,480
Don't forget

408
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,530
you're going to Tianque Sect to look for the medicine for me.

409
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,050
If you don't wake up,

410
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,460
I’m going to die.

411
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,440
Huo Xingchen.

412
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,110
Huo Xingchen.

413
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,480
Huo Xingchen.

414
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,690
Are you looking for me?

415
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,420
Who are you?

416
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,030
I am

417
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,250
Huo Xingchen.

418
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,560
Have you figured out who you are?

419
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,660
Go to sleep.

420
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,350
You'll be fine after some sleep.

421
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,550
Xing.

422
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,560
Xing.

423
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:19,680
Xing.

424
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,190
Xing.

425
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,550
Doctor,

426
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,520
it seemed that she

427
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,100
was about to wake up. Why is…

428
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,200
And she hasn't eaten anything

429
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,770
during her long sleep.

430
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,060
It's really bad for her health.

431
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,730
Besides that,

432
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,940
if people continues to stay in the dream deeply,

433
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,350
their self-consciousnesses will become weaker.

434
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,640
In the beginning of the dream,

435
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,070
they might find something wrong.

436
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,130
But the longer they stay in the dream,

437
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,430
the more chances for them to believe it is real

438
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,060
and never wake up.

439
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,740
Doctor. Doctor,

440
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,250
please find another way.

441
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,740
You have to save her.

442
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,240
Doctor, please.

443
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,030
At this point,

444
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,710
there is only one thing left to do.

445
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,940
But this method

446
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,060
is very dangerous.

447
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,030
You said

448
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,820
if the dreamer can't wake up,

449
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,230
then someone needs to enter the dream

450
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,070
to help the dreamer find herself.

451
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,590
The pipe dream will end

452
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,070
if you help the dreamer realize

453
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,340
she is in a dream.

454
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,470
Okay, I'll go.

455
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:32,640
I'll go.

456
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,980
Wait a minute.

457
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,000
I have to warn you that

458
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,930
after you enter the dream,

459
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,220
if you can't get the dreamer's self-consciousness back,

460
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,510
you're likely to get lost

461
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,440
like them do.

462
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,780
And you would never wake up.

463
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,690
Even so, do you

464
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,230
still want to do this?

465
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,950
Yes.

466
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,130
You are the intruder,

467
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,830
so you have to wake them up as quickly as possible

468
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,070
after going into the pipe dream.

469
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,050
You have to bring them back

470
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,740
before they reach

471
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,760
the physical limit.

472
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:27,930
Xing,

473
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,710
wait for me.

474
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,590
Here. Here.

475
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,610
Come and get your bonus.

476
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,850
Here.

477
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,090
Sir, we're getting another bonus?

478
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,510
Didn't we just get a bonus the day before yesterday?

479
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:00,120
Yeah.

480
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,120
Her ladyship is pregnant.

481
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,940
Pregnant.

482
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,770
Wuyue Sect is going to have

483
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,360
the sceond young master soon.

484
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:05,940
The second young master.

485
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,600
That's great news.

486
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,520
Chief is very happy.

487
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:08,890
So he is giving you another bonus.

488
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,010
Her Ladyship and Chief

489
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,870
are really in love.

490
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,600
They're our role models.

491
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,230
Thank you, Sir.

492
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,680
Yeah.

493
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,780
Yes, of course.

494
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,230
Jiang.

495
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
Come and get your money.

496
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,030
What are you waiting for?

497
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,890
Uncle Fu,

498
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,020
didn't chief's wife pass away?

499
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,810
Bah!

500
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,730
How dare you, stupid server.

501
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,270
How dare you curse Her Ladyship?

502
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,360
I...

503
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,020
I'm going to kill you.

504
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,560
I'm going to kill you.

505
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,570
Uncle Fu. Uncle Fu.

506
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,230
I'll kill you!

507
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,180
Uncle Fu, I was sleepy.

508
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,020
I didn't curse Her Ladyship.

509
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,690
I didn't.

510
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,270
You bastard.

511
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,440
When Her Ladyship was Miss Huo,

512
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,480
she cared so much about you servants.

513
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,980
If I hear you talking nonsense again,

514
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,610
I will tear you apart.

515
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,480
Okay. Got it.

516
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,100
What did you say?

517
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,770
Miss Huo is Her Ladyship.

518
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,610
Huo Xingchen.

519
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,390
This…

520
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,890
This…Damn you.

521
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:03,480
Sir. Sir.

522
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,180
Don't you run fast?

523
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,730
I… I'm going to kill you.

524

00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,560
Jiang,

698
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:40,690
come and get your money.

699
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,980
What are you waiting for?

700
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:42,940
Here. Here.

701
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,020
Here.

702
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,770
Why is he acting so weird today?

703
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,520
Here.

704
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,310
What's that?

705
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:10,860
This...

706
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,480
What's wrong?

707
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,210
Nothing.

708
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:20,280
Let's go inside.

709
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:21,330
Um-hum.

710
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:26,270
Come here.

711
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,420
Be careful.

712
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,850
Why is everything starting over again?

713
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,010
Damn Mu Binghe.

714
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:32,989
Nasty.

715
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,739
And Huo Xingchen.

716
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:39,040
I told you everything was fake.

717
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,610
Why did you fall into the trap again?

718
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,110
Silly.

719
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,400
How can you live without me?

720
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,560
You missed.

721
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,470
Haha…

722
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,640
Huo Xingchen,

723
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,070
why are you killing your husband.

724
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,390
You won't be happy

725
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,220
if I'm disabled.

726
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,420
Stop talking nonsense.

727
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,410
I don't know you.

728
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,850
Hey,

729
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,030
where are you going?

730
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,880
Do you know how hard it was to get you out here?

731
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,570
Don't touch me again.

732
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,620
If my husband knows you humiliated me,

733
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,230
he will hunt you down.

734
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,990
I forgive you

735
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,250
since you don't remember anything.

736
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,230
But remember, Huo Xingchen,

737
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,800
Mu Binghe is not your husband.

738
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,630
If you ever going to have a husband,

739
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,760
it should be me.

740
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:40,880
Nonsense!

741
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:43,430
I am

742
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,660
a mother now.

743
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,820
I'm not talking nonsense.

744
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,230
This whole thing is fake.

745
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,800
You're not the chief's wife.

746
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,950
This child is also fake.

747
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,600
If you don't believe me, check it.

748
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:52,400
Jerk!

749
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,850
Listen to me.

750
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,610
Okay, I'm listening to your nonsense.

751
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,210
Okay.

752
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,420
Even if this is real,

753
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,100
can you recall

754
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,660
there are things you haven't finished?

755
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:07,440
You

756
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,630
going to Kunlun with me to look for the medicine.

757
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,180
Don't you remember?

758
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,080
Do you remember your idol?

759
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:23,770
The Fork Man.

760
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,000
The Fork Man?

761
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,920
There's no Fork Man in this world.

762
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,700
There's only the Hook Man.

763
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:35,690
The Hook Man?

764
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,370
Damn Mu Binghe.

765
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,560
You despicable man.

766
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,620
Don't talk about my husband like that.

767
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,000
I suggest you tell me the truth.

768
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,400
Who are you, really?

769
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,620
Let me be honest with you,

770
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:56,890
I love you.

771
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,360
I've loved you for a long time.

772
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,280
You...

773
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,630
You're shameless.

774
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,190
I don't allow you to love me.

775
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,220
I will

776
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:10,510
let you go

777
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:11,710
this time.

778
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,040
Hey.

779
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,050
Hey.

780
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,520
What's wrong?

781
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,470
Why are you in such a hurry?

782
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,150
I heard you were back.

783
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:33,790
You don't need to rush

784
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,200
even if you want to see me.

785
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:37,760
Umm.

786
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:38,980
I won't do it again.

787
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,270
I'm glad you're back.

788
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:50,130
Chief and Her Ladyship is going to do horse riding for spring outing.

789
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,720
They need a stableman who's clean.

790
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:56,520
Sir.

791
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,800
Let me do it.

792
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,230
Look how clean I am.

793
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,480
He can't do it, Sir.

794
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,640
Let me do it.

795
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,180
Let me, Sir.

796
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,850
Nice. Good boy.

797
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:15,690
You go.

798
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:16,730
Thank you, Uncle Fu.

799
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:17,520
Work hard.

800
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:21,940
It's so beautiful here.

801
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:23,800
Here.

802
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,080
Xingchen,

803
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,270
you must be hungry.

804
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,640
The view is nice here.

805
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,130
Let's eat here.

806
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,640
Okay, whatever you like.

807
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,160
Huh.

808
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,440
Hey,

809
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,760
we don't need you here.

810
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,650
You can go now.

811
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:47,820
Let's go, Bing.

812
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,050
Let's go eat some grass.

813
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:50,420
Come here.

814
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,590
Be good. Come here.

815
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,510
You two have the same nickname.

816
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,400
It is as handsome as me.

817
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,430
Let's go.

818
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,120
Let's go.

819
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,710
It must be a good horse.

820
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,410
That's right.

821
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,010
Mu,

822
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,400
be careful.

823
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:17,980
I will catch it soon.

824
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:18,940
Okay.

825
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,850
What are you doing?

826
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,590
Why are you following around me every day?

827
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:40,860
Huo Xingchen,

828
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,600
you cold-hearted player.

829
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,800
You flirted with me and then left me.

830
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:47,890
You said

831
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,440
you would take care of me.

832
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,150
Well,

833
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,810
now you're being lovey-dovey with another man,

834
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:53,890
and live happily ever after.

835
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,340
Why don't you just kill me?

836
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:56,270
My goodness.

837
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,350
All right.

838
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,710
Don't be upset.

839
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,300
Xingchen,

840
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,820
look what I've got.

841
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,210
Mu, you're amazing.

842
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:23,860
Xingchen,

843
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,300
I just grill the fish.

844
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,230
Smell it.

845
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,090
It smells so good.

846
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:29,700
Right?

847
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:32,590
Mu,

848
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,490
you grilled it nicely.

849
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:34,940
Here.

850
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,380
Try it.

851
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:45,930
Xingchen.

852
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,770
Mu, you try it too.

853
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,660
I did a good job,

854
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,800
Right?

855
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:57,770
I think

856
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,080
you're the best person in the world.

857
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,910
And you're good at grilling the fish.

858
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,600
Imagine that

859
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,340
I grill fishes for you every day in the future.

860
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,070
Mu, you are so nice to me.

861
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,120
Yes, of course.

862
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,410
Because you are my Xingchen.

863
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,320
You are my Mu.

864
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,210
You go there first

865
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,210
and check everything again.

866
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,270
Don't leave anything behind.

867
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,330
I'm fine.

868
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:47,830
Xingchen.

869
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:48,920
I'm fine.

870
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,330
Xingchen.

871
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:51,610
Are you okay?

872
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,120
Well...

873
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,910
Are you okay?

874
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,310
I'm fine. Of course I'm fine.

875
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,140
That's good.

876
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,190
Let's leave this wrong place

877
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,210
and the wrong person.

878
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,560
Xingchen.

879
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,410
Let's go back and get you examed.

880
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,980
You must hurt your food

881
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,360
after stepping on some hard bones.

882
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:07,490
I...

883
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:07,990
Hya!

884
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,450
Mu,

885
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:12,400
You stepped on my foot and hugged my girlfriend.

886
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,420
You're dead.

887
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:17,970
Well,

888
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,110
someone stole my girlfriend.

889
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,070
What should I do?

890
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,770
Jiang, today is your lucky day.

891
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:37,170
You did a great job protecting Her Ladyship.

892
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,780
Chief had a wheelchair made for you.

893
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:40,400
What?

894
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,670
Try it.

895
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,280
What?

896
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,700
Don't overthink it.

897
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,020
I just came here to say thank you.

898
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,780
You're the superior sect leader's wife.

899
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:25,850
And I'm a stableman.

900
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,160
I dare not to overthink it.

901
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,330
That's not what I meant.

902
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,340
So you meant

903
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,060
that I can overthink it?

904
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,740
How do you usually repay someone for saving your life?

905
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,050
Be serious.

906
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:48,260
I'm here to say thank you.

907
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,430
That's a lot.

908
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,670
You deserve it.

909
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:09,620
Actually,

910
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,920
you don't have to give me this.

911
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,240
You don't have to thank me either.

912
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:18,540
You have saved me before.

913
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:21,270
You saved my life too.

914
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:23,880
We can't repay each other.

915
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,770
I don't know why you keep saying

916
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:31,830
we had a history.

917
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:33,910
But I don't remember anything

918
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:35,510
you told me.

919
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:37,560
Now

920
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,650
I'm the sect leader's wife.

921
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,520
Then why did you come to see me?

922
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:48,440
Because you

923
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:50,290
have to thank me?

924
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,310
As the wife of the sect leader,

925
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,720
if you need to sincerely

926
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:01,300
thank a stableman,

927
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:04,670
why are you being so secretive?

928
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:06,330
What are you afraid of?

929
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,950
Who… who is scared?

930
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:12,760
I told you not to overthink this.

931
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,200
I'm just here to say thank you.

932
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:20,310
You're right.

933
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:24,360
I, a stableman, is thinking about Your Ladyship.

934
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,600
How immoral it is.

935
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,410
It's like throwing an egg against a rock.

936
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,740
Throw an egg against a rock.

937
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,020
Then the egg is the brave one.

938
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,690
♫Wow, baby♫

939
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,670
♫I can touch the clouds in fairy tales♫

940
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:10,490
♫When I reach out♫

941
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:12,490
♫A calm heart starts♫

942
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:15,240
♫Feeling excited and nervous♫

943
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,870
♫The sky in front of me is also painted♫

944
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,050
♫Heart-warming pink♫

945
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,440
♫Oh, please♫

946
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:24,510
♫Tell me it's not a dream♫

947
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,450
♫When the passing fireflies♫

948
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:29,880
♫Bring warm wind♫
