4
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,060
It's so beautiful here.

5
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,599
If there's a chance

6
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,350
I'll bring Ting here.

7
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,220
Huo Xingchen.

8
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,060
It's said that you got a Magic Power Pill.

9
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,020
Give it to me.

10
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,600
Go back to Wuyue Sect and be a missy.

11
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,770
You still made this decision.

12
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,640
You have already known my purpose.

13
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,229
You're just like those who want to kill me,

14
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,890
just because of the pill I have,

15
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,100
right?

16
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,479
Yes.

17
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,920
As long as I get the pill,

18
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,770
I can become the best in the world.

19
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,970
But,

20
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,680
you are too foolish.

21
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,430
With such a powerful pill,

22
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,979
you're still fooled by me.

23
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,560
I just treat you as a friend.

24
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,600
Shut up!

25
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,310
I don't have any friend at all!

26
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,390
After tonight,

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,020
I won't have any friend forever!

28
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,430
Then I can get everything I want!

29
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,380
It's the sword of Xingchen.

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,520
She's in danger.

31
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,890
Someone set up a formation here.

32
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,100
Be careful.

33
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,100
This time,

34
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,560
no one can break my formation!

35
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,100
There are three eyes of this formation.

36
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,350
Bu Ying.

37
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,560
Brother,

38
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,230
The situation is settled.

39
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,770
Bu Ying, turn left to Xun position.

40
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,520
Brother, turn right to the Zhen position.

41
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,640
The formation is broken.

42
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,770
Give me the Magic Power Pill!

43
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,810
Xingchen!

44
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,680
Why are you here?

45
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,980
We're friends.

46
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,140
Of course we should come.

47
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,310
What a "friend".

48
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,520
As long as I activate the mechanism,

49
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,270
this place will collapse.

50
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,100
None of you can escape.

51
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,270
Either,

52
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,770
leave Huo Xingchen here

53
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,390
or

54
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,180
all of you die together.

55
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,430
I'd like to see

56
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,640
what your professed friend

57
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,100
will choose?

58
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,640
You're not leaving?

59
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,020
Then let's die together!

60
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,890
What a "friend".

61
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,730
We'll meet again!

62
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,100
Where is he?

63
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,230
Wow,

64
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,060
This waterfall is so beautiful.

65
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,390
There's fish!

66
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,770
Fish, fish!

67
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,810
Where is the fish?

68
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,230
Over there. See?

69
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,520
Where is the fish?

70
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,180
Over there.

71
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,100
Can you see?

72
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,670
Yes.

73
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,140
Xingxing, what are you thinking?

74
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,480
Do you think

75
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,520
I'm stupid?

76
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,020
What do you mean by "stupid"?

77
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,060
That's kindness.

78
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
It's all Yin Fengmian's fault. He's too bad.

79
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,390
I'll tell you then.

80
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,100
Don't scold me.

81
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,520
Until now,

82
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,730
I still don't consider him as a badass.

83
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,810
What?

84
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
He's still not a bad guy?

85
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,890
Is he a good person?

86
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,840
I just think,

87
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,930
no matter how bad a person is,

88
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,480
as long as in his heart,

89
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,770
there is still a little bit of kindness,

90
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,850
he might become a good person.

91
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,520
But, some good people with good intentions

92
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,770
will be driven by evil thoughts,

93
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,480
and then become evils.

94
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,420
What?

95
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,230
What do you mean?

96
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,890
Is he a good person or a bad person?

97
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,680
It doesn't matter

98
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,020
whether a person is good or bad,

99
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,480
It depends on your choice.

100
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,560
Okay.

101
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,310
We onlookers

102
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,560
don't think too much.

103
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,230
It depends on

104
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,600
what she is thinking.

105
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,350
Where is the dragon?

106
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,060
There's a dragon.

[The Doctrine is High and Mighty]

108
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,809
Brother Binghe,

109
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,230
I have something to report.

110
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,380
Go ahead.

111
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,100
All sects

112
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,520
sent people to ask about the wedding date.

113
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,850
The wedding date on March is coming,

114
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,060
Uncle is still in a coma.

115
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,430
All sects have been eyeing us.

116
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,310
They all want to take over the Wuyue Sect.

117
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,290
Uhh…

118
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,310
What should we do?

119
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:15,810
Under the circumstances,

120
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,850
Only taking her to the Wuyue Sect in person

121
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,680
and making her get married on time,

122
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,770
the situation can be stabilized.

123
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,560
But Xingchen

124
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,770
seems doesn't want to do so.

125
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,930
I will bring her back

126
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,810
and make her be my wife willingly.

127
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:34,930
When I leave,

128
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,390
please take care of the Wuyue Sect.

129
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,250
Okay.

130
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,390
Xingchen,

131
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,730
Wait.

132
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,930
Are you okay with that?

133
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,140
When Fengming tricked you into the Butterfly Valley,

134
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,810
Jiang Buting broke the formation

135
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,480
with three people.

136
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,890
The formation was set by Yin Fengmian.

137
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,100
I've been thinking

138
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,850
why three people are needed for breaking it?

139
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,390
Yeah.

140
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,680
Why three people?

141
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,890
Because I have three friends

142
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,140
who will never give up on me.

143
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,600
Yin Fengmian,

144
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,850
Is this a coincidence?

145
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,890
Or…

146
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,930
Clean it up quickly.

147
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,230
After a while, Huo Xingchen

148
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,260
will take the bait.

149
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,020
Please have a seat.

150
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,720

153
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,140
Tea Pavilion, let's go.

154
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,770
Waiter, serve the tea.

155
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:12,600
The most expensive one!

156

Coming.

157
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,350
Have a seat.

158
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,890
It's done.

159
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,640
Yes.

160
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,060
Let's go.

161
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,350
Waiter.

162
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,430
Money was put on the table.

163
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,890
Okay!

165

no one can bully her.

167
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,060
Stop!

168
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,730
We caught Huo Xingchen.

169
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,850
Why did you do that?

170
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,310
No one can covet my Xing.

171
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,560
Because Huo Xingchen,

172
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,180
belongs to me.

173
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,560
Oh, be careful.

174
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:11,980
I'll hold you.

175
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,350
Did you do it on purpose?

176
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,600
Be careful.

177
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,560

00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:44,500
Where did you go to play

354
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,140
when you were a child?

355
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,850
I was sick every day when I was a kid.

356
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,810
I ate medicine as if it were food every day.

357
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,140
I didn't go out or leave the house.

358
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,230
I didn't have a Brother Mu

359
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,310
to watch fireworks with me every day.

360
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,060
You don't have a Brother Mu

361
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,310
to watch fireworks with you.

362
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,310
What is your dream then?

363
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:16,730
[May blessings come in their proper time.]

364
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,100
My dream

365
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,930
is to grow up peacefully

366
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,520
and not get sick anymore.

367
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,470
I have nothing to say.

368
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:32,930
What about you?

369
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,890
What is your dream?

370
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,350
My dream is to travel the martial art world

371
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,560
with Fork Man

372
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,040
helping the weak and fighting  the strong.

373
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,510
I see.

374
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,510
[May blessings come in their proper time.]

375
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,170
I'm going to bed.

376
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:51,000
Hey.

377
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,980
Don't you watch the fireworks?

378
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,100
It's really expensive.

379
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:06,980
How beautiful.

380
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,360
[First, dream]

381
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,600
I'll give you one more chance.

382
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:42,490
[Second, Left-handed Sword]

383
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,680
Are you reading?

384
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,600
Little Ting Ting

385
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,730
Don't be angry.

386
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,270
Sending you a little flower.

387
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,310
Alright.

388
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,140
It was my fault yesterday.

389
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,390
I apologize.

390
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,350
I shouldn't mention unrelated people

391
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,730
in front of you.

392
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,180
Little flower.

393
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,850
Will you do the same next time?

394
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,180
Of course not.

395
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,020
Then

396
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,850
I'll forgive you reluctantly.

397
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:34,960
Okay.

398
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,230
Oh.

399
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,140
What's wrong?

400
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,310
Bleeding! Bleeding!

401
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,100
Blood!

402
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,180
B...Bleeding. Good.

403
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,060
You're bleeding.

404
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,600
Xing.

405
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,270
Shouldn't you stop the bleeding for me?

406
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,730
Of course.

407
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,430
You're bleeding.

408
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:10,270
Xing.

409
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,420
It's so hot.

410
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,680
Are we waiting for someone here?

411
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:14,600
Yes.

412
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,180
We're waiting for brother.

413
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,230
They went to buy some daily necessities.

414
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:26,770
Oh.

415
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,310
Oh no, someone is coming again!

416
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,810
They scared me!

417
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,810
Oh!

418
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:53,480
Ouch!

419
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,230
Your right hand is injured.

420
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,270
You can't use a sword.

421
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,390
I happen to have a Left-handed Sword.

422
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,930
I think you haven't had lunch

423
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,640
or something.

424
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,220
Ah.

425
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,530
Can you give me some strength?

426
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,100
Power.

427
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,020
Give me some strength. Hurry!

428
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:30,810
Hurry!

429
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,480
One more time.

430
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,890
OK. Come on!

431
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,050
Power!

432
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:36,770
Power!

433
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,250
Come on.

434
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,560
Come on.

435
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,520
The feeling of anger, do you understand?

436
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,730
Anger! Anger! Anger!

437
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,810
Come on. Hit me here.

438
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:02,770
A...Anger.

439
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:05,020
Here.

440
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:05,980
Give it to me.

441
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,600
Sorry. It broke.

442
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,600
Who dares to bully my brother?

443
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,890
Go!

444
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:26,140
Brother!

445
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,420
Go!

446
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,980
Hurry up!

447
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,560
It seems like Bu Ting really isn't Fork Man.

448
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,310
I shouldn't have spent this money

449
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,520
to ask someone to test him.

450
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,600
Bu Ying beat them up

451
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,270
and they asked me for twice the money.

452
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,520
Brother.

453
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,060
Brother.

454
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,520
What are you doing secretly

455
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,270
in broad daylight?

456
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,560
N...Nothing.

457
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,810
I was just drawing.

458
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,060
Just drawing.

459
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,230
Hey.

460
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:57,850
Bu Ying Brother,

461
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,270
What brings you here?

462
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,390
Nothing.

463
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,680
I can't find you?

464
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:07,480
No.

465
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,980
I thought you usually practice outside

466
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,100
during the day, right?

467
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,890
Bu Ying Brother,

468
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,930
You can't see this.

469
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,270
Don't look!

470
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,230
Hey. What's written in your booklet?

471
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,060
Why are you so nervous?

472
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,020
What else can't I see?

473
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,180
No, no, that's my secret.

474
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,230
Just show me.

475
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:22,810
My secret.

476
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,110
I...

477
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,430
You, I...

478
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:44,380
No.

479
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,480
Brother,

480
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,430
can you explain

481
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,230
why is everything written in this booklet

482
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,060
about my brother and Xingchen?

483
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,780
I...

484
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,640
I can explain.

485
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:02,700
Okay.

486
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:04,230
Go ahead.

487
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,430
I'll listen.

488
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,470
I want you to record what happened

489
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,050
between Xingchen and Jiang Buting.

490
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,810
and send me a letter by pigeon.

491
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:22,730
Can you do it?

492
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,150
Then...

493
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,280
Well...

494
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:30,310
Okay.

495
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:33,610
I see.

496
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
I got it, brother.

497
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,220
Did someone threaten you?

498
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:36,930
Tell me who it is.

499
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,520
I'll beat him up for you.

500
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,060
No.

501
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,430
What are you thinking?

502
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,350
I wrote these things for myself.

503
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,730
For yourself?

504
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:53,810
Yes.

505
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:57,980
It's such a ashame.

506
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,590
When you saw me writing these things,

507
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,770
your initial reaction

508
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,060
isn't to suspect that I'm a bad person,

509
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,690
but rather to think

510
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,770
that I've been threatened.

511
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,600
You really consider me as one of your own.

512
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,020
Of course.

513
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,310
I really treat you as my brother.

514
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,350
At this point,

515
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,429
I'll be honest with you.

516
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,889
Actually, the materials I collected

517
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,520
are for my writing.

518
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,020
For such a big secret,

519
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,480
I wouldn't tell just anyone.

520
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:30,770
Writing?

521
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,310
Oh.

522
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,929
Actually,

523
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,600
I'm a writer.

524
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,929
You're a writer?

525
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,350
Yes.

526
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:46,230
Brother,

527
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,230
you are awesome!

528
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,100
