I hoped for a miracle,

176
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,820
but unfortunately

177
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,740
your body started to corrupt.

178
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,390
That's why he called you a total failure.

179
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,070
So...

180
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,590
I wasn't born weak.

181
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,280
Well, at first,

182
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
you did have some minor health issues.

183
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,230
But I cured them later.

184
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,220
You don't have focus of infection now.

185
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,730
I chose you

186
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,330
because of your bones for real.

187
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
Why?

188
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,240
I treated you as my master,

189
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,220
but you treated me as a test subject.

190
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:32,920
No.

191
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,920
The best.

192
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,990
You're my best test subject.

193
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,630
Only you could do it.

194
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,220
No one else could.

195
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:48,730
Only you

196
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,150
could take the medicine, no matter how strong it was,

197
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,800
you were able to tolerate it courageously.

198
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,560
You were a good kid.

199
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,260
And I adored you the most.

200
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,460
You've gone through so much for me.

201
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:11,360
I wouldn't want to see you being so weak.

202
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,500
But I am so close.

203
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,750
There is only one missing piece.

204
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,190
I'm almost there.

205
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,640
And you won't have to suffer then.

206
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,240
Umm?

207
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:30,990
Good boy.

208
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,070
Can you take me to Xingchen?

209
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,210
Now she is the missing piece.

210
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,400
I won't let you touch her.

211
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,730
Master, you stabbed me again.

212
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,190
You're really great.

213
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,630
You won again.

214
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:38,560
Master,

215
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,140
I am

216
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,030
not letting you win this time.

217
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,050
Why bother?

218
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,600
That's perfect.

219
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,180
Perfect.

220
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,180
Well,

221
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,570
how are things going?

222
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,720
Let me tell you something.

223
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,570
My medicine

224
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,890
is really special.

225
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,460
I asked Jiang Buting about

226
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,120
Huo Xingchen's responses to my medicine.

227
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,240
And then I made the pills especially

228
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,680
according to her feedback.

229
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,540
Well, can I take it?

230
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,110
You...

231
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,070
Well,

232
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,980
this medicine

233
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,750
will only work for people

234
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,820
who practice martial arts.

235
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,470
It will be useless

236
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,250
for an ordinary people like you,

237
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,860
who are born with flawed bones.

238
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,660
Besides, I don't think

239
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,560
you would want to take it.

240
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,440
Why?

241
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,450
this medicine can help you

242
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,350
reach your full potential

243
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,870
in a short time.

244
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,160
But you will lose your consciousness

245
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,940
after taking it.

246
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,530
You'll have to take a long time to recover.

247
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,600
It's good that my son is unconscious right now.

248
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,630
Otherwise, the silly boy

249
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,400
wouldn't be able to hurt her at all.

250
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,640
You...

251
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,420
I like it when you're being

252
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,590
such a monster.

253
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,490
Buting.

254
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,380
Perfect.

255
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,570
Perfect.

256
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,310
This is so perfect.

257
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,810
I didn't expect

258
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,460
I can see the perfect combination of the pills.

259
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,850
The book of heaven

260
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,240
is perfect indeed.

261
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,540
Mu. Mu.

262
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,660
Mu, what happened to you?

263
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,750
Wake up. It's me, Xingchen.

264
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,630
Don't waste your energy.

265
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,890
He can't hear you.

266
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,630
Without normal people's emotions,

267
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,260
now he is the strongest one.

268
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,300
He is the best weapon in my hand now.

269
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,950
You even did this to your own son?

270
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,920
You are a monster.

271
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,630
This is good for him, isn't it?

272
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,310
Hmm?

273
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,220
In the martial arts world,

274
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,290
who would be

275
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,690
as powerful as him?

276
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,650
Hmm?

277
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,840
Very soon,

278
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,950
they will hand over the whole martial world to us.

279
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,890
Mu, wake up.

280
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,090
Don't give up on yourself.

281
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,280
As long as you don't give up on yourself,

282
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,440
no one can control you.

283
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,340
I won't give up on you. Wake up!

284
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,740
Mu,

285
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,750
we said we were going to become the hero and heroine when we were children.

286
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,750
Don't you remember?

287
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,260
Mu,

288
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,500
you said

289
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,780
you would protect me.

290
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,490
Mu,

291
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,190
my dad said there were many bad people in the martial arts world.

292
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,260
Don't be afraid, Xingchen.

293
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,470
I will always stand in front of you.

294
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,100
When there are bad guys, you can run first.

295
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:44,320
Okay, let's go help those in need and eliminate the bullies.

296
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,540
Let's be the great hero and heroine.

297
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,090
The great hero and heroine.

298
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,810
Sound a bit weird.

299
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,110
But no worries, Xingchen.

300
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,690
We will be the best warriors

301
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,000
and become the legend in the martial arts world.

302
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,650
Umm.

00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,790
Loser!

308
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:48,810
Guards!

309
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,950
Get those lowlifes out.

310
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,390
Put them in jail.

311
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,480

Xingchen,

326
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,290
this time,

327
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,670
I finally protected you successfully.

328
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,420
Yaoguang.

329
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,370
Yaoguang.

330
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,490
My father did all this,

331
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:45,840
didn't he?

332
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,400
Yaoguang,

333
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:51,880
please remember

334
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,720
your father is who he is.

335
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:56,710
But you're not him.

336
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,400
Yaoguang.

337
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,100
I want to see him.

338
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,410
I'll wait for you here.

339
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,320
Let me know if you need anything.

340
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,280
Umm.

341
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:27,230
Dad.

342
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,220
what are you doing here?

343
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,190
Are you here to laugh at me too?

344
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,520
No, I am not.

345
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,440
Or, are you here

346
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,970
to break me out?

347
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,290
How did I raise you two

348
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,370
ungrateful brats?

349
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:58,940
Dad,

350
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,410
we are not.

351
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,320
My brother and I

352
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,080
have always listened to you since we were children.

353
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,660
Then why did you betray me?

354
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,230
Huh?

355
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,740
Why did you do that to me?

356
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,410
You betrayed me. Your brother did, too.

357
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,220
He could have become the best in the world.

358
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,640
He could have anything he wants.

359
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,400
But he betrayed me at last.

360
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,980
He deserved to die.

361
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,750
What did you say?

362
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:28,700
Brother.

363
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,680
What happened to my brother?

364
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,860
Why?

365
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,520
You didn't know?

366
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,260
Your brother is dead.

367
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,620
That's impossible.

368
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,230
Father，

369
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,140
you're lying, aren't you?

370
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,710
He's my brother.

371
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,610
Why would I lie to you?

372
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,440
Didn't your good friends tell you?

373
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,870
Your brother is dead.

374
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,730
Your brother is dead.

375
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,070
Your brother is dead.

376
00:31:59,220 --> 00:31:59,870
No.

377
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,440
I don't believe it.

378
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,150
I do not.

379
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,240
My brother won't die.

380
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,560
Yaoguang.

381
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,570
He said

382
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,920
my brother...

383
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,500
my brother…he…

384
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,910
I wanted to tell you as soon as I knew.

385
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,260
Then I thought...

386
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,150
You mean...

387
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,820
Yaoguang.

388
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:40,700
Brother.

389
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,110
You...

390
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,660
Brother.

391
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,380
Since you weren't willing to,

392
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,860
why did you say that?

393
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,190
I always thought

394
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,180
you were just obsessed with martial arts

395
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,450
and didn't care about anything else.

396
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,990
I've never seen you so sad

397
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,510
even when your son died.

398
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,670
Why is your daughter different?

399
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,440
Umm?

400
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,070
After all, she was raised by love.

401
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,550
But this is good.

402
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,880
It's not over yet.

403
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:21,280
Yaoguang is different from Binghe.

404
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,429
She would be my only offspring,

405
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,800
in case things didn't work out.

406
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,980
This is not like you.

407
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,150
So far, everything

408
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,210
is going smoothly, isn't it?

409
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,969
You're right.

410
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:49,320
After planning for years,

411
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,409
I will definitely win

412
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,590
in the end.

413
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,950
Well,

414
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,630
it must be cold in the snow mountain now.

415
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,580
I wonder if that girl

416
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,450
is weraing more layers of clothing.

417
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,640
You didn't even care about the apprentice you raised up.

418
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,390
Now you're worried about her?

419
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,630
Bah!

420
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,530
Would you treat the failure

421
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,410
and the treasure the same?

422
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,420
Am I right?

423
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,960
[Tianque Sect] [Kunlun]

424
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,920
It's so high.

425
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,560
It's indeed beyond humans' capacity.

426
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,230
Uncle Fu,

427
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,210
when did you come?

428
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,280
We arrived

429
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,560
not long ago.

430
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,200
I've heard about it.

431
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,740
I didn’t expect

432
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,380
the one you went to meet that night

433
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,000
was Chief Mu.

434
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:02,790
How long has Uncle Huo been poisoned?

435
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,450
More than 2 months.

436
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,270
Have you tried other treatments

437
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,310
since he got poisoned?

438
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,900
We've tried various ways

439
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,490
over the past 2 months.

440
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,000
And we asked different doctors.

441
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,440
They all said

442
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:17,670
only the Ice Herb

443
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,950
could remove the poison.

444
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,080
Why didn't he kill him,

445
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,150
since he was able to poison him?

446
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,760
It's been 2 months.

447
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,490
The things in Yinling Valley were finished.

448
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,280
Everything was settled.

449
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,590
Why did Chief Mu

450
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,410
poison Chief Huo at that moment?

451
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,830
Was it really because Chief Huo

452
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,280
found some clues?

453
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,640
We need a famous booster of the medicine

454
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,130
to compeletely cure him.

455
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,350
Which booster?

456
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,380
The Ice Herb.

457
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,010
I also need the Ice Herb

458
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,170
to recover.

459
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,050
Is this really a coincidence?

460
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,150
I've worked so hard for 10 years.

461
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,000
My best test subject

462
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,050
is now a failure.

463
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:18,940
It's so…

464
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,510
Why did Chief Mu

465
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,940
make that move at that particular time?

466
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,350
If he had made Mu Binghe did that from the beginning,

467
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:31,370
or hired more men like Mu Binghe,

468
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,990
he would have succeed.

469
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,700
If he wanted to be the Chief of Wuyue Sect,

470
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:40,770
why didn't he murder Chief Huo?

471
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,330
Compared to murder,

472
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,930
it was more like

473
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,630
walking into the trap.

474
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,000
Buting.

475
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,940
Buting, are you here to visit me?

476
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,180
You did it on purpose.

477
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,700
I don't know what you're talking about.

478
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,220
What are you doing exactly?

479
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,730
What else can I do?

480
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,590
Look.

481
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:35,790
Your master and I are prisoners now.

482
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,030
Our power is sealed.

483
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,410
We can't play any games now.

484
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,890
You've planned this for years.

485
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,530
You won't let it fail so easily.

486
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:45,980
You hid it so well,

487
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,110
from Elixir Village to Star-picking Sect.

488
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,810
Why did you let it fail now?

489
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,820
Take a guess.

490
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,250
The Fork Man

491
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,870
is the No. 1 hero in the martial arts world.

492
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:00,270
He fights for the justice for people,

493
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,810
and is loved by everyone there.

494
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:04,960
You are so smart.

495
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:08,340
You don't need to ask me, do you?

496
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,170
Brother.

497
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:27,330
Brother.

498
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,170
Something happened to Xingchen.

499
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:31,860
Are you okay?

500
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,820
I'm fine. Take me to her.

501
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:51,890
Your hand.

502
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,480
Your hand.

503
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,390
You've reached your limist.

504
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,570
Xing.

505
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,970
Xing, are you okay?

506
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:24,950
I...I'm fine.

507
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,820
It's such a big wound. How can you say you're fine?

508
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,660
If you were a little late,

509
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:40,020
her wounds would have healed.

510
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,460
How come there was an avalanche?

511
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,790
You fell from such a high place.

512
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,300
Do you have some internal injuries?

513
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:49,680
I'm fine.

514
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,490
I've practiced the skills from the Book of Heaven.

515
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,370
I have the magic power to protect myself now.

516
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,180
Here. Look.

517
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:05,660
Umm.

518
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,420
I'm glad you're okay.

519
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,080
She's really fine.

520
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:12,580
You are the one who is really injured.

521
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,240
Let me check your pulse.

522
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,380
How come… how come you've relapsed so much?

523
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:27,580
What…what did you do?

524
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,590
I didn't do anything.

525
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:30,370
Grandma,

526
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,930
give him the Ice Herb now.

527
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:33,040
He will recover after take it, right?

528
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,080
Yes.

529
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:35,560
Here.

530
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,130
You'll recover after taking it.

531
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:18,460
Grandma,

532
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:20,060
how is my dad?

533
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,380
I've withheld the poison in his elixir field.

534
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:26,560
The poison can be removed after he takes Ice Herb.

535
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:28,130
That's great.

536
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:30,750
Then give him the herb now.

537
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,040
Grandma, what's wrong?

538
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,060
Is there something wrong with the Ice Herb?

539
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,790
There should be the Yin and the Yang of the Ice Herb.

540
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,650
They grow together.

541
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,770
The combined two

542
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:55,270
is counted as one.

543
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,180
Well, then…

544
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,250
I'm going to pick another.

545
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,740
It won't work.

546
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,940
I've sent someone to check.

547
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:06,310
The cliff where the Ice Herb grow

548
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,400
has collapsed.

549
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:14,070
Well…can this one save two people?

550
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,670
One Ice Herb

551
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,460
can only save one person.

552
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,750
Xingchen,

553
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:41,170
are you going to save Jiang Buting, or your father?

554
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,420
You have to make the decision as soon as possible.

555
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:56,520
♫Wow, baby♫

556
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,510
♫I can touch the clouds in fairy tales♫

557
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:11,290
♫When I reach out♫

558
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,370
♫A calm heart starts♫

559
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:15,980
♫To feel excited and nervous♫

560
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,770
♫The sky in front of me is also painted♫

561
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:20,970
♫Heart-warming pink♫
