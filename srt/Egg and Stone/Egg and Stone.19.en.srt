4
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,710
You're right.

5
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,830
I'm just a stableman. How dare I think about Her Ladyship?

6
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,010
How outrageous it is.

7
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,980
It's like hitting a stone with an egg.

8
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,060
Hitting a stone with an egg.

9
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,510
The egg is the brave one.

10
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,340
Jiang Buting,

11
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,220
would you dare to elope with me?

12
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,070
♫Wow, baby♫

13
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,080
♫I can touch the clouds in fairy tales♫

14

♫When I reach out♫

15

00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:31,960
Xingchen.

42
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,980
Come to me.

43
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,590
She won't go.

44
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,060
Mu Binghe,

45
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,560
Face the reality.

46
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,280
Xingchen.

47
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,060
Mu, I...

48
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:48,620
Xing.

49
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,550
Don't talk to him.

50
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,200
Someone

51
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,790
speaks nicely,

52
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,170
but is actually despicable.

53
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,900
You darn stableman! Let her go!

54
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,690
No!

55
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,580
Xingchen is mine.

56
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,360
Even if you take the lead,

57
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,840
as long as I show up,

58
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,290
she will definitely fall in love with me.

59
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,030
Well, you definitely don't know

60
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,890
once I kill both of you,

61
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,519
this dream will enter a new cycle.

62
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,890
Everything will start over.

63
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,450
Xingchen

64
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,490
will be my wife afterall.

65
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,510
Xing.

66
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,560
This is the border of the dreamland.

67
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,190
It should be the exit of the dream.

68
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,030
Do you know?

69
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,060
Actually,

70
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,830
since I was young,

71
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,740
I've been afraid of water.

72
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,530
Why are you

73
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,460
bringing this up now?

74
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,100
♫One inch of tears♫

75
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,440
♫Goes through the time♫

76
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,890
♫And falls from the clouds♫

77
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,990
♫Then it turns into silence♫

78
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,850
♫Is this the end♫

79
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,010
♫Is this the end♫

80
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,890
♫I'll look for it forever♫

81
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,090
♫No matter the distance♫

82
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,320
♫Far away or closer♫

83
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:38,770
Xingchen.

84
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,550
♫In your eyes♫

85
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,710
♫Is this the end♫

86
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,700
♫Is this the end♫

87
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,170
♫Is this the end♫

88
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,270
Xing.

89
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,090
Why are we still in the dream?

90
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,580
Yeah.

91
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,330
As you said,

92
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,060
as long as we know we're in the dream,

93
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,390
we can break free from the pipe dream.

94
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,860
There's only one possibility now.

95
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,450
The master of this dream

96
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,920
is Mu Binghe.

97
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,850
Only when he wakes up,

98
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,690
everything will end.

99
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,220
He's here.

100
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,520
Xingchen.

101
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,190
I won't hurt you.

102
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,550
It'll be fine soon.

103
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,540
Mu,

104
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,320
you're actually sober, right?

105
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,270
Every time I realize something is wrong,

106
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,700
you would change my mind

107
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,720
and slowly confuse my consciousness.

108
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,630
You've been deceiving me all along.

109
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,380
You lied to me that you let go of everything.

110
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,440
But you didn't.

111
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,280
You've always known

112
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,330
that everything now is fake.

113
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,360
Yet, you still want to trap us

114
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,650
in this fake dream.

115
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,670
Mu Binghe,

116
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,220
you are nothing more than this.

117
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,370
You keep saying that you love Xingchen,

118
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,800
yet you'd rather be with a fake Xingchen

119
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,970
and indulge in this dream.

120
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:33,530
Do you know?

121
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,190
Xingchen's body outside

122
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,320
has already reached its limit.

123
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,570
You don't truly love her.

124
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,300
What you love

125
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,620
is just a substitute

126
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,350
that can be manipulated by you,

127
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,070
and change as you wish.

128
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,400
Shut up!

129
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,180
Xingchen.

130
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,060
let's just stay here,

131
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,630
isn't it good?

132
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,610
Mu,

133
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,530
this is just a dream.

134
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,200
I'm just the version of me that you imagine in this dream.

135
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,600
You

136
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,490
will wake up from the dream one day.

137
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,870
Even if it's just a dream,

138
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,480
I'm willing to indulge in it.

139
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,780
You're crazy.

140
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,560
We'll all die here.

141
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,350
I don't care.

142
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,890
At least here,

143
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,660
Xingchen belongs to me.

144
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,690
She is mine.

145
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,140
I won't let you hurt her.

146
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,700
Xingchen.

147
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,960
Move!

148
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,420
Move away!

149
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,900
Is this how much you love him?

150
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:57,900
Huh?

151
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,620
Even if it's just a dream,

152
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,430
even if everything is fake,

153
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,250
you still want to protect him?

154
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,870
I know

155
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,250
that all of this is me forcing it.

156
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,900
But Xingchen, I have no other choice.

157
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,270
What can I do to keep you?

158
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,190
Only in this dream

159
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,810
can I temporarily have you.

160
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,170
Unfortunately,

161
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,570
this beautiful dream

162
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,190
cannot be completed.

163
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,890
If

164
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,830
I have to wake up from this dream...

to die here.

174
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,060
♫I still have a lot to tell you♫

175
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,560
♫When you wake up and smile at me♫

176
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:30,830
♫The falling heart will shine bright light again♫

177
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:38,310
♫Time flies like firework, but it can’t take away my persistence♫

178
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:43,880
♫I always embrace the passion♫

179
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,820
♫Oh♫

180
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,250
♫Let me follow you without hesitation♫

181
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:57,660
♫There's no such thing as you in this world♫

182
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,890
♫I'll still protect you in your dreams♫

183
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,800
♫Oh♫

184
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:17,060
♫I won't regret staying with you♫

185
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,280
Buting.

186
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:28,970
Xing.

187
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,990
Xing.

188
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,940
Buting, are you okay?

189
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,780
Yeah.

190
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,210
We're finally back.

191
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,280
I will never

192
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,770
never let you go again.

193
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,540
Okay.

194
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,120
Oh my.

195
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,880
It was really a pipe dream.

196
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,570
Let's go out and have fun.

197
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,550
I'm not going. Go by yourself.

198
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,440
I'm going.

199
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,270
Look, how wonderful the outside world is.

200
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,290
So, the real world is still better.

201
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,350
Alright,

202
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,600
I know you've suffered.

203
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,350
About that dream,

204
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:52,810
I...

205
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:53,290
Dream?

206
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,770
What dream?

207
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,310
You did it on purpose.

208
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,840
A little girl told me before

209
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,860
that yesterday's everything is like death.

210
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,730
The Huo Xingchen in the dream

211
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,870
is not the real Huo Xingchen.

212
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,800
What we need to do now is to cherish the present,

213
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,600
cherish the moment.

214
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,190
Well...

215
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:36,880
Sir!

216
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,290
Jie!

217
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,070
Ouch, it hurts!

218
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,160
Ouch, ouch, ouch, it hurts!

219
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,240
Chen Jie, why are you here?

220
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,500
That's our home.

221
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,480
Your home?

222
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,360
You...

223
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,820
Aren't you the ones who scared me?

224
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,080
Chen Jie.

225
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,790
Weren't you getting treatment from Doctor Song?

226
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,730
Why? The medicine didn't work?

227
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,880
We have our reasons.

228
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,680
You just woke up.

229
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,100
You need to walk around.

230
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,050
Why don't you take a look around Sophora Town first?

231
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,750
We can talk about it later.

232
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,780
Okay.

233
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,520
Oh.

234
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,140
For us?

235
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,800
Thank you.

236
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,490
Thank you.

237
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:01,820
Smells good.

238
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,180
Are you friends of Mr. Chen?

239
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:06,900
Yes.

240
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,900
We are Chen Jie's friends.

241
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,670
Since you're Mr. Chen's friend,

242
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,780
please come in.

243
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,010
May I ask

244
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,270
since you haven't recovered,

245
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,190
why don't you go to Doctor Song for treatment?

246
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:24,540
I don't know what you're talking about.

247
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,860
Doctor,

248
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,160
you let

249
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,920
mutants work here?

250
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,750
This child is my son.

251
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,670
He has recovered a lot.

252
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,210
Not only can he recognize medicine, but he can also read.

253
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,940
I brought him to the shop

254
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,180
to help out.

255
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,090
Why don't you go to Doctor Song for treatment?

256
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,460
It can be cured, isn't it?

257
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,830
Ping!

258
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,160
Don't mention Doctor Song in Sophora Town anymore.

259
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,630
People here don't like to hear it.

260
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,580
Ping!

261
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,590
Stop running around. Come back.

262
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,770
Ping!

263
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:53,760
Hey.

264
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,450
What are you thinking?

265
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,350
It's weird.

266
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,310
They don't seem

267
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,500
to receive any treatment from my master.

268
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,470
But it feels like

269
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,800
they have been living with the mutants for a long time.

270
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,580
What exactly went wrong?

271
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,230
Chen,

272
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,600
we've been wandering in Sophora Town the whole day.

273
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,430
and found that the mutants haven't been treated.

274
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,640
What's going on?

275
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,340
And I noticed that most of the mutants

276
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,720
haven't fully recovered either.

277
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,900
It seems that

278
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,980
they

279
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,140
are particularly averse to mentioning my master.

280
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,850
You don't know.

281
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,330
All of this

282
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,200
started a month ago.

283
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,400
On that day,

284
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,670
after you rescued Jie in Yinling Valley,

285
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,280
we followed a group of mutants

286
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,940
to Doctor Song's clinic.

287
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,810
Jie.

288
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,200
Great!

289
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,690
We'll be back to normal soon.

290
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:05,870
Yes.

291
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,470
Doctor Song looks kind and compassionate.

292
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,590
He's a good man.

293
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,450
Yes.

294
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,410
Yu is right.

295
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,800
Listen.

296
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,580
Don't talk.

297
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,430
And don't move.

298
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,340
So they won't think you're fine

299
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,410
and don't treat you.

300
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,560
Okay.

301
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:30,580
Okay.

302
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,780
I'll wait for you at the place we used to live.

303
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:35,570
Okay.

304
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,840
[Xiao Xiangzi] [Jiang Wen] [Master Yumian]

305
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,240
Bamboo Leaf Man.

306
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,500
Shi Xiaoyu.

307
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,340
Go.

308
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,120
Go.

309
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,680
Number six.

310
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,760
Add poisonous spider, the venom of snake,

311
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,920
and cinnabar.

312
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,140
Well.

313
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,250
Although on the outside he seems to have recovered,

314
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,760
the poison has already infiltrated

315
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,770
into the lungs,

316
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,240
causing meridians burst and death.

317
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,650
Well,

318
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,870
it's useless.

319
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,010
Drag him out.

320
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,080
Get another one.

321
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,190
Hey.

322
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:10,770
Master,

323
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,730
all the mutants for today's experiment are ready.

324
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,300
These two are strong.

325
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,700
The potency of the medicine can be stronger.

326
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,750
That's great.

327
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,860
I just made a new medicine today.

328
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,480
Let's see if there are any interesting changes later.

329
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,130
Okay.

330
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,390
This medicine

331
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,220
is most effective when tested on humans.

332
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,470
Master, he seems to wake up soon.

333
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,580
Nonsense, that's impossible.

334
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:45,690
It's true, Master.

335
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,690
What should we do?

336
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,020
Could it be a coincidence?

337
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,700
Hey.

338
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,230
You.

339
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,920
Drag him to the front hall immediately.

340
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,850
Present him as a cured case.

341
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,430
Okay.

342
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,860
Master, should I record

343
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,140
this formula in the records?

344
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,710
You fool.

345
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,970
My goal is not to save mutants.

346
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,010
What's there to record?

347
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,280
Okay.

348
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,430
Let's go.

349
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,460
Okay.

350
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,640
Mr. Zhou,

351
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,210
you've recovered.

352
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,740
You can go back and rest now.

353
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,070
Thank you for saving my life.

354
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,230
I will never forget it.

355
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,380
If you need my help in the future,

356
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,630
I will do my best to help.

357
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,730
Don't mention it.

358
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,310
Farewell.

359
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,560
Doctor Song can bring people back from the brink of death.

360
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,180
His medical skills are unmatched.

361
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,160
It seems that

362
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,520
Mr. Zhou's internal energy

363
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,340
is much stronger than before.

364
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:13,930
Yeah.

365
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:14,440
That's right.

366
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,640
What a pity.

367
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,600
I lost another test subject.

368
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,160
Let's go.

369
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,890
Have you checked the mutants in other rooms?

370
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:29,610
Yes.

371
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:30,420
Let's go.

372
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,450
Brothers...

373
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,410
who are conscious

374
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,590
don't...

375
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,510
have to pretend anymore.

376
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,600
Out of 20 people,

377
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,520
only one was saved.

378
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,650
Save?

379
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,620
He's using us as test subjects.

380
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,140
We...

381
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,000
we need to save ourselves.

382
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,570
Let's go.

383
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,210
Stop.

384
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,770
Something is wrong with the fog.

385
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,280
Don't break in.

386
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,900
Retreat.

387
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,370
Retreat.

388
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,000
Impossible.

389
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,170
Master

390
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,560
always helps others selflessly.

391
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,080
You can't be talking about Master.

392
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,840
Mr. Jiang, don't be angry.

393
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,040
We are also confused.

394
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,190
Me and Jie have been hesitating

395
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,940
whether we should tell you this

396
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,860
because of your relationship

397
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,450
with Doctor Song.

398
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,680
Maybe

399
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,080
Master has his reasons, right?

400
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,040
Yes.

401
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,840
Master

402
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,550
must have his reasons.

403
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,330
By the way,

404
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,530
when Jie escaped,

405
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,760
he brought some pills with him.

406
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,840
The doctors in town have examined them.

407
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,270
Most of the pills

408
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,280
can't help the mutants regain consciousness.

409
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,940
And the effect of these pills

410
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,980
are not the same.

411
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,710
Some are tonics,

412
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,190
some can stimulate people's mind,

413
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,410
and some

414
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,780
are poison.

415
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,010
Poison?

416
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,110
Impossible.

417
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,140
I know that

418
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,110
Master

419
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,190
has a habit of studying new medicine.

420
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,450
He has prescribed medicine for me since I was young.

421
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,320
It can't be poison.

422
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,610
Hey.

423
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,270
You.

424
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:14,600
Where is your brother?

425
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,660
He went out just now.

426
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,670
He looked upset.

427
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,460
Did you fight again?

428
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:20,740
What fight?

429
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,070
Bu...

430
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,350
Buying.

431
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:26,820
Chen.

432
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,070
Chen.

433
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,040
Well...

434
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,040
Where...

435
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,210
Where...

436
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,000
is your brother?

437
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,290
My brother?

438
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,690
Why is everyone looking for my brother?

439
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,170
He went out just now.

440
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,230
Doctor Song...

441
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,140
Master?

442
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,240
might be at Star-picking Sect.

443
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,900
Why is Master at Star-picking Sect?

444
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,140
How do you know?

445
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,600
A mother and daughter

446
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:59,700
who just returned from the Star-picking Sect.

447
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,420
saw him.

448
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,210
Okay, I got it.

449
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,270
I'll tell my brother now.

450
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:17,880
Actually, I hope it's not your master.

451
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,430
Chen,

452
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,840
it's not your fault.

453
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,630
We'll look into it.

454
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,580
Okay.

455
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:50,870
Master, I won!

456
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,980
Master, I won!

457
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,660
Master, I beat you!

458
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,750
Master, master, I won!

459
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,790
Master!

460
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,070
Master!

461
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,240
Buting has grown up.

462
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,600
You don't need me anymore.

463
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,910
Master.

464
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,230
I will never grow up.

465
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,600
Then Master won't get old.

466
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,150
Good boy.

467
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,250
I will

468
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,650
protect you well

469
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,700
and let you grow up safely.

470
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,830
Thank you, Master.

471
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,740
Master.

472
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,990
In fact, in the previous game,

473
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,580
I was just lucky.

474
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,360
Shall we play another round?

475
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,560
It really was just luck.

476
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,120
How can I ever beat Master?

477
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,370
Let's play another round.

478
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:55,390
Let's go.

479
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:55,940
Let's go.

480
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,580
Are you okay?

481
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,310
Why...

482
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:19,800
Why am I not okay?

483
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,520
As long as you're here,

484
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,760
everything will be fine.

485
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,580
I'm talking about

486
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,210
Doctor Song.

487
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,890
Actually,

488
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,650
I think I know

489
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:38,860
why Master did that.

490
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,450
Master

491
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,030
went against his nature

492
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,880
and did everything

493
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,870
because of me.

494
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,230
Because of you?

495
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:56,810
Yes.

496
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:10,970
I'm sorry.

497
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,360
Excuse me.

498
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,250
Go ahead.

499
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,520
Master is at the Star-picking Sect.

500
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,740
Master.

501
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,050
Master.

502
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,660
I don't want to live long.

503
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,080
I don't want you to cough up blood,

504
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,870
or test the medicine.

505
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,290
If there's a living person to test on,

506
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,050
it'll be much more efficient.

507
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,830
Master did this

508
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,730
for my illness.

509
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,199
He became obsessed

510
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,960
and experimented on living creatures.

511
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,810
In the eyes of the world, he made a mistake,

512
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,469
but to me,

513
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:33,989
what did he do wrong?

514
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,630
Jiang Buting,

515
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,900
all the mistakes

516
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,330
are your fault.

517
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,600
Here.

518
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,200
Have some porridge.

519
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:08,360
Thank you.

520
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,100
Be careful.

521
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,560
Give it to me.

522
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,980
What are you thinking?

One or two

you are not really treating those mutants,

619

620
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,130

00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,950
From these batches of mutants,

624
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,270

Studying living subjects is indeed effective.

My current research

631
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,370
is much more efficient.

632
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:17,260
It's already pitiful that they were made into mutants.

633
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,080
They have families.

634
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,460

Don't you feel guilty

Please stop making mistakes.

699
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,950
No, I won't.

700
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:23,820
Master.

701
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:25,390
Why?

702
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:33,550
Good boy.

703
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:35,410
Drink this

704
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:38,430

00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:46,670
My medicine!

706
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,030
Very well.

707

Blending perfectly.

708
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:01,690

709
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,500
Okay?

710
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:04,910
It's much better for me to conduct research

711
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,110
with you than with Buting.

712
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:08,650
Okay?

713
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,590
Do you feel tingking all over?

714
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,130
Do you smell that fragrance?

715
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,720
Do you feel like you've lost all your strength?

716
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:27,830
Don't come over.

717
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:28,850
Don't hurt her.

Master.

719
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:32,300
Please don't hurt her.

720
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,630
How could I ever do that?

721
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:46,290
♫Wow, baby♫

722
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,200
♫I can touch the clouds in fairy tales♫

723
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,050
