1
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:47,667
He's smiling.

2
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:50,809
He's welcoming you.

3
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,917
Chinese hospitality.

4
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,601
Is it gold?

5
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,059
Of course.

6
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,101
This temple

7
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,750
was built in the Yongjia
era of Western Jin,

8
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:03,292
and having been renovated by Tang,
Liao and Jin Dynasties.

9
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,042
I like it.

10
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:10,333
It's for you.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,476
Only one?

12
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,042
All, of course.

13
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,184
Empress Dowager, rest assured.

14
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:23,518
America will always be
a friend to the Great Qing.

15
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,833
Fool.

16
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:48,042
Drive!

17
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,893
Filthy beggar.

18
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:54,917
Back to the palace.

19
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,559
Britain, America, Germany, France,

20
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:03,934
Russia, Italy, Japan, and Austria-Hungary.

21
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,101
Consuls from those eight countries

22
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,143
had been persuaded by me

23
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:10,809
Not to further pursue the Boxer Rebellion.

24
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:11,934
Empress Dowager,

25
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:12,851
rest assured.

26
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:13,875
Alright.

27
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,518
The rebels from Revive China Society,

28
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:17,434
Sun Yat-sen and Zheng Shiliang

29
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:18,726
failed in Guangzhou affair

30
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,684
are now hiding in America,

31
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,143
assembling firearms

32
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:24,309
for bigger rebellion.

33
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,143
Internal stability comes before
eliminating external threats.

34
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:29,143
I believe we should take the initiative,

35
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:31,083
capture Sun and Zheng.

36
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,559
I have one person in mind for the job.

37
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:36,476
Fei Yanggu, Captain of the Imperial Guards.

38
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,851
This man excels as a literary mind

39
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:38,852
and skilled combatant.

40
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:39,934
He is of majestic demeanor

41
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:40,893
and is well-groomed.

42
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:41,852
An expert at dagger flying.

43
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:43,018
An English speaker.

44
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:44,643
Right waiting outside.

45
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:45,667
Summon him.

46
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:47,417
Summon him.

47
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,351
Your faithful servant, Fei Yanggu,

48
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,333
greets your majesty the Empress Dowager.

49
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:55,875
Go to America

50
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,875
and bring back those traitors.

51
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,583
Get rid of those pests

52
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:07,125
and you'll help secure lasting

53
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:11,708
prosperity of the Great Qing.

54
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,083
Well noted.

55
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:17,268
When you said "friends,"

56
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:19,143
I almost believed you meant it.

57
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,226
Of course I did!

58
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,351
As long as they give us enough.

59
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,809
And if they don't

60
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,809
We'll pry it out of them.

61
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,792
Then we'll see which of our
other "friends" can grab the most.

62
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:57,917
What is a genius?

63
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,375
A natural talent.

64
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,643
At five, I had read
through all the classics,

65
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:04,934
mastered music, chess,
calligraphy, and painting,

66
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,851
reciting Tang and Song poetry fluently.

67
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,018
At seven, I took on Chinese medicine,
a family business.

68
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,309
By nine, I was able to
treat patients on my own.

69
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,476
People in my home
village called me a prodigy.

70
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,643
At eleven, because of
my remarkable talents,

71
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,309
Lord Yung Wing chose me as one of the first
Chinese students to study in America,

72
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,625
taking up the mission to revive China.

73
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,351
So, Mr. Prodigy...

74
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:22,917
Genius.

75
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:24,227
Mr. Genius.

76
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:26,375
How exactly did my father die?

77
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:28,875
Gotta think about it.

78
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:33,042
The pills.

79
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,208
The pills?

80
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,351
The victim died from excessive drinking

81
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,393
combined with a large
dose of chloral hydrate,

82
00:05:38,417 --> 00:05:41,042
leading to respiratory failure.

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,125
Who's responsible for his meal?

84
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:46,667
Him.

85
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,042
He is the murderer.

86
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:51,518
Is it

87
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:52,310
a little hasty?

88
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:54,018
What a luxury room.

89
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:55,309
With an ice box.

90
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,684
You knew the victim's habits,

91
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,976
so you simply made ice
with chloral hydrate in it.

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,309
Whiskey on rock,

93
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,059
a nail in the coffin.

94
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,059
There's still some water
from the melted ice.

95
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,208
Let's check this out.

96
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,333
Tie him up.

97
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:12,792
Money! Money!

98
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:13,976
Qin, you've improved.

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That was a lengthy deduction you memorized.

100
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,601
After two months with you,

101
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,393
I've learned just by watching.

102
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:21,643
Detective work isn't so hard, is it?

103
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,226
It helps to have a good teacher.

104
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,934
I don't have disciples.

105
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:25,727
You are my...

106
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:26,851
Translator.

107
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:27,458
I know.

108
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:30,917
What are you going to San Francisco for?

109
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,309
A high official from China is here
to catch a revolutionary.

110
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,726
Our New York office contacted me.

111
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,167
There's another case in San Francisco.

112
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:40,684
I thought it over,

113
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,643
I think it would suit
your particular skill set.

114
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:44,667
Me?

115
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,143
I can work as a translator

116
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:48,268
and a traditional Chinese
medical practitioner

117
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:48,809
but...

118
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:49,519
solve a case?

119
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,750
There's a ten thousand dollar award.

120
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,893
It's not out of the question.

121
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:56,292
Is it a particularly difficult case?

122
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,250
Easy peasy.

123
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:10,083
Qin, you're an astute fellow.

124
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:11,435
In fact,

125
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:14,851
the fundamental principles of
all professions are the same.

126
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,518
Use the logic of traditional
Chinese medicine

127
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:20,018
to magnify the detail and the logic,

128
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:23,667
and I believe you will make
an exceptional detective.

129
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,018
Okay, I'll try.

130
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:28,143
Now, as you get off,
you'll see someone holding a name plaque.

131
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:30,059
Our names are quite similar, so...

132
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:30,792
keep it

133
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,500
So, he will be holding...?

134
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,435
Watson,

135
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:46,434
you're constipated again?

136
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,250
You didn't get to say goodbye to Qin.

137
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,500
The Chinese laxatives he
gave me worked a charm.

138
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,476
Did you refuse the case,

139
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,059
because it's too dangerous, Sherlock?

140
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,143
Partly, yes.

141
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,601
But mostly because I loathe politics.

142
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,143
A white society will never allow
for a white detective

143
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:02,351
to solve this case

144
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,309
And the hardest part of every case

145
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,934
is never the case itself.

146
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,042
I'm trying to help those poor people.

147
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,333
Qin!

148
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,625
Good luck.

149
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,643
It's me

150
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:13,667
It's me, it's me.

151
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:14,913
What are you yapping about?

152
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:16,167
Banana man.

153
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:17,934
I am Sherlock Holmes.

154
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:18,894
You?

155
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:20,518
Last name Qin, first name Fu,
nickname Olmes.

156
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,684
And Fu-Olmes became Holmes.

157
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,500
I thought it would be a white man.

158
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:23,333
I am.

159
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,184
Can't you tell?

160
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:24,894
Is he?

161
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:26,667
Whatever. Take his words then.

162
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:27,768
Mr. Detective,

163
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:28,518
This way please.

164
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:29,542
Come on!

165
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,268
What a San Francisco!

166
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:35,184
Yes

167
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,208
What's the case?

168
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:39,208
No Chinese.

169
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,917
Jack the Ripper.

170
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,019
Isn't he in England?

171
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:43,203
How did he end up in America?

172
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,684
Look, It's the Chinese.

173
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:46,685
Right there!

174
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:47,833
Shut up.

175
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:48,477
Run!

176
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:49,518
Who is Bai?

177
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:50,542
Run!

178
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Run!

179
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:55,143
No Chinese.

180
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,518
Big scene in San Francisco, huh?

181
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:57,851
Haven't you read the papers lately?

182
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:58,644
Shocking news in America.

183
00:08:58,668 --> 00:08:59,792
I'm new here.

184
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:01,309
Jack the Ripper disappeared
over ten years ago.

185
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,434
Since when did he become Chinese?

186
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,083
Three days ago,

187
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,351
two Chinese wandering in the
back alley of the theater

188
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,458
found two bodies.

189
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:07,476
One was a white girl named Alice,

190
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,393
the other, an old Native American man,

191
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:08,894
Six-Hands.

192
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:10,309
The woman was cut open,

193
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,726
with all visceras gone.

194
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,143
The old man had his throat cut,

195
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:14,851
blood sprayed all over the ground.

196
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:15,852
The next morning,

197
00:09:15,876 --> 00:09:16,917
the San Francisco Times

198
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:17,768
received a letter,

199
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:18,394
from

200
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:19,958
Jack the Ripper.

201
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,833
With only one line:

202
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,625
Very delicious...

203
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,792
Are you ready girls?

204
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:26,559
Very delicious...?

205
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:27,583
What does that mean?

206
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:29,583
The worst part is,

207
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,602
Alice's father

208
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:32,226
is a Republican senator,

209
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:32,958
Grant.

210
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,059
Who is running for mayor.

211
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,833
The white community won't let this slip.

212
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,684
And Six-Hands is the
chief of the Navajo tribe.

213
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,184
Neither the Indians would let us off.

214
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,518
It's getting more chaotic out there lately.

215
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:41,976
Our people dare not to leave Chinatown.

216
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,851
Soon, even Chinatown
itself might be in danger.

217
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,226
What are we going to do?

218
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,917
So who exactly is this Jack the Ripper?

219
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,976
Hip Sing Tong.

220
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,708
Rang a bell?

221
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,830
Who doesn't know the biggest
Chinese gang in America?

222
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:51,750
Jack“.

223
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:52,792
Bai.

224
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,917
Are you saying it's Bai Xuanling,
the boss of HST?

225
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:57,226
It's his son,

226
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,144
Bai Zhenbang.

227
00:09:58,168 --> 00:09:59,934
How sick are gangsters nowadays?

228
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,351
As if gambling, selling drugs, pimping,

229
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,018
looting and kidnapping weren't enough.

230
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,434
They are into cannibalism now?

231
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,750
So embarrassing.

232
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:06,809
Alright,

233
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:07,559
enough about them.

234
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,375
Let's talk about our case.

235
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:09,417
Just did.

236
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,583
Did what?

237
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,393
Told you everything.

238
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:13,851
Our boss will

239
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:14,875
tell you the rest.

240
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,625
Father

241
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,917
Father

242
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:50,708
Father

243
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,125
Father

244
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,292
Why did you burn him?

245
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,851
Father is starting to stink.

246
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,976
No, I don't believe Father is dead.

247
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,542
He's gone.

248
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,125
And...

249
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,208
stinks, too.

250
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:22,167
I will avenge him.

251
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,083
Ghost.

252
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:33,601
Go ask Pearl.

253
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,625
Go on.

254
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,583
Pearl,

255
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,167
who killed Father?

256
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:16,042
Go to where the Easterners gather.

257
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:19,792
The first person you knocked into

258
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,333
will answer you.

259
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:31,643
Use the gift granted by the Kachina

260
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:37,958
to find the justice you demand.

261
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:20,852
Here in America,

262
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:22,516
Buddha, General Guan and Jesus all works.

263
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:25,417
This...

264
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,292
must be Detective Fu, right?

265
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:28,893
A young hero,

266
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:29,769
so majestic in demeanor.

267
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:31,268
I am Bai Xuanling.

268
00:13:31,292 --> 00:13:32,875
Call me Louis.

269
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,518
<i>Master Bah</i>

270
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:35,875
Nice to finally meet you.

271
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,851
I've heard so much about you.

272
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,559
Coming to America alone, empty-handed,

273
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,726
building an empire in forty years,

274
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,000
helping all Chinese in
America through Hip Sing Tong.

275
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:45,434
You're truly our hero.

276
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,101
Every Chinese knows your name.

277
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,125
Brother,

278
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,208
you're too kind.

279
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:51,382
You don't mind if I call
you "Brother," right?

280
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,518
Big Brother.

281
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,768
What you said wasn't entirely accurate.

282
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,018
I didn't came alone.

283
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:57,601
In the third year of Xianfeng, 1854,

284
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,934
I set off with seven
fellow villagers from Siyi.

285
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,226
We traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong,

286
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,101
then went on a boat ride for three months

287
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,768
before we reached San Francisco,
the Gold Mountain.

288
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:06,458
Two of us died of illness on the way.

289
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:07,269
This...

290
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:10,042
is a photo taken by a
British journalist back then.

291
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:12,184
Which one is you?

292
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,208
I'm not in this picture.

293
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:14,768
I hung up these photos

294
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:16,601
as a constant reminder to myself.

295
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,809
So I'd never forget where I came from.

296
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,417
Later, I opened a restaurant,

297
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,893
then laundry,

298
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:22,018
then pawnshop,

299
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:23,101
then factory.

300
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,809
I pushed on against all odds.

301
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,059
Against the Americans,

302
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,518
the Italians,

303
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:29,226
and the Irish.

304
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,351
I made it to where I am today

305
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,393
Seven fellows

306
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,268
one survivor, me.

307
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:37,042
My achievement was built upon two things.

308
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:38,394
Versatility

309
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:39,434
and righteousness.

310
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,768
Amitabha

311
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,542
and hallelujah.

312
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:44,769
I've learned so much

313
00:14:44,793 --> 00:14:46,333
from your words.

314
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:47,726
If you don't mind, bro...

315
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,167
take me as a disciple.

316
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:52,292
Brother to disciple?

317
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:53,601
You are too much for that.

318
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,893
Not at all.

319
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,226
Once a teacher, always a father.

320
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,875
From now on, you're my godfather.

321
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,101
Godfather.

322
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,125
Hey! You!

323
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,458
Alright.

324
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:03,143
OK, godson.

325
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,167
I accept you.

326
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,726
Shall we

327
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,833
talk about your god brother then?

328
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:12,708
<i>So,</i>

329
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,143
why do they think my brother is the killer?

330
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:16,309
Three days ago,

331
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,601
the night of August 10th,

332
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,792
at the Chinese Grand Theater,

333
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:22,292
it was Ching Ling <i>Fu's</i>
premiere in San Francisco.

334
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:37,958
Amazing.

335
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:42,559
Soon after the show began,

336
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,375
Zhenbang suddenly rose to leave.

337
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,351
Zhenbang,

338
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,375
You're leaving?

339
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,750
What's so great about those tricks?

340
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,958
That's amazing.

341
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,375
Bravo!

342
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,434
Alice and Six-Hands

343
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,125
were killed that night

344
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:20,477
in the alley

345
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:22,000
behind the theater.

346
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,875
Someone called the police,

347
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,809
claiming that they saw

348
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,809
Zhenbang there at that time.

349
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:28,833
Where was he going?

350
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:29,726
After leaving the theater,

351
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,727
where did he go?

352
00:16:30,751 --> 00:16:32,125
- No one knows.
- That's him.

353
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,309
Until the morning of the 11th,

354
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,208
when the police arrested him at the port.

355
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,144
Grab him!

356
00:16:38,168 --> 00:16:40,000
After Zhenbang was taken to the station,

357
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,101
he didn't say a word.

358
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,643
Where did you go after leaving
the theater last night?

359
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,792
Where were you headed
so early this morning?

360
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,250
You trying to run away?

361
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,143
You studied anatomy in the UK

362
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:54,726
and you have a record of harassing Alice.

363
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,351
If you don't talk,

364
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,875
I can't help you.

365
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,143
He has a record of harassment?

366
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:02,851
Alice's family servant reported that

367
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,059
about the harassment

368
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,417
That's slander!

369
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,875
Grant even came to
confront the master about it.

370
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,208
Shameless!

371
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,559
And he studied anatomy?

372
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,833
Just a hobby!

373
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,708
Just a coincidence.

374
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,125
Godfather,

375
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,934
I am a detective, maybe.

376
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,167
But a green one.

377
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,417
I'm far from qualified
for solving this case.

378
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:30,833
Perhaps you should find someone else,

379
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,840
lest progress be delayed
in the investigation.

380
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:41,417
Detective Fu, solved
countless crimes in England,

381
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,625
how could you be "green"?

382
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:48,434
I am working on

383
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,893
bailing Zhenbang out

384
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:51,250
to meet you in person.

385
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,476
His life

386
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,809
is in your hands now.

387
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:55,833
Zhenbang

388
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,958
is my only son.

389
00:17:58,667 --> 00:17:59,667
Godfather,

390
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:01,500
to tell you the truth,

391
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,583
I'm actually here on a secret mission.

392
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,684
Fei Yanggu, an imperial official from Qing

393
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,143
will arrive at the dock this afternoon.

394
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:11,583
He has orders to capture
some dangerous fugitives.

395
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,917
It's the order from the Empress Dowager.

396
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:18,851
Grant, the Republican senator

397
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,601
has formally proposed a bill,

398
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,025
citing his daughter's tragic death,

399
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:24,518
to ban all Chinatowns in California.

400
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:25,310
In four days,

401
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:27,184
I will be representing the
Chinese Chamber of Commerce

402
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,684
to debate in the Council Hall.

403
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,601
If this bill passes in San Francisco,

404
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,143
they'll immediately propose it
to the federal government.

405
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:34,684
Then, Chinese people all across America

406
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,434
will have no place to call home.

407
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,059
So, this case

408
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,976
concerns not only the
fate of the Bai family

409
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,542
but also all Chinese in America.

410
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:45,958
Master.

411
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:48,976
Lao Si,

412
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,226
ask Mr. Weyman

413
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,393
to come to the silk factory.

414
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:52,976
Take good care of Detective Fu.

415
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,809
Have him rest in the third-floor guest room

416
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:55,833
and keep an eye on him.

417
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:05,144
Sir,

418
00:19:05,168 --> 00:19:06,726
do we need to

419
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,390
keep such a low profile for this mission?

420
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:09,893
Mission confidential.

421
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:10,934
Be cautious.

422
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,375
Strike and go.

423
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:22,667
Go away.

424
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:27,559
Go back to China.

425
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,958
What are they talking about?

426
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,809
Welcoming us to America.

427
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,184
Go away.

428
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,060
Hi.

429
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:35,208
Go away.

430
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,792
Follow me.

431
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:44,143
Don't send me back.

432
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:44,977
This way.

433
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:46,059
Open your mouth.

434
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,101
No, no.

435
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,226
Take your clothes off.

436
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:48,893
Take your...

437
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:49,434
What are you doing?

438
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,394
Protecting our Master.

439
00:19:50,418 --> 00:19:52,000
Drop your weapons.

440
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,268
Firearms are powerful.

441
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:56,059
Do not act recklessly.

442
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,684
Drop...

443
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:57,375
your”.

444
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:58,476
Weapons.

445
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,393
What does that mean?

446
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:00,125
Wai Pen?

447
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:00,934
What's Wai Pen?

448
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:01,500
Wai Pen?

449
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,018
I think it means...

450
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:04,042
foreigners.

451
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,059
I am Fei Yanggu from the
Yellow Banner of the Great Qing.

452
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,101
Hands behind your head,

453
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,768
get down on your knees.

454
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:11,934
It seems he's telling us to kneel.

455
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:12,958
Insolent!

456
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:14,894
I, Fei Yanggu,

457
00:20:14,918 --> 00:20:16,078
only kneel before the Emperor

458
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,559
and the Empress Dowager.

459
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,227
Who do you think you are?

460
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:19,542
I said get down!

461
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,167
Friends of the union,

462
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,059
the most heinous crime has been committed

463
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,934
right in front of our eyes.

464
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:43,143
Not only did they brutally murder
that innocent girl,

465
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,518
they removed her organs!

466
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:47,184
Right, it's true.

467
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,792
They really do eat everything.

468
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,851
Animals.

469
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:54,583
Now,

470
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,250
as much as it pains me,

471
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,893
I must ask the father of the deceased,

472
00:20:58,917 --> 00:21:01,559
the honorable Congressman Grant,

473
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,208
to say a few words.

474
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,667
The soul I loved most in the world

475
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:12,917
is gone.

476
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,333
Murdered by a Chinese immigrant.

477
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,893
But I mourn not just for my daughter

478
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:19,559
but for our entire nation.

479
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,851
The Chinese come here.

480
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,768
At first they take over a street,

481
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:25,518
then they take over a school,

482
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:27,292
then they take over a hospital,

483
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:29,750
then they take over a city.

484
00:21:30,042 --> 00:21:33,393
Disease will spread along with crime,

485
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,750
extortion and murder.

486
00:21:37,292 --> 00:21:39,893
Are you gonna let America
become an rats nest?

487
00:21:39,917 --> 00:21:41,726
No!

488
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,476
What are we waiting for?

489
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,167
Drive these rats out.

490
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:57,833
Wait.

491
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,809
I am American.

492
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,726
I am American citizen!

493
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,667
This is my property.

494
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,601
I am American citizen!

495
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,518
We know who you are,

496
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:11,083
Mr. Bai.

497
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:12,417
Good!

498
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,143
Do you know that my property

499
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,518
protected under the Fourth Amendment.

500
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:19,476
You're breaking the American law.

501
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,684
American...

502
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:21,934
law?

503
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,101
Mr. Bai.

504
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,684
Did the American law

505
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,476
allow your son

506
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,268
to kill my daughter?

507
00:22:28,292 --> 00:22:30,417
I'm very sorry about your loss.

508
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,750
But my son is only a suspect now

509
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,708
I believe the real
killer is still out there.

510
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:37,792
He'll have his day in court.

511
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:39,144
In the meantime,

512
00:22:39,168 --> 00:22:42,000
what do we do with the vermin,
the rats behind this gate?

513
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:44,559
We won't!

514
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,125
Mr. Grant,

515
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:49,559
I understand that you
are grief-stricken, sir.

516
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:50,601
However, don't you feel

517
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:53,476
that you've created enough
of a disturbance here today?

518
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,018
I'm considering the public interest.

519
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,351
Just spoken with Police Chief Lance,

520
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,601
and he's assured me
he will along momentarily

521
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,542
with his entire squadron.

522
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:06,393
Chinatown's fate will be decided at that
hearing in just a few days time.

523
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:09,851
Wouldn't it be prudent of you
to hold off until then?

524
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,684
The public want satisfaction.

525
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,518
Yeah!

526
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:17,018
And it bears repeating, Sir.

527
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:19,893
That my numerous and generous
contributions to your campaign

528
00:23:19,917 --> 00:23:23,333
could just as easily be
diverted to the Democrats.

529
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,083
Let's go.

530
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:32,625
Mr. Grant,

531
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:35,476
my son is not a killer,

532
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,125
I swear on my life.

533
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,333
I'm sorry. I have a...

534
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:42,458
sensitivity for hygiene.

535
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:45,542
As far as your son is concerned,

536
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:48,500
he will soon meet my daughter in the grave.

537
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,250
Let's go.

538
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:58,934
The first person you knocked into

539
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,375
will answer you.

540
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,500
This way.

541
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:49,833
Trots.

542
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:51,875
Where's the bathroom?

543
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:53,917
Over there.

544
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,559
Jack the Ripper,

545
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:03,583
Hip Sing Tong...

546
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:05,000
Are you kidding me?

547
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:07,453
I have a better chance
fooling that imperial official.

548
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,530
Why build the toilet so high up?

549
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:12,750
Detective Fu,

550
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:14,434
is everything...

551
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:16,167
going smoothly?

552
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:20,417
Detective Fu...

553
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:22,708
Detective Fu...

554
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,125
You...

555
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,500
Just an old pet peeve.

556
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:31,208
I can't poop fully dressed.

557
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:33,625
Understood.

558
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:39,417
You...

559
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:41,875
Also a pet peeve.

560
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,625
Foul smell makes me dizzy.

561
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:46,958
I see.

562
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,250
Help!

563
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,333
He's trying to escape!

564
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,351
Bro.

565
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:04,375
Please don't.

566
00:26:05,417 --> 00:26:05,958
Really.

567
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,726
Bro.

568
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,750
Let me go.

569
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:10,708
Bro.

570
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:11,268
Please.

571
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:12,143
Stop it.

572
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:12,851
Bro.

573
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:13,875
Please bro.

574
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:50,542
You knocked into me.

575
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:51,958
Chinese?

576
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:53,625
You're Chinese?

577
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:55,059
- Where?

578
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:55,851
Take me to the killer.

579
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:56,559
What killer?

580
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:57,309
The one that killed Father.

581
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:58,018
Whose father?

582
00:26:58,042 --> 00:26:58,894
Pearl said you would...

583
00:26:58,918 --> 00:26:59,976
Who the hell is Pearl?

584
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,309
The Kachina will protect us.

585
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,518
Enough with the crazy talk.

586
00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:03,352
Where are you going?

587
00:27:03,376 --> 00:27:04,434
To get dressed.

588
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:05,458
Take me with you!

589
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:06,644
Stop it.

590
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:08,167
People frown upon such things!

591
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:15,019
Stop them,

592
00:27:15,043 --> 00:27:16,250
then we'll go for the killer.

593
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:29,208
Eyes of Hawk.

594
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:33,333
Ears of Wolf.

595
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:41,417
Speed of Puma.

596
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,792
Useless.

597
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,542
Brother.

598
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:53,167
Brother.

599
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:54,500
Go.

600
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,750
By myself, please.

601
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,708
Strength of Bear.

602
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:46,583
Impressive.

603
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:14,269
The killer is here?

604
00:29:14,293 --> 00:29:15,476
How did you find me?

605
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,184
I'm the hunter,

606
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:17,208
you're the prey.

607
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:19,042
Put this on.

608
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:21,851
Together,

609
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,333
let's thank Mr. Weyman.

610
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:25,810
Louis.

611
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:28,500
I know you took them in out of kindness,

612
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:30,934
but you can only protect them for a while,

613
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:32,250
not forever.

614
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,976
As long as I can.

615
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,643
Do you need me helping accommodate them?

616
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:39,792
No need to bother you with these.

617
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,393
Hold off work here before the hearing.

618
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,268
Can't give them any ammunition.

619
00:29:47,292 --> 00:29:48,375
Understood.

620
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:50,894
Take this.

621
00:29:50,918 --> 00:29:52,018
It's all of a sudden.

622
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:54,434
Zhenbang's bail money is way too high.

623
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:56,559
This piece of land is
my most valuable asset.

624
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:57,917
Keep it as a mortgage.

625
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:00,976
Again, I'm counting on you to
help my family through this.

626
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,810
I told you.

627
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:03,601
I can lend you the money.

628
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:04,250
No.

629
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:05,809
All these years,

630
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,226
I've owed you too much.

631
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,851
My people have owed you too much.

632
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:09,875
Alright then,

633
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:12,125
I'll keep this just for now.

634
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,458
I'll arrange Zhenbang's bail momentarily.

635
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:17,226
Right now, our priority

636
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,184
is to clear ZhenBang's name

637
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,583
and find the real killer.

638
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:24,417
Thank you.

639
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:50,476
So, this is America.

640
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,601
Not as fancy as I thought.

641
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:52,625
Sir, watch out.

642
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,477
Sir,

643
00:30:55,501 --> 00:30:56,917
where's the pick-up guy?

644
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,184
Should be here.

645
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:00,601
A young Chinese man.

646
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:01,768
Named Qin Fu.

647
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:04,500
Qin Fu.

648
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:05,852
Remember,

649
00:31:05,876 --> 00:31:07,268
when addressing people in the West,

650
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:08,059
Given name first,

651
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:08,934
then family name.

652
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:09,809
So, we should call him...

653
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:10,833
Fu Qin.

654
00:31:11,042 --> 00:31:12,184
Fu Qin.

655
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:13,667
- Who's Fu Qin?
- Fu Qin.

656
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:21,125
Are you looking for...

657
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:22,518
Fu Qin?

658
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:24,268
I am "father." (Same
pronunciation with Fu Qin)

659
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:25,292
You are?

660
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:26,833
My name is Fei.

661
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:28,375
Mr. Fei.

662
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:29,583
Address him as Master.

663
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:31,375
Master Fei.

664
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:33,625
What are you waiting for?

665
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,112
Help the master with his luggage.

666
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,458
- Let me.
- I'll take this.

667
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,417
Find us the best inn in town,

668
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:46,333
then a nice meal.

669
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,434
The food on the ship

670
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:49,542
Y-u-c-k-y.

671
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,893
No worries.

672
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:52,852
All set.

673
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:54,768
Chinese help Chinese.

674
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:55,602
Exactly.

675
00:31:55,626 --> 00:31:56,976
No scamming your own kind.

676
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,708
Let's go.

677
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:58,726
One moment, sir.

678
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,910
I'll go bring the ride about.

679
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:01,458
Hold on.

680
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:03,708
What ride?

681
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:05,713
Our master isn't used
to those newfangled cars.

682
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,667
I'm driving a carriage.

683
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,250
One moment, sir.

684
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:10,809
Don't wander around.

685
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:11,417
Wait here.

686
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:13,182
Father will be right back to pick you up.

687
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:24,958
Sir,

688
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:27,042
are we

689
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:28,625
scammed?

690
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,125
Why aren't you eating?

691
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,500
I miss Father.

692
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:37,375
Your name is Gui?

693
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:39,583
Ghost.

694
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:40,833
Alright, Gui.

695
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,805
So Six-Hands, the victim, was your father?

696
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:44,768
But how could an old Indian
man bear a Shanxi son?

697
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:45,917
I'm from Hebei.

698
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:48,101
No matter where you from,
let me say this again.

699
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:48,851
I'm really not a detective.

700
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:49,750
I can't help you find the killer.

701
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:50,875
But Pearl said...

702
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:51,958
Pearl or pig,

703
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:53,500
no means no.

704
00:32:54,292 --> 00:32:56,012
Does she know me better than I know myself?

705
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:57,643
Whatever, I'm sticking with you.

706
00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:58,708
What's your problem?

707
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:02,351
Wherever you go, I'll go.

708
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:03,143
I'm going to the bathroom.

709
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:04,167
Wanna join?

710
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:20,518
If you can find me again,

711
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:22,000
I'll do as you command.

712
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:28,393
Sir,

713
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:29,417
should we keep waiting?

714
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,083
Maybe a little longer.

715
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,434
Go back.

716
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:35,458
Leave.

717
00:33:36,667 --> 00:33:38,467
Indeed, this barbaric
land is full of tricks.

718
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:40,542
We must keep our eyes open

719
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:42,083
and never be fooled again.

720
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:03,125
Come on, quick.

721
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:04,667
Spread out and search.

722
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:08,208
Hurry.

723
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:16,083
He's not getting away.

724
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:17,792
Find him!

725
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:35,417
You're awake.

726
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:37,417
Who the hell are you?

727
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,750
I'm Ghost.

728
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:39,833
We're here.

729
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:40,893
Where?

730
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:41,583
Home.

731
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:42,708
Home?

732
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,500
This is him.

733
00:35:03,542 --> 00:35:04,667
Stare at my sister again,

734
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:06,125
and I'll drink from your skull.

735
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:07,500
Huh?

736
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:08,792
Tell him.

737
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,083
What's he saying?

738
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,643
He said if you find the killer,

739
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:15,707
his sister will marry you.

740
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:17,757
And you'll drink the
wine of matrimony tonight

741
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:19,000
Indians do that, too?

742
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:20,667
What did he say?

743
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,125
Don't you want to avenge Father?

744
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:24,976
All you know is revenge.

745
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,059
Look at that stupid face of his.

746
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,351
Pearl must have made a mistake.

747
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,375
What is he saying?

748
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:30,059
If his sister isn't enough,

749
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:31,563
you can have that piece of land, too.

750
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:33,458
Deal.

751
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:34,542
He's OK.

752
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:36,042
OK.

753
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:39,708
When I was five,

754
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:41,309
I watched my parents

755
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:42,958
die in front of me.

756
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:18,417
Father found me,

757
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:21,625
and raised me,

758
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:24,333
taught me everything.

759
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,434
He gave me a second life.

760
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:00,977
<i>So,</i>

761
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:02,625
you must help me find the killer.

762
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:04,726
With you as my partner,
I'm very confident.

763
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,910
If you try to escape again...

764
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:07,208
I'll castrate you.

765
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:09,042
It hurts my feelings you'd say that.

766
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:10,667
In fact,

767
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,667
they've already found the killer.

768
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:17,375
Godfather.

769
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:18,351
Godfather.

770
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:19,375
I'm back.

771
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:20,809
Fu, my boy!

772
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:22,226
I thought you took off.

773
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:22,893
Godfather,

774
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:23,851
how could I?

775
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:24,809
Exactly.

776
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:25,833
How could you?

777
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:29,184
I actually left to recruit him.

778
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:30,434
Six-Hands' son, Gui.

779
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:31,658
We'll solve the case together.

780
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,833
It's Ghost.

781
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,167
<i>Gui</i>

782
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:35,394
<i>Fu and Gui</i>

783
00:37:35,418 --> 00:37:37,000
A perfect match made in heaven.

784
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:38,560
Come, come.

785
00:37:38,584 --> 00:37:40,917
Last night, three men wandered
around looking for "Fu Qin."

786
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:42,060
And this morning,

787
00:37:42,084 --> 00:37:44,143
they came to my door.

788
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:46,583
This is Fei Yanggu. Master Fei.

789
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:48,768
Master Fei.

790
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:49,958
Nice finally meeting you.

791
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:52,792
I was tied up yesterday
and couldn't pick you up.

792
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:54,227
Never mind.

793
00:37:54,251 --> 00:37:55,351
As soon as I arrived,

794
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:56,310
I was scammed.

795
00:37:56,334 --> 00:37:57,726
We had to sleep on the street.

796
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,393
I heard that Hip Sing Tong is the largest

797
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:01,708
Chinese society in the city,

798
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:04,095
so I came to pay my respects to Master Bai.

799
00:38:04,542 --> 00:38:06,143
Master Fei, you're too kind.

800
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:08,268
You mentioned you're
here to arrest some rebels.

801
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:09,476
Who are they exactly?

802
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,394
Sir,

803
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:11,792
the young master is back.

804
00:38:16,917 --> 00:38:18,292
As long as you are safe.

805
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:21,125
Come,

806
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:22,167
let me introduce you.

807
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,042
I hired these two detectives for you.

808
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:26,601
Mr. Fu...

809
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:27,625
<i>and Mr. Gui</i>

810
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:28,560
This is...

811
00:38:28,584 --> 00:38:30,958
Master Fei Yanggu, who
just arrived in America.

812
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:33,750
This is my son, Bai Zhenbang.

813
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:36,292
And this is...

814
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:39,458
We studied together in England.

815
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:41,458
Zheng Shiliang.

816
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:45,958
<i>Master Bah</i>

817
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:48,351
just now you asked me

818
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:50,208
who it is I am here to arrest.

819
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:52,625
This must be destiny.

820
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:55,917
Arrest him!

821
00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:02,917
Stop!

822
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,917
Be decent.

823
00:39:10,917 --> 00:39:12,018
<i>Master Bah</i>

824
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:12,894
this man Zheng Shiliang

825
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:17,250
is a fugitive wanted by the
Empress Dowager herself

826
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:21,059
Your Empress is back there in Qing.

827
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:21,685
This...

828
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:23,143
is America.

829
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:24,643
I'm taking this man with me,

830
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:26,768
no matter what.

831
00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:27,792
Master Fei,

832
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:30,101
both you and him,

833
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:31,143
at this moment,

834
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:32,792
are guests of the Hip Sing Tong.

835
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:34,083
As long as I'm here,

836
00:39:34,292 --> 00:39:35,976
your safety is guaranteed.

837
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,393
Once you leave this room,

838
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:40,143
whatever you do is none of my business.

839
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:41,875
But here and now,

840
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:43,685
no one

841
00:39:43,709 --> 00:39:44,875
is taking him away.

842
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:54,000
Master Bai made his point.

843
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,476
Zheng Shiliang,

844
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,833
count your blessings now,

845
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:00,292
you won't be this lucky forever.

846
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:01,583
Sheathe your swords.

847
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,684
What a day!

848
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:12,708
Wen, Wu,

849
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,143
top up for Master Fei.

850
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:14,602
Yes, sir.

851
00:40:14,626 --> 00:40:15,875
That won't be necessary.

852
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:18,125
We're leaving.

853
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:29,958
<i>Fu, Gui</i>

854
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:31,810
Tell them

855
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:33,794
what exactly did you do
on the night of the 10th?

856
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:35,309
You boys have a good talk.

857
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:36,333
I'll be right back.

858
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,500
Is this how you treat guests?

859
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:50,500
Why not invite Mr. Marston go inside?

860
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:56,393
No need for pleasantries, Master Bai.

861
00:40:56,417 --> 00:40:58,851
I know your Chinese customs.

862
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:00,559
It will be impolite for us Irish

863
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,851
to barge in and haul off one of your own.

864
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:04,583
You want to take someone away?

865
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:05,917
Who?

866
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:08,875
It's not necessarily about taking someone,

867
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,458
just as long as they return
what they stole from us.

868
00:41:12,958 --> 00:41:13,958
Mr. Marston,

869
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:16,583
I think you should explain.

870
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:28,143
Is there any evidence?

871
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:29,851
Of course!

872
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:32,792
I wouldn't dare come
to Chinatown otherwise.

873
00:41:45,042 --> 00:41:46,042
Okay,

874
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:48,125
give me some time to investigate.

875
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:49,458
If it's true,

876
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:52,226
I'll bring him to apologize in person

877
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,917
and return what he took.

878
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,268
You have one day.

879
00:41:58,292 --> 00:42:00,684
I don't want the hard-earned peace
between us and Chinatown

880
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:02,333
to be broken over this.

881
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:11,917
Brother,

882
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:14,958
where did you go after leaving
the theater that night?

883
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,125
How can we help you if you don't tell us?

884
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:20,833
Say something.

885
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:22,833
Tell us.

886
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,667
Please.

887
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,500
Why don't you tell us?

888
00:42:27,042 --> 00:42:27,519
What are you doing?

889
00:42:27,543 --> 00:42:28,851
Didn't we agree to only take action
when it's necessary?

890
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:29,685
What more is there to say?

891
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:31,101
He doesn't even dare to say where he went.

892
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:31,934
He must be the killer.

893
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:32,644
Be patient.

894
00:42:32,668 --> 00:42:33,768
Give him more time.

895
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:34,394
No.

896
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:35,851
I'll avenge Father right now.

897
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:36,875
What's the motive?

898
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:37,726
Why would he kill your father?

899
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:38,417
Don't you want to know?

900
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,820
Was he into money, or Indian men?

901
00:42:43,417 --> 00:42:44,958
Come on, speak up, brother.

902
00:42:46,792 --> 00:42:48,583
Young master, tell them.

903
00:42:48,917 --> 00:42:50,226
Young master, tell them.

904
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,184
Please.

905
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:52,018
Tell us.

906
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:52,809
Are you going to talk or not?

907
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:53,643
Tell them.

908
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:54,476
- Tell them.
- Please.

909
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,268
Speak up.

910
00:42:55,292 --> 00:42:55,875
Will you talk or not?

911
00:42:55,958 --> 00:42:57,208
Alright!

912
00:42:59,792 --> 00:43:00,792
Shiliang.

913
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Nothing is more important

914
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,851
than clearing your name right now.

915
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:04,875
Shiliang,

916
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:06,059
don't.

917
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,083
Zhenbang,

918
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:09,018
I have to let it out,
it's killing me inside.

919
00:43:09,042 --> 00:43:09,726
Shiliang.

920
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:10,309
Zhenbang.

921
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:10,851
Shiliang.

922
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:11,351
Zhenbang.

923
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:11,976
Shiliang.

924
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,601
Zhenbang.

925
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:13,625
You two!

926
00:43:16,542 --> 00:43:17,542
Went on a date?

927
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,500
Guns.

928
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:23,000
Marston said you two stole his guns.

929
00:43:23,917 --> 00:43:24,917
That's right.

930
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,250
On the night of the 10th,

931
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:29,434
Zhenbang and I, we...

932
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:30,958
went to steal guns from the Irish.

933
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:54,993
You got something else to do?

934
00:43:55,792 --> 00:43:56,560
No.

935
00:43:56,584 --> 00:43:57,667
This is Zheng Shiliang.

936
00:43:58,083 --> 00:43:59,923
We went to medical
school in England together.

937
00:44:00,167 --> 00:44:02,208
He's joined Dr. Sun's Revive China Society.

938
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:03,833
Guns can be bought,

939
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,643
why steal them?

940
00:44:05,667 --> 00:44:07,809
The revolution is imminent.

941
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:09,268
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

942
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:10,851
They stole from us all the time anyway.

943
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:11,476
These weapons

944
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,435
were in fact gathered by the Irish

945
00:44:12,459 --> 00:44:14,809
for their next raid on Chinatown.

946
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:16,809
So you had no time to kill Father.

947
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:17,833
Of course not.

948
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,083
My people can vouch for him.

949
00:44:22,917 --> 00:44:24,809
No wonder you kept
silent at the police station.

950
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:26,153
Turns out you were stealing guns.

951
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:28,667
I knew my brother was innocent.

952
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:29,667
Godfather,

953
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,375
we did good, didn't we?

954
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:33,583
<i>Gm,</i>

955
00:44:33,792 --> 00:44:34,875
put your knife away.

956
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:39,684
Then why were you at the port so early?

957
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:40,560
He wasn't trying to escape.

958
00:44:40,584 --> 00:44:41,934
He was simply scared
after stealing the guns.

959
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:43,558
So, he was going to lay low out of town.

960
00:44:43,917 --> 00:44:44,917
Right, brother?

961
00:44:49,708 --> 00:44:51,476
Us believing you is not enough.

962
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,083
All Americans need to be persuded.

963
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:54,644
For now,

964
00:44:54,668 --> 00:44:57,042
we need to find the killer first.

965
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:57,727
Yes.

966
00:44:57,751 --> 00:44:58,833
Let's go find him.

967
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:01,125
Godfather,

968
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:02,184
I have another request.

969
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:03,208
Spill.

970
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,476
I've just acquired some land

971
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,059
in the Native American area

972
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:05,875
and got myself a wife,

973
00:45:06,042 --> 00:45:07,851
but still I don't have
American citizenship.

974
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:09,476
You really want to stay for good?

975
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,820
I have property and a family now.

976
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:11,518
Alright,

977
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,185
I'll help you.

978
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,250
Thank you, Godfather.

979
00:45:16,542 --> 00:45:17,667
One's a fraud.

980
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:19,208
The other a savage.

981
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:22,059
And you ask them to solve the case?

982
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:23,167
At this point,

983
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:25,628
is there anyone else who
would take on your case?

984
00:45:26,042 --> 00:45:27,625
Qin Fu is quite observant

985
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:29,184
and quick-thinking.

986
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:30,292
Definitely a man of talent.

987
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:31,310
As for Ghost,

988
00:45:31,334 --> 00:45:32,393
with his animal instincts,

989
00:45:32,417 --> 00:45:33,269
and skills in combat and tracking,

990
00:45:33,293 --> 00:45:34,500
is no average Joe, either.

991
00:45:34,792 --> 00:45:35,976
The two of them

992
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,226
came along at the right time

993
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,458
just to save you.

994
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:40,477
Right now,

995
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:43,208
both of you are wanted criminals out there.

996
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:44,809
Stay put.

997
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:47,375
Stay. At least for safety.

998
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:51,625
The great Master Bai

999
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,726
can only keep me safe for a while?

1000
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,393
The hearing in four days...

1001
00:45:56,417 --> 00:45:57,625
if I fail,

1002
00:45:58,208 --> 00:45:59,434
I won't just be unable to protect you,

1003
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:00,434
but also Hip Sing Tong

1004
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:01,435
and Chinatown.

1005
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:02,809
I fear that all Chinese in America

1006
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:03,934
won't be safe, either.

1007
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:05,625
We were never safe here to begin with.

1008
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:08,059
Our hope

1009
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:09,226
should not be put here.

1010
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,042
No more talk of revolution.

1011
00:46:11,708 --> 00:46:13,351
If it could truly change things,

1012
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:15,309
we wouldn't have to cross the ocean

1013
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:17,167
to make a living on a foreign land.

1014
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:19,893
I've fought my whole life

1015
00:46:19,917 --> 00:46:21,434
just to earn some respect,

1016
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:23,833
hoping that we'll no longer be
bullied by the whites.

1017
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:32,851
Out there is the Chinatown

1018
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,542
you've protected for decades.

1019
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:37,393
It's still packed with brothels,

1020
00:46:37,417 --> 00:46:38,309
opium dens,

1021
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:39,333
and casinos.

1022
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:41,750
Have our people become better here?

1023
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,292
If our hope isn't back home

1024
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:45,602
or here,

1025
00:46:45,626 --> 00:46:47,125
then where is it?

1026
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:05,667
Gentlemen.

1027
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,792
Your hope

1028
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,792
is too distant for me.

1029
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:20,708
My only hope now

1030
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:25,083
is for you to be okay.

1031
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:52,958
Where to?

1032
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,059
Yeah,

1033
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:54,852
Where?

1034
00:47:54,876 --> 00:47:56,000
You're asking me?

1035
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,601
The fundamental
principles of all professions

1036
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:00,809
are the same.

1037
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:03,518
Use the logic of traditional
Chinese medicine,

1038
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:07,083
to magnify the detail and the logic.

1039
00:48:07,375 --> 00:48:07,893
I got it.

1040
00:48:07,917 --> 00:48:08,917
Follow me.

1041
00:48:09,708 --> 00:48:11,143
A doctor of Chinese
medicine does four things.

1042
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:12,018
Wang, observe the patient.

1043
00:48:12,042 --> 00:48:12,976
Wen, listen to the breathing.

1044
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:13,769
Wen, ask about symptoms.

1045
00:48:13,793 --> 00:48:14,851
And "Qie," feel the pulse.

1046
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:16,434
Crime investigation is not that different.

1047
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:17,458
Let's start with...

1048
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:20,417
What you got here?

1049
00:48:21,042 --> 00:48:21,684
Footprints.

1050
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:22,351
Father's.

1051
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:23,227
How do you know?

1052
00:48:23,251 --> 00:48:24,292
Father doesn't wear shoes.

1053
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:27,934
Judging by the blood stains,

1054
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:29,667
someone out your father's throat.

1055
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:31,351
My father's name is Six-Hands.

1056
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,434
Once, he chopped off six enemies' hands

1057
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:34,269
and wore them around his neck.

1058
00:48:34,293 --> 00:48:35,809
This time, your father
wasn't carrying a knife?

1059
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:37,583
Someone must have ambushed him from behind.

1060
00:48:38,792 --> 00:48:39,792
These footprints...

1061
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:43,958
Strange.

1062
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:45,184
Two people died,

1063
00:48:45,208 --> 00:48:46,893
yet there's only father's blood.

1064
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:47,917
How do you know?

1065
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:49,768
Can't you smell the difference
between a man's blood and a woman's?

1066
00:48:49,792 --> 00:48:50,893
You can?

1067
00:48:50,917 --> 00:48:52,417
You don't even have common sense.

1068
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:54,458
80, Alice didn't die here.

1069
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:55,769
And,

1070
00:48:55,793 --> 00:48:57,184
there are no women's footprints here.

1071
00:48:57,208 --> 00:48:58,333
Only a fat man's.

1072
00:48:58,458 --> 00:48:59,101
How fat?

1073
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:00,125
Thrice your size.

1074
00:49:08,958 --> 00:49:09,958
Carriage.

1075
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:14,627
You don't need to eat
shit to prove that, do you?

1076
00:49:15,542 --> 00:49:16,601
City horse.

1077
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:18,018
What's special about
the dung of a city horse?

1078
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:19,268
City horses are fed beans,

1079
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:20,292
ours are fed grass.

1080
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:25,917
So it wasn't a fat man.

1081
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:29,792
Someone placed Alice here from a carriage.

1082
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:36,352
And your father

1083
00:49:36,376 --> 00:49:37,458
just happened to pass by.

1084
00:49:43,667 --> 00:49:45,000
The killer wasn't alone.

1085
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:47,434
Our land was taken from us.

1086
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:49,625
Father would come
here at night to trade furs.

1087
00:49:53,375 --> 00:49:54,375
Maybe

1088
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:56,125
he was finding you a mother.

1089
00:50:07,917 --> 00:50:10,208
Never see a man with
dark circle on the side?

1090
00:50:11,167 --> 00:50:12,833
You are not on the visitors' list.

1091
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:15,434
We're a newly established agency,

1092
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:17,750
of course we're not on the list.

1093
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:19,708
What agency?

1094
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:22,184
FBI.

1095
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:23,185
What?

1096
00:50:23,209 --> 00:50:25,143
Funeral Bureau of Investigation.

1097
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:27,309
We specialize in
inspecting places like this

1098
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:28,917
for abuse of corpses.

1099
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:31,601
There definitely isn't any abuse.

1100
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:34,184
Your department should be
established long time ago.

1101
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:35,518
Please, go inside.

1102
00:50:35,542 --> 00:50:36,542
Go inside.

1103
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:40,375
What are you doing?

1104
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,226
Looks like this country
really does need an FBI.

1105
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,184
I thought sniffing is one of the steps.
Wen, right?

1106
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:44,060
In Chinese medicine,

1107
00:50:44,084 --> 00:50:45,434
wen means listen, not smell.

1108
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:47,226
As in listening to the dead.

1109
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,458
Examine the body, an autopsy.

1110
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,358
You know what autopsy means, right?

1111
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:53,750
How do I explain it to an Indian?

1112
00:50:54,667 --> 00:50:55,917
Autopsy means...

1113
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:57,768
Fractured joint on the left funny bone.

1114
00:50:57,792 --> 00:50:59,143
Bruise on the tushy bone.

1115
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:00,476
Ribster scraped.

1116
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,393
Back of the head cracked.

1117
00:51:01,417 --> 00:51:02,417
Neck snapped.

1118
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:03,750
This here is the fatal wound.

1119
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:07,434
Hang on, wait a second.

1120
00:51:07,458 --> 00:51:07,893
What is...

1121
00:51:07,917 --> 00:51:08,643
funny bone, tushy,

1122
00:51:08,667 --> 00:51:09,560
<i>and Master?</i>

1123
00:51:09,584 --> 00:51:10,976
Is that Indian slang?

1124
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,851
It's authentic Chinese.

1125
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:14,101
You mean Hebei dialect.

1126
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:15,226
Banana Man.

1127
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:16,309
How can you autopsy?

1128
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:17,269
Father taught me.

1129
00:51:17,293 --> 00:51:18,684
First animal, then people.

1130
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,143
Impressive.

1131
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:21,207
Multiple external injuries

1132
00:51:21,292 --> 00:51:23,309
indicate severe violence before death.

1133
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,375
She fought back, too.

1134
00:51:24,917 --> 00:51:26,042
No, she scratched.

1135
00:51:29,042 --> 00:51:30,125
Why can't I see it?

1136
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,060
Because it's not visible to human eyes.

1137
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:33,792
Only the Hawk's.

1138
00:51:38,917 --> 00:51:40,717
So the killer must have
scratch marks on him.

1139
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,708
<i>Gm,</i>

1140
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:42,833
impressive.

1141
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,708
The stomach is empty.

1142
00:51:46,417 --> 00:51:47,144
But why would the killer

1143
00:51:47,168 --> 00:51:49,125
remove all her intestines?

1144
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:50,144
The estimated time of death

1145
00:51:50,168 --> 00:51:52,393
is between 6 to 10 pm on August 10th,

1146
00:51:52,417 --> 00:51:54,184
the same time your father was killed.

1147
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:56,226
So the guy killed Alice somewhere nearby

1148
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,809
then moved her, and disemboweled her.

1149
00:51:57,833 --> 00:51:59,208
What was the purpose?

1150
00:52:00,625 --> 00:52:01,352
There's been talk before

1151
00:52:01,376 --> 00:52:02,934
that Jack the Ripper was a doctor,

1152
00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:03,935
because the wounds on the victims

1153
00:52:03,959 --> 00:52:05,333
were as smooth as surgical cuts.

1154
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:06,227
This person

1155
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:07,309
struck without hesitation.

1156
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,542
He must be a butcher
or a hunter if not doctor.

1157
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,518
Didn't I tell you not to sniff around?

1158
00:52:14,542 --> 00:52:15,143
Just now, I smelled

1159
00:52:15,167 --> 00:52:15,893
a strange scent

1160
00:52:15,917 --> 00:52:16,917
right here.

1161
00:52:18,625 --> 00:52:19,625
Look.

1162
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Wood shavings.

1163
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:25,528
Why would there be wood shavings?

1164
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:26,769
A stick.

1165
00:52:26,793 --> 00:52:28,553
She was beaten to
death with a wooden stick.

1166
00:52:28,792 --> 00:52:30,312
I see you have the nose of a pig, too.

1167
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:32,333
This isn't a normal murder.

1168
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:33,893
A crime driven by extreme hatred.

1169
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:34,768
Now it's time to inquire.

1170
00:52:34,792 --> 00:52:35,500
Who?

1171
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:37,042
Whoever knew her the best.

1172
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:43,976
Are you done talking?

1173
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,667
Yes.

1174
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:46,976
So, we believe Bai
Zhenbang is not the murderer.

1175
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,417
There must be someone else.

1176
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:52,226
Must she be insulted even in death?

1177
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,268
I understand your grief and anger.

1178
00:52:54,292 --> 00:52:55,976
I am only presenting my deductions.

1179
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,351
Let me speak

1180
00:52:57,375 --> 00:53:00,059
clearly and calmly with you both.

1181
00:53:00,083 --> 00:53:02,976
My daughter Alice had
no complex entanglements

1182
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,375
nor enemies of any kind,

1183
00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:08,518
except those naturally hateful towards us.

1184
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:10,309
Those who want to steal our land

1185
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:12,309
and our resources from us.

1186
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:14,351
I'm talking about you, the yellow race.

1187
00:53:14,375 --> 00:53:16,393
So, you'll excuse my determination

1188
00:53:16,417 --> 00:53:18,643
to send a murder to the gallows.

1189
00:53:18,667 --> 00:53:20,083
But you should feel honored.

1190
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:23,250
You're the first Chinaman and
native to set foot in this office.

1191
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:24,500
Now, get out.

1192
00:53:25,417 --> 00:53:26,417
Shoo!

1193
00:53:28,917 --> 00:53:29,917
Nothing valuable.

1194
00:53:30,417 --> 00:53:31,351
Since asking fails,

1195
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,415
it's time to "qie" - feel!

1196
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,018
<i>Me?</i>

1197
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:34,042
How?

1198
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:35,750
Too early to "qie" now,

1199
00:53:36,292 --> 00:53:37,292
We'll just

1200
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:38,458
do it later.

1201
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:40,434
(PALPATE)
Before Grant gets home.

1202
00:53:40,458 --> 00:53:41,458
Let's go.

1203
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:43,226
Once you're in, open the door for me.

1204
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:43,976
Didn't we say feel?

1205
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,685
Since when did it become steal?

1206
00:53:44,709 --> 00:53:45,809
Obviously your Chinese is bad.

1207
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:46,559
Better than yours,

1208
00:53:46,583 --> 00:53:47,143
Banana Man.

1209
00:53:47,167 --> 00:53:47,934
You savage,

1210
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:48,768
ever heard of homophones?

1211
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:50,112
Qie can mean both feel and steal.

1212
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:52,101
So handy.

1213
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:53,125
Screw you.

1214
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:02,602
Come on.

1215
00:54:02,626 --> 00:54:03,958
Qie your ass out.

1216
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:11,458
Where's Alice's room?

1217
00:54:12,042 --> 00:54:13,500
How should I know?

1218
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:15,226
Use your pig nose to find it.

1219
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,450
Wherever it smells the nicest.

1220
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:20,750
Second floor.

1221
00:55:16,292 --> 00:55:17,643
What about this photo that
makes you so emotional?

1222
00:55:17,667 --> 00:55:18,667
I don't see it.

1223
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,559
Can I take it?

1224
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:21,208
No.

1225
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:21,809
Why no?

1226
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:22,477
Don't you even think about it.

1227
00:55:22,501 --> 00:55:23,559
But you said it also means steal.

1228
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:24,903
Doesn't mean you can take things.

1229
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:26,083
Let's go.

1230
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:38,583
What's wrong?

1231
00:55:39,042 --> 00:55:39,810
Bai Zhenbang.

1232
00:55:39,834 --> 00:55:41,354
I have something important to ask him.

1233
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:43,292
Young master.

1234
00:55:53,542 --> 00:55:54,292
Master.

1235
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:55,393
The young master left with Mr. Zheng,

1236
00:55:55,417 --> 00:55:56,500
don't know where.

1237
00:55:57,208 --> 00:55:58,144
San Francisco

1238
00:55:58,168 --> 00:55:59,208
isn't that big.

1239
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:01,476
Just tell the boys

1240
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,851
to bring them back safely.

1241
00:56:03,875 --> 00:56:04,875
Yes, sir.

1242
00:56:05,917 --> 00:56:06,852
If anything happens to my brother,

1243
00:56:06,876 --> 00:56:08,226
it'll be impossible to overturn the case.

1244
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:09,410
Is there anything you can do?

1245
00:56:21,083 --> 00:56:21,643
Is this real?

1246
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:22,667
You have psychic power?

1247
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:24,893
Last time, you used acupuncture

1248
00:56:24,917 --> 00:56:26,768
with bamboo sticks to block pain

1249
00:56:26,792 --> 00:56:28,184
and boost strength,

1250
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:29,851
chewed coca leaves
to stimulate your nerves.

1251
00:56:29,875 --> 00:56:31,601
Chinese medicine can explain all that,

1252
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:32,833
but definitely not this.

1253
00:56:36,458 --> 00:56:37,542
Come with me.

1254
00:56:41,542 --> 00:56:42,269
Grand

1255
00:56:42,293 --> 00:56:43,518
The-

1256
00:56:43,542 --> 00:56:44,583
-ater?

1257
00:56:45,375 --> 00:56:47,335
Is Bai Zhenbang still in
the mood for magic show?

1258
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:49,292
We'll ask around and find out.

1259
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:50,667
Ask who?

1260
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:52,625
Him.

1261
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:04,185
Hello.

1262
00:57:04,209 --> 00:57:05,559
Can I help you, Sir?

1263
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:06,601
If you are Chinese, speak Chinese.

1264
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:07,518
OK.

1265
00:57:07,542 --> 00:57:08,434
We're looking for Ching Ling Fu.

1266
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:08,977
Sorry,

1267
00:57:09,001 --> 00:57:10,809
Mr. Ching is about to go on stage.

1268
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:12,583
He won't be meeting fans.

1269
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,250
Fans?

1270
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:17,768
Do we look like fans?

1271
00:57:17,792 --> 00:57:18,792
Yes, you do.

1272
00:57:22,042 --> 00:57:23,083
You can't go in.

1273
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:25,684
Sorry. Mr. Ching,

1274
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,833
I couldn't stop these crazy fans of yours.

1275
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:29,208
I understand.

1276
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:31,833
After all, I am the great Ching Ling Foo.

1277
00:57:32,042 --> 00:57:34,351
Have you heard the song
Americans made for me?

1278
00:57:39,667 --> 00:57:40,726
You're a good singer,

1279
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:41,870
but please stop immediately.

1280
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:43,268
Where is he?

1281
00:57:43,292 --> 00:57:44,292
Who?

1282
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:46,143
There are three cups.

1283
00:57:46,167 --> 00:57:47,167
Drink.

1284
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:48,458
And three chairs.

1285
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:49,750
Sit and drink.

1286
00:57:50,792 --> 00:57:51,809
So, what do you want?

1287
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:52,351
An autograph?

1288
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:53,351
We are detectives

1289
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:54,310
hired by

1290
00:57:54,334 --> 00:57:55,667
Master Bai Xuanling.

1291
00:57:56,792 --> 00:57:58,809
Mr. Bai and Mr. Weyman

1292
00:57:58,833 --> 00:58:00,518
are my loyal fans,

1293
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:01,542
and experts in magic.

1294
00:58:02,167 --> 00:58:02,769
<i>So,</i>

1295
00:58:02,793 --> 00:58:04,073
where would you like me to sign?

1296
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:05,269
Chest?

1297
00:58:05,293 --> 00:58:06,533
We're here to see Bai Zhenbang.

1298
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:08,143
Bai Zhenbang isn't here.

1299
00:58:08,167 --> 00:58:09,726
I can make anyone appear out of thin air,

1300
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:11,643
but not Bai Zhenbang.

1301
00:58:11,667 --> 00:58:12,393
I just heard him.

1302
00:58:12,417 --> 00:58:13,059
He's here.

1303
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:13,726
No, he's not.

1304
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:14,268
He's here.

1305
00:58:14,292 --> 00:58:14,643
No, he's not.

1306
00:58:14,667 --> 00:58:15,310
He's here.

1307
00:58:15,334 --> 00:58:16,814
- He's not here, or here.
- He's here.

1308
00:58:17,167 --> 00:58:18,167
My friend!

1309
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:26,393
You must be delusional.

1310
00:58:26,417 --> 00:58:30,167
We're often deceived by our own senses.

1311
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:31,644
Whatever

1312
00:58:31,668 --> 00:58:33,167
you think you see

1313
00:58:33,625 --> 00:58:35,042
or hear...

1314
00:58:35,542 --> 00:58:37,583
isn't necessarily real.

1315
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:40,042
Neither are your words, for that matter.

1316
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:41,583
Actually,

1317
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,708
they are more likely to be fake.

1318
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:45,019
Isn't that right,

1319
00:58:45,043 --> 00:58:46,417
Mr. Magician?

1320
00:58:47,875 --> 00:58:49,000
I'm about to go on stage.

1321
00:58:49,375 --> 00:58:50,375
Be my guest.

1322
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:13,917
Bai Zhenbang,

1323
00:59:14,042 --> 00:59:15,375
We're not here for you.

1324
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:17,917
We are.

1325
00:59:22,042 --> 00:59:23,042
Who are you?

1326
00:59:23,667 --> 00:59:24,667
Get out of here now!

1327
00:59:25,042 --> 00:59:26,042
None of your business!

1328
00:59:26,917 --> 00:59:28,851
Next magic.

1329
00:59:28,875 --> 00:59:30,625
Disappearance.

1330
00:59:30,917 --> 00:59:32,375
I need one lady...

1331
00:59:32,708 --> 00:59:33,708
Zheng Shiliang.

1332
00:59:34,375 --> 00:59:36,875
No one can protect you today.

1333
00:59:37,583 --> 00:59:38,583
You,

1334
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:39,667
come here please.

1335
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:44,292
We'll protect him.

1336
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:53,333
Stab yourself.

1337
00:59:56,625 --> 00:59:58,042
Use the sticks and transform.

1338
00:59:58,375 --> 00:59:59,125
Cannot

1339
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:00,060
Why not?

1340
01:00:00,084 --> 01:00:01,309
Strength of the Bear, do it now!

1341
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:02,958
I can only do that once every two days.

1342
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:07,500
There's four of us,

1343
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,917
and only three of you.

1344
01:00:11,292 --> 01:00:12,292
Get them.

1345
01:00:21,208 --> 01:00:22,728
Even four against three is not enough?

1346
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:24,292
No.

1347
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,000
How about four against one then?

1348
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:53,958
Which one of you

1349
01:00:54,792 --> 01:00:56,208
wants to die first?

1350
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:24,375
Come out.

1351
01:01:24,958 --> 01:01:25,852
Smile, just smile.

1352
01:01:25,876 --> 01:01:26,917
Wave.

1353
01:01:33,417 --> 01:01:34,893
Now, get your ass back in there.

1354
01:01:34,917 --> 01:01:35,519
What the hell?

1355
01:01:35,543 --> 01:01:36,833
Shut the door.

1356
01:01:40,208 --> 01:01:41,208
One.

1357
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:43,583
Two.

1358
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:46,083
Three.

1359
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Sir.

1360
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:51,542
Go get them.

1361
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:53,333
Kill them dead.

1362
01:02:02,667 --> 01:02:03,643
A real kung fu master, I see.

1363
01:02:03,667 --> 01:02:04,667
Of course.

1364
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:06,208
Can't even win four against two.

1365
01:02:10,333 --> 01:02:11,453
What about four against one?

1366
01:02:12,292 --> 01:02:13,292
No, no, no.

1367
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:18,060
My leg!

1368
01:02:18,084 --> 01:02:19,583
My...

1369
01:02:20,208 --> 01:02:21,667
leg!

1370
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:24,542
My...

1371
01:03:19,292 --> 01:03:20,643
Smile, everybody smile.

1372
01:03:20,667 --> 01:03:21,667
Here, say "thank you."

1373
01:03:22,875 --> 01:03:24,250
And bow.

1374
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:52,708
Darling.

1375
01:03:53,292 --> 01:03:54,292
Bravo.

1376
01:03:55,125 --> 01:03:56,542
Bravo.

1377
01:03:58,958 --> 01:04:01,143
This is the greatest
magic show I've ever seen.

1378
01:04:01,167 --> 01:04:03,375
Laughters and tears. It's true art form!

1379
01:04:05,667 --> 01:04:06,269
Those guns...

1380
01:04:06,293 --> 01:04:08,167
you hid them in the theater, didn't you?

1381
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,726
You went to see Ching Ling Fu

1382
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,458
to discuss how to move those guns.

1383
01:04:12,667 --> 01:04:14,167
This is why you came to us?

1384
01:04:14,542 --> 01:04:16,458
Actually, we came for something else.

1385
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:19,083
You and Alice, the dead girl,

1386
01:04:21,042 --> 01:04:22,125
were you couple?

1387
01:04:26,667 --> 01:04:27,667
Why do you ask?

1388
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:29,608
Observe, listen, inquire, and feel.

1389
01:04:30,042 --> 01:04:31,768
Crime investigation is
much like Chinese medicine.

1390
01:04:31,792 --> 01:04:33,518
You seek out seemingly unrelated symptoms

1391
01:04:33,542 --> 01:04:34,726
to find the cause of sickness.

1392
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,143
That day, Zheng Shiliang
was hesitant to speak.

1393
01:04:36,167 --> 01:04:37,726
Alright!

1394
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:39,125
You studied in England,

1395
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,143
and Alice had been there, too.

1396
01:04:41,167 --> 01:04:43,226
Maybe you two knew
each other from back then.

1397
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:44,250
Most importantly,

1398
01:04:44,625 --> 01:04:45,518
when you were arrested by the police

1399
01:04:45,542 --> 01:04:46,393
on the morning of August 11th,

1400
01:04:46,417 --> 01:04:47,417
you were at the port.

1401
01:04:47,792 --> 01:04:48,952
You weren't trying to escape,

1402
01:04:49,958 --> 01:04:51,458
you were eloping with Alice,

1403
01:04:52,292 --> 01:04:53,292
weren't you?

1404
01:04:55,375 --> 01:04:57,375
Apparently I've underestimated you.

1405
01:04:58,667 --> 01:04:59,667
Looks like I was right.

1406
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:01,144
Honestly,

1407
01:05:01,168 --> 01:05:03,248
I'm even surprised by my
sheer talent as a detective.

1408
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:06,292
Turns out I really am perfect for the job.

1409
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:11,625
I first met her

1410
01:05:12,417 --> 01:05:13,958
was by River Thames.

1411
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:17,500
I was eighteen.

1412
01:05:23,917 --> 01:05:24,917
From that moment on,

1413
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,500
I knew

1414
01:05:27,375 --> 01:05:29,095
she would be the place where my life begins

1415
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,917
and also where it ends.

1416
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:33,185
I despised my father

1417
01:05:33,209 --> 01:05:34,375
and all his criminal deeds.

1418
01:05:35,542 --> 01:05:36,601
I was planning to

1419
01:05:36,625 --> 01:05:37,958
settle in England for good.

1420
01:05:38,417 --> 01:05:39,417
It was only for her

1421
01:05:40,167 --> 01:05:41,583
that I returned to San Francisco.

1422
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:19,375
And it was from then

1423
01:06:20,292 --> 01:06:22,083
that we truly got to know each other.

1424
01:06:23,292 --> 01:06:24,572
The Chinese Exclusion Act states

1425
01:06:25,417 --> 01:06:28,042
that Chinese men cannot marry white women.

1426
01:06:29,083 --> 01:06:30,809
We were so in love

1427
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:32,875
but it's us against the world.

1428
01:06:34,042 --> 01:06:35,500
We could only meet in secret.

1429
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:40,643
Revealing your relationship

1430
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:41,643
would have cleared your name.

1431
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:42,787
Why didn't you say anything?

1432
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:45,750
Alice is already dead.

1433
01:06:47,542 --> 01:06:50,375
I don't want her name
tarnished after her death.

1434
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:52,750
A true romantic.

1435
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:54,601
But you can't be

1436
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:55,602
known as the Chinese

1437
01:06:55,626 --> 01:06:57,018
Jack the Ripper, either, can you?

1438
01:06:57,042 --> 01:06:58,375
You've finally got to the point.

1439
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:01,726
The case is the biggest
story across America now.

1440
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,559
They want to make the
Chinese Exclusion Act a permanent law,

1441
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:05,383
so they need a reason
to convince the public.

1442
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:07,144
Brother,

1443
01:07:07,168 --> 01:07:09,048
why don't you tell us
what happened that night.

1444
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:11,953
On the afternoon of the 8th,

1445
01:07:12,167 --> 01:07:13,643
I received a letter from Alice,

1446
01:07:13,667 --> 01:07:15,208
delivered by her maid Amanda.

1447
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:17,310
Dear Zhenbang,

1448
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:19,018
I miss you terribly.

1449
01:07:19,042 --> 01:07:21,101
An unexpected event has occurred,

1450
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:23,292
and I must tell you about it in person.

1451
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:27,500
I will wait for you at the
port at 6 AM on the 11th.

1452
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:29,559
Please come and

1453
01:07:29,583 --> 01:07:31,750
we will start a new life together.

1454
01:07:32,792 --> 01:07:34,476
We had made plans to snatch those guns

1455
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,260
in the Irish block on
the night of the 10th.

1456
01:07:36,667 --> 01:07:38,726
So, after delivering
the guns to the theater,

1457
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:39,958
I went home to pack

1458
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,559
and made it to the port before 6 am.

1459
01:07:43,583 --> 01:07:45,143
But instead of Alice,

1460
01:07:45,167 --> 01:07:46,287
it was the police that came.

1461
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:49,250
I understand now.

1462
01:07:50,417 --> 01:07:51,417
Go find Amanda.

1463
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:53,059
She knows everything

1464
01:07:53,083 --> 01:07:54,083
about me and Alice.

1465
01:07:54,458 --> 01:07:55,144
And she should know

1466
01:07:55,168 --> 01:07:56,393
who the real killer is.

1467
01:07:56,417 --> 01:07:57,102
Where are you going?

1468
01:07:57,126 --> 01:07:58,559
The revolution is happening,

1469
01:07:58,583 --> 01:07:59,917
and these firearms are crucial.

1470
01:08:00,417 --> 01:08:01,768
As of now, either love or death

1471
01:08:01,792 --> 01:08:02,872
should make place for that.

1472
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:04,976
Shiliang and I will move the guns first.

1473
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:05,727
You were born and raised

1474
01:08:05,751 --> 01:08:06,768
here in America,

1475
01:08:06,792 --> 01:08:07,952
and have never been to China.

1476
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:09,925
Why do you care so
much about the revolution?

1477
01:08:12,083 --> 01:08:13,018
I've never been to China,

1478
01:08:13,042 --> 01:08:13,810
nor did I braid my hair.

1479
01:08:13,834 --> 01:08:15,417
Still they call me "pig-tail."

1480
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:18,152
Alice and I love each other truly,

1481
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:20,750
yet we can't be seen
together in broad daylight.

1482
01:08:22,667 --> 01:08:24,101
The world is full of questions

1483
01:08:24,125 --> 01:08:25,165
to which I have no answer.

1484
01:08:26,292 --> 01:08:27,917
After meeting Shiliang, I realized that

1485
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:32,309
Chinese people are always
protected by a portion of their own.

1486
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:34,375
They knowingly pursue the impossible.

1487
01:08:35,375 --> 01:08:37,125
They are the true hope of China.

1488
01:08:38,583 --> 01:08:39,667
Perhaps they can give me

1489
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:41,625
the answers I don't have.

1490
01:08:43,167 --> 01:08:44,417
You're doing a great thing.

1491
01:08:45,917 --> 01:08:46,917
I admire that.

1492
01:08:47,375 --> 01:08:48,434
Great or not,

1493
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:49,750
we all have our purpose in life.

1494
01:08:50,917 --> 01:08:51,934
I do hope you two

1495
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:53,268
can clear Zhenbang's name.

1496
01:08:53,292 --> 01:08:54,708
We can also help you tomorrow.

1497
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:57,128
Right now, Zhenbang's
case is just as important.

1498
01:08:57,750 --> 01:08:59,208
We appreciate your kindness.

1499
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:02,226
Qin Fu,

1500
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:03,250
<i>Gm,</i>

1501
01:09:04,583 --> 01:09:06,750
please find the person who killed Alice.

1502
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:08,268
Rest assured,

1503
01:09:08,292 --> 01:09:09,060
Brother.

1504
01:09:09,084 --> 01:09:10,309
Also,

1505
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:11,333
just Zhenbang is okay.

1506
01:09:11,792 --> 01:09:12,952
Please don't call me brother.

1507
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:16,417
It creeps me out.

1508
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:18,559
Alright.

1509
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:19,583
Brother Zhenbang.

1510
01:09:42,417 --> 01:09:43,976
We don't serve Chinese here.

1511
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Get lost.

1512
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:50,583
Here...

1513
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:51,727
who...

1514
01:09:51,751 --> 01:09:53,208
can speak Chinese,

1515
01:09:53,875 --> 01:09:54,875
anyone?

1516
01:09:55,667 --> 01:09:56,309
Get out,

1517
01:09:56,333 --> 01:09:57,333
Chinaman.

1518
01:09:58,583 --> 01:09:59,863
As long as there's a translator.

1519
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,768
I am from the Yellow
Banner of the Great Qing,

1520
01:10:02,792 --> 01:10:05,643
Captain of the Imperial
Guards, First Assistant

1521
01:10:05,667 --> 01:10:06,934
and Deputy of the Intelligence Department,

1522
01:10:06,958 --> 01:10:08,518
Head of the Secret Escort,

1523
01:10:08,542 --> 01:10:09,976
Recipient of the Yellow Jacket,

1524
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,167
member of the Niohuru Clan,

1525
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:13,792
Fei Yanggu.

1526
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:16,458
Translate.

1527
01:10:17,542 --> 01:10:18,643
What the fuck?

1528
01:10:18,667 --> 01:10:19,417
What did he say?

1529
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:20,310
A name.

1530
01:10:20,334 --> 01:10:21,854
He seemed to have said more than that.

1531
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:22,917
Along name

1532
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:24,393
So what?

1533
01:10:24,417 --> 01:10:25,417
So?

1534
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:27,167
<i>So,</i>

1535
01:10:28,042 --> 01:10:29,375
we can work together

1536
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:30,644
to catch the rebels.

1537
01:10:30,668 --> 01:10:32,434
You take the guns.

1538
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:34,833
I take the people.

1539
01:10:36,708 --> 01:10:38,583
What can you provide in this cooperation?

1540
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,250
Your piggy tail?

1541
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,625
I know where you can find the guns.

1542
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:17,393
Which is faster?

1543
01:11:17,417 --> 01:11:18,417
A dagger or a gun?

1544
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:21,708
At this distance,

1545
01:11:23,292 --> 01:11:24,583
I'm faster.

1546
01:11:48,708 --> 01:11:50,184
Sir, you held yourself so well back there.

1547
01:11:50,208 --> 01:11:51,208
My respect.

1548
01:11:53,417 --> 01:11:54,083
Sir.

1549
01:11:54,375 --> 01:11:55,375
Help me.

1550
01:11:55,792 --> 01:11:56,912
Don't let the Americans see.

1551
01:11:57,417 --> 01:11:58,667
I'm about to pee myself.

1552
01:12:03,042 --> 01:12:04,042
Search!

1553
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:06,792
Chief Lance.

1554
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:08,976
What is this about?

1555
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,559
Where is Bai Zhenbang?

1556
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:11,310
Hand him over.

1557
01:12:11,334 --> 01:12:12,934
I'm looking for him too.

1558
01:12:12,958 --> 01:12:14,684
He's out since this morning.

1559
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:16,143
Mr. Lance,

1560
01:12:16,167 --> 01:12:18,351
you know, my son's bail paid already.

1561
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,809
We're here for him concerning another case.

1562
01:12:20,833 --> 01:12:22,809
One that just occurred in Chinatown.

1563
01:12:22,833 --> 01:12:25,000
Could it be that you've
found Alice's maid, Amanda?

1564
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:27,684
You seem to know a lot about the case.

1565
01:12:27,708 --> 01:12:28,893
We're looking for Amanda too.

1566
01:12:28,917 --> 01:12:30,167
But no. It's not her.

1567
01:12:30,875 --> 01:12:31,476
The victim,

1568
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:32,227
Lin Yue'e,

1569
01:12:32,251 --> 01:12:33,393
26 years old,

1570
01:12:33,417 --> 01:12:35,583
a traditional Chinese
medicine practitioner.

1571
01:12:35,958 --> 01:12:38,250
Her father found the
body and called the police.

1572
01:12:42,375 --> 01:12:43,643
How long's she been dead?

1573
01:12:43,667 --> 01:12:45,625
Likely within the last hour.

1574
01:12:45,958 --> 01:12:47,583
The killer hasn't gone far.

1575
01:12:48,083 --> 01:12:49,375
Let's go. Follow me.

1576
01:12:52,042 --> 01:12:53,726
He's not here Mr. Bai.

1577
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:56,226
I recall you promised
to keep an eye on him.

1578
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:59,226
Please, give me a little more time.

1579
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:01,018
Zhenbang was with us just now.

1580
01:13:01,042 --> 01:13:03,292
He couldn't have had
the time to kill someone.

1581
01:13:03,708 --> 01:13:05,018
No one will believe the testimony

1582
01:13:05,042 --> 01:13:06,976
of a Chinese now, Mr. Bai.

1583
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,042
I'm under a lot of pressure right now.

1584
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:12,208
He'd better not resist arrest
or try to flee again.

1585
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:16,000
Or I can't guarantee his safety any longer.

1586
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:17,875
Let's go.

1587
01:13:21,917 --> 01:13:23,309
My brother has something
important to do tomorrow.

1588
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:24,269
I know.

1589
01:13:24,293 --> 01:13:25,375
The guns.

1590
01:13:25,542 --> 01:13:27,101
We want to go take a
look at the crime scene.

1591
01:13:27,125 --> 01:13:28,292
You go ahead.

1592
01:13:28,625 --> 01:13:30,333
I'll call Mr. Weyman.

1593
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:31,995
Right now, he's the only one

1594
01:13:32,792 --> 01:13:33,958
who can help us.

1595
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:36,208
Lao Si,

1596
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:40,851
get Zhenbang a ferry
ticket for tomorrow night,

1597
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,755
and make sure he doesn't
come back for a while.

1598
01:13:42,917 --> 01:13:44,250
Where to?

1599
01:13:45,958 --> 01:13:47,208
As far as possible.

1600
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:49,375
Hong Kong.

1601
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:52,851
Turns out we're peers.

1602
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:53,851
She was a detective?

1603
01:13:53,875 --> 01:13:55,235
Also a doctor of Chinese medicine.

1604
01:13:55,833 --> 01:13:56,833
Let's keep observing.

1605
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:00,125
No signs of struggle.

1606
01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:03,059
Fresh blood.

1607
01:14:03,083 --> 01:14:04,309
This time, the body wasn't moved.

1608
01:14:04,333 --> 01:14:05,573
The attack happened right here.

1609
01:14:11,083 --> 01:14:12,250
She was strangled first,

1610
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,500
then disemboweled.

1611
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,667
Strange.

1612
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:18,917
What?

1613
01:14:19,167 --> 01:14:19,852
The cut this time

1614
01:14:19,876 --> 01:14:21,226
isn't as clean as the last one.

1615
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:23,143
The internal organs were displaced, too.

1616
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:23,852
You mean

1617
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:25,292
it's not the same guy who did it?

1618
01:14:25,458 --> 01:14:26,458
Definitely not.

1619
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:27,434
Alright,

1620
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:28,292
now let's go ask again.

1621
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:30,250
(RE - INQUIRY)
Yue'e was a good child.

1622
01:14:30,375 --> 01:14:33,434
She came to America with me at fifteen.

1623
01:14:33,458 --> 01:14:35,518
Never even had an argument with people.

1624
01:14:35,542 --> 01:14:37,434
Why would anyone do such a horrible thing?

1625
01:14:37,458 --> 01:14:38,768
She had no enemies.

1626
01:14:38,792 --> 01:14:39,875
Did she have any friends?

1627
01:14:40,583 --> 01:14:41,768
What do you mean?

1628
01:14:41,792 --> 01:14:43,018
You should know that Bai Zhenbang's case

1629
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:44,684
concerns the future of Chinatown,

1630
01:14:44,708 --> 01:14:46,268
as well as the fate of
all Chinese in America.

1631
01:14:46,292 --> 01:14:47,227
If you know anything...

1632
01:14:47,251 --> 01:14:48,601
Now is the time to
speak, before it's too late.

1633
01:14:48,625 --> 01:14:49,602
And more importantly...

1634
01:14:49,626 --> 01:14:51,266
Don't you want justice for your daughter?

1635
01:14:54,625 --> 01:14:55,976
Jack the Ripper strikes again,

1636
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,583
another Chinese woman.

1637
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,184
Check it! Check it!

1638
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:02,309
Chinese woman brutally murdered.

1639
01:15:02,333 --> 01:15:07,893
- Jack the Ripper strikes again.
- Another Chinese woman got killed.

1640
01:15:07,917 --> 01:15:09,101
News! News!

1641
01:15:09,125 --> 01:15:10,476
Jack the Ripper strikes again,

1642
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,434
another Chinese woman

1643
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:14,184
brutally murdered.

1644
01:15:14,208 --> 01:15:15,559
Jack the Ripper strikes again,

1645
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,542
another Chinese woman.

1646
01:15:24,667 --> 01:15:26,934
This is my last time here.

1647
01:15:26,958 --> 01:15:30,518
Tomorrow I will go to Europe.

1648
01:15:30,542 --> 01:15:32,684
I hope the Europeans

1649
01:15:32,708 --> 01:15:34,750
will like my humor.

1650
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:39,667
Does this mean Jack the Ripper
is bound for Europe, too?

1651
01:15:41,167 --> 01:15:43,726
This case not ended.

1652
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:46,809
I believe killer not Chinese.

1653
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:48,351
Would you bet on it?

1654
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:49,185
OK.

1655
01:15:49,209 --> 01:15:50,559
I take your bet.

1656
01:15:50,583 --> 01:15:53,018
If killer is Chinese,

1657
01:15:53,042 --> 01:15:55,375
I never back to America.

1658
01:15:58,375 --> 01:15:59,375
Bai Zhenbang.

1659
01:16:01,292 --> 01:16:02,292
Stop!

1660
01:16:04,917 --> 01:16:05,917
Stop!

1661
01:16:06,333 --> 01:16:07,333
Stop!

1662
01:16:14,875 --> 01:16:15,875
Hey,

1663
01:16:16,042 --> 01:16:17,242
he's a better driver than you.

1664
01:16:25,083 --> 01:16:26,083
Zhenbang is on the move.

1665
01:16:26,667 --> 01:16:27,667
Are we heading out now?

1666
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:28,750
Let's go.

1667
01:16:35,708 --> 01:16:36,726
The guns are all here.

1668
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:37,750
Catch them! Come on!

1669
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:44,583
Freeze! Don't move!

1670
01:16:49,042 --> 01:16:50,042
Stop!

1671
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:50,893
A distraction.

1672
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:52,083
Amateur...

1673
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:54,750
An amateur move.

1674
01:17:56,333 --> 01:17:57,333
Amateur...

1675
01:17:59,583 --> 01:18:00,667
Empty.

1676
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:16,792
<i>Gui</i>

1677
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:33,208
Gui, please don't die.

1678
01:19:33,667 --> 01:19:34,667
<i>Gun!</i>

1679
01:19:36,167 --> 01:19:37,934
Where are the guns?

1680
01:19:37,958 --> 01:19:42,518
I didn't know the Irish
were so interested in magic.

1681
01:19:42,542 --> 01:19:43,352
Don't just stand there.

1682
01:19:43,376 --> 01:19:44,476
Get'em out of here.

1683
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:45,500
<i>Gui</i>

1684
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,042
My name is Ghost.

1685
01:19:55,292 --> 01:19:56,458
Thank Kachina,

1686
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:58,500
and my father, too.

1687
01:20:35,417 --> 01:20:36,417
Save the young master!

1688
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:42,833
Dao.

1689
01:20:45,542 --> 01:20:46,542
Dao.

1690
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:47,875
Dao.

1691
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:51,059
Dao.

1692
01:20:51,083 --> 01:20:51,684
Young Master.

1693
01:20:51,708 --> 01:20:52,518
Get out of here! Young master.

1694
01:20:52,542 --> 01:20:53,125
Dao.

1695
01:20:53,292 --> 01:20:54,393
Leave Brother Dao with us.

1696
01:20:54,417 --> 01:20:55,583
We'll take it from here.

1697
01:20:59,125 --> 01:21:01,059
The master booked you a ticket
to leave tonight by boat.

1698
01:21:01,083 --> 01:21:02,393
We're taking you to the dock.

1699
01:21:02,417 --> 01:21:03,417
Let's go.

1700
01:21:07,292 --> 01:21:08,292
Uncle Si,

1701
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:09,583
I can't go with you.

1702
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:11,559
There's something I must do.

1703
01:21:11,583 --> 01:21:13,059
No, we have to go to the dock now.

1704
01:21:13,083 --> 01:21:14,208
No, I must do this.

1705
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:16,083
Take him to the dock.

1706
01:21:16,917 --> 01:21:18,018
Young Master.

1707
01:21:18,042 --> 01:21:19,042
If you won't let me go,

1708
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:20,667
I'll kill myself right here.

1709
01:21:21,583 --> 01:21:22,601
Give me the ticket.

1710
01:21:22,625 --> 01:21:24,500
I'll board the ship after I'm done.

1711
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:25,958
Zhenbang.

1712
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:26,809
Don't go.

1713
01:21:26,833 --> 01:21:27,833
Ticket!

1714
01:21:33,167 --> 01:21:34,167
Uncle Si,

1715
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:48,333
tell my father that,

1716
01:21:50,083 --> 01:21:52,123
although I don't approve of
many things he has done,

1717
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:54,250
he's always been

1718
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:57,292
a hero to me.

1719
01:21:58,417 --> 01:21:59,750
That has never changed.

1720
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:03,583
I'm very grateful for the name he gave me.

1721
01:22:04,958 --> 01:22:05,958
It made me understand

1722
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:08,167
what a man

1723
01:22:09,292 --> 01:22:10,875
should do with his life.

1724
01:22:18,708 --> 01:22:19,269
Boss,

1725
01:22:19,293 --> 01:22:20,500
everything is loaded.

1726
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:22,333
Let's go.

1727
01:22:27,083 --> 01:22:28,083
Stop.

1728
01:22:32,458 --> 01:22:33,750
Where are the guns?

1729
01:22:34,167 --> 01:22:35,768
They're already

1730
01:22:35,792 --> 01:22:36,792
in Hong Kong.

1731
01:22:40,917 --> 01:22:42,601
Give me the location of your operation

1732
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,667
and all the names of the rebels,

1733
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:46,750
and I'll spare your life.

1734
01:22:48,458 --> 01:22:49,458
Okay...

1735
01:22:50,083 --> 01:22:51,851
but on one condition.

1736
01:22:51,875 --> 01:22:52,976
What is it?

1737
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Go on.

1738
01:22:57,792 --> 01:23:01,042
Your hairstyle doesn't
really suit your face.

1739
01:23:02,375 --> 01:23:03,601
Cut off your braid,

1740
01:23:03,625 --> 01:23:04,434
and I'll tell you.

1741
01:23:04,458 --> 01:23:05,458
How dare you?

1742
01:23:13,708 --> 01:23:15,188
Who told you to mess him up that bad?

1743
01:23:15,458 --> 01:23:16,458
Stop!

1744
01:23:16,875 --> 01:23:18,675
We don't want to cause
a diplomatic incident.

1745
01:23:23,875 --> 01:23:25,125
Throw him into the cell.

1746
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:28,167
We'll continue the
interrogation tomorrow morning.

1747
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:48,750
Not dead.

1748
01:23:51,375 --> 01:23:52,375
Faked it.

1749
01:23:53,125 --> 01:23:54,792
A wise man knows when to yield.

1750
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:56,333
Where's Brother Zhenbang?

1751
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,476
He said he has something
more important to do.

1752
01:23:58,500 --> 01:23:59,934
He'll join me afterwards.

1753
01:23:59,958 --> 01:24:00,935
Join you?

1754
01:24:00,959 --> 01:24:02,125
How are you getting out?

1755
01:24:02,792 --> 01:24:03,583
<i>Gm,</i>

1756
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:04,750
got any ideas?

1757
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:06,792
There is one.

1758
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:07,934
But it's slow.

1759
01:24:07,958 --> 01:24:08,958
How slow?

1760
01:24:09,042 --> 01:24:10,962
They're coming for us
first thing in the morning.

1761
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:24,542
Don't worry.

1762
01:24:25,167 --> 01:24:26,542
We'll live.

1763
01:24:27,208 --> 01:24:28,393
We're doomed.

1764
01:24:28,417 --> 01:24:29,434
So very doomed.

1765
01:24:29,458 --> 01:24:30,476
Master Fei,

1766
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:31,726
We are like peas in a pod.

1767
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:32,976
Why must we harm each other?

1768
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,851
I'm nothing like you.

1769
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:35,893
Look at you three.

1770
01:24:35,917 --> 01:24:36,768
A rebel,

1771
01:24:36,792 --> 01:24:37,602
a savage,

1772
01:24:37,626 --> 01:24:38,917
a banana man.

1773
01:24:39,625 --> 01:24:40,833
You all deserve to die.

1774
01:24:41,583 --> 01:24:42,643
You want to live?

1775
01:24:42,667 --> 01:24:43,667
Let him talk if you do.

1776
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:45,750
Brother Zheng,

1777
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,042
just confess.

1778
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,269
As long you're alive,

1779
01:24:48,293 --> 01:24:49,333
there's hope.

1780
01:24:49,583 --> 01:24:50,435
Revolution requires patience.

1781
01:24:50,459 --> 01:24:51,500
Let it take its course.

1782
01:24:53,625 --> 01:24:56,042
Live as a hero,

1783
01:24:56,917 --> 01:24:59,518
die a martyr.

1784
01:24:59,542 --> 01:25:00,893
I'll screw the "martyr" out of you.

1785
01:25:00,917 --> 01:25:01,917
Bury him.

1786
01:25:02,167 --> 01:25:03,167
Do it.

1787
01:25:05,083 --> 01:25:06,476
Where are your powers?

1788
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:07,684
Use them!

1789
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:09,226
Strength of the Bear!

1790
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:09,810
The pigeon said

1791
01:25:09,834 --> 01:25:10,934
we'll live.

1792
01:25:10,958 --> 01:25:12,125
You believe a pigeon?

1793
01:25:12,542 --> 01:25:13,726
Our lives are at stake here

1794
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:14,958
and you believe a pigeon?

1795
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:16,643
I believe in Kachina.

1796
01:25:16,667 --> 01:25:18,250
And I believe in the revolution.

1797
01:25:20,083 --> 01:25:21,101
Lads! Lads!

1798
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:22,309
You'll never believe it.

1799
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:24,018
It's the news, the news.

1800
01:25:24,042 --> 01:25:27,018
My cousin's unit is going to China.

1801
01:25:27,042 --> 01:25:28,809
He's going to make a fortune.

1802
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:29,893
They say it's all the gold
and jewels over there.

1803
01:25:29,917 --> 01:25:30,500
Sir!

1804
01:25:30,833 --> 01:25:31,292
Sir!

1805
01:25:31,625 --> 01:25:32,625
Sir!

1806
01:25:34,167 --> 01:25:35,309
Sir, sir!

1807
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:36,476
The Eight-Nation Alliance led
by Britain and America

1808
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:37,643
has invaded Peking,

1809
01:25:37,667 --> 01:25:38,934
occupied the Forbidden City.

1810
01:25:38,958 --> 01:25:40,000
Concubine Zhen was killed.

1811
01:25:40,208 --> 01:25:41,559
The Empress Dowager and the Emperor-

1812
01:25:41,583 --> 01:25:43,292
have gone missing, fate unknown.

1813
01:25:43,958 --> 01:25:46,125
We are rich men.

1814
01:25:49,458 --> 01:25:52,042
They say they'll loot the Forbidden City.

1815
01:25:52,792 --> 01:25:56,309
Maybe my cousin will
have sex with the Chinese queen?

1816
01:25:56,333 --> 01:25:57,227
Now they are

1817
01:25:57,251 --> 01:25:59,131
talking about sleeping
with the emperor's wife.

1818
01:27:19,708 --> 01:27:21,351
A dagger?

1819
01:27:21,375 --> 01:27:22,310
Or a gun?

1820
01:27:22,334 --> 01:27:24,208
You crazy bastard.

1821
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:36,208
Brother!

1822
01:28:20,958 --> 01:28:21,958
We're late.

1823
01:28:22,792 --> 01:28:23,792
Just in time.

1824
01:28:28,458 --> 01:28:29,559
Are you alright?

1825
01:28:29,583 --> 01:28:30,583
I'm fine.

1826
01:28:30,625 --> 01:28:32,101
He speaks Hebei dialect too?

1827
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:33,292
He's my Eagle Eyes.

1828
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,083
Save China.

1829
01:29:14,208 --> 01:29:15,208
Detective Fu,

1830
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:17,945
we have news of the young master.

1831
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:20,059
Do you need us to go with you?

1832
01:29:20,083 --> 01:29:21,268
You'll scare people.

1833
01:29:21,292 --> 01:29:22,434
Just give us the horses.

1834
01:29:22,458 --> 01:29:23,184
Brother-in-law,

1835
01:29:23,208 --> 01:29:24,185
take care of your sister.

1836
01:29:24,209 --> 01:29:25,268
I'll come for her soon.

1837
01:29:25,292 --> 01:29:26,518
What did he say?

1838
01:29:26,542 --> 01:29:27,958
That he'll find the killer soon.

1839
01:29:28,542 --> 01:29:29,917
We made a good team.

1840
01:29:30,375 --> 01:29:31,792
I misjudged you.

1841
01:29:32,583 --> 01:29:33,434
His sister is waiting for you.

1842
01:29:33,458 --> 01:29:34,458
Don't forget the land.

1843
01:29:35,292 --> 01:29:36,476
I will not give up.

1844
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:37,500
OK.

1845
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:52,018
Where's he?

1846
01:29:52,042 --> 01:29:53,042
Inside.

1847
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,750
What happened?

1848
01:30:35,792 --> 01:30:37,684
This morning, Mr. Grant came to my office

1849
01:30:37,708 --> 01:30:40,000
to inquire about the progress of the case.

1850
01:30:40,417 --> 01:30:42,726
I want you to arrest this man right now.

1851
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:46,143
And I will not have this impede
my campaign in any way.

1852
01:30:46,167 --> 01:30:47,268
Don't worry, Mr. Grant,

1853
01:30:47,292 --> 01:30:49,500
your sympathy vote's climbing as we speak.

1854
01:30:50,208 --> 01:30:50,852
Sir,

1855
01:30:50,876 --> 01:30:54,208
someone reported that Bai Zhenbang
was found at the silk factory.

1856
01:31:09,708 --> 01:31:10,726
Bai Zhenbang,

1857
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:12,042
Put your hands up!

1858
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:13,958
You're surrounded.

1859
01:31:29,667 --> 01:31:31,434
You're under arrest.

1860
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:32,750
Put your hands up!

1861
01:32:16,208 --> 01:32:17,875
We all saw it, Mr. Bai.

1862
01:32:18,625 --> 01:32:19,792
Everyone here.

1863
01:32:21,125 --> 01:32:22,792
Your son is Jack the Ripper.

1864
01:32:29,292 --> 01:32:30,643
<i>Mr. Bah</i>

1865
01:32:30,667 --> 01:32:32,958
you've been in America for decades,

1866
01:32:33,417 --> 01:32:36,333
but still, I don't think you
understand this country.

1867
01:32:36,708 --> 01:32:38,851
Our freedom is based on the law.

1868
01:32:38,875 --> 01:32:41,184
And the law is made by the American people,

1869
01:32:41,208 --> 01:32:42,684
not an emperor.

1870
01:32:42,708 --> 01:32:45,083
It was the law that
sentenced your son to death.

1871
01:32:46,417 --> 01:32:47,417
Tomorrow,

1872
01:32:48,417 --> 01:32:49,458
all of Chinatown

1873
01:32:50,042 --> 01:32:51,542
will pay for his crimes.

1874
01:33:02,958 --> 01:33:04,559
For now, it's the time

1875
01:33:04,583 --> 01:33:08,625
to drive out the Yellow
Peril out of our country.

1876
01:33:10,292 --> 01:33:12,000
Go away.

1877
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:20,875
Go away.

1878
01:33:58,708 --> 01:34:04,375
Go away.

1879
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,458
This is the American
residency paper you wanted.

1880
01:34:13,333 --> 01:34:15,893
Master Bai knew all along that
you are not Mr. Holmes.

1881
01:34:15,917 --> 01:34:17,167
Your real name is Qin Fu.

1882
01:34:17,333 --> 01:34:18,019
Your grandfather

1883
01:34:18,043 --> 01:34:19,101
was the imperial physician
to Emperor Daoguang.

1884
01:34:19,125 --> 01:34:20,792
Qin Benyu the Divine Hands.

1885
01:34:20,875 --> 01:34:22,018
He retired to his home village,

1886
01:34:22,042 --> 01:34:23,417
treating common folk for a living.

1887
01:34:23,708 --> 01:34:25,393
In the third year of Xianfeng,

1888
01:34:25,417 --> 01:34:27,351
<i>man Yuan, the Lord of Mn, took Henan</i>

1889
01:34:27,375 --> 01:34:30,184
and slaughtered all eleven
members of your family.

1890
01:34:30,208 --> 01:34:32,518
Your father was the only survivor.

1891
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:36,375
I think that's why you rather
stay here than going back.

1892
01:34:36,667 --> 01:34:38,268
You're not a student sent by
the Qing government, either.

1893
01:34:38,292 --> 01:34:39,417
The age doesn't match.

1894
01:34:39,833 --> 01:34:41,643
Your older brother, Qin Lin, is.

1895
01:34:41,667 --> 01:34:43,101
You came to America years ago

1896
01:34:43,125 --> 01:34:44,726
looking for him,

1897
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:46,184
the only family you have left.

1898
01:34:46,208 --> 01:34:47,208
Am I right?

1899
01:34:47,875 --> 01:34:49,292
Take this residency paper

1900
01:34:49,708 --> 01:34:50,708
and go find him.

1901
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:01,727
What does this mean?

1902
01:35:01,751 --> 01:35:02,792
No more investigation?

1903
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:07,893
And you?

1904
01:35:07,917 --> 01:35:08,917
You're giving up, too?

1905
01:35:09,083 --> 01:35:10,083
This time tomorrow,

1906
01:35:10,833 --> 01:35:13,208
Lance will announce the case closed
at City Hall Square.

1907
01:35:14,083 --> 01:35:15,292
What more can we do?

1908
01:35:23,375 --> 01:35:24,809
My parents died in an explosion

1909
01:35:24,833 --> 01:35:26,233
building railways for white people.

1910
01:35:26,333 --> 01:35:27,125
I was young.

1911
01:35:27,208 --> 01:35:28,208
I had to let go.

1912
01:35:28,417 --> 01:35:29,019
Later,

1913
01:35:29,043 --> 01:35:31,559
the Native American tribe that
raised me was driven away,

1914
01:35:31,583 --> 01:35:33,917
forced to leave their ancestors' lands.

1915
01:35:34,625 --> 01:35:36,059
Father told me not to resist.

1916
01:35:36,083 --> 01:35:36,685
I had to let go.

1917
01:35:36,709 --> 01:35:37,917
Now Father was killed,

1918
01:35:38,583 --> 01:35:39,809
and Zhenbang was falsely accused.

1919
01:35:39,833 --> 01:35:41,233
Are we supposed to let it go again?

1920
01:35:41,667 --> 01:35:42,867
Plus, with so many loose ends,

1921
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,792
we all know Zhenbang can't be the killer.

1922
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Yet in the end,

1923
01:35:47,333 --> 01:35:48,726
even we are to give up investigation.

1924
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:49,750
Then history

1925
01:35:49,792 --> 01:35:50,809
will forever remember

1926
01:35:50,833 --> 01:35:52,542
a Chinese Jack the Ripper.

1927
01:35:54,167 --> 01:35:55,893
You can choose to give up,

1928
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:56,894
to let it go,

1929
01:35:56,918 --> 01:35:58,458
but this time, I won't.

1930
01:35:59,833 --> 01:36:01,667
I will find the real killer.

1931
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:24,477
What are you doing here?

1932
01:36:24,501 --> 01:36:26,476
We've come to say
goodbye to Young Master Bai.

1933
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:27,477
Everyone here

1934
01:36:27,501 --> 01:36:29,309
has received help from the Bai family,
more or less.

1935
01:36:29,333 --> 01:36:31,851
Whether it's you, Master
Bai, or the Young Master.

1936
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:33,476
Six months ago, I had a difficult labor.

1937
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:35,518
The American doctors had given up on me.

1938
01:36:35,542 --> 01:36:37,643
If it weren't for the Young Master,

1939
01:36:37,667 --> 01:36:39,476
my child and I wouldn't have survived.

1940
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:42,643
My wife and I run a
laundry shop outside Chinatown.

1941
01:36:42,667 --> 01:36:44,851
We're bullied by the
Irish gang all the time.

1942
01:36:44,875 --> 01:36:46,595
My wife was pushed to the brink of suicide.

1943
01:36:46,917 --> 01:36:49,393
It was Young Master
Bai who stood up for us.

1944
01:36:49,417 --> 01:36:51,351
We don't believe he is a murderer.

1945
01:36:51,375 --> 01:36:52,750
We don't believe it.

1946
01:36:53,083 --> 01:36:54,083
Public Will.

1947
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:55,851
Public Will.

1948
01:36:55,875 --> 01:36:57,417
Aren't this the will of public?

1949
01:36:58,792 --> 01:37:00,000
Gui is right.

1950
01:37:00,292 --> 01:37:01,812
We can't let Zhenbang die for nothing.

1951
01:37:02,333 --> 01:37:03,768
There are still 24 hours
before the case closes.

1952
01:37:03,792 --> 01:37:04,917
We still have a chance.

1953
01:37:05,417 --> 01:37:06,226
<i>Gm,</i>

1954
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:06,934
let's go.

1955
01:37:06,958 --> 01:37:07,958
Take me with you.

1956
01:37:16,208 --> 01:37:17,968
Aren't you supposed
to be on a ship tonight?

1957
01:37:18,125 --> 01:37:18,560
Yes.

1958
01:37:18,584 --> 01:37:19,934
The magician is waiting for you.

1959
01:37:19,958 --> 01:37:20,976
I want to stay

1960
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,351
and fight with you until the end.

1961
01:37:22,375 --> 01:37:23,768
You have something more important to do.

1962
01:37:23,792 --> 01:37:24,559
We've got it covered here.

1963
01:37:24,583 --> 01:37:25,375
Don't worry.

1964
01:37:25,542 --> 01:37:26,542
<i>Shi Liang,</i>

1965
01:37:26,583 --> 01:37:27,903
the greater thing needs you more.

1966
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,833
If all our countrymen were like you two,

1967
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:33,125
China will surely be a great nation again.

1968
01:37:34,625 --> 01:37:35,976
Guess this is where we part ways, then.

1969
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Take care.

1970
01:37:40,333 --> 01:37:41,768
From now on,

1971
01:37:41,792 --> 01:37:44,333
you two shall be known
as Detective Chinatown.

1972
01:37:50,625 --> 01:37:52,018
Observe, listen, ask, feel? Which one now?

1973
01:37:52,042 --> 01:37:53,042
Time is against us.

1974
01:37:54,042 --> 01:37:55,042
Just improvise.

1975
01:37:55,458 --> 01:37:56,643
These past few days, we were so focused on

1976
01:37:56,667 --> 01:37:57,934
Bai Zhenbang and Alice

1977
01:37:57,958 --> 01:37:59,518
that we overlooked an important person.

1978
01:37:59,625 --> 01:38:01,000
That black maid.

1979
01:38:03,167 --> 01:38:04,167
Amanda lives here.

1980
01:38:05,042 --> 01:38:07,351
I do not know so much about her affairs.

1981
01:38:07,375 --> 01:38:09,184
She was with Miss Alice every day.

1982
01:38:09,208 --> 01:38:11,059
The very day Miss Alice was killed,

1983
01:38:11,083 --> 01:38:12,226
she disappeared too.

1984
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:13,518
Can we have a look around?

1985
01:38:13,542 --> 01:38:14,185
Suit yourself.

1986
01:38:14,209 --> 01:38:15,708
The police have already checked.

1987
01:38:22,667 --> 01:38:24,351
You said the wounds on Amanda's body

1988
01:38:24,375 --> 01:38:26,226
are the same as those on Dr. Lin's.

1989
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:27,393
The person who cut open Alice

1990
01:38:27,417 --> 01:38:28,934
is not the one who did them.

1991
01:38:28,958 --> 01:38:30,351
But I don't understand.

1992
01:38:30,375 --> 01:38:31,643
Besides a need for attention,

1993
01:38:31,667 --> 01:38:32,768
why would the killer copy

1994
01:38:32,792 --> 01:38:34,417
Jack the Ripper's pattern?

1995
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:35,935
What's even stranger...

1996
01:38:35,959 --> 01:38:37,250
why are there two killers?

1997
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:44,767
What's this herb-brewing pot doing here?

1998
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,800
Black people believe in
Chinese medicine too?

1999
01:38:51,583 --> 01:38:52,143
Mulberry mistletoe.

2000
01:38:52,167 --> 01:38:52,684
Nourishes liver and kidneys,

2001
01:38:52,708 --> 01:38:53,268
dispels rheumatism,

2002
01:38:53,292 --> 01:38:53,934
strengthens bones,

2003
01:38:53,958 --> 01:38:54,667
stabilizes the fetus.

2004
01:38:54,875 --> 01:38:55,393
Baikal Skullcap.

2005
01:38:55,417 --> 01:38:55,934
Clears heat,

2006
01:38:55,958 --> 01:38:56,519
purges toxins,

2007
01:38:56,543 --> 01:38:57,684
stops bleeding, stabilizes the fetus.

2008
01:38:57,708 --> 01:38:58,393
Atractylodes.

2009
01:38:58,417 --> 01:38:59,184
Replenishes qi, strengthens the spleen,

2010
01:38:59,208 --> 01:39:00,018
dispels dampness,

2011
01:39:00,042 --> 01:39:01,042
relieves sweating,

2012
01:39:01,792 --> 01:39:02,519
stabilizes the fetus.

2013
01:39:02,543 --> 01:39:03,917
The medicine wasn't for her.

2014
01:39:04,833 --> 01:39:07,434
But why would the killer
remove her intestines?

2015
01:39:07,458 --> 01:39:08,875
This here is the fatal wound.

2016
01:39:09,125 --> 01:39:10,125
Wood shavings.

2017
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:11,417
Why are there wood shavings?

2018
01:39:16,083 --> 01:39:17,851
We're close to solving Alice's case.

2019
01:39:17,875 --> 01:39:19,476
Who killed Father then?

2020
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:20,268
We need to

2021
01:39:20,292 --> 01:39:21,292
Qie one more time.

2022
01:39:21,625 --> 01:39:23,385
(RE - STEAL)
Which kind are we talking about?

2023
01:39:33,625 --> 01:39:35,184
None of us believe
Zhenbang was the murderer.

2024
01:39:35,208 --> 01:39:37,333
There must be a loophole in what they saw.

2025
01:39:56,542 --> 01:39:57,958
Me, it's me.

2026
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:02,500
You didn't leave?

2027
01:40:03,292 --> 01:40:04,227
I did.

2028
01:40:04,251 --> 01:40:05,309
Almost.

2029
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:06,733
I thought you have a boat to catch.

2030
01:40:08,167 --> 01:40:09,351
That can wait a day.

2031
01:40:09,375 --> 01:40:10,500
Zhenbang's case can't.

2032
01:40:11,625 --> 01:40:12,708
Mr. Ching said

2033
01:40:13,333 --> 01:40:15,667
this whole thing might
just be a misdirection.

2034
01:40:15,792 --> 01:40:16,769
I was recreating the scene

2035
01:40:16,793 --> 01:40:18,893
where Zhenbang got shot in my mind.

2036
01:40:18,917 --> 01:40:20,143
I think

2037
01:40:20,167 --> 01:40:21,458
maybe it was all a trick.

2038
01:40:22,042 --> 01:40:22,935
I wonder if he is thinking

2039
01:40:22,959 --> 01:40:24,184
what we are thinking.

2040
01:40:24,208 --> 01:40:25,601
It was rather misty here in the afternoon.

2041
01:40:25,625 --> 01:40:26,809
The person everyone thought was Zhenbang

2042
01:40:26,833 --> 01:40:27,958
wasn't him at all,

2043
01:40:28,833 --> 01:40:30,768
just someone dressed like him.

2044
01:40:30,792 --> 01:40:32,309
When he saw Lance and the others coming,

2045
01:40:32,333 --> 01:40:33,500
he pretended to escape.

2046
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,476
Grant fired a shot.

2047
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:38,768
Where's that gunshot sound from?

2048
01:40:38,792 --> 01:40:39,792
That was my whistle.

2049
01:40:40,708 --> 01:40:41,708
Impressive.

2050
01:40:43,167 --> 01:40:44,167
<i>So,</i>

2051
01:40:44,292 --> 01:40:45,185
Grant

2052
01:40:45,209 --> 01:40:46,750
fired a blank shot.

2053
01:40:47,792 --> 01:40:48,809
The fake Zhenbang pretended to be shot,

2054
01:40:48,833 --> 01:40:49,393
fell into the water,

2055
01:40:49,417 --> 01:40:50,310
then he was switched out,

2056
01:40:50,334 --> 01:40:52,534
and the real Zhenbang's body
was floated to the surface.

2057
01:40:53,917 --> 01:40:54,917
<i>So,</i>

2058
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:56,768
there must be a hiding space

2059
01:40:56,792 --> 01:40:58,167
at the bottom of this pool.

2060
01:40:58,583 --> 01:40:59,351
<i>Gm,</i>

2061
01:40:59,375 --> 01:41:00,375
how good a swimmer...

2062
01:41:03,375 --> 01:41:04,375
So hasty.

2063
01:41:32,917 --> 01:41:33,583
So?

2064
01:41:33,833 --> 01:41:35,000
Someone could hide in there.

2065
01:41:39,042 --> 01:41:40,125
And I found this.

2066
01:41:42,125 --> 01:41:43,351
Looks familiar.

2067
01:41:43,375 --> 01:41:45,184
The Irish Union pin.

2068
01:41:45,208 --> 01:41:46,809
Our theory is plausible,

2069
01:41:46,833 --> 01:41:48,309
but we're still missing direct evidence.

2070
01:41:48,333 --> 01:41:49,060
Right now,

2071
01:41:49,084 --> 01:41:50,500
only one person can help us.

2072
01:41:53,917 --> 01:41:55,726
I studied medicine to save lives,

2073
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:56,750
out of benevolence.

2074
01:41:57,208 --> 01:41:58,809
Later, I realized that practicing medicine
can only save individuals,

2075
01:41:58,833 --> 01:42:00,059
but not the world.

2076
01:42:00,083 --> 01:42:01,601
That's why I joined
Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution.

2077
01:42:01,625 --> 01:42:02,394
Who knew

2078
01:42:02,418 --> 01:42:03,778
I'd be back on my old trade again.

2079
01:42:04,625 --> 01:42:06,018
I studied Chinese medicine because...

2080
01:42:06,042 --> 01:42:07,393
Enough chitchat, let's get started.

2081
01:42:07,417 --> 01:42:08,518
Still so hasty.

2082
01:42:08,542 --> 01:42:09,643
Bai Zhenbang,

2083
01:42:09,667 --> 01:42:10,560
if you're watching from above,

2084
01:42:10,584 --> 01:42:12,167
please show us some clues.

2085
01:42:21,208 --> 01:42:24,476
That the murders on the night
of August 10th behind Chinatown

2086
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:27,601
and on the night of August 15th
in the Chinese medicine shop

2087
01:42:27,625 --> 01:42:30,809
were in fact committed
by the same individual.

2088
01:42:30,833 --> 01:42:33,851
He was killed by our officers
at the scene of the crime yesterday.

2089
01:42:33,875 --> 01:42:35,518
His name was Bai Zhenbang,

2090
01:42:35,542 --> 01:42:36,917
a Chinese man.

2091
01:42:37,833 --> 01:42:39,208
Calm down,

2092
01:42:39,708 --> 01:42:41,083
Quiet.

2093
01:42:42,167 --> 01:42:42,769
<i>So,</i>

2094
01:42:42,793 --> 01:42:44,417
Bai was Jack the Ripper?

2095
01:42:44,917 --> 01:42:46,083
Of course not.

2096
01:42:52,042 --> 01:42:54,393
Our investigation has concluded.

2097
01:42:54,417 --> 01:42:55,310
Mr. Lance,

2098
01:42:55,334 --> 01:42:58,684
we have gathered new evidence
that contradicted your investigation.

2099
01:42:58,708 --> 01:43:00,601
I believe that public and journalists

2100
01:43:00,625 --> 01:43:02,208
would also like to know the truth.

2101
01:43:02,958 --> 01:43:06,684
How can you claim justice
and fairness in the American law

2102
01:43:06,708 --> 01:43:09,750
if you close such a
crucial case prematurely?

2103
01:43:10,292 --> 01:43:11,833
Today... the new witness.

2104
01:43:12,042 --> 01:43:13,184
A new witness?

2105
01:43:13,208 --> 01:43:13,851
Yes.

2106
01:43:13,875 --> 01:43:14,394
Who?

2107
01:43:14,418 --> 01:43:16,375
Please welcome our witness,

2108
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:18,583
Mr. Bai Zhenbang.

2109
01:43:18,917 --> 01:43:20,083
Bai Zhenbang?

2110
01:43:30,208 --> 01:43:31,643
Let them speak!

2111
01:43:31,667 --> 01:43:33,184
We all want to know what they have to say.

2112
01:43:33,208 --> 01:43:35,476
We don't just want the
police's side of the story.

2113
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:36,352
Exactly.

2114
01:43:36,376 --> 01:43:37,976
America is a free society.

2115
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,309
We could even hold a small press
conference on the side,

2116
01:43:40,333 --> 01:43:41,518
one led by the Chinese.

2117
01:43:41,542 --> 01:43:42,269
That's right!

2118
01:43:42,293 --> 01:43:43,851
You don't control what we publish.

2119
01:43:43,875 --> 01:43:45,018
Mr. Grant,

2120
01:43:45,042 --> 01:43:46,559
out of love for your daughter,

2121
01:43:46,583 --> 01:43:48,351
surely you can hear them out.

2122
01:43:48,375 --> 01:43:51,333
Let them speak!

2123
01:44:00,292 --> 01:44:01,500
Free country.

2124
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:03,435
Quiet.

2125
01:44:03,459 --> 01:44:05,250
Calm down, please

2126
01:44:07,042 --> 01:44:08,792
Alright, you have 10 minutes.

2127
01:44:09,375 --> 01:44:13,643
Given the recent horrifying
serial killings in Chinatown

2128
01:44:13,667 --> 01:44:15,684
and other malicious incidents,

2129
01:44:15,708 --> 01:44:16,352
SO...

2130
01:44:16,376 --> 01:44:18,684
today we will vote on the appropriation

2131
01:44:18,708 --> 01:44:24,601
of all Chinese-owned assets in Chinatown
to municipal ownership.

2132
01:44:24,625 --> 01:44:25,394
<i>Mr. Bah</i>

2133
01:44:25,418 --> 01:44:27,684
you have not brought a lawyer?

2134
01:44:27,708 --> 01:44:30,309
Because 95 percent
lawyers in America are white,

2135
01:44:30,333 --> 01:44:31,917
I choose to defend myself.

2136
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:34,000
Let's quickly review the case.

2137
01:44:35,375 --> 01:44:36,495
On the night of August 10th,

2138
01:44:36,750 --> 01:44:38,667
two victims were killed in Chinatown.

2139
01:44:39,167 --> 01:44:41,143
One was Mr. Grant's daughter, Alice,

2140
01:44:41,167 --> 01:44:43,184
and the other was the
Native American chief, Six Hands.

2141
01:44:43,208 --> 01:44:44,601
After the autopsy, we
discovered that the killer

2142
01:44:44,625 --> 01:44:46,583
demonstrated expertise
in the use of a scalpel.

2143
01:44:46,792 --> 01:44:47,809
On August 15th,

2144
01:44:47,833 --> 01:44:50,059
another victim popped up in Chinatown,

2145
01:44:50,083 --> 01:44:51,393
the female Chinese doctor, Lin Yue'e,

2146
01:44:51,417 --> 01:44:53,018
who was also disemboweled,

2147
01:44:53,042 --> 01:44:55,643
but the cut on her body was uneven,

2148
01:44:55,667 --> 01:44:58,559
just like Amanda's,
found at the silk factory yesterday.

2149
01:44:58,583 --> 01:44:59,519
From this, we can conclude

2150
01:44:59,543 --> 01:45:01,309
that your so-called Jack the Ripper

2151
01:45:01,333 --> 01:45:02,227
is actually two people.

2152
01:45:02,251 --> 01:45:04,042
Two different person.

2153
01:45:06,333 --> 01:45:09,518
So there was another murderer
in addition to Bai Zhenbang?

2154
01:45:09,542 --> 01:45:10,394
No.

2155
01:45:10,418 --> 01:45:11,601
In fact,

2156
01:45:11,625 --> 01:45:13,184
it could have been anyone

2157
01:45:13,208 --> 01:45:14,184
besides Bai Zhenbang.

2158
01:45:14,208 --> 01:45:15,185
What do you mean?

2159
01:45:15,209 --> 01:45:18,184
On the evening of August 10th,

2160
01:45:18,208 --> 01:45:19,518
Bai Zhenbang was with me,

2161
01:45:19,542 --> 01:45:22,101
and he had no opportunity
to commit the crime.

2162
01:45:22,125 --> 01:45:23,559
I can be his alibi.

2163
01:45:23,583 --> 01:45:25,125
We can prove.

2164
01:45:25,667 --> 01:45:26,352
How can we be sure

2165
01:45:26,376 --> 01:45:28,167
the testimonies of you
Chinese are credible?

2166
01:45:28,458 --> 01:45:29,559
But many witnessed Bai Zhenbang

2167
01:45:29,583 --> 01:45:31,684
committing murder before he was shot dead.

2168
01:45:31,708 --> 01:45:32,976
Alright,

2169
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,976
let's start with that case.

2170
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:35,810
Mr. Lance,

2171
01:45:35,834 --> 01:45:38,059
you led your team into
the silk factory yesterday,

2172
01:45:38,083 --> 01:45:40,559
and you happened to see
Bai Zhenbang committing murder.

2173
01:45:40,583 --> 01:45:41,643
Bai Zhenbang

2174
01:45:41,667 --> 01:45:42,792
You're surrounded

2175
01:45:43,583 --> 01:45:45,125
<i>Are you sure K's Bad Zhenbang'?</i>

2176
01:45:45,917 --> 01:45:48,393
Well, it's true that we
couldn't see clearly until...

2177
01:45:48,417 --> 01:45:50,059
Until Mr. Grant

2178
01:45:50,083 --> 01:45:51,083
shot him, right?

2179
01:45:53,917 --> 01:45:54,458
Yes.

2180
01:45:54,625 --> 01:45:55,394
But

2181
01:45:55,418 --> 01:45:57,958
what if Bai Zhenbang's body
had been hidden in the water

2182
01:45:58,292 --> 01:46:00,351
and the fake Bai Zhenbang swapped himself

2183
01:46:00,375 --> 01:46:02,559
with the real one after entering the water?

2184
01:46:02,583 --> 01:46:04,976
Like a magician's misdirection.

2185
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:09,434
We discovered an enclave in the pool
where someone could hide.

2186
01:46:09,458 --> 01:46:10,518
Mr. Thomas,

2187
01:46:10,542 --> 01:46:11,476
we just happened to

2188
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:12,352
find your union badge

2189
01:46:12,376 --> 01:46:13,667
at the bottom of the pool.

2190
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:15,310
It has

2191
01:46:15,334 --> 01:46:16,768
the initials of Thomas Lawrence on it.

2192
01:46:16,792 --> 01:46:17,851
I wonder what you were doing

2193
01:46:17,875 --> 01:46:19,292
in the pool at the silk factory.

2194
01:46:19,875 --> 01:46:20,875
Taking a bath?

2195
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:24,101
If I'm not misunderstanding,

2196
01:46:24,125 --> 01:46:26,143
are you suggesting that
Senator Grant colluded

2197
01:46:26,167 --> 01:46:27,809
with Mr. Lawrence to perform this illusion?

2198
01:46:27,833 --> 01:46:29,726
Whether it was a performance or not,

2199
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:30,768
Mr. Grant,

2200
01:46:30,792 --> 01:46:32,833
do you mind I use your gun for a moment?

2201
01:46:34,792 --> 01:46:36,208
Senator, please.

2202
01:46:42,333 --> 01:46:43,333
Thank you.

2203
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:45,643
Here's our second witness,

2204
01:46:45,667 --> 01:46:46,667
Piggy.

2205
01:46:49,833 --> 01:46:50,625
Mr. Lance,

2206
01:46:50,792 --> 01:46:52,851
what was the approximate distance

2207
01:46:52,875 --> 01:46:55,018
when Mr. Grant shot the suspect yesterday?

2208
01:46:55,042 --> 01:46:56,083
25 feet.

2209
01:46:56,708 --> 01:46:58,101
Depends on distance,

2210
01:46:58,125 --> 01:46:59,893
bullet wounds on an animal or a human

2211
01:46:59,917 --> 01:47:01,083
could be very different.

2212
01:47:02,042 --> 01:47:03,184
By looking at Bai Zhenbang's wound,

2213
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:04,934
we'll know who's lying.

2214
01:47:04,958 --> 01:47:06,976
There are clear burn marks on
Bai Zhenbang's body.

2215
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,393
He was shot by this gun.

2216
01:47:08,417 --> 01:47:10,684
But he was shot from point-blank range,

2217
01:47:10,708 --> 01:47:12,643
and the time of death
wasn't yesterday morning,

2218
01:47:12,667 --> 01:47:13,958
but the night before.

2219
01:47:20,167 --> 01:47:22,708
To seek more conclusive evidence,

2220
01:47:24,167 --> 01:47:27,101
I autopsy on Bai Zhenbang's body yesterday.

2221
01:47:27,125 --> 01:47:28,351
What did you find?

2222
01:47:28,375 --> 01:47:29,226
Clenched teeth,

2223
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:30,226
facial muscle spasms,

2224
01:47:30,250 --> 01:47:31,019
stiff limbs,

2225
01:47:31,043 --> 01:47:32,226
a twisted smile.

2226
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:33,559
<i>The liver mortis appears bright red,</i>

2227
01:47:33,583 --> 01:47:34,518
with blackened nose and fingertips.

2228
01:47:34,542 --> 01:47:35,269
Cold energy invaded,

2229
01:47:35,293 --> 01:47:36,393
keeping the yin energy inside

2230
01:47:36,417 --> 01:47:37,476
and the yang energy out.

2231
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:38,500
Could it be he was...

2232
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:40,417
I have a knife.

2233
01:47:40,583 --> 01:47:41,663
I have a bottle of vinegar.

2234
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:42,910
What do you need vinegar for?

2235
01:47:50,208 --> 01:47:51,568
His complexion appears gray-white.

2236
01:47:51,708 --> 01:47:52,833
He's froze to death.

2237
01:47:53,542 --> 01:47:54,750
Zhenbang would've been proud

2238
01:47:55,333 --> 01:47:58,309
seeing we combine Chinese learning
with Western methods.

2239
01:47:58,333 --> 01:48:01,542
I found his iliopsoas muscle was bleeding,

2240
01:48:02,083 --> 01:48:06,851
and there was focal bleeding
in the lungs and heart.

2241
01:48:06,875 --> 01:48:08,417
This indicates that

2242
01:48:09,375 --> 01:48:11,250
although he was shot,

2243
01:48:11,667 --> 01:48:13,917
he was not killed by the gunshot.

2244
01:48:14,625 --> 01:48:16,333
He was frozen to death.

2245
01:48:23,833 --> 01:48:24,727
In San Francisco,

2246
01:48:24,751 --> 01:48:26,750
there aren't many
buildings with ice cellars.

2247
01:48:27,375 --> 01:48:28,559
Mr. Grant,

2248
01:48:28,583 --> 01:48:30,063
you have one in your home, don't you?

2249
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,934
You fought in the Civil War,

2250
01:48:45,958 --> 01:48:46,976
serving as

2251
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:47,894
a military doctor.

2252
01:48:47,918 --> 01:48:49,268
Your daughter Alice,

2253
01:48:49,292 --> 01:48:52,726
it was you who cut open her chest,

2254
01:48:52,750 --> 01:48:53,750
wasn't it?

2255
01:48:53,875 --> 01:48:56,393
You are a liar.

2256
01:48:56,417 --> 01:48:58,226
These chinks had gone mad.

2257
01:48:58,250 --> 01:48:58,685
Insane.

2258
01:48:58,709 --> 01:48:59,976
As you all know,

2259
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,101
Mr. Grant is running for mayor.

2260
01:49:02,125 --> 01:49:02,935
His new policies include

2261
01:49:02,959 --> 01:49:04,768
making the Chinese Exclusion Act permanent,

2262
01:49:04,792 --> 01:49:06,059
shutting down Chinatown,

2263
01:49:06,083 --> 01:49:08,726
and banning any business or
individual from hiring Chinese.

2264
01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:11,059
These policies have won him votes,

2265
01:49:11,083 --> 01:49:13,768
especially the support of
the Union led by Thomas.

2266
01:49:13,792 --> 01:49:15,143
But what you might not know is,

2267
01:49:15,167 --> 01:49:17,167
his daughter Alice's
boyfriend was a Chinese man.

2268
01:49:17,958 --> 01:49:19,375
And that man

2269
01:49:19,625 --> 01:49:21,042
was none other than Bai Zhenbang.

2270
01:49:24,375 --> 01:49:25,684
<i>Mr. Bah</i>

2271
01:49:25,708 --> 01:49:28,101
do Chinese people eat offal?

2272
01:49:28,125 --> 01:49:29,184
Yes, we do.

2273
01:49:29,208 --> 01:49:32,559
Internal organs of animals are filthy,

2274
01:49:32,583 --> 01:49:37,309
and such filth exemplifies the
dirtiness of Chinese people.

2275
01:49:37,333 --> 01:49:42,393
Could this eating habits contribute
to the spread of potential diseases?

2276
01:49:42,417 --> 01:49:43,417
Senator,

2277
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:45,559
as far as I know,

2278
01:49:45,583 --> 01:49:48,417
many Europeans also eat animal organs.

2279
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:50,708
Many people here,

2280
01:49:52,042 --> 01:49:52,810
here,

2281
01:49:52,834 --> 01:49:55,309
are of European origin.

2282
01:49:55,333 --> 01:49:56,917
Are they spreading diseases?

2283
01:49:58,625 --> 01:49:59,560
<i>Mr. Bah</i>

2284
01:49:59,584 --> 01:50:01,268
you are only to answer the questions,

2285
01:50:01,292 --> 01:50:03,708
you are not permitted to ask any.

2286
01:50:04,792 --> 01:50:08,309
Does your company engage in activities
that violate U.S. law?

2287
01:50:08,333 --> 01:50:09,144
No.

2288
01:50:09,168 --> 01:50:13,143
Has your silk factory been
harboring Chinese laborers?

2289
01:50:13,167 --> 01:50:14,144
Yes.

2290
01:50:14,168 --> 01:50:15,393
Are you aware

2291
01:50:15,417 --> 01:50:17,476
that this violates U.S. law?

2292
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:20,768
Because they are Chinese workers
brought to here as coolies.

2293
01:50:20,792 --> 01:50:23,309
I didn't ask you for an explanation.

2294
01:50:23,333 --> 01:50:25,726
You do not need to explain.

2295
01:50:25,750 --> 01:50:29,226
Are you maintaining a gang of
enforcers in Chinatown?

2296
01:50:29,250 --> 01:50:30,809
Senator,

2297
01:50:30,833 --> 01:50:33,726
the Chinese Exclusion Act
makes life very difficult

2298
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:35,601
for all Chinese in America.

2299
01:50:35,625 --> 01:50:38,476
Sometimes we can't
even get police protection.

2300
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:41,292
How should we defend ourselves
against the bad people?

2301
01:50:41,792 --> 01:50:44,018
Will this town become another Rock Springs?

2302
01:50:44,042 --> 01:50:46,101
Just answer the question,

2303
01:50:46,125 --> 01:50:48,583
are you keeping a gang of enforcers?

2304
01:50:51,333 --> 01:50:52,333
Yes.

2305
01:50:55,417 --> 01:50:57,101
This is a letter

2306
01:50:57,125 --> 01:50:58,768
Alice wrote to Bai Zhenbang,

2307
01:50:58,792 --> 01:51:02,059
who wasn't planning to escape on
the morning of the 11th.

2308
01:51:02,083 --> 01:51:06,601
They were to elope to England together
at dawn on the 11th.

2309
01:51:06,625 --> 01:51:09,101
We also have these two boat tickets,

2310
01:51:09,125 --> 01:51:12,351
which we found on Bai Zhenbang
and Alice's bodies.

2311
01:51:12,375 --> 01:51:13,643
Now, let's talk about what
everyone is eager to know,

2312
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:15,643
Jack the Ripper.

2313
01:51:15,667 --> 01:51:17,434
The one thing that confused
us the most before was

2314
01:51:17,458 --> 01:51:19,393
why the killer would impersonate him,

2315
01:51:19,417 --> 01:51:21,292
removing the victims' intestines.

2316
01:51:21,958 --> 01:51:24,518
Until we went to the home
of the second victim, Lin Yue'e.

2317
01:51:24,542 --> 01:51:25,542
Her clinic

2318
01:51:25,958 --> 01:51:27,809
was where Alice and Bai Zhenbang
would meet in secret.

2319
01:51:27,833 --> 01:51:29,473
Don't you want justice for your daughter?

2320
01:51:31,458 --> 01:51:33,434
She did tell me that

2321
01:51:33,458 --> 01:51:36,101
she was pretty close

2322
01:51:36,125 --> 01:51:37,583
to Young Master Bai and Miss Alice.

2323
01:51:41,542 --> 01:51:43,434
But one day,

2324
01:51:43,458 --> 01:51:45,042
they were seen

2325
01:51:45,583 --> 01:51:46,583
by Mr. Grant.

2326
01:51:55,542 --> 01:51:56,934
Father, no.

2327
01:51:56,958 --> 01:51:59,208
Please, I'm begging you, father.

2328
01:51:59,458 --> 01:52:00,898
And the true reason Alice was killed

2329
01:52:01,292 --> 01:52:02,667
was because she was pregnant

2330
01:52:03,250 --> 01:52:04,458
with Bai Zhenbang's child.

2331
01:52:07,042 --> 01:52:08,792
After discovering her pregnancy,

2332
01:52:09,292 --> 01:52:10,601
Alice decided to elope with Bai Zhenbang

2333
01:52:10,625 --> 01:52:11,809
on the morning of the 11th.

2334
01:52:11,833 --> 01:52:13,375
But just as she was about to leave...

2335
01:52:15,083 --> 01:52:16,083
You...

2336
01:52:16,292 --> 01:52:18,375
pushed her down the stairs to her death.

2337
01:52:24,417 --> 01:52:26,208
These blood-stained wood shavings

2338
01:52:26,708 --> 01:52:28,500
were found in Alice's hair,

2339
01:52:29,292 --> 01:52:31,309
and they are a perfect
match to the broken railing

2340
01:52:31,333 --> 01:52:32,333
in Mr. Grant's home.

2341
01:52:32,917 --> 01:52:34,542
This is the true cause of Alice's death.

2342
01:52:35,333 --> 01:52:36,333
Also,

2343
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:37,684
we found some human tissue

2344
01:52:37,708 --> 01:52:39,083
under Alice's fingernails,

2345
01:52:39,542 --> 01:52:41,792
from when she fought against her killer.

2346
01:52:43,708 --> 01:52:44,708
Mr. Grant,

2347
01:52:45,042 --> 01:52:47,002
I'm guessing there's a
scratch on your left hand.

2348
01:52:47,083 --> 01:52:48,250
Never touch a white man.

2349
01:52:50,625 --> 01:52:51,958
Never touch a white man.

2350
01:53:01,042 --> 01:53:03,101
You used Jack the Ripper's name

2351
01:53:03,125 --> 01:53:05,143
to increase public attention on this case,

2352
01:53:05,167 --> 01:53:06,833
then you blamed the Chinese,

2353
01:53:07,167 --> 01:53:08,309
which earned you quite a few votes.

2354
01:53:08,333 --> 01:53:10,893
More importantly, it covered up
the fact that Alice was pregnant.

2355
01:53:11,833 --> 01:53:13,792
And Bai Zhenbang, until
his death, never knew

2356
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:16,500
that Alice

2357
01:53:17,417 --> 01:53:18,583
was carrying his child.

2358
01:53:27,167 --> 01:53:28,167
He knew.

2359
01:53:29,792 --> 01:53:31,226
He even dared to confront me!

2360
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:33,333
The goddamn little yellow monkey.

2361
01:53:33,750 --> 01:53:35,458
He asked me if I killed my own daughter!

2362
01:53:36,583 --> 01:53:37,667
Did you

2363
01:53:38,667 --> 01:53:40,000
kill your daughter?

2364
01:53:40,708 --> 01:53:41,708
Did you?

2365
01:53:46,583 --> 01:53:47,708
Tell me!

2366
01:53:50,417 --> 01:53:52,250
Everything is because of you.

2367
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,083
You ruined her.

2368
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:00,708
You ruined me.

2369
01:54:01,583 --> 01:54:02,583
You killed her.

2370
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:06,208
Alice is dead.

2371
01:54:13,833 --> 01:54:14,833
So am I.

2372
01:54:21,042 --> 01:54:25,042
She was carrying your
bastard son inside her.

2373
01:54:27,958 --> 01:54:28,958
What?

2374
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:31,542
It was unforgivable. She had to die!

2375
01:54:32,458 --> 01:54:34,018
You fucking animal.

2376
01:54:34,042 --> 01:54:35,042
I'm gonna kill you.

2377
01:54:41,042 --> 01:54:43,000
I shot Bai Zhenbang,

2378
01:54:43,667 --> 01:54:45,292
but Alice was an accident.

2379
01:54:46,458 --> 01:54:47,708
It was just an accident.

2380
01:54:48,125 --> 01:54:48,917
Alice,

2381
01:54:49,125 --> 01:54:52,268
you are not running away with
some Chinaman and you are not

2382
01:54:52,292 --> 01:54:53,726
disrespecting your father.

2383
01:54:53,750 --> 01:54:54,559
Do you understand?

2384
01:54:54,583 --> 01:54:55,250
No.

2385
01:54:55,458 --> 01:54:56,185
Stop this.

2386
01:54:56,209 --> 01:54:57,601
- Stop this right now.
- I love him.

2387
01:54:57,625 --> 01:54:59,000
I love him, father.

2388
01:54:59,167 --> 01:55:00,559
I have to go with him.

2389
01:55:00,583 --> 01:55:03,226
We're going to England.

2390
01:55:03,250 --> 01:55:04,601
You are not going to the England.

2391
01:55:04,625 --> 01:55:05,976
There's an election coming up

2392
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,226
and you're going to do...

2393
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:09,684
You are not going to
disrespect your family.

2394
01:55:09,708 --> 01:55:11,976
To hell with the Chinese Exclusion Act!

2395
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:12,644
Alice!

2396
01:55:12,668 --> 01:55:14,792
I have to go with him!

2397
01:55:15,625 --> 01:55:18,375
Because I'm pregnant with his child!

2398
01:55:20,667 --> 01:55:21,667
What did you say?

2399
01:55:22,125 --> 01:55:23,500
What did you just say to me?

2400
01:55:24,042 --> 01:55:25,809
You said you are pregnant

2401
01:55:25,833 --> 01:55:28,583
with the Chinaman's son or daughter?

2402
01:55:29,083 --> 01:55:30,250
You ruined me.

2403
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,833
You moved Alice's body to Chinatown,

2404
01:55:52,417 --> 01:55:54,497
when Six Hands,
who was there to trade furs, saw you.

2405
01:55:56,125 --> 01:55:57,792
So, he became the second victim.

2406
01:55:58,042 --> 01:55:59,792
To make sure no one finds out what you did,

2407
01:56:00,250 --> 01:56:02,000
you had to silence the witnesses.

2408
01:56:02,458 --> 01:56:04,226
The first was Lin Yue'e, the Chinese doctor

2409
01:56:04,250 --> 01:56:05,667
who knew about Alice's pregnancy.

2410
01:56:07,583 --> 01:56:09,268
And then, the person who knew everything,

2411
01:56:09,292 --> 01:56:10,958
the maid, Amanda.

2412
01:56:11,625 --> 01:56:13,083
But the latter two were your doing,

2413
01:56:13,750 --> 01:56:15,167
weren't they, Mr. Thomas?

2414
01:56:16,125 --> 01:56:17,143
Your knife skills are clearly

2415
01:56:17,167 --> 01:56:19,417
not as practiced as Dr. Grant's.

2416
01:56:28,333 --> 01:56:29,542
Bai Zhenbang.

2417
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:42,809
Don't let them do this. I'm not going down,

2418
01:56:42,833 --> 01:56:43,394
Mr. Grant.

2419
01:56:43,418 --> 01:56:44,601
Come on, please

2420
01:56:44,625 --> 01:56:45,602
For god's...

2421
01:56:45,626 --> 01:56:47,417
sake, man! Don't grovel.

2422
01:56:47,917 --> 01:56:49,542
If we're beaten, we're beaten.

2423
01:56:52,125 --> 01:56:53,805
We can't let these Chinks look down on us!

2424
01:57:02,333 --> 01:57:03,333
We found this.

2425
01:57:06,125 --> 01:57:08,042
Going somewhere, Bai Zhenbang?

2426
01:57:11,333 --> 01:57:12,583
Did you call for us?

2427
01:57:16,625 --> 01:57:18,768
These are the autopsy reports for Alice,

2428
01:57:18,792 --> 01:57:20,917
Lin Yue'e, and Amanda.

2429
01:57:21,125 --> 01:57:22,125
Also,

2430
01:57:22,958 --> 01:57:25,208
here is the piece of
evidence you want the most.

2431
01:57:25,542 --> 01:57:26,934
Why help us?

2432
01:57:26,958 --> 01:57:28,101
I'm not helping anyone,

2433
01:57:28,125 --> 01:57:30,500
I just want to uphold
the justice of the law.

2434
01:57:40,125 --> 01:57:42,768
Let's start with Mr. Chairman's
clean white shirt.

2435
01:57:42,792 --> 01:57:43,792
Last night,

2436
01:57:43,958 --> 01:57:44,935
Ms. Yun from Chinatown

2437
01:57:44,959 --> 01:57:47,268
was waiting outside your house
to pick up the shirt.

2438
01:57:47,292 --> 01:57:49,833
It's dirty with red wine at the party.

2439
01:57:50,542 --> 01:57:51,542
Before morning,

2440
01:57:51,875 --> 01:57:53,458
the vegetable seller A-Qiang

2441
01:57:53,667 --> 01:57:55,417
sent fresh products to your maid.

2442
01:57:55,750 --> 01:57:58,976
That's how you got a wonderful
breakfast today before you come here.

2443
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Look,

2444
01:58:00,167 --> 01:58:01,559
I don't understand, Mr. Bai.

2445
01:58:01,583 --> 01:58:03,934
What are you getting
at with all these stories?

2446
01:58:03,958 --> 01:58:05,684
If you don't understand,

2447
01:58:05,708 --> 01:58:06,750
I make it simple.

2448
01:58:08,958 --> 01:58:10,833
How did everyone get here?

2449
01:58:12,583 --> 01:58:14,833
Who built this transcontinental railway,

2450
01:58:14,958 --> 01:58:17,833
one hammer strike at a time?

2451
01:58:19,542 --> 01:58:23,934
The Chinese took the hardest
and the most dangerous jobs.

2452
01:58:23,958 --> 01:58:28,226
One out of every ten of our
people died while building

2453
01:58:28,250 --> 01:58:33,559
seventy percent of the first
transcontinental railroad in America.

2454
01:58:33,583 --> 01:58:38,393
They say there was a Chinese worker
under every railroad tie.

2455
01:58:38,417 --> 01:58:41,518
This isn't exaggeration,

2456
01:58:41,542 --> 01:58:42,750
it's true.

2457
01:58:56,542 --> 01:58:57,351
Ghost,

2458
01:58:57,375 --> 01:58:58,375
tomorrow morning,

2459
01:58:58,417 --> 01:58:59,684
go to Grant's house

2460
01:58:59,708 --> 01:59:01,059
and get something for me.

2461
01:59:01,083 --> 01:59:01,852
What?

2462
01:59:01,876 --> 01:59:03,167
I know who you are.

2463
01:59:03,708 --> 01:59:05,333
I knew from the moment I first saw you.

2464
01:59:23,292 --> 01:59:24,292
Go!

2465
01:59:31,042 --> 01:59:32,042
Those two

2466
01:59:32,333 --> 01:59:33,375
and myself,

2467
01:59:34,292 --> 01:59:37,083
are the only survivors in that accident.

2468
01:59:40,083 --> 01:59:41,250
My brother,

2469
01:59:41,625 --> 01:59:42,893
Lao Si,

2470
01:59:42,917 --> 01:59:44,000
lost his arm.

2471
01:59:45,792 --> 01:59:47,476
This young man, Ah Gui,

2472
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:49,708
lost his parents.

2473
01:59:54,250 --> 01:59:55,643
What about this photo
makes you so emotional?

2474
01:59:55,667 --> 01:59:56,667
I don't see it.

2475
01:59:57,083 --> 01:59:59,583
But, in that most famous group photo,

2476
02:00:00,250 --> 02:00:02,542
why is there not a single Chinese?

2477
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:05,833
Are we not worthy?

2478
02:00:09,375 --> 02:00:10,375
Gentlemen,

2479
02:00:10,875 --> 02:00:12,833
I ask you to look at the marble floor,

2480
02:00:13,458 --> 02:00:14,458
the chairs,

2481
02:00:14,625 --> 02:00:15,625
the tables,

2482
02:00:15,833 --> 02:00:17,208
and the beautiful ceiling.

2483
02:00:18,333 --> 02:00:21,792
None of those would exist
without a hand of Chinese,

2484
02:00:21,833 --> 02:00:24,226
who have been suffered

2485
02:00:24,250 --> 02:00:25,583
by your arrogance

2486
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,292
prejudice

2487
02:00:27,333 --> 02:00:28,917
and discrimination.

2488
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,542
At this moment,

2489
02:00:33,583 --> 02:00:35,083
my only son,

2490
02:00:35,542 --> 02:00:37,500
fleshed outside his home.

2491
02:00:38,958 --> 02:00:40,875
He was born in America.

2492
02:00:42,042 --> 02:00:43,958
We, father and son,

2493
02:00:44,208 --> 02:00:48,042
have given our years,
lives, to this country.

2494
02:00:48,208 --> 02:00:51,167
And what have we got in return?

2495
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:56,083
We got a Chinese Exclusion Act,

2496
02:00:56,458 --> 02:01:00,458
which was enacted
without asking any Chinese.

2497
02:01:02,875 --> 02:01:04,750
You call us "rats in the hole,"

2498
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:07,583
but I believe that everyone here

2499
02:01:08,042 --> 02:01:11,625
benefits from the lab our of these rats.

2500
02:01:11,792 --> 02:01:13,143
Whether it's your food

2501
02:01:13,167 --> 02:01:13,768
clothes,

2502
02:01:13,792 --> 02:01:14,435
houses,

2503
02:01:14,459 --> 02:01:16,125
even your transportation.

2504
02:01:17,667 --> 02:01:18,667
In this land,

2505
02:01:19,542 --> 02:01:21,292
in the eyes of natives,

2506
02:01:23,417 --> 02:01:24,500
we are all

2507
02:01:24,708 --> 02:01:26,292
outsiders.

2508
02:01:31,042 --> 02:01:32,833
All men are created equal,

2509
02:01:33,417 --> 02:01:36,833
that is the spirit of
American independence,

2510
02:01:37,917 --> 02:01:40,875
the very foundation of this nation.

2511
02:01:42,500 --> 02:01:43,500
Gentlemen,

2512
02:01:44,208 --> 02:01:45,958
I have the last question for you.

2513
02:01:47,417 --> 02:01:50,625
Where is equality?

2514
02:02:10,042 --> 02:02:12,851
The vote on whether to
appropriate Chinatown

2515
02:02:12,875 --> 02:02:15,667
as municipal property results in.

2516
02:02:16,292 --> 02:02:18,851
We have 125 in favor

2517
02:02:18,875 --> 02:02:21,500
and 217 against,

2518
02:02:22,333 --> 02:02:25,226
the decision takes effect immediately.

2519
02:02:25,250 --> 02:02:28,917
Although Chinatown has
not been appropriated,

2520
02:02:29,333 --> 02:02:31,893
due to the evident
criminal gang affiliations

2521
02:02:31,917 --> 02:02:33,708
of Hip Sing Tong,

2522
02:02:34,417 --> 02:02:37,059
all properties registered under its name

2523
02:02:37,083 --> 02:02:40,417
shall be seized by City Hall.

2524
02:03:07,667 --> 02:03:09,476
Ladies and gentlemen,

2525
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:12,559
please welcome San Francisco's new mayor,

2526
02:03:12,583 --> 02:03:14,792
George William!

2527
02:03:22,750 --> 02:03:24,101
Ladies and gentlemen,

2528
02:03:24,125 --> 02:03:27,726
as Mayor William is delivering
his inaugural speech,

2529
02:03:27,750 --> 02:03:29,226
let us make a toast

2530
02:03:29,250 --> 02:03:32,601
to a successful campaign
by the Democratic Party,

2531
02:03:32,625 --> 02:03:36,625
and to a brighter future for San Francisco!

2532
02:03:37,042 --> 02:03:38,958
Cheers!

2533
02:03:41,125 --> 02:03:42,268
Bruce, old boy,

2534
02:03:42,292 --> 02:03:44,393
don't take the Republican loss to heart.

2535
02:03:44,417 --> 02:03:46,059
You know it's rare for our two parties

2536
02:03:46,083 --> 02:03:49,018
to agree on something
like Chinese Exclusion.

2537
02:03:49,042 --> 02:03:50,601
Let me get this straight.

2538
02:03:50,625 --> 02:03:51,519
You mean

2539
02:03:51,543 --> 02:03:54,792
that we should be
thankful to those Chinese?

2540
02:04:03,375 --> 02:04:04,768
Ladies and gentlemen,

2541
02:04:04,792 --> 02:04:05,727
If you'll excuse me.

2542
02:04:05,751 --> 02:04:07,375
I shan't be but a moment.

2543
02:04:11,083 --> 02:04:12,083
Louis,

2544
02:04:13,208 --> 02:04:14,583
my old friend.

2545
02:04:15,750 --> 02:04:17,434
I have a house full of guests.

2546
02:04:17,458 --> 02:04:19,018
Please forgive me for not inviting you in.

2547
02:04:19,042 --> 02:04:20,042
No need for formalities.

2548
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:21,833
I came to say goodbye.

2549
02:04:22,458 --> 02:04:23,559
About Zhenbang,

2550
02:04:23,583 --> 02:04:25,167
I'm truly sorry.

2551
02:04:25,625 --> 02:04:27,185
It was all part of you plan, wasn't it?

2552
02:04:27,333 --> 02:04:28,333
What?

2553
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:29,351
Grant

2554
02:04:29,375 --> 02:04:30,375
could never come up with

2555
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,226
an idea using Jack the Ripper

2556
02:04:33,250 --> 02:04:34,250
to frame Zhenbang.

2557
02:04:34,458 --> 02:04:37,476
Nor would he know so much
about the silk factory

2558
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:40,434
to create a misdirection
using its environment.

2559
02:04:40,458 --> 02:04:41,976
It must have been someone who knows

2560
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,434
how to manipulate public opinion

2561
02:04:43,458 --> 02:04:45,667
and is an expert in magic tricks.

2562
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:49,684
Mr. Bai and Mr. Weyman...

2563
02:04:49,708 --> 02:04:51,226
are my loyal fans,

2564
02:04:51,250 --> 02:04:52,250
and experts in magic.

2565
02:04:58,625 --> 02:05:01,393
I told Lance to hand you the key evidence

2566
02:05:01,417 --> 02:05:02,893
not to help you

2567
02:05:02,917 --> 02:05:04,083
but because I realized

2568
02:05:04,667 --> 02:05:07,125
that if Grant, a Democrat, wins,

2569
02:05:07,333 --> 02:05:08,684
his policies

2570
02:05:08,708 --> 02:05:12,125
would prohibit any business
from hiring Chinese laborers.

2571
02:05:12,458 --> 02:05:12,935
<i>So,</i>

2572
02:05:12,959 --> 02:05:14,458
he had to be removed.

2573
02:05:14,625 --> 02:05:16,917
To secure a win for William,
the Republican candidate.

2574
02:05:17,917 --> 02:05:18,602
At the same time,

2575
02:05:18,626 --> 02:05:20,586
you had to deal with the
mortal enemy of capital,

2576
02:05:20,750 --> 02:05:21,750
the union.

2577
02:05:21,958 --> 02:05:23,559
Only by wining the union over

2578
02:05:23,583 --> 02:05:27,542
can you legally employ
Chinese laborers long-term.

2579
02:05:30,042 --> 02:05:31,042
Louis,

2580
02:05:31,250 --> 02:05:33,583
you're indeed worthy of being my friend.

2581
02:05:35,917 --> 02:05:38,143
In fact, that day, I was going to

2582
02:05:38,167 --> 02:05:40,434
talk him into changing
his campaign strategy.

2583
02:05:40,458 --> 02:05:44,101
I am committed to my policy of
shutting down Chinatown

2584
02:05:44,125 --> 02:05:45,768
and the public opinion is with us.

2585
02:05:45,792 --> 02:05:46,792
Sir.

2586
02:05:49,125 --> 02:05:50,125
Excuse me.

2587
02:06:08,125 --> 02:06:10,268
There must be something else.

2588
02:06:10,292 --> 02:06:11,458
Your silk factory,

2589
02:06:12,208 --> 02:06:14,417
I need that land.

2590
02:06:15,542 --> 02:06:18,417
But for the livelihood
of your fellow Chinese,

2591
02:06:18,875 --> 02:06:20,458
you would never give it up.

2592
02:06:21,542 --> 02:06:23,750
Now all my assets have been confiscated.

2593
02:06:24,625 --> 02:06:27,333
And the land is yours already.

2594
02:06:27,792 --> 02:06:30,125
You gave me the deed willingly.

2595
02:06:30,667 --> 02:06:33,500
This world operates by two rules only.

2596
02:06:34,917 --> 02:06:36,792
Power controls everything,

2597
02:06:37,292 --> 02:06:38,917
or money controls power.

2598
02:06:39,667 --> 02:06:40,917
We are the latter.

2599
02:06:41,417 --> 02:06:42,559
Understood.

2600
02:06:42,583 --> 02:06:43,917
Old friend,

2601
02:06:44,625 --> 02:06:45,708
see yourself out.

2602
02:06:47,417 --> 02:06:49,708
We have an old saying in Chinese.

2603
02:06:50,417 --> 02:06:51,976
Times change,

2604
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,393
fortune rises and falls.

2605
02:06:53,417 --> 02:06:55,143
What is on top today

2606
02:06:55,167 --> 02:06:56,833
may be at the bottom tomorrow.

2607
02:06:57,958 --> 02:06:59,750
We will meet again.

2608
02:08:04,083 --> 02:08:05,083
Ghost,

2609
02:08:05,250 --> 02:08:06,958
you look just like your father.

2610
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,059
If he could see

2611
02:08:09,083 --> 02:08:10,542
what you've become,

2612
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:12,684
he would smile from beyond.

2613
02:08:12,708 --> 02:08:14,188
Too bad fate wasn't that kind to him.

2614
02:08:16,333 --> 02:08:18,133
Don't let your emotions
cloud your judgement.

2615
02:08:21,500 --> 02:08:22,726
There's so much

2616
02:08:22,750 --> 02:08:25,601
we can learn from this place.

2617
02:08:25,625 --> 02:08:27,143
Study your opponent's strength

2618
02:08:27,167 --> 02:08:28,726
before going into battle.

2619
02:08:28,750 --> 02:08:29,726
Godfather,

2620
02:08:29,750 --> 02:08:30,750
I understand it now.

2621
02:08:32,250 --> 02:08:33,690
Fallen leaves return to their roots.

2622
02:08:33,958 --> 02:08:36,792
Zhenbang and I are going
back home, to Canton.

2623
02:08:37,458 --> 02:08:39,458
He's never been there.

2624
02:08:43,667 --> 02:08:44,958
Take care.

2625
02:08:49,458 --> 02:08:50,476
Take care, Godfather.

2626
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:51,500
Take care, Master Bai.

2627
02:08:53,375 --> 02:08:54,375
Kid,

2628
02:08:54,792 --> 02:08:55,792
sing us a song.

2629
02:08:56,083 --> 02:08:57,083
Kid,

2630
02:08:57,792 --> 02:08:58,792
sing us a song.

2631
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:32,740
Now that my Godfather has left,

2632
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:34,643
I have two plans in mind.

2633
02:09:34,667 --> 02:09:35,667
Help me choose one.

2634
02:09:36,250 --> 02:09:36,893
Go ahead.

2635
02:09:36,917 --> 02:09:37,500
<i>A,</i>

2636
02:09:37,667 --> 02:09:38,893
We work as a team, Detective Chinatown.

2637
02:09:38,917 --> 02:09:39,917
I choose B.

2638
02:09:39,958 --> 02:09:40,958
And B,

2639
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:41,559
go back and marry the princess,

2640
02:09:41,583 --> 02:09:42,394
become a prince of your tribe.

2641
02:09:42,418 --> 02:09:43,625
I'll go with Plan A then.

2642
02:09:45,792 --> 02:09:46,458
<i>Gui</i>

2643
02:09:46,667 --> 02:09:47,519
Ghost.

2644
02:09:47,543 --> 02:09:48,893
What's your last name?

2645
02:09:48,917 --> 02:09:50,333
I forgot to ask Master Bai earlier.

2646
02:09:50,625 --> 02:09:52,265
From now on, your last name will be Tang.

2647
02:09:52,292 --> 02:09:53,292
Why Tang?

2648
02:09:53,625 --> 02:09:55,792
So your children will
know where you came from,

2649
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:57,400
and where this Chinatown came from.

2650
02:09:57,708 --> 02:09:59,667
So, I'll be Ghost Tang?

2651
02:10:00,042 --> 02:10:00,976
It's Gui Tang.

2652
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:01,934
Fu means fortune and Gui means wealth.

2653
02:10:01,958 --> 02:10:02,809
We wish you super duper rich!

2654
02:10:02,833 --> 02:10:03,601
King-of-the-world rich!

2655
02:10:03,625 --> 02:10:04,394
God of wealth rich!

2656
02:10:04,418 --> 02:10:05,643
Rich and lucky!

2657
02:10:05,667 --> 02:10:06,560
Happy New Year!

2658
02:10:06,584 --> 02:10:07,667
I hope you get rich!

2659
02:10:41,708 --> 02:10:42,708
Mr. Ching,

2660
02:10:43,750 --> 02:10:44,893
what's this?

2661
02:10:44,917 --> 02:10:46,018
This?

2662
02:10:46,042 --> 02:10:47,375
It's called a camera.

2663
02:10:47,875 --> 02:10:49,351
For making movies.

2664
02:10:49,375 --> 02:10:51,559
What's a movie?

2665
02:10:51,583 --> 02:10:53,976
Movies are the best thing ever.

2666
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:55,476
But I worry that this thing

2667
02:10:55,500 --> 02:10:57,768
might someday put magicians like myself

2668
02:10:57,792 --> 02:10:59,018
out of business.

2669
02:10:59,042 --> 02:11:00,042
Mr. Ching,

2670
02:11:00,583 --> 02:11:02,226
I hope to see your performance again soon.

2671
02:11:02,250 --> 02:11:04,500
At least I didn't lose the bet.

2672
02:11:04,750 --> 02:11:05,833
I sure will

2673
02:11:06,125 --> 02:11:07,708
have the courage to come back one day.

2674
02:11:08,167 --> 02:11:10,059
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

2675
02:11:10,083 --> 02:11:13,101
Farewell.

2676
02:11:13,125 --> 02:11:14,684
- Farewell, Shiliang.
- Farewell.

2677
02:11:14,708 --> 02:11:15,750
Farewell.

2678
02:11:17,667 --> 02:11:18,917
What exactly is a revolution?

2679
02:11:19,958 --> 02:11:20,958
It's something

2680
02:11:21,875 --> 02:11:23,250
that will make China better.

2681
02:11:24,542 --> 02:11:25,809
If things were better there,

2682
02:11:25,833 --> 02:11:27,083
who would come here?

2683
02:11:29,125 --> 02:11:29,750
Mr. Ching,

2684
02:11:30,125 --> 02:11:31,833
thank you for waiting another day.

2685
02:11:35,042 --> 02:11:36,250
Look at this country.

2686
02:11:37,125 --> 02:11:38,559
Their magic is cars,

2687
02:11:38,583 --> 02:11:39,269
movies,

2688
02:11:39,293 --> 02:11:40,518
skyscrapers,

2689
02:11:40,542 --> 02:11:41,958
railways, and steamboats,

2690
02:11:42,292 --> 02:11:45,083
whereas mine is merely for entertainment.

2691
02:11:46,458 --> 02:11:48,292
So, what I can't accomplish,

2692
02:11:48,917 --> 02:11:50,375
I hope you all can.

2693
02:11:51,833 --> 02:11:54,684
Can a few hundred guns on this ship

2694
02:11:54,708 --> 02:11:55,917
really save China?

2695
02:11:56,875 --> 02:11:57,893
If hundreds aren't enough,

2696
02:11:57,917 --> 02:11:59,000
then I'll bring thousands.

2697
02:11:59,542 --> 02:12:00,601
And if those still aren't enough

2698
02:12:00,625 --> 02:12:01,985
then I'll bring tens of thousands.

2699
02:12:02,625 --> 02:12:03,893
Despite endless trials and tribulations,

2700
02:12:03,917 --> 02:12:05,083
our nation still stands,

2701
02:12:05,792 --> 02:12:07,768
it's all because our people

2702
02:12:07,792 --> 02:12:09,500
gave their lives for bigger things.

2703
02:12:10,708 --> 02:12:12,333
I believe that one day

2704
02:12:12,875 --> 02:12:15,458
we will be the most powerful country.

2705
02:12:18,667 --> 02:12:19,667
Yes,

2706
02:12:20,417 --> 02:12:22,042
and that will be

2707
02:12:22,625 --> 02:12:24,545
the greatest magic trick
the world has ever seen.
