00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,870
"Under the Crescent Moon"

2
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,459
Hey, Abby! Where are you going?

3
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,211
Ah! I'm on my way to the Masjid!

4
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,504
Come here, then. I'll give a ride.

5
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,922
It's okay, I'll just take a tricycle.

6
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,841
Just come already. Stop being picky.

7
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:25,919
Abby.

8
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,088
I'll wait for you here
until you're done, Abby.

9
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,048
Alright, but this might take a while?

10
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,133
It's okay, then let's have lunch together.

11
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,097
Allah is great!

12
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,192
Allah is great!

13
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,448
Allah is great!

14
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,131
Peace to you.

15
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:57,343
Peace to you.

16
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,149
Ama, I'll go ahead
I still have my classes.

17
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,092
Abdul.

18
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,011
Ama.

19
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,180
Go straight to school,

20
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,848
and make sure to come home right after.

21
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,847
Was your father angry?

22
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,601
Huh? No. That's just the way he talks.

23
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:33,648
Don't you think he's angry
because you wore school uniform while praying?

24
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:40,488
No, no, what's important for us
is to be in clean clothes and hide the awrat.

25
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,198
Awrat?

26
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,662
Body parts that aren't allowed
to be seen inside the Masjid.

27
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,337
Wait, Abby.
You have something on your face.

28
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:58,798
Thanks.

29
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,134
Let's get going,
we might be late again for our class.

30
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,732
Are you done with your assignment?

31
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,486
Assignment?

32
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,697
Oh yes! I forgot. I'll do it later.

33
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:41,758
A common noun is the generic
and non-specific name of a person, thing, animal, or place.

34
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,801
Good afternoon, Ma'am.

35
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:44,969
Sorry, we're late.

36
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,805
Jerryl, Abby. You're late again.

37
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,224
Sorry, Ma'am.

38
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,899
Sorry, Ma'am.

39
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,719
Hey, thank you for the ride.

40
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,761
Of course, anything for you.

41
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,804
I can do it.

42
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,491
Peace to you.

43
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,742
Abdul.

44
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,621
I hope you don't forget
what truly matters.

45
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,091
(With Jerryl)

46
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:50,321
Allah is great!

47
00:08:51,989 --> 00:09:02,833
Allah is great!

48
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:21,394
I bear witness that there is no God but Allah!

49
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,155
Hey, Abby!

50
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,122
Hey, Abby! What up?
Let's go together again later?

51
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,249
Ah, I can't.

52
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,792
Huh? Why? C'mon, it's on me. Deal?

53
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:28,961
No, thanks. You should go ahead.

54
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,939
Abby.

55
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,401
Abby.

56
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,070
Abby.

57
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,032
Hey! You've been avoiding me for days.

58
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,410
Did I did something wrong?

59
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,662
Nothing.

60
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,665
You wouldn't avoid me
if there's really nothing wrong.

61
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,710
Are you okay? Are we okay?

62
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,754
Jerryl. You wouldn't understand.

63
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,214
You know... it would just be hard for us.

64
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,636
It would just be hard for us
if we continue doing this.

65
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,182
They say I might be better
if I just avoid you.

66
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,060
We're not doing anything wrong, Abby.

67
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,396
We're just friends, right?

68
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,859
Are we really just friends?

69
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,529
Whatever this is,

70
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,574
they have nothing to do with it.

71
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:30,040
Jerryl... Allah sees everything...
This is wrong.

72
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,712
Hasn't it crossed your mind that
maybe they're just saying that because...? Abby,

73
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:41,093
we're not hurting or aggrieving anyone.

74
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,846
What's wrong with this?

75
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,891
This is what's wrong with you.

76
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,060
You're acting too holy.

77
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,064
Jerryl.

78
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,526
Jerryl... I don't want to displease
Allah because of you.

79
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,155
And I also don't want to be the reason
for you to hate my Religion.

80
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,364
Abby.

81
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,745
I need to go to the Masjid.

82
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,580
Abby.

83
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,874
Jerryl.

84
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,000
Abby.

85
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,667
Jerryl.
