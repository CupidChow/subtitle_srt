00:01:18,818 --> 00:01:28,828
(Our Season)

5
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,838
They said I'd be assigned
to a nice working environment.

6
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:40,382
What?

7
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:42,759
How is this nice?

8
00:01:46,596 --> 00:01:50,433
Hello. I'm your vacation
guide. Nice to meet you.

9
00:01:52,227 --> 00:01:53,687
Like your vacation robes?

10
00:01:55,814 --> 00:01:59,651
Do you like it, ma'am?
You look great.

11
00:02:02,445 --> 00:02:04,172
Let's begin.

12
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,465
(Next Door's Stir-fried Pepper
Is Awesome)

13
00:02:05,532 --> 00:02:06,466
Title.

14
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:09,786
"Next Door's Stir-fried Pepper
Is Awful."

15
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:12,539
No, "Awesome".

16
00:02:13,832 --> 00:02:15,834
You won 4th
in the writing contest?

17
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:20,046
It'd be great if you'd reply.

18
00:02:21,923 --> 00:02:23,675
As luck would have it,

19
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:25,424
the 3rd place winner wanted a trip

20
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:28,112
to visit his wife,

21
00:02:28,179 --> 00:02:29,681
but unfortunately,

22
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:33,743
she passed away and came here.

23
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,037
- So Ms. Park Bok-ja, you're...
- Enough!

24
00:02:36,104 --> 00:02:38,940
I got it. I'm dying to go already!

25
00:02:39,316 --> 00:02:40,249
Since you're so anxious,

26
00:02:40,316 --> 00:02:41,751
I'll speed up.

27
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:45,255
Meet loved ones on your vacation

28
00:02:45,322 --> 00:02:47,035
and make new memories.

29
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:48,967
All that you see and hear

30
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:50,635
will all be saved here.

31
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:53,805
If you want to see
any past memories,

32
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:56,599
I can play them all here, ma'am.

33
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,602
Think of me as
your digital genius guide.

34
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:01,796
Who did you want to see?

35
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:03,048
My daughter.

36
00:03:03,256 --> 00:03:04,799
Where is she?

37
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:08,470
She's at... Ucla or Ukraine.

38
00:03:08,845 --> 00:03:11,598
It's in America.

39
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:13,516
California, you know?

40
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:15,769
She's a professor at that college.

41
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:17,395
She's a genius.

42
00:03:17,937 --> 00:03:21,708
There's no college named Ucla
in California.

43
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:23,943
There is a UCLA, though.

44
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:28,365
Ah, we'll just call it Ucla.

45
00:03:28,865 --> 00:03:30,466
Shall we go then?

46
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:31,759
Wait.

47
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:35,121
We're going west to L.A.

48
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:38,708
You can't see it. It's top secret.

49
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,366
(Home-cooked Meals)

50
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:57,852
Hey, guide? Why are we here?

51
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,121
Something's wrong!

52
00:04:00,188 --> 00:04:02,498
Can't you tech folks get it right?

53
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:05,735
This is where
I lived before I died!

54
00:04:09,864 --> 00:04:10,865
Ms. Park Bok-ja?

55
00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:15,537
Your daughter isn't a professor
in the States, is she?

56
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:19,999
A diner is far from UCLA.

57
00:04:22,252 --> 00:04:23,211
Ma'am?

58
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:25,505
Please listen to me, ma'am.

59
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:29,592
Huh?

60
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:32,137
What is all this?

61
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:43,022
Nice weather.

62
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:45,692
Jin-ju!

63
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:47,444
Whoosh.

64
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:50,488
What the...
She just walked past?

65
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:53,992
Right. I'm a ghost.

66
00:04:55,118 --> 00:04:56,244
I forgot.

67
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,790
Yes, you are. You've passed away.

68
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:07,005
Why is a UCLA professor
washing rags in Gimcheon?

69
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:09,883
It's a very unusual scene...

70
00:05:11,926 --> 00:05:15,988
She must be here on vacation.
We are too!

71
00:05:16,055 --> 00:05:17,182
Anyway!

72
00:05:19,142 --> 00:05:20,643
I'll go through the rules.

73
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:23,204
Touching is not allowed.

74
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:26,065
Your daughter can't
see or hear you.

75
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:28,084
Just watch and bring back
good,

76
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:30,878
happy memories of her.

77
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:32,030
Understand, ma'am?

78
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:36,384
I hope you do.

79
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:41,039
Also, please know
that I'll return after 3 nights.

80
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:43,166
Please answer, ma'am.

81
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,709
Something's wrong.

82
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:47,879
She's not supposed to be here.

83
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,840
Hey, guide? What the...

84
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:55,136
Jin-ju.

85
00:05:57,138 --> 00:05:58,848
You really can't see me?

86
00:06:01,142 --> 00:06:02,143
Jin-ju.

87
00:06:03,353 --> 00:06:06,231
Can't you see your mama?

88
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,399
You can't see me?

89
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:12,862
She can't.

90
00:06:18,034 --> 00:06:19,410
What's all this?

91
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:23,498
I don't get it at all. Jeez.

92
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:33,216
Oh, no.

93
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:40,014
What happened?

94
00:06:40,723 --> 00:06:42,475
What is she doing here?

95
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:45,103
I don't get it at all.

96
00:06:53,444 --> 00:06:55,780
It's been 3 years,
but nothing has changed.

97
00:06:57,407 --> 00:06:59,117
I missed you darlings.

98
00:07:04,872 --> 00:07:06,374
Let's see.

99
00:07:21,723 --> 00:07:23,016
I saved money.

100
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:30,773
Did she become
a carpenter or what?

101
00:07:37,196 --> 00:07:38,156
Hi.

102
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:41,618
I'm doing fine.

103
00:07:44,037 --> 00:07:44,996
It's been so long, huh?

104
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,081
Happy in love?

105
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:50,167
Me?

106
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:55,006
Being an owner of a diner
suits me too.

107
00:07:58,551 --> 00:07:59,761
School?

108
00:08:01,512 --> 00:08:03,389
Let's just say I got fired.

109
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:05,491
You got fired?

110
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:06,558
Yup.

111
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:09,537
I bragged so much about you
being a professor,

112
00:08:09,604 --> 00:08:11,898
but you got fired?
Are you crazy!

113
00:08:12,148 --> 00:08:13,358
I guess.

114
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:16,152
- What?
- You're right.

115
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:21,032
You're coming tomorrow?

116
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,410
It's really far here.

117
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,413
Of course, you're welcomed.

118
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:30,909
Bring some flour.

119
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,627
Let's make dumplings.

120
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,895
Dumplings?

121
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:37,674
Are you seriously making
damn dumplings at this moment?

122
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:40,259
Great idea, huh?

123
00:08:40,718 --> 00:08:42,278
- Great?
- Yup.

124
00:08:42,345 --> 00:08:44,514
Text me your bus time.

125
00:08:45,473 --> 00:08:46,473
Okay.

126
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:49,977
Who's that?

127
00:08:51,437 --> 00:08:52,371
Come safely.

128
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:53,898
Bye.

129
00:08:59,445 --> 00:09:01,197
- Are you open?
- Yes.

130
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:04,117
You're stressing me out!

131
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:06,035
You'll cook for them?

132
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,465
Is there a menu?

133
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:21,525
No, there isn't.

134
00:09:21,592 --> 00:09:23,886
I just serve the meal of the day.

135
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,972
What is it today?

136
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:28,182
Kimchi stew with Spam.

137
00:09:28,808 --> 00:09:30,184
Make it spicy, please.

138
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:31,811
I'll be right back.

139
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:36,524
She never cooked once in life.
How will she make stew?

140
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:11,017
It's perfect.

141
00:10:17,064 --> 00:10:19,083
An old man who used to live

142
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,568
there made a little cave.

143
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:23,613
They say he made it as a bunker.

144
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:27,825
Even when it's scorching hot
in the summer,

145
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:30,720
it's miraculously cool down there.

146
00:10:30,787 --> 00:10:33,748
Things don't freeze there
in the winter either.

147
00:10:39,712 --> 00:10:42,507
If you store kimchi down there,

148
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,385
it'll stay fresh and crisp
over a year.

149
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:50,948
If you wrap radish and cabbage
in newspaper

150
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:54,352
and store 'em there,
they'll stay fresh.

151
00:10:54,727 --> 00:10:56,203
Amazing, huh?

152
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,331
My stew is way better than
this made

153
00:10:59,398 --> 00:11:00,733
with Chinese kimchi.

154
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:05,171
Do you want to order
something else?

155
00:11:05,238 --> 00:11:06,531
No, it's fine.

156
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:09,367
We're paying for this.
I'll eat it.

157
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:12,829
Why are you so out of breath?

158
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:15,206
Are you sick?

159
00:11:16,165 --> 00:11:17,834
Of course not.

160
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:21,754
Who doesn't have shortness
of breath at my old age?

161
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:26,066
The village chief said
bellflower extract works wonders,

162
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:29,804
so I said
I'll order it in the fall.

163
00:11:42,024 --> 00:11:45,336
Waitress! The gas is low.
Please change it.

164
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:46,320
Coming.

165
00:12:05,131 --> 00:12:06,257
That's it.

166
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,640
You're good!

167
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,371
Enjoy your meal.

168
00:12:42,668 --> 00:12:44,545
I wish I could eat.

169
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:48,023
I worked hard for your schooling,

170
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,508
so you wouldn't live like me.

171
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:52,194
And this is what I get?

172
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:53,679
What a waste...

173
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:56,182
Are you happy?

174
00:12:57,183 --> 00:12:58,309
It's good.

175
00:12:59,393 --> 00:13:00,728
It does look good.

176
00:13:02,188 --> 00:13:03,247
How much is it?

177
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:04,415
It's $10, please.

178
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:06,792
- For 2 servings?
- Yes.

179
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:07,777
Wow.

180
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:10,796
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

181
00:13:10,863 --> 00:13:11,781
Thanks. It was great.

182
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:13,282
Thank you.

183
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:29,189
If Bok-ja saw that from heaven,

184
00:13:29,256 --> 00:13:30,633
she'd be fuming mad.

185
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:33,569
She was so happy

186
00:13:33,636 --> 00:13:36,405
and bragged about her daughter
being a Ucla professor.

187
00:13:36,472 --> 00:13:38,449
Does she make any money?

188
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:39,463
Probably not.

189
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,102
She'll starve to death soon.

190
00:13:41,435 --> 00:13:43,662
Damn you, old-timer.

191
00:13:43,729 --> 00:13:44,730
Mind your own business!

192
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:58,285
Ma'am.

193
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,085
Sesame oil, please.

194
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:09,588
I'm not selling to you.

195
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,132
Come on. Not again.

196
00:14:11,882 --> 00:14:13,676
I told you to buy elsewhere.

197
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:16,929
Seeing you like this makes me mad.

198
00:14:17,388 --> 00:14:18,755
I left the diner open.

199
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:20,182
Give it to me, please?

200
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:39,577
How long will you live like this?

201
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,790
Thank you.

202
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:46,959
Why you...

203
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,878
Come by to eat.

204
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,882
What are we going to do with her?

205
00:14:53,257 --> 00:14:54,800
See you next time.

206
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:58,596
Oh, Bok-ja.
Are you seeing this?

207
00:14:59,513 --> 00:15:02,641
Yes, I am, my friend.

208
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:05,811
What is she thinking?

209
00:15:22,787 --> 00:15:23,596
You never listened,

210
00:15:23,663 --> 00:15:25,372
but learned well.

211
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:36,675
There.

212
00:15:42,431 --> 00:15:44,058
(My daughter)

213
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:50,831
- Hi.
- Jin-ju! It's me.

214
00:15:50,898 --> 00:15:52,124
Busy?

215
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:53,333
Why?

216
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,653
It's nothing special.

217
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:00,257
I laid some bricks, mudded them,

218
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:03,244
and made a pretty, little furnace.

219
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:06,764
I also bought a caldron.

220
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:09,391
Grilling some pork on the lid

221
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,642
will drip off the fat.

222
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:13,003
It'd be amazing!

223
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:17,566
Do you want to come down?
Let's grill some pork.

224
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:19,260
I have a class soon.

225
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:22,012
Right. You're busy.

226
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:24,682
Wait, Jin-ju!

227
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:26,225
Make it quick.

228
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,770
When are you going to the States?

229
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:32,915
Are you coming home before you go?

230
00:16:32,982 --> 00:16:34,458
If you're busy, should I come up?

231
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:35,818
I'll call you later.

232
00:16:54,962 --> 00:16:56,438
Hi, sister-in-law.

233
00:16:56,505 --> 00:16:58,440
- Hi.
- Is everything all right?

234
00:16:58,507 --> 00:16:59,550
Of course.

235
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:03,737
How did my brother's operation go?

236
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:05,197
Great. He's fine.

237
00:17:05,264 --> 00:17:06,932
What a relief.

238
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:12,079
I just called about Jin-ju.

239
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:13,080
Jin-ju?

240
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:15,482
When is she going to America?

241
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:19,503
Next week, she said.

242
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,280
She's all packed to go already.

243
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,535
Right. I remember now.

244
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:30,748
She told me but I forgot.

245
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,628
I'll give her a call later.

246
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:37,504
Take care.

247
00:17:37,838 --> 00:17:39,757
Bye now.

248
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:48,807
That cold brat!

249
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:01,253
Are you happy?

250
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,782
You went all the way to America
without seeing me.

251
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:07,993
Even if you got fired,

252
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:09,928
after all this time,

253
00:18:09,995 --> 00:18:11,664
you chose to come here?

254
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:15,876
It's burning!

255
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,769
Is it burnt?

256
00:18:17,836 --> 00:18:20,464
You burned it
while lost in thought!

257
00:18:57,918 --> 00:18:59,811
Are you singing now?

258
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:02,089
You're not even good at it!

259
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:05,968
Why is it so itchy?

260
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:08,278
Is someone talking about me?

261
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:10,347
What if I am!

262
00:19:10,806 --> 00:19:11,849
Can you hear me?

263
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:14,226
Silly brat!

264
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,859
Solved it!

265
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:56,852
Silly brat...

266
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:31,720
Jin-ju?

267
00:20:32,388 --> 00:20:33,639
What's wrong?

268
00:20:37,643 --> 00:20:39,770
What's the matter?

269
00:21:17,182 --> 00:21:18,642
I'm losing it.

270
00:21:20,436 --> 00:21:22,187
I'm losing my mind, Mom!

271
00:21:23,272 --> 00:21:24,273
I...

272
00:21:26,191 --> 00:21:28,485
I can't live because of you!

273
00:21:35,784 --> 00:21:37,911
Help me, Mom!

274
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:52,926
(Geochang Daedeok
Daegu Seongju)

275
00:21:59,516 --> 00:22:00,700
(Depression & Panic Disorder)

276
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:02,269
Ms. Bang Jin-ju?

277
00:22:03,187 --> 00:22:05,230
Please come in.

278
00:22:09,651 --> 00:22:11,878
I heard from Dr. Han in Seoul.

279
00:22:11,945 --> 00:22:14,698
I was worried you wouldn't come.

280
00:22:16,074 --> 00:22:18,535
You moved to Gimcheon
from the States?

281
00:22:18,994 --> 00:22:19,912
Yes.

282
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:23,473
I went to Dr. Han
whenever in Seoul,

283
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,958
but it's too far now.

284
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:27,602
I meant to come sooner.

285
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:29,813
How are you these days?

286
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,798
I was okay,

287
00:22:32,508 --> 00:22:33,842
but I can't sleep again.

288
00:22:34,676 --> 00:22:36,220
I wake up at nights.

289
00:22:37,137 --> 00:22:38,347
When I do,

290
00:22:39,264 --> 00:22:41,475
the memories flood in.

291
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:44,978
More than I can bear.

292
00:22:47,773 --> 00:22:49,608
In a way,

293
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:55,405
memory is like the fuel
for people to live.

294
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,133
Good memories will keep

295
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,995
you going like a car filled
with high-grade gasoline.

296
00:23:02,412 --> 00:23:04,389
Bad memories make life bumpy

297
00:23:04,456 --> 00:23:06,208
and rattle like bad gasoline.

298
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:10,921
What memories come to mind?

299
00:23:12,923 --> 00:23:14,424
About Mom.

300
00:23:15,425 --> 00:23:18,011
What about your mom?

301
00:23:21,848 --> 00:23:23,809
Why did she abandon me?

302
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:28,730
Thoughts like that.

303
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:45,372
If you give up your kid,

304
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,265
think you can live?

305
00:23:47,332 --> 00:23:48,709
I can.

306
00:23:49,418 --> 00:23:50,711
This is better.

307
00:23:51,211 --> 00:23:52,729
It'd be better for Jin-ju too.

308
00:23:52,796 --> 00:23:53,939
Please!

309
00:23:54,006 --> 00:23:55,299
It's better!

310
00:24:00,554 --> 00:24:01,988
Jin-ju.

311
00:24:02,055 --> 00:24:04,824
I'm not going far away.

312
00:24:04,891 --> 00:24:06,893
I'll come once a month.
No.

313
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:08,937
I'll come every two weeks.

314
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:12,249
Stay here with your uncle's family

315
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:14,109
and study hard.

316
00:24:14,776 --> 00:24:15,944
Got it?

317
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:30,375
Hey!
Bang Jin-ju!

318
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:33,728
I missed you, girl!

(Gimcheon Bus Terminal)

320
00:24:36,632 --> 00:24:38,050
Who's that?

321
00:24:38,717 --> 00:24:40,218
Her friend?

322
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:42,679
How've you been?

323
00:24:43,722 --> 00:24:46,016
- Brought the flour?
- Of course!

324
00:24:46,683 --> 00:24:49,311
Also, bought some hamburgers!

325
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,272
I don't like McDonald's.

326
00:24:53,482 --> 00:24:54,775
No way.

327
00:24:56,026 --> 00:24:59,821
You always ate McDonald's
back in school.

328
00:25:01,657 --> 00:25:02,783
Not anymore.

329
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,868
You've changed.

330
00:25:10,499 --> 00:25:11,458
Sure you don't want it?

331
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:19,341
Here she comes!

332
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,778
(Don't kill the village!
Stop holding out and leave!)

333
00:25:23,845 --> 00:25:24,863
What's going on?

334
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,532
Stop holding ground here!

335
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,159
Leave at once!

336
00:25:29,226 --> 00:25:30,744
Leave at once!

337
00:25:30,811 --> 00:25:32,954
- Stop killing the village!
- What is it?

338
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:34,623
Stop it! Stop it!

339
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,125
Annoy not the local elderly!

340
00:25:37,192 --> 00:25:39,277
Annoy! Annoy?

341
00:25:41,154 --> 00:25:43,214
Come back to
where you come from!

342
00:25:43,281 --> 00:25:45,242
Come! Come?

343
00:25:45,742 --> 00:25:47,344
It's 'go back', silly.

344
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:49,095
Stupid.

345
00:25:49,162 --> 00:25:50,497
Go, go...

346
00:25:50,872 --> 00:25:53,458
Go away! Bok-ja's daughter!

347
00:25:54,126 --> 00:25:56,795
- Let's make noodles.
- What on earth...

348
00:25:57,587 --> 00:25:59,147
Go on your way!

349
00:25:59,214 --> 00:26:01,191
Go! Go!

350
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:02,776
Excuse us.

351
00:26:02,843 --> 00:26:04,678
They're telling you to leave?

352
00:26:05,512 --> 00:26:06,988
Can you make egg garnish?

353
00:26:07,055 --> 00:26:08,682
I don't know how to cook.

354
00:26:17,065 --> 00:26:18,525
Don't burn it.

355
00:26:25,115 --> 00:26:26,591
Coming through!

356
00:26:26,658 --> 00:26:28,160
Step back, please.

357
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:55,620
You need energy to protest.

358
00:26:55,687 --> 00:26:57,230
Have some food first.

359
00:26:57,731 --> 00:26:59,566
Who asked you to make this?

360
00:27:00,025 --> 00:27:01,167
Just leave!

361
00:27:01,234 --> 00:27:03,586
The golf course can't be made

362
00:27:03,653 --> 00:27:04,754
because of you!

363
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:05,714
Don't feed them!

364
00:27:05,781 --> 00:27:08,867
Why make all this food
for those folks?

365
00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:11,886
You can't even play golf.

366
00:27:11,953 --> 00:27:14,206
Why do you want it
to be made here?

367
00:27:15,123 --> 00:27:17,058
If a golf course is made,

368
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,852
they said it'll be easier

369
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:21,312
to mow the lawn than farming.

370
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:25,358
Right! We don't have
the strength to farm anymore.

371
00:27:25,425 --> 00:27:27,068
It'd be nice to work part-time

372
00:27:27,135 --> 00:27:28,737
trimming the lawn there.

373
00:27:28,804 --> 00:27:31,197
Are you going to feed and save us?

374
00:27:31,264 --> 00:27:33,558
How can I feed and save you?

375
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:36,019
I couldn't even do that for Mom.

376
00:27:38,522 --> 00:27:39,981
At least she knows...

377
00:27:42,651 --> 00:27:45,070
Eat up, please.
It'll taste bad soggy.

378
00:27:45,612 --> 00:27:48,256
Let's just eat first,
then protest.

379
00:27:48,323 --> 00:27:50,575
She made all this for us.

380
00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:52,619
It looks good.

381
00:27:53,745 --> 00:27:56,331
She takes after her mom
and did a great job.

382
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:59,251
Looks yummy.

383
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,173
It's delicious.

384
00:28:11,137 --> 00:28:13,598
Want some? Then eat.

385
00:28:14,432 --> 00:28:16,201
I'm not eating.

386
00:28:16,268 --> 00:28:18,787
Just eat! Why hold back?

387
00:28:18,854 --> 00:28:20,121
I'm not eating.

388
00:28:20,188 --> 00:28:21,356
Silly.

389
00:28:22,732 --> 00:28:23,859
It's so good!

390
00:28:25,151 --> 00:28:26,544
Eat.

391
00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:27,504
Just eat!

392
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:29,030
Then don't eat!

393
00:28:30,448 --> 00:28:31,741
Eat.

394
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:38,832
Come and sit here, please.

395
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:42,502
Please eat before it gets cold.

396
00:28:43,253 --> 00:28:44,296
Sit here, please.

397
00:29:09,946 --> 00:29:11,156
Bok-ja.

398
00:29:12,365 --> 00:29:15,744
Your daughter makes good noodles.

399
00:29:17,162 --> 00:29:19,331
Even better than you.

400
00:29:23,168 --> 00:29:25,962
Like mother, like daughter.

401
00:29:28,715 --> 00:29:31,384
She must really miss you too.

402
00:29:32,844 --> 00:29:34,596
That's why she's here like this.

403
00:29:35,347 --> 00:29:36,765
I don't think so.

404
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:38,278
She's like that

405
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:39,976
because she resents me.

406
00:29:41,144 --> 00:29:43,246
I wish I can resolve things

407
00:29:43,313 --> 00:29:45,565
while here on vacation.

408
00:29:47,275 --> 00:29:49,961
Do you worry about your daughter
up there too?

409
00:29:50,028 --> 00:29:52,364
Isn't it obvious?

410
00:29:53,865 --> 00:29:56,050
It must break your heart

411
00:29:56,117 --> 00:29:58,244
to see her like that.

412
00:30:00,497 --> 00:30:02,374
Hi, son.

413
00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:05,101
Why talk to yourself like that?

414
00:30:05,168 --> 00:30:07,796
It could look like
you have dementia, Mama.

415
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:11,007
When you get as old as me,

416
00:30:11,466 --> 00:30:13,735
you ramble on by yourself.

417
00:30:13,802 --> 00:30:15,945
Went to Jin-ju's diner?

418
00:30:16,012 --> 00:30:17,238
Yup.

419
00:30:17,305 --> 00:30:19,449
Why do you folks keep going there

420
00:30:19,516 --> 00:30:20,850
to bother her like that?

421
00:30:21,601 --> 00:30:23,436
I heard she made
noodles for you guys.

422
00:30:24,187 --> 00:30:25,689
It was good.

423
00:30:26,523 --> 00:30:28,458
She must take after her mom

424
00:30:28,525 --> 00:30:29,693
in cooking.

425
00:30:30,986 --> 00:30:32,487
Of course.

426
00:30:33,238 --> 00:30:34,631
The day she died,

427
00:30:34,698 --> 00:30:37,283
Bok-ja called me over for lunch.

428
00:30:39,536 --> 00:30:41,788
She had the food all set...

429
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,810
We didn't know
she had a bad heart.

430
00:30:47,877 --> 00:30:50,463
Heart attacks are scary.

431
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:52,357
You'd better be careful too, Mama!

432
00:30:52,424 --> 00:30:53,591
I'm fine.

433
00:30:54,092 --> 00:30:55,093
Mama?

434
00:30:56,761 --> 00:30:58,763
Can't you move in with us now?

435
00:31:00,265 --> 00:31:03,101
Why live apart
in the same village?

436
00:31:03,476 --> 00:31:06,896
My wife always worries
about you too.

437
00:31:07,981 --> 00:31:09,315
When it gets warmer.

438
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:10,917
When it gets warmer,

439
00:31:10,984 --> 00:31:12,861
you'll say, 'When it gets colder!'

440
00:31:13,236 --> 00:31:15,655
You're so funny!

441
00:31:15,989 --> 00:31:18,700
Since when did I
go back and forth like that?

442
00:31:26,332 --> 00:31:28,626
You're so lucky.

443
00:31:29,836 --> 00:31:33,882
I came on vacation
to see my pretty daughter,

444
00:31:35,425 --> 00:31:37,635
but I'm miserable again.

445
00:32:07,665 --> 00:32:09,684
Wait! A bug just went in!

446
00:32:09,751 --> 00:32:11,269
What bug?

447
00:32:11,336 --> 00:32:13,171
That's cold! Stop!

448
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,510
Silly girls.

449
00:32:19,594 --> 00:32:22,013
That's why friends are the best
in life or death.

450
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,140
Neuropsychiatry?

451
00:32:24,933 --> 00:32:25,867
Depression?

452
00:32:25,934 --> 00:32:27,118
(Prescribed Medicine
Depression)

453
00:32:27,185 --> 00:32:28,561
You're seeing a shrink?

454
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,025
Come on.

455
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:36,919
No wonder you're depressed here.

456
00:32:36,986 --> 00:32:39,547
I'm punishing myself.

457
00:32:39,614 --> 00:32:40,573
What?

458
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:43,426
Punishing yourself?

459
00:32:43,493 --> 00:32:45,745
If I was here when Mom died,

460
00:32:46,663 --> 00:32:48,473
I wouldn't be here like this.

461
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,391
I died because it was my time!

462
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:51,642
What are you saying?

463
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:54,212
Her funeral got delayed
because of me.

464
00:32:55,255 --> 00:32:57,899
She was in the cold freezer
for 2 more days.

465
00:32:57,966 --> 00:33:00,301
Who cares? I was dead!

466
00:33:01,052 --> 00:33:02,262
But,

467
00:33:03,763 --> 00:33:05,907
you were in the States.

468
00:33:05,974 --> 00:33:07,892
Right.

469
00:33:08,268 --> 00:33:09,936
When I could've worked in Seoul,

470
00:33:10,854 --> 00:33:13,148
why'd I run away to the States?

471
00:33:17,777 --> 00:33:19,988
This is absolutely insane.

472
00:33:21,948 --> 00:33:22,866
Listen.

473
00:33:23,992 --> 00:33:27,328
You didn't run away.
You went to be a professor.

474
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:30,206
This is so frustrating.

475
00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:33,501
Hey, guide! Where are you?

476
00:33:33,918 --> 00:33:35,561
Don't just stand there!

477
00:33:35,628 --> 00:33:38,423
Play Jin-ju's memories, fool!

478
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:45,520
- You dropped this.
- Thank you.

479
00:33:45,587 --> 00:33:47,755
- See you later.
- See you.

480
00:33:48,914 --> 00:33:52,596
SGB to X is homeomorphism.

481
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,663
That's our marking.

482
00:33:54,863 --> 00:33:58,190
- I like that. That's easy.
- I understand so much better

483
00:33:58,257 --> 00:34:01,295
- than the last time.
- This is awesome.

484
00:34:01,362 --> 00:34:02,530
Hi, Auntie.

485
00:34:03,656 --> 00:34:05,033
Jin-ju...

486
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,703
How could it be?

487
00:34:10,872 --> 00:34:14,834
This morning... Your mother...

488
00:34:18,546 --> 00:34:22,008
I had no idea
she'd pass away like this.

489
00:34:54,123 --> 00:34:55,583
This is killing me!

490
00:34:57,835 --> 00:34:59,562
For good dumplings,
you have to squeeze hard.

491
00:34:59,629 --> 00:35:02,106
My wrists are breaking off!

492
00:35:02,173 --> 00:35:03,900
There are lots of dumpling shops.

493
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:05,401
Must we make them?

494
00:35:05,468 --> 00:35:06,803
Your wrists won't break.

495
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,948
What are you doing?

496
00:35:11,015 --> 00:35:13,643
You're full of weird surprises.

497
00:35:18,106 --> 00:35:19,624
You're adding radish?

498
00:35:19,691 --> 00:35:21,567
Mom made it like this.

499
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,711
She knows?

500
00:35:23,778 --> 00:35:25,671
Is that Gimcheon style?

501
00:35:25,738 --> 00:35:26,739
Probably not.

502
00:35:27,907 --> 00:35:31,035
She probably learned it
from a house she worked at.

503
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:34,122
She said she was so poor,

504
00:35:34,747 --> 00:35:36,457
she never tried dumplings before.

505
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,085
You forgot to add soy sauce.

506
00:35:39,877 --> 00:35:41,004
Did you add soy sauce?

507
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:44,357
How would I know that?

508
00:35:44,424 --> 00:35:45,650
Listen.

509
00:35:45,717 --> 00:35:47,652
You wouldn't eat kimchi.

510
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,903
If you ate anything spicy,

511
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:51,239
you'd drink a pitcher of water.

512
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:53,032
With your princess tastes,

513
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:54,934
I had to make up that recipe.

514
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:07,363
Mommy?

515
00:36:10,783 --> 00:36:13,411
- You waited up for me?
- Yup!

516
00:36:17,081 --> 00:36:18,541
Look at this.

517
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:22,420
I bought you a new pencil case.

518
00:36:23,171 --> 00:36:24,881
Wow! It's a magnetic case!

519
00:36:29,677 --> 00:36:31,596
You didn't touch the food?

520
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:33,030
Why?

521
00:36:33,097 --> 00:36:35,266
I wanted to eat with you.

522
00:36:36,184 --> 00:36:37,310
My puppy.

523
00:36:40,897 --> 00:36:41,831
Now.

524
00:36:41,898 --> 00:36:45,860
I'll make it round
like your face, Jin-ju.

525
00:36:47,445 --> 00:36:48,363
There!

526
00:36:49,155 --> 00:36:50,198
Perfect.

527
00:36:50,531 --> 00:36:51,449
Watch.

528
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,620
This is Jin-ju's little bum.

529
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:02,627
This is Jin-ju's little nose!

530
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:04,754
Isn't it fun making this?

531
00:37:06,381 --> 00:37:07,340
What's wrong?

532
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,802
Then are you going to eat me,
Mommy?

533
00:37:11,636 --> 00:37:14,305
Right. Why not!

534
00:37:22,939 --> 00:37:24,999
To get Mom's recipe right,

535
00:37:25,066 --> 00:37:26,776
I ate over a hundred dumplings.

536
00:37:27,902 --> 00:37:28,919
Why didn't you just ask her?

537
00:37:28,986 --> 00:37:30,880
Agreed!

538
00:37:30,947 --> 00:37:32,740
You said it, girl!

539
00:38:43,144 --> 00:38:44,437
The radish is sweet.

540
00:38:46,189 --> 00:38:49,650
I don't know why your mama
put this in her dumplings.

541
00:38:50,526 --> 00:38:52,236
How sweet it was.

542
00:40:18,406 --> 00:40:19,824
It's delicious.

543
00:40:20,825 --> 00:40:21,826
Good, huh?

544
00:40:22,493 --> 00:40:23,911
Damn good.

545
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:27,290
Want a beer?

546
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,293
I never thought you'd ask!

547
00:40:31,627 --> 00:40:33,963
You girls are the same.

548
00:40:34,297 --> 00:40:35,481
Others your age

549
00:40:35,548 --> 00:40:37,800
are happily married with kids.

550
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,113
You're solving math here too?

551
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,190
Holy cow!

552
00:40:44,257 --> 00:40:45,641
Is math fun?

553
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,312
Yup. And I get answers.

554
00:40:51,564 --> 00:40:54,984
What? You get no answers in life?

555
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,945
Is that why a UCLA...

556
00:41:00,406 --> 00:41:03,092
professor is here going crazy
solving math problems?

557
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:05,553
professor is here going crazy
solving math problems?

558
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:09,123
Good! You tell her, girl!

559
00:41:09,373 --> 00:41:10,639
Why run a diner

560
00:41:10,706 --> 00:41:13,811
with your smart brain?

561
00:41:13,878 --> 00:41:15,630
They emailed me to return soon.

562
00:41:17,506 --> 00:41:18,983
You weren't fired?

563
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,485
If I don't go back soon,
I will be.

564
00:41:21,552 --> 00:41:23,654
If you're not fired,

565
00:41:23,721 --> 00:41:26,657
why are you here in the boonies!

566
00:41:26,724 --> 00:41:27,825
All good then.

567
00:41:27,892 --> 00:41:30,353
Just go back when you can.

568
00:41:31,312 --> 00:41:32,538
Yummy.

569
00:41:32,605 --> 00:41:35,232
This is damn frustrating!

570
00:41:35,775 --> 00:41:38,832
I was amazed

571
00:41:38,899 --> 00:41:40,696
when you became a professor.

572
00:41:41,822 --> 00:41:44,575
Until grade nine,

573
00:41:45,618 --> 00:41:48,846
you and I were about the same
in school.

574
00:41:48,913 --> 00:41:50,956
Mid-lower class.

575
00:41:51,832 --> 00:41:53,100
I wasn't that bad.

576
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:55,644
How dare you
compare yourself to her!

577
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,755
I studied because I was mad.

578
00:41:58,714 --> 00:42:00,007
Really?

579
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,927
Back in grade nine,

580
00:42:03,886 --> 00:42:06,931
Mom made me mad, so I studied.

581
00:42:17,108 --> 00:42:20,127
- I'm at the store.
- Really?

582
00:42:20,194 --> 00:42:21,253
Where do I go?

583
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,572
Just stay there. I'll come out.

584
00:42:24,323 --> 00:42:25,741
- I'll be there soon!
- Mom?

585
00:42:40,172 --> 00:42:41,549
Jin-ju.

586
00:42:42,007 --> 00:42:44,218
Let's eat. Come and sit.

587
00:42:55,646 --> 00:42:58,040
I have to go to tutoring.

588
00:42:58,107 --> 00:43:00,943
I know but eat before you go.

589
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:06,449
I heard you like egg rolls.
Try it.

590
00:43:07,158 --> 00:43:08,951
Ji-yeon likes them.

591
00:43:09,201 --> 00:43:10,953
I just eat whatever.

592
00:43:23,132 --> 00:43:24,300
All set.

593
00:43:26,302 --> 00:43:27,386
Eat up.

594
00:43:30,306 --> 00:43:31,932
How's school going?

595
00:43:32,892 --> 00:43:34,810
I should go sometime.

596
00:43:35,561 --> 00:43:37,188
Auntie came by instead.

597
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:39,106
I see.

598
00:43:39,732 --> 00:43:42,359
Are you studying well?

599
00:43:43,068 --> 00:43:44,156
Don't worry about anything

600
00:43:44,223 --> 00:43:46,171
and just study hard.

601
00:43:46,238 --> 00:43:48,006
Don't worry about tuition.

602
00:43:48,073 --> 00:43:51,035
Study hard and become a doctor.

603
00:43:51,952 --> 00:43:54,538
You have to study hard
to be respected in life.

604
00:43:56,081 --> 00:44:00,586
Try some noodles too.

605
00:44:09,637 --> 00:44:10,554
Here.

606
00:44:13,432 --> 00:44:16,393
- Is someone here?
- Ah...

607
00:44:21,106 --> 00:44:23,125
I thought you were coming back
tomorrow.

608
00:44:23,192 --> 00:44:25,043
Dae-sik had an upset stomach,

609
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:26,529
so we took the first flight back.

610
00:44:27,071 --> 00:44:28,572
Who's this?

611
00:44:31,534 --> 00:44:33,244
Your daughter?

612
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:36,096
School ended early today,

613
00:44:36,163 --> 00:44:37,665
so I told her to come and eat.

614
00:44:38,249 --> 00:44:39,516
I'm hungry too.

615
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:41,477
Make me ramyun, please?

616
00:44:41,544 --> 00:44:43,353
You two, go to your rooms.

617
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,730
Anything else besides ramyun?

618
00:44:44,797 --> 00:44:46,482
Of course. I made a lot of food.

619
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:47,550
Go inside!

620
00:44:53,931 --> 00:44:55,349
It's been a while, Jin-ju.

621
00:44:57,768 --> 00:44:59,311
Studying well?

622
00:45:00,896 --> 00:45:02,773
You'd better study hard.

623
00:45:04,733 --> 00:45:07,169
Your mom works hard here
to pay

624
00:45:07,236 --> 00:45:08,696
for your schooling.

625
00:45:10,906 --> 00:45:13,284
Study while you can.

626
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,080
Eat lots.

627
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:20,416
Who will eat all this?

628
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,795
If it's not eaten, it's garbage.

629
00:45:25,504 --> 00:45:27,548
Why'd you cook so much?

630
00:45:32,845 --> 00:45:33,987
Jin-ju?

631
00:45:34,054 --> 00:45:35,347
Jin-ju!

632
00:45:36,974 --> 00:45:38,142
Jin-ju!

633
00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:40,327
Take this with you.

634
00:45:40,394 --> 00:45:41,453
Forget it.

635
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,622
I made it all night. Take it.

636
00:45:43,689 --> 00:45:45,983
Why didn't you go
on the family trip?

637
00:45:48,694 --> 00:45:52,047
I don't like taking flights.

638
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:53,657
You've never been on one!

639
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,202
I said I'd stay, so I can see you.

640
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,163
Oh, please!

641
00:46:00,289 --> 00:46:01,332
Jin-ju!

642
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:03,167
Jin-ju!

643
00:46:05,586 --> 00:46:08,839
Jin-ju, come by again.

644
00:46:11,926 --> 00:46:13,138
Mom.

645
00:46:13,928 --> 00:46:14,820
Yes?

646
00:46:14,887 --> 00:46:17,447
If I don't go to college and work,

647
00:46:17,514 --> 00:46:19,533
we can live together.

648
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,310
You have to...

649
00:46:21,644 --> 00:46:23,437
study to go to college.

650
00:46:24,021 --> 00:46:26,273
When I graduate,
I'll get a job right away.

651
00:46:26,941 --> 00:46:30,361
I'll support you,
so come out of there.

652
00:46:33,447 --> 00:46:35,824
I eat and live well here.

653
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:40,412
When you become successful later,

654
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,624
then we can live together again.

655
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:46,126
Okay?

656
00:46:50,756 --> 00:46:52,925
Jin-ju. Wait.

657
00:46:53,342 --> 00:46:54,635
Jin-ju!

658
00:46:56,971 --> 00:46:58,305
Jin-ju...

659
00:47:49,523 --> 00:47:51,333
- Hey!
- What?

660
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,251
Get away from my desk!

661
00:47:53,318 --> 00:47:55,779
- Why?
- Move! I'm going to study.

662
00:47:56,697 --> 00:47:59,450
Mom! Jin-ju says she's studying!

663
00:48:05,122 --> 00:48:06,498
This is your mom?

664
00:48:07,249 --> 00:48:08,333
Yup.

665
00:48:08,917 --> 00:48:10,102
Then they must be

666
00:48:10,169 --> 00:48:13,672
your uncle and aunt.

667
00:48:16,925 --> 00:48:19,053
You're so young here.

668
00:48:20,179 --> 00:48:22,473
We weren't so bad in our 20s, huh?

669
00:48:23,515 --> 00:48:25,117
What's wrong with us now?

670
00:48:25,184 --> 00:48:27,744
Back then, I had awesome skin

671
00:48:27,811 --> 00:48:29,396
without doing facials like this.

672
00:48:30,606 --> 00:48:34,084
Still, this is
your graduation picture.

673
00:48:34,151 --> 00:48:36,445
Why didn't you stand
beside your mom?

674
00:48:36,737 --> 00:48:37,879
Well.

675
00:48:37,946 --> 00:48:42,367
Still it's the only picture
I took with mom.

676
00:48:59,468 --> 00:49:01,069
Who's here at this hour?

677
00:49:01,136 --> 00:49:04,281
Hi, Mi-jin.
I saw the sign and pulled in.

678
00:49:04,348 --> 00:49:05,682
Is this right?

679
00:49:06,725 --> 00:49:07,976
Hi, Min-wook.

680
00:49:12,439 --> 00:49:14,316
Is someone here?

681
00:49:20,572 --> 00:49:22,866
Ah, I don't know anything.

682
00:49:28,205 --> 00:49:30,124
I don't hate you.

683
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:32,501
Forget everything and get married.

684
00:49:33,293 --> 00:49:35,754
Right. Let's get married.

685
00:49:36,463 --> 00:49:39,299
Good! Get her to marry you!

686
00:49:40,551 --> 00:49:42,402
Not me. Marry someone else.

687
00:49:42,469 --> 00:49:44,263
But I want to marry you!

688
00:49:45,097 --> 00:49:47,641
You want to marry me,

689
00:49:48,517 --> 00:49:51,478
but you don't want
my mom to come.

690
00:49:52,896 --> 00:49:56,666
You want my uncle,
the vice principal,

691
00:49:56,733 --> 00:49:58,251
and his wife to act as my parents?

692
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:01,113
I'm really sorry about that.

693
00:50:02,447 --> 00:50:04,199
I should've stopped my mom.

694
00:50:04,783 --> 00:50:05,909
It's okay.

695
00:50:06,618 --> 00:50:09,037
I get why your mom said that.

696
00:50:10,164 --> 00:50:11,331
I understand.

697
00:50:12,416 --> 00:50:14,501
But I couldn't do it.

698
00:50:17,004 --> 00:50:20,023
All she had was me.

699
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:21,967
If she can't host my wedding,

700
00:50:23,135 --> 00:50:24,803
how sad is that for my mom?

701
00:50:26,013 --> 00:50:27,723
No matter what,

702
00:50:29,766 --> 00:50:31,727
I'm her daughter.

703
00:50:36,148 --> 00:50:37,566
I just couldn't do it.

704
00:50:39,943 --> 00:50:41,278
I wish you the best.

705
00:50:42,321 --> 00:50:43,614
Forget me.

706
00:50:46,033 --> 00:50:47,534
It's late.

707
00:50:48,577 --> 00:50:50,996
I have to wake up early
to open shop tomorrow.

708
00:50:52,998 --> 00:50:53,916
Jin-ju...

709
00:50:54,791 --> 00:50:56,017
This time, I will...

710
00:50:56,084 --> 00:50:58,670
Did you come
because Mom passed away?

711
00:51:02,341 --> 00:51:05,052
Drive safely. It's dark out.

712
00:51:15,229 --> 00:51:18,523
I have no right to host
your wedding anyway.

713
00:51:23,195 --> 00:51:27,115
Why'd a smart girl like you
break the engagement?

714
00:51:27,407 --> 00:51:29,509
It's a blessing
to marry a nice man

715
00:51:29,576 --> 00:51:31,178
and have kids!

716
00:51:31,245 --> 00:51:33,205
What the hell is this!

717
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,797
What? I kicked that?

718
00:51:43,215 --> 00:51:44,383
Wait.

719
00:51:46,677 --> 00:51:48,011
I can touch thing?

720
00:51:49,888 --> 00:51:51,056
Jin-ju!

721
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,683
Jin-ju!

722
00:51:53,016 --> 00:51:55,060
Can you hear me?

723
00:51:55,644 --> 00:51:56,770
I can touch thing!

724
00:51:57,271 --> 00:51:58,580
- How could you?
- Jin-ju!

725
00:51:58,647 --> 00:52:00,916
Why ruin your chance?

726
00:52:00,983 --> 00:52:03,001
- Can you hear me?
- Min-wook was devastated!

727
00:52:03,068 --> 00:52:06,738
- Can you see me?
- It's over between us.

728
00:52:07,364 --> 00:52:09,633
- Can you see?
- Can you do the same to your mom?

729
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,968
- Jin-ju! Concentrate!
- Don't change the subject.

730
00:52:12,035 --> 00:52:16,139
- Why'd you break your engagement?
- Why bring up my mom?

731
00:52:16,206 --> 00:52:18,433
- I didn't live for this!
- I choose to be single!

732
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:23,230
- Can you hear me?
- I'm not getting married!

733
00:52:23,297 --> 00:52:25,716
- Can you see me?
- Forget it! I'm sleeping!

734
00:52:26,091 --> 00:52:27,259
Just sleep!

735
00:52:27,843 --> 00:52:30,137
- Can you see me?
- How can you sleep?

736
00:52:30,595 --> 00:52:32,572
Jin-ju! Can you hear me?

737
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,724
Hey!

738
00:52:50,866 --> 00:52:52,242
Ms. Park Bok-ja?

739
00:52:54,536 --> 00:52:56,163
You startled me.

740
00:52:57,039 --> 00:52:58,332
Why are you here?

741
00:52:58,999 --> 00:53:00,308
I came to escort you back.

742
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:02,502
You said you'd come
after 3 nights.

743
00:53:03,837 --> 00:53:07,274
Then why didn't you keep good pace

744
00:53:07,341 --> 00:53:09,401
and mess up the calendar?

745
00:53:09,468 --> 00:53:11,511
Pace? Calendar?

746
00:53:12,387 --> 00:53:13,764
What are you saying?

747
00:53:15,766 --> 00:53:19,561
While I was in Jeju Island,
you made a big mistake.

748
00:53:19,978 --> 00:53:22,397
You're under
special management now.

749
00:53:22,731 --> 00:53:24,791
They want you to return now.
Let's go.

750
00:53:24,858 --> 00:53:25,901
Dang!

751
00:53:26,193 --> 00:53:28,862
Hey! Why cut a day short?

752
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,215
I couldn't talk to her
or touch her!

753
00:53:32,282 --> 00:53:33,700
What mistake?

754
00:53:34,034 --> 00:53:35,452
I'm not going!

755
00:53:36,953 --> 00:53:38,038
Ms. Park Bok-ja!

756
00:53:38,705 --> 00:53:39,623
Please...

757
00:53:41,249 --> 00:53:42,584
Ma'am!

758
00:53:42,834 --> 00:53:43,960
Wait!

759
00:53:44,252 --> 00:53:45,854
You touched!

760
00:53:45,921 --> 00:53:48,648
- Touched what?
- Correction.

761
00:53:48,715 --> 00:53:49,733
You kicked.

762
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,735
You kicked a bucket!

763
00:53:51,802 --> 00:53:53,261
They're upset up there!

764
00:53:53,678 --> 00:53:55,864
So what if I kicked it!

765
00:53:55,931 --> 00:53:57,657
What's wrong with that?

766
00:53:57,724 --> 00:53:59,701
Please keep your distance.

767
00:53:59,768 --> 00:54:00,936
You're too close.

768
00:54:03,522 --> 00:54:05,144
You got too worked up and angry,

769
00:54:05,211 --> 00:54:07,147
so your vitals exceeded capacity

770
00:54:07,214 --> 00:54:09,044
for the anomaly.

771
00:54:09,111 --> 00:54:10,211
Do you understand?

772
00:54:10,278 --> 00:54:11,238
No, I don't!

773
00:54:11,863 --> 00:54:14,341
Anyway,
it's a dangerous situation.

774
00:54:14,408 --> 00:54:18,412
It's deadly to my work evaluation!

775
00:54:19,204 --> 00:54:22,124
This is my first case
on my new post.

776
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:24,267
It's upsetting.

777
00:54:24,334 --> 00:54:27,020
You're pissed off? So am I!

778
00:54:27,087 --> 00:54:29,147
I'm not sure what you mean,
but I feel something.

779
00:54:29,214 --> 00:54:30,674
Just go away!

780
00:54:32,175 --> 00:54:34,886
This will make it harder for you!

781
00:54:36,763 --> 00:54:37,697
It's obstruction of justice!

782
00:54:37,764 --> 00:54:39,141
Think you can scare me?

783
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:41,643
Get lost!

784
00:54:42,686 --> 00:54:43,661
Ms. Park?

785
00:54:43,728 --> 00:54:45,814
Granny!

786
00:54:46,481 --> 00:54:49,067
I'm not joking here.

787
00:54:51,111 --> 00:54:53,488
Granny! Please!

788
00:55:00,328 --> 00:55:02,372
Where are you going?

789
00:55:03,498 --> 00:55:04,282
I'm running away from you

790
00:55:04,349 --> 00:55:05,809
with some soju. Why?

791
00:55:05,876 --> 00:55:07,828
Let's run away together!
I love soju!

792
00:55:07,895 --> 00:55:09,270
Wait!

793
00:55:09,337 --> 00:55:10,380
Ms. Park?

794
00:55:11,715 --> 00:55:12,841
Hello?

795
00:55:15,635 --> 00:55:19,723
Where are we going
to drink this early?

796
00:55:21,141 --> 00:55:22,184
Wait up.

797
00:55:22,893 --> 00:55:23,868
Did you bring snacks?

798
00:55:23,935 --> 00:55:26,454
Guide! Where are they going?

799
00:55:26,521 --> 00:55:27,914
I don't know.

800
00:55:27,981 --> 00:55:30,942
Is it your strategy
to keep acting clueless?

801
00:55:31,151 --> 00:55:33,361
- If so, as your guide I...
- Hey!

802
00:55:33,695 --> 00:55:35,864
I can hit you, right?

803
00:55:37,824 --> 00:55:40,994
If you do, I can strike back.

804
00:55:42,245 --> 00:55:43,914
What the hell!

805
00:55:44,331 --> 00:55:46,724
We don't use the 'h' word, ma'am.

806
00:55:46,791 --> 00:55:49,836
Please don't say that
to a heavenly guide like me.

807
00:55:50,754 --> 00:55:52,088
It's upsetting.

808
00:55:53,256 --> 00:55:54,774
I will let the two times
you said it slide.

809
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:57,093
If you say that one more time,
I'll have to report you.

810
00:55:57,636 --> 00:55:59,179
Oh, really?

811
00:56:00,764 --> 00:56:02,432
The hell with you!

812
00:56:05,769 --> 00:56:07,729
I'll let it go this last time.

813
00:56:08,146 --> 00:56:09,314
Ma'am!

814
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:11,274
Whoa!

815
00:56:12,234 --> 00:56:13,818
Where are we?

816
00:56:17,656 --> 00:56:19,074
Hello, ma'am.

817
00:56:21,993 --> 00:56:25,013
What a great view!

818
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,514
So this is where I am.

819
00:56:26,581 --> 00:56:29,834
You're buried in
a nice, sunny place.

820
00:56:30,168 --> 00:56:33,771
- I hope you like it, ma'am.
- Thanks.

821
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:35,840
Is today
the anniversary of her passing?

822
00:56:36,424 --> 00:56:37,592
It's her birthday.

823
00:56:39,135 --> 00:56:40,053
Wow.

824
00:56:41,221 --> 00:56:42,363
What a good daughter!

825
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:44,015
Not me. No way.

826
00:56:46,518 --> 00:56:50,313
If I cooked for my mom's birthday
just once,

827
00:56:50,772 --> 00:56:52,107
I'd have no regrets.

828
00:56:53,733 --> 00:56:54,693
What?

829
00:56:55,026 --> 00:56:59,072
Stop dwelling on dead son's balls.

830
00:56:59,406 --> 00:57:02,175
Dead son's what?

831
00:57:02,242 --> 00:57:03,785
Balls!

832
00:57:15,964 --> 00:57:19,676
She'd always call on my birthdays

833
00:57:20,385 --> 00:57:21,402
and said to eat noodles.

834
00:57:21,469 --> 00:57:23,013
Happy birthday, my daughter
and said to eat noodles.

835
00:57:23,513 --> 00:57:25,265
She always made some.

836
00:57:26,766 --> 00:57:29,686
She said you live longer
by eating noodles on birthdays.

837
00:57:30,312 --> 00:57:32,480
You remembered that?

838
00:57:32,981 --> 00:57:35,317
Then we should've brought
some noodles.

839
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:39,195
For what? She's gone.

840
00:57:40,989 --> 00:57:42,324
It's too late.

841
00:57:44,075 --> 00:57:46,703
Ma'am! I'll take a drink.

842
00:57:47,495 --> 00:57:48,747
Jin-ju!

843
00:57:48,955 --> 00:57:51,666
I never wanted that anyway.

844
00:57:52,208 --> 00:57:56,921
Stop thinking about that
and go back to the States.

845
00:57:58,965 --> 00:58:01,593
It's so damn frustrating!

846
00:58:06,931 --> 00:58:07,991
What!

847
00:58:08,058 --> 00:58:10,310
- Let's go.
- I'm about to blow!

848
00:58:12,228 --> 00:58:14,022
Don't blow. Let's go.

849
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:27,869
What the?

850
00:58:28,495 --> 00:58:30,038
Cho-rong!

851
00:58:31,665 --> 00:58:33,291
Whose dog is that?

852
00:58:35,502 --> 00:58:38,146
Isn't she cute?
It's my mom's friend's dog.

853
00:58:38,213 --> 00:58:39,464
It's cute.

854
00:58:44,135 --> 00:58:46,112
Don't bark at me.

855
00:58:46,179 --> 00:58:48,765
It's okay! She's my friend. Stop.

856
00:58:50,558 --> 00:58:52,394
She's smart.

857
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:57,148
Where is she going?

858
00:58:59,859 --> 00:59:02,420
What? You recognize me?

859
00:59:02,487 --> 00:59:05,532
Cho-rong! You're still alive!

860
00:59:05,865 --> 00:59:07,409
How've you been?

861
00:59:08,576 --> 00:59:11,137
Ma'am! What's wrong with it?

862
00:59:11,204 --> 00:59:12,372
Let go of me!

863
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:17,836
Why? You don't like him?

864
00:59:18,878 --> 00:59:19,838
No?

865
00:59:21,464 --> 00:59:23,466
Cho-rong!
You want to bite him?

866
00:59:24,759 --> 00:59:25,802
Good girl!

867
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:28,096
Look!

868
00:59:29,431 --> 00:59:30,890
She's excited.

869
00:59:41,568 --> 00:59:42,986
I broke it.

870
00:59:43,194 --> 00:59:45,405
Then how are we going to eat?

871
00:59:49,617 --> 00:59:52,036
I know it's not broken.

872
00:59:56,666 --> 00:59:58,042
Dang dog.

873
01:00:00,754 --> 01:00:02,688
This is my final warning.

874
01:00:02,755 --> 01:00:05,008
Let's go now.

875
01:00:06,801 --> 01:00:10,221
Why are you covering your behind?

876
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:14,809
That's not important.

877
01:00:15,226 --> 01:00:16,869
If you don't go back now,

878
01:00:16,936 --> 01:00:19,898
they'll send someone and drag you

879
01:00:20,982 --> 01:00:23,151
by the head, ma'am.

880
01:00:23,651 --> 01:00:24,544
What's with you?

881
01:00:24,611 --> 01:00:26,129
- Let's see.
- Why?

882
01:00:26,196 --> 01:00:27,989
- Let me see.
- Why! No!

883
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,094
- Did you poo in your pants?
- That's crazy!

884
01:00:33,161 --> 01:00:35,012
Let me see!

885
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:36,139
Let go!

886
01:00:36,206 --> 01:00:38,708
Why are you so strong?

887
01:00:47,091 --> 01:00:47,984
Let's go now.

888
01:00:48,051 --> 01:00:48,985
I can't!

889
01:00:49,052 --> 01:00:50,720
I don't believe this!

890
01:00:51,262 --> 01:00:53,348
If you were me, can you go?

891
01:00:54,015 --> 01:00:55,003
When your kid is barely alive

892
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:56,684
on depression pills?

893
01:00:57,185 --> 01:00:58,661
What if her depression gets worse

894
01:00:58,728 --> 01:01:01,564
and she jumps off a bridge?

895
01:01:01,898 --> 01:01:04,834
That's called accessory to murder!

896
01:01:04,901 --> 01:01:05,918
You know?

897
01:01:05,985 --> 01:01:08,671
How is that
an accessory to murder?

898
01:01:08,738 --> 01:01:10,798
Headquarters?
Is that an accessory to murder?

899
01:01:10,865 --> 01:01:12,158
Why ask?

900
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:14,594
Listen.

901
01:01:14,661 --> 01:01:17,346
I have to pull out
the peg of pains

902
01:01:17,413 --> 01:01:18,665
stuck in her heart!

903
01:01:19,165 --> 01:01:21,292
Don't you have any sense?

904
01:01:21,918 --> 01:01:23,394
I'm not going even if I die!

905
01:01:23,461 --> 01:01:24,604
Ma'am, you're already dead.

906
01:01:24,671 --> 01:01:27,899
You saw your tomb
at a nice, sunny spot.

907
01:01:27,966 --> 01:01:28,883
Oh, really?

908
01:01:29,968 --> 01:01:31,135
Fine!

909
01:01:32,762 --> 01:01:35,531
Cho-rong! Where are you?

910
01:01:35,598 --> 01:01:37,575
The underwear man misses you!

911
01:01:37,642 --> 01:01:38,534
Ma'am.

912
01:01:38,601 --> 01:01:41,287
Come quickly!
There's lots to eat here.

913
01:01:41,354 --> 01:01:42,246
Stop.

914
01:01:42,313 --> 01:01:43,206
- Cho-rong!
- Don't.

915
01:01:43,273 --> 01:01:45,984
- Cho-rong! Where are you?
- Please!

916
01:01:46,401 --> 01:01:47,794
Come quickly, Cho-rong!

917
01:01:47,861 --> 01:01:50,572
Okay, okay!

918
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:52,131
Okay?

919
01:01:52,198 --> 01:01:56,219
I don't have the manual on that.

920
01:01:56,286 --> 01:01:59,096
I'll have to go and ask,
so please!

921
01:01:59,163 --> 01:02:01,891
Stay here quietly
and don't make trouble.

922
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:03,476
Don't kick buckets!

923
01:02:03,543 --> 01:02:04,936
Don't call Cho-rong!

924
01:02:05,003 --> 01:02:07,505
Be good.
Get going.

925
01:02:13,261 --> 01:02:14,762
This is mine.

926
01:02:17,348 --> 01:02:18,433
Where is she?

927
01:02:19,267 --> 01:02:20,201
Who?

928
01:02:20,268 --> 01:02:21,394
Where is your daughter?

929
01:02:22,145 --> 01:02:23,396
Over there.

930
01:02:23,646 --> 01:02:25,064
Why? Do you want to play cupid?

931
01:02:25,273 --> 01:02:26,749
Worry about yourself!

932
01:02:26,816 --> 01:02:29,319
Where'd he go this time?

933
01:02:34,324 --> 01:02:37,160
I could've taken a cab.

934
01:02:38,786 --> 01:02:41,205
Give me the cab fare.

935
01:02:42,749 --> 01:02:44,667
I was just being polite.

936
01:02:45,793 --> 01:02:47,478
Aren't you coming to Seoul?

937
01:02:47,545 --> 01:02:49,547
I have no reason to go.

938
01:02:50,965 --> 01:02:52,258
What about me?

939
01:02:52,383 --> 01:02:54,218
You came here. Why would I go?

940
01:02:54,802 --> 01:02:56,362
You're so cold.

941
01:02:56,429 --> 01:02:57,864
That's what my mom would say.

942
01:02:57,931 --> 01:02:59,766
Glad you know.

943
01:03:06,731 --> 01:03:07,941
It was fun, Mi-jin.

944
01:03:08,608 --> 01:03:09,651
See you.

945
01:03:12,946 --> 01:03:14,072
Take care.

946
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,531
Go home safely.

947
01:03:51,776 --> 01:03:53,695
It's your favorite song.

948
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:34,110
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

949
01:04:34,819 --> 01:04:36,863
Looks delicious.

950
01:04:44,537 --> 01:04:47,790
(Mom)

951
01:05:33,002 --> 01:05:36,839
The person you have called
can't be reached...

952
01:06:08,955 --> 01:06:11,249
Why the hell are you doing this?

953
01:06:13,084 --> 01:06:15,837
Can't I bring some food
for my daughter?

954
01:06:16,504 --> 01:06:19,106
Do we have a natural relationship?

955
01:06:19,173 --> 01:06:20,508
You think?

956
01:06:21,467 --> 01:06:23,261
Then what relationship do we have?

957
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:26,556
Damn it!

958
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,201
Why'd you bring all this

959
01:06:30,268 --> 01:06:32,119
to my tiny studio?

960
01:06:32,186 --> 01:06:35,314
We're not close enough
to sleep under one blanket!

961
01:06:38,276 --> 01:06:41,487
Can't a mother and daughter
have a meal together?

962
01:06:42,697 --> 01:06:44,715
Can't we just chit-chat

963
01:06:44,782 --> 01:06:46,409
and sleep beside each other?

964
01:06:47,827 --> 01:06:51,622
Then you should've raised me
like other mothers.

965
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:18,999
(Karaoke)

966
01:07:19,066 --> 01:07:20,818
(Bar)

967
01:07:33,164 --> 01:07:34,999
Where is she going?

968
01:07:43,169 --> 01:07:44,266
(Open 24 hour)

969
01:07:48,721 --> 01:07:50,097
Thank you.

970
01:07:52,934 --> 01:07:55,186
May I take your order?

971
01:08:01,943 --> 01:08:04,862
That one, please.

972
01:08:06,447 --> 01:08:08,866
(Ice Cream Cone)

973
01:08:30,096 --> 01:08:33,094
(I'm on the bus back home)

974
01:08:33,161 --> 01:08:36,227
(Hope you eat and sleep tight
- Mom)

975
01:09:11,846 --> 01:09:13,431
You saw me?

976
01:09:15,474 --> 01:09:18,352
You were watching me?

977
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:23,190
I forgot the whole thing.

978
01:09:24,358 --> 01:09:27,403
Why keep remembering
such useless things?

979
01:09:29,739 --> 01:09:34,452
Moms forget all
the upsetting and sad stuff.

980
01:09:34,869 --> 01:09:36,287
We forget it all.

981
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:43,878
We only remember the good stuff
about our children.

982
01:09:45,171 --> 01:09:51,260
So let it all go, my dear.

983
01:09:57,725 --> 01:10:00,353
Jin-ju. Do you understand?

984
01:10:09,278 --> 01:10:11,072
You made tofu?

985
01:10:11,655 --> 01:10:12,798
It looks good.

986
01:10:12,865 --> 01:10:17,052
I was just packing some
to take to you.

987
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:18,595
I knew, so I came.

988
01:10:18,662 --> 01:10:20,456
You read my mind.

989
01:10:20,748 --> 01:10:22,854
Should I go and buy makgeolli

990
01:10:22,921 --> 01:10:24,752
to have this with kimchi?

991
01:10:28,005 --> 01:10:30,049
You really read my mind!

992
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,010
Have a seat.

993
01:10:33,344 --> 01:10:34,278
I'll be right back.

994
01:10:34,345 --> 01:10:36,806
You made it nice and firm.

995
01:10:37,765 --> 01:10:39,433
You're better than your mama.

996
01:10:45,773 --> 01:10:48,667
The pupil excels her master, Bok-ja!

997
01:10:48,734 --> 01:10:51,654
Of course my daughter
is better than me.

998
01:10:53,781 --> 01:10:55,157
Your mama...

999
01:10:55,699 --> 01:10:59,036
She used to love reading books.

1000
01:10:59,662 --> 01:11:02,973
She borrowed books

1001
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,126
and read them whenever she could.

1002
01:11:06,001 --> 01:11:09,396
You know the schoolyard statue

1003
01:11:09,463 --> 01:11:11,549
of siblings reading books?

1004
01:11:11,882 --> 01:11:14,318
She said it's like her
and her brother.

1005
01:11:14,385 --> 01:11:17,930
She said she had too many chores

1006
01:11:18,764 --> 01:11:20,766
and didn't have time to read books.

1007
01:11:21,308 --> 01:11:23,352
She hated that.

1008
01:11:24,145 --> 01:11:27,940
When we were told we couldn't go
to middle school and on,

1009
01:11:28,566 --> 01:11:33,028
I was okay,
but your mama got so mad.

1010
01:11:33,571 --> 01:11:35,781
After elementary school graduation,

1011
01:11:36,657 --> 01:11:38,217
she picked up a rock,

1012
01:11:38,284 --> 01:11:40,536
went up to that statue,

1013
01:11:40,953 --> 01:11:43,372
and chucked it hard!

1014
01:11:43,706 --> 01:11:46,876
One of the fingers on the girl
broke off.

1015
01:11:48,377 --> 01:11:50,838
Then Bok-ja left the village.

1016
01:11:51,464 --> 01:11:53,339
She worked at a city factory

1017
01:11:53,406 --> 01:11:56,635
and sent money home.

1018
01:11:57,011 --> 01:12:01,015
Your mama paid for
your uncle's schooling.

1019
01:12:01,307 --> 01:12:04,101
She never came back
until she got old.

1020
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:08,898
Your mama had strong pride like that.

1021
01:12:15,863 --> 01:12:18,949
I couldn't find a babysitter.

1022
01:12:21,202 --> 01:12:22,661
Good girl.

1023
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:28,183
Here. Buy some cookies.

1024
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:30,727
It's okay, ma'am. You don't have to.

1025
01:12:30,794 --> 01:12:32,729
It's okay.

1026
01:12:32,796 --> 01:12:34,423
It's because she's cute.

1027
01:12:35,257 --> 01:12:36,717
It's okay. Take it.

1028
01:12:37,801 --> 01:12:39,303
Say, "Thank you, ma'am."

1029
01:12:40,095 --> 01:12:41,680
Thank you, ma'am.

1030
01:12:42,389 --> 01:12:44,225
Listen well to your mom.

1031
01:12:45,392 --> 01:12:46,352
Thank you.

1032
01:12:56,362 --> 01:12:59,615
- Please wipe off the kimchi stain.
- Yes.

1033
01:13:00,157 --> 01:13:01,784
Ms. Park!

1034
01:13:02,368 --> 01:13:04,052
Why'd you wash this together!

1035
01:13:04,119 --> 01:13:05,888
It's all stained!

1036
01:13:05,955 --> 01:13:08,374
I don't believe this!

1037
01:13:11,335 --> 01:13:13,979
You've worked hard today.

1038
01:13:14,046 --> 01:13:15,647
Please finish off

1039
01:13:15,714 --> 01:13:18,384
and lock the door behind you.

1040
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:21,778
Ma'am?

1041
01:13:21,845 --> 01:13:24,114
This is probably not enough,

1042
01:13:24,181 --> 01:13:25,888
but please use it

1043
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:27,784
to buy a new shirt.

1044
01:13:27,851 --> 01:13:29,603
It's okay.

1045
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:31,897
That's not nearly enough.

1046
01:13:32,481 --> 01:13:33,499
Just take it and go.

1047
01:13:33,566 --> 01:13:34,650
I insist.

1048
01:13:35,526 --> 01:13:39,989
Though I'm poor and unschooled,
I don't rip people off.

1049
01:13:40,447 --> 01:13:42,157
I'll work for a few more days.

1050
01:13:43,784 --> 01:13:46,370
I'm sorry about today.

1051
01:13:46,954 --> 01:13:48,122
Ms. Park.

1052
01:13:48,956 --> 01:13:51,208
I get how you feel.

1053
01:13:51,917 --> 01:13:52,788
But showing strong pride

1054
01:13:52,855 --> 01:13:54,728
while working at someone else's house

1055
01:13:54,795 --> 01:13:57,047
makes things awkward.

1056
01:13:58,924 --> 01:14:00,175
Just take it.

1057
01:14:00,551 --> 01:14:01,594
No, ma'am.

1058
01:14:03,804 --> 01:14:05,691
Still, I will pay for what I must

1059
01:14:05,758 --> 01:14:08,559
before my child.

1060
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:11,103
Let's go, Jin-ju.

1061
01:14:12,271 --> 01:14:13,355
Bid her goodbye.

1062
01:14:18,193 --> 01:14:19,987
Mom? Wait.

1063
01:14:36,879 --> 01:14:40,341
Does this mean we can't pay rent?

1064
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,510
I'll make money again.

1065
01:14:44,219 --> 01:14:46,822
But the homeowner came

1066
01:14:46,889 --> 01:14:48,849
and yelled
this morning again.

1067
01:14:51,518 --> 01:14:53,203
If you raise his kids well,

1068
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:57,399
he promised to pay for
Jin-ju's schooling all she wants.

1069
01:14:58,067 --> 01:14:59,068
Really?

1070
01:14:59,652 --> 01:15:01,362
Will you move in with Jin-ju?

1071
01:15:01,904 --> 01:15:03,839
He asked about that.

1072
01:15:03,906 --> 01:15:06,049
He seemed worried

1073
01:15:06,116 --> 01:15:08,327
because
he has two kids and they're younger.

1074
01:15:08,952 --> 01:15:11,163
It's your choice to take her.

1075
01:15:12,164 --> 01:15:15,350
But if she'd be uncomfortable,
have her stay somewhere else.

1076
01:15:15,417 --> 01:15:17,519
He promised to pay for her college

1077
01:15:17,586 --> 01:15:21,840
and studying abroad if needed.

1078
01:15:22,758 --> 01:15:25,819
Since you're pretty and work well,

1079
01:15:25,886 --> 01:15:28,305
he really wants this to work.

1080
01:15:28,597 --> 01:15:30,198
Don't lose this opportunity.

1081
01:15:30,265 --> 01:15:33,060
As she got remarried,

1082
01:15:35,437 --> 01:15:41,402
she thought you'd be way better off
with her brother, the teacher.

1083
01:15:42,152 --> 01:15:45,698
Leaving her daughter like that,

1084
01:15:45,948 --> 01:15:49,952
Bok-ja was lonely her whole life.

1085
01:15:53,414 --> 01:15:55,682
If your mom didn't send money,

1086
01:15:55,749 --> 01:16:00,963
think your uncle's family
would've taken good care of you?

1087
01:16:01,672 --> 01:16:03,173
I know.

1088
01:16:08,804 --> 01:16:11,348
I questioned why she made
that decision.

1089
01:16:12,224 --> 01:16:14,852
I thought she was so stupid.

1090
01:16:16,103 --> 01:16:18,272
But after she passed away

1091
01:16:19,523 --> 01:16:23,444
and was gone, I understood.

1092
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,407
I realized she had no choice.

1093
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:33,370
She had no other choice.

1094
01:16:36,415 --> 01:16:37,833
No...

1095
01:16:40,002 --> 01:16:45,382
It's because
I didn't know any better.

1096
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,676
Still...

1097
01:16:48,385 --> 01:16:50,015
Why'd you go to America

1098
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:54,183
without even seeing your mama?

1099
01:16:55,434 --> 01:16:57,352
You should've seen her face then.

1100
01:16:58,437 --> 01:17:02,024
It turned dark as night.

1101
01:17:20,876 --> 01:17:23,295
She told me to stay and sleep,

1102
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:27,190
but she had a million things to do.

1103
01:17:27,257 --> 01:17:28,675
Of course.

1104
01:17:29,134 --> 01:17:31,970
She's so busy getting ready to go
to America.

1105
01:17:32,221 --> 01:17:34,448
I didn't want her to worry about
taking care of me too,

1106
01:17:34,515 --> 01:17:35,724
so I came back.

1107
01:17:36,099 --> 01:17:38,118
- Good thinking.
- See?

1108
01:17:38,185 --> 01:17:40,857
Jin-ju bought this bread for me

1109
01:17:40,924 --> 01:17:44,291
to share with you.

1110
01:17:44,358 --> 01:17:48,654
Oh, really! She thought of me too?

1111
01:17:49,154 --> 01:17:51,256
Of course you should let her be.

1112
01:17:51,323 --> 01:17:53,534
You saw her, so it's fine.

1113
01:17:54,368 --> 01:17:58,163
Here! A toast to a professor's mama!

1114
01:17:58,831 --> 01:18:02,184
She's not just any professor!

1115
01:18:02,251 --> 01:18:05,562
She's a professor at Ucla, America!

1116
01:18:05,629 --> 01:18:06,713
Right!

1117
01:18:09,716 --> 01:18:11,760
It snowed!

1118
01:18:13,262 --> 01:18:14,763
Oh my.

1119
01:18:20,477 --> 01:18:21,520
What's that?

1120
01:18:37,828 --> 01:18:41,415
(Bellflower extract)

1121
01:18:46,545 --> 01:18:48,213
You left it there?

1122
01:18:49,381 --> 01:18:52,175
Why didn't you see me
before you go?

1123
01:18:54,511 --> 01:18:56,346
Jeez.

1124
01:18:58,223 --> 01:19:00,809
There's so much I want to say.

1125
01:19:03,437 --> 01:19:05,522
But I have no way of telling you.

1126
01:19:07,524 --> 01:19:09,109
I guess...

1127
01:19:09,693 --> 01:19:12,195
I'll have to die to meet you, Mom.

1128
01:19:12,821 --> 01:19:15,949
What! Are you insane!

1129
01:19:22,664 --> 01:19:25,417
One more drink...

1130
01:19:26,335 --> 01:19:28,921
One more drink...

1131
01:19:31,632 --> 01:19:33,133
Thank you very much.

1132
01:19:34,301 --> 01:19:35,610
She drank a lot.

1133
01:19:35,677 --> 01:19:37,804
Looks like it.

1134
01:19:40,474 --> 01:19:44,937
Mama? You drank a lot, huh?

1135
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:47,439
Had a good time?

1136
01:20:16,677 --> 01:20:18,929
(Park Bok-ja)

1137
01:20:33,235 --> 01:20:36,863
"I can't reach her. Is she busy?"

1138
01:20:38,407 --> 01:20:41,702
"It snowed a lot.
Everything is white."

1139
01:20:43,078 --> 01:20:45,539
"Jin-ju would've loved seeing it."

1140
01:20:47,290 --> 01:20:49,626
"I gave birth and raised you."

1141
01:20:50,752 --> 01:20:52,713
"I love you."

1142
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:55,549
"But I'm heartbroken again
because of you."

1143
01:20:58,010 --> 01:21:00,512
"Why do you hate me, Jin-ju?"

1144
01:21:05,142 --> 01:21:07,144
It breaks my heart every time.

1145
01:21:09,521 --> 01:21:11,773
Oh, Ms. Park Bok-ja...

1146
01:21:15,944 --> 01:21:19,156
This is why you're stuck out here?

1147
01:21:25,579 --> 01:21:30,625
Why'd I write this
and torment you like this?

1148
01:21:34,838 --> 01:21:39,051
I'm totally useless to you.

1149
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:23,678
Did you ask?

1150
01:22:27,849 --> 01:22:30,018
Yes. It won't be accessory to murder.

1151
01:22:31,853 --> 01:22:33,830
Right. It's not your fault.

1152
01:22:33,897 --> 01:22:35,857
It's all my fault.

1153
01:22:41,488 --> 01:22:42,906
Come on.

1154
01:22:43,949 --> 01:22:45,826
You must go now.

1155
01:22:46,284 --> 01:22:48,078
Can we go after tonight?

1156
01:22:58,213 --> 01:23:01,591
Guide? Please help me!

1157
01:23:03,051 --> 01:23:04,177
She'll die

1158
01:23:04,573 --> 01:23:05,971
if I leave her like this!

1159
01:23:06,847 --> 01:23:08,390
You saw everything.

1160
01:23:09,099 --> 01:23:12,227
I'll go back and take the punishment.

1161
01:23:13,311 --> 01:23:16,956
I don't care if I become dust!

1162
01:23:17,023 --> 01:23:22,445
I have to tell my daughter
it's okay.

1163
01:23:24,406 --> 01:23:25,782
That I'm fine.

1164
01:23:27,367 --> 01:23:29,995
Please let me tell her that.

1165
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:36,960
There has to be a way.

1166
01:23:37,711 --> 01:23:39,462
I can't go like this.

1167
01:23:40,881 --> 01:23:42,382
I'm not leaving.

1168
01:23:43,967 --> 01:23:46,471
I wanted to help

1169
01:23:46,538 --> 01:23:48,847
so I discussed it
with my seniors.

1170
01:23:51,308 --> 01:23:54,102
They said humans have a lot of
affection

1171
01:23:54,686 --> 01:23:55,729
and attachments.

1172
01:23:59,065 --> 01:24:01,735
Please, Mr. Angel!

1173
01:24:02,235 --> 01:24:04,295
I'm sorry I cursed at you.

1174
01:24:04,362 --> 01:24:06,406
I swear I'll never curse again!

1175
01:24:06,865 --> 01:24:08,283
Tell me how!

1176
01:24:09,659 --> 01:24:11,286
Tell me!

1177
01:24:11,828 --> 01:24:13,955
Please! I have to tell her.

1178
01:24:22,005 --> 01:24:26,259
If you talk to your daughter...

1179
01:24:26,468 --> 01:24:27,469
Yes?

1180
01:24:30,513 --> 01:24:32,474
You'll lose your vacations here.

1181
01:24:32,641 --> 01:24:33,975
It's okay.

1182
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:38,021
I can meet Jin-ju later
when she comes as a granny.

1183
01:24:38,396 --> 01:24:40,106
No, that's not it.

1184
01:24:41,775 --> 01:24:43,777
If you meet her now,

1185
01:24:45,528 --> 01:24:47,948
she'll be erased forever

1186
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:50,575
from your memory.

1187
01:24:51,826 --> 01:24:54,220
Even if she comes to heaven later,

1188
01:24:54,287 --> 01:24:55,705
you won't recognize her.

1189
01:24:56,414 --> 01:24:58,416
You miss her so much even now...

1190
01:24:59,417 --> 01:25:01,836
If she's erased from your memory,

1191
01:25:03,296 --> 01:25:08,260
she becomes non-existent to you.

1192
01:25:11,471 --> 01:25:13,265
Human ties are sharing memories.

1193
01:25:25,819 --> 01:25:27,237
Are you okay?

1194
01:25:58,435 --> 01:25:59,853
Let's do it.

1195
01:26:02,522 --> 01:26:04,607
What's more important?

1196
01:26:05,859 --> 01:26:08,653
Jin-ju living a happy life
means more.

1197
01:26:10,822 --> 01:26:14,117
Let's do it. What do I do?

1198
01:26:17,203 --> 01:26:18,830
Jeez.

1199
01:26:24,044 --> 01:26:25,962
My seniors warned me

1200
01:26:26,755 --> 01:26:31,009
that parents' hearts
can't be controlled.

1201
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:06,294
Mom?

1202
01:27:16,513 --> 01:27:18,098
Where'd you go all this time?

1203
01:27:23,561 --> 01:27:25,271
Were you waiting for me?

1204
01:27:29,484 --> 01:27:30,443
Did you eat?

1205
01:27:31,111 --> 01:27:32,779
I'm not hungry.

1206
01:27:34,155 --> 01:27:36,449
You need to eat
your birthday soup.

1207
01:27:37,367 --> 01:27:39,494
I waited all day for you.

1208
01:27:40,161 --> 01:27:43,498
You'll make seaweed soup for me?

1209
01:27:44,624 --> 01:27:46,392
It's all ready to be made.

1210
01:27:46,459 --> 01:27:47,419
Really?

1211
01:27:48,002 --> 01:27:51,881
Hold on.
I'll make your birthday seaweed soup.

1212
01:27:52,424 --> 01:27:54,134
I also made noodles.

1213
01:28:37,802 --> 01:28:40,221
You're good!

1214
01:28:41,014 --> 01:28:42,865
It smells so good.

1215
01:28:42,932 --> 01:28:44,893
Like mother, like daughter.

1216
01:28:46,686 --> 01:28:48,396
Go on. Try it.

1217
01:29:00,325 --> 01:29:01,592
Good, huh?

1218
01:29:01,659 --> 01:29:02,744
It's great!

1219
01:29:03,953 --> 01:29:08,958
How'd you think of cooking
for me on my birthday?

1220
01:29:09,751 --> 01:29:12,086
I've always wanted to do this,

1221
01:29:12,962 --> 01:29:14,714
though you probably didn't know.

1222
01:29:15,715 --> 01:29:17,550
You probably didn't know,

1223
01:29:19,093 --> 01:29:22,722
but I've always wanted
you to cook a meal for my birthday.

1224
01:29:24,432 --> 01:29:25,517
I'm glad.

1225
01:29:27,393 --> 01:29:28,394
Wait,

1226
01:29:29,145 --> 01:29:31,022
hold on, Mom.

1227
01:29:34,484 --> 01:29:37,820
I worked so hard to make this.

1228
01:29:38,696 --> 01:29:39,989
I hope you enjoy it.

1229
01:29:40,532 --> 01:29:42,507
Should I give it a go?

1230
01:29:42,574 --> 01:29:44,051
Give it a go.

1231
01:29:44,118 --> 01:29:45,662
Okay.

1232
01:30:02,262 --> 01:30:03,321
Perfect.

1233
01:30:03,388 --> 01:30:04,906
Does it taste like yours?

1234
01:30:04,973 --> 01:30:07,684
Yes, exactly. It's delicious.

1235
01:30:12,355 --> 01:30:14,983
Try this.

1236
01:30:15,608 --> 01:30:16,651
Go on.

1237
01:30:23,157 --> 01:30:24,409
Is it good?

1238
01:30:25,702 --> 01:30:26,744
Well done.

1239
01:30:27,704 --> 01:30:29,122
That's it. Eat up!

1240
01:30:31,874 --> 01:30:34,419
You came to mind a lot
when I was in the States.

1241
01:30:39,591 --> 01:30:40,983
But...

1242
01:30:41,050 --> 01:30:44,679
I didn't think about things
that made me angry or upset.

1243
01:30:46,431 --> 01:30:48,266
I only remembered the good stuff.

1244
01:30:53,521 --> 01:30:55,648
But I couldn't call you.

1245
01:30:56,816 --> 01:30:58,610
I thought I'd call you the next day,

1246
01:31:00,194 --> 01:31:02,238
then the next day...

1247
01:31:03,281 --> 01:31:04,866
But time just passed.

1248
01:31:07,952 --> 01:31:09,245
Jin-ju.

1249
01:31:11,998 --> 01:31:17,045
I never abandoned you
even in my dreams.

1250
01:31:20,423 --> 01:31:22,467
I just wanted you to study well

1251
01:31:23,259 --> 01:31:29,849
and live a different life from mine.

1252
01:31:31,851 --> 01:31:32,935
I know.

1253
01:31:35,021 --> 01:31:36,022
Mom.

1254
01:31:39,651 --> 01:31:41,277
It's because I was childish.

1255
01:31:47,283 --> 01:31:48,618
Look!

1256
01:31:50,119 --> 01:31:53,998
I'm all grown up thanks to you.

1257
01:31:59,837 --> 01:32:02,715
I'm living a great life

1258
01:32:03,466 --> 01:32:06,052
that you sacrificed yours for, Mom.

1259
01:32:08,221 --> 01:32:13,810
I knew that,
but I made you lonely.

1260
01:32:18,481 --> 01:32:19,816
I'm sorry, Mom.

1261
01:32:21,901 --> 01:32:22,902
Mom.

1262
01:32:25,321 --> 01:32:27,198
Thank you.

1263
01:32:30,493 --> 01:32:31,744
Thank you.

1264
01:32:33,996 --> 01:32:36,249
Thank you so much for saying that.

1265
01:32:37,375 --> 01:32:40,044
My baby girl, Jin-ju.

1266
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:45,967
Mom.

1267
01:32:46,801 --> 01:32:47,927
Thank you.

1268
01:32:49,303 --> 01:32:50,237
It's cold.

1269
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,764
I'm fine.

1270
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:53,558
It's so cold.

1271
01:33:00,648 --> 01:33:02,442
(Erasing memories of
Park Bok-ja's daughter)

1272
01:33:10,575 --> 01:33:12,702
Go to sleep, Jin-ju.

1273
01:33:14,662 --> 01:33:16,122
I'm not sleepy.

1274
01:33:18,332 --> 01:33:20,668
Your eyes are drooping.

1275
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,675
I'm so happy.

1276
01:33:28,259 --> 01:33:30,720
Seeing you happy makes me happy.

1277
01:33:35,975 --> 01:33:37,894
Your eyes are the same
as before.

1278
01:33:38,728 --> 01:33:40,438
Your nose, too.

1279
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:42,690
You too.

1280
01:33:44,817 --> 01:33:46,652
Sleep tight, my baby.

1281
01:33:50,406 --> 01:33:51,616
Mom.

1282
01:33:54,118 --> 01:33:56,496
Don't go anywhere.

1283
01:34:01,626 --> 01:34:02,752
Let's travel...

1284
01:34:04,170 --> 01:34:06,422
to the sea...

1285
01:34:07,673 --> 01:34:09,675
and other places...

1286
01:34:26,901 --> 01:34:28,861
Take good care.

1287
01:34:32,782 --> 01:34:34,575
Don't be sorry.

1288
01:34:35,993 --> 01:34:37,370
Have a happy life.

1289
01:34:38,996 --> 01:34:44,418
I cried enough tears
for the both of us in life.

1290
01:34:47,505 --> 01:34:49,465
So Jin-ju,

1291
01:34:54,428 --> 01:34:56,389
smile and live happily.

1292
01:34:59,183 --> 01:35:00,518
Promise?

1293

I'm sleeping over.

1300
01:39:47,555 --> 01:39:49,656
You told me to visit.

I loved seeing you on my vacation)

1302

Okay.
