When I first saw you in the arena,

00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,360
I needed an identity.

58
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,950
Being a slave to a noble lady

59
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,490
could perfectly conceal my true purpose.

60
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,120
What purpose?

61
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,159
To kill the Eldest Prince,

62
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,320
the future Crown Prince.

63
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,240
Why?

64
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,800
My mother was from the Yue Tribe.

65
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,510
When I was born,

66
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,800
the imperial astronomers said
I was a bad omen for Daning.

67
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,000
So my father, the Emperor, rejected me.

68
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,120
Later, my mother
was rescued by her people,

69
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,380
but she left me behind.

70
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,830
The Eldest Prince, for his amusement,

71
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,390
threw me into the arena.

72
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,120
But he never expected me to survive,

73
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,270
let alone be rescued
by the Yue Tribe later.

74
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,390
So that's how it was.

75
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,370
It's all right now.

It's all in the past.

77
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,920
So,

78

you're now relying
on the Yue State's power

79
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,000
to kill the Eldest Prince

80
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,720
and the emperor?

81
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,190
You don't like it when I kill people,

82
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:41,680

That's not it.

84
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,230
They corrupt the country

85
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,130
and oppress the people.

86
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,810
They deserve to die.

87
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,510
But can you promise me

88
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,720
not to harm any innocent people?

89
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,520
All right.

90

I promise you.

There are many ways to kill them.

I'll just use a different method.

93
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,930
Then I have one last question.

94

birthday celebration.

171
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,120
I would like

172
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,640
to toast everyone first.

173
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,460
I, Yan Hui, as a junior,

174
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,390
thank all my elders
and fellow colleagues here.

175
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,000
Everyone, cheers!

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,340
Happy birthday, Hui.

177
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,120
Don't worry, Chief Commander.

178
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,750
I've secretly replaced my wine with water.

179
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,750
Hui,

180
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,960
do you remember

181
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,360
the birthday gift

182
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,960
I prepared for you last year?

183
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,030
Of course I remember.

184
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,630
Whatever you give me,

185
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,360
I'll keep it safe.

186
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,750
Keep it?

187
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,480
Didn't you eat it all right away?

188
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:22,790
Oh no.

189
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,120
Master.

190
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,720
I misspoke.

191
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,600
The Eldest Prince is here.

192
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,330
The Eldest Prince has arrived.

193
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,460
The Eldest Prince is here.

194
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,870
Do you dare look again?

195
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,800

196
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,870
Try looking again!
