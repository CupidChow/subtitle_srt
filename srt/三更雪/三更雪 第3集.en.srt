[Episode 3]

3
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,079
Hurry up!

4
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,160
Stop!

5
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,140
Get up! Get up now!

6
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,590
No. 5! Get up now!

7
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,630
Why did he stop?

8
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,370
Young man, what's going on?

9
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,150
What are you doing?

10
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,360
Why did he stop?

11
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,960
Miss, what displeased you?

12
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,150
He didn't deserve

13
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,840
such a quick death.

14
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,520
I want to buy him.

15
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,560
Before you die,

16
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,910
I will return all the suffering

17
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,640
I endured in my past life to you.

18
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,750
Why is he chained up?

19
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,680
I don't know.

20
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,900
What's happening?

21
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,690
He must have offended someone.

22
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,560
My Lady,

23
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,360
why did you chain him up outside?

24
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,680
There are many people watching
on the street.

25
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,910
Are we going too far?

26
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,240
I want him to taste

27
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,150
the feeling of being humiliated in public.

28
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,940
[Lu's Mansion]

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
My Lady, I'll get you a mounting block.

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,630
No need.

31
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,310
You, come here.

32
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,840
Kneel.

33
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,250
Hold out your hands.

34
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,510
Clean the blood off yourself
before coming in.

35
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,050
[Lu's Mansion]

36
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,830
You're filthy.

37
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,480
That's my residence ahead.

38
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,750
From now on,

39
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,450
whether it's windy, rainy,
or freezing cold,

40
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,950
your residence

41
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,520
is right on this floor beneath my feet.

42
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,160
Be a good watchdog for me.

43
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,680
Master,

44
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,270
please give me a name.

45
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,270
Why does a slave need a name?

46
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,230
The arena owner called you No. 5,

47
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,120
so I'll call you Five from now on.

48
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,180
Thank you, Master.

49
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,070
The snow...

50
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
In my past life,

51
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,560
the first time I met Jun Che,

52
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,630
he made me kneel in the snow all night.

53
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,500
If you want to thank me,

54
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,600
do it sincerely.

55
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,450
Thank me on your knees.

56
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,630
Thank you, Master.

57
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,120
Shut up!

58
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,270
Yan Hui,

59
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,070
I would be better off dead.

60
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,120
I'm just like a walking corpse now.

61
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,560
Can Yan Hui bring you back from the dead?

62
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,950
If I catch you writing
to another man again,

63
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,680
Let it go!

64
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,430
I'll break your wings myself!

65
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,750
My Lady, what happened?

66
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,159
Bring me the horsewhip.

67
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,560
You killed my pigeon,

68
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,950
and prevented me
from sending letters home.

69
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,720
You imprisoned me while I was alive,

70
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,630
and wouldn't let me go even after I died.

71
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,240
Cutting you into a thousand pieces

72
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,300
wouldn't ease the hatred in my heart.

73
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,360
Master, it's just a baby

74
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,490
and nearly freezing to death.

75
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,830
Please save it.

76
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,560
Call someone.

77
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,830
Compared to my suffering,

78
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,100
this is merely a drop in the ocean.

79
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,680
I won't let you die easily.

[Lu's Mansion]

81
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,480
My Lady,

82
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,840
he looks seriously injured.

83
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,169
Should we call a doctor?

84
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,240
He defeated so many people.

85
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,370
He won't die easily.

86
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,080
But My Lady,

87
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,750
your cloak is still on him.

88
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,030
Should I get it back?

89
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,910
He has made it dirty.

90
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,970
Just leave it here.

91
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,550
So noisy.

[Sang Li, a witch from Yue State
and Jun Che's trusted aide]

Let us handle these scum.

108
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,530
You don't have to deal with them yourself.

109
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,750
I've found a new hideout.

110
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,440
This arena is no longer useful.

111
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,700
Sang Li, clean this place up thoroughly.

112

The most important thing now

113
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,550
is to lie low

114
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,860
and bide our time.

The situation will certainly be complex.

It's a perfect opportunity for us
to observe covertly

Why is there blood on your clothes?

137

It's from

138

an old wound.

139
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,590
It's nothing.

Does it hurt?
