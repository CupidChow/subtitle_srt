00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,200
I made this scent from ambergris.

174
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,480
It's one of a kind.

175
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,960
The one who'd leave this handkerchief here

176
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,120
could only be Sang Li when she

177
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,200
switched bodies
by the Heart-Binding Poison.

178

♪ Black hair turns to smoke,
love ends in sorrow ♪

179
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,600
Yan Hui,

180
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,840
are you sick with missing her?

181
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,630
If you miss her that much,

182
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:10,520
♪ By the Naihe Bridge,
no one has perfect love ♪

183
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,360
I can dig her up for you to see.

184
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,200
This is the handkerchief
you put under my pillow.

185
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:18,230
♪ This life's fate is shallow, sighing,
love hard to explain ♪

186
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,200
This is the one you gave me

187
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,030
when you pretended to be the mute girl.

188
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,200
They're identical.

189
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,640
♪ Before the Three Lives Stone,
time carved into light years ♪

191
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,630
Much better.

192
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,400
That's right.

193
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,750
I deliberately disguised myself
as a mute to trick you.

194
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:38,700
♪ In front of the Buddha, devoutly,
stranded before the Forgetting River ♪

195
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,870
I planned to poison you to death,

196
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,720
but accidentally,

197
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,360
I cured your eyes instead.

198
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,390
Kill me if you want. It's up to you.

199

♪ Three lifetimes searching,
only remembering your smile ♪

200
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,870
Why won't you admit it?

201
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,170
Weren't you always saying
you wanted me to marry you?

202
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,840
Sang Li,

203
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:54,020
♪ I would go against the heavens

are you threatened by someone?

205
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,510
Tell me.

206

As long as I'm here,

207
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,690
we'll face it together.

208
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:56,600

I would.

Jun Che's mother made you do this?

223
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,040
She threatened me using Yan Hui.

224
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,240
No one can get close to His Majesty now.

225
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
His Majesty is completely
under her control.

226
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,770
She wants to use His Majesty

227
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,670
to kill all Daning people
at tomorrow's Heaven Worship Ritual.

228

Yan Hui asked me to talk to you.

229
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,200
He said if I tell you the truth,

230
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,080
you would surely find a way.

231
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,510
I can't even see him now.

232
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,120
How can I persuade him?

233
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,330
Greetings, Your Majesty.

234
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,360
Your Majesty,

235
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,960
Her Grace told me to give this to you.

236
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,800
[Five]

237
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,200
Take this Calming Bead to Jun Che

238
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,760
and ask him to come see me.

239
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,240
If he doesn't come,

240
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,840
our relationship

241
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,630
is over forever.

242
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,390
This is the Calming Bead.

243
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,790
My mother obtained it for me.

244
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,840
It works very well.

245
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,550
If you keep it close to you,

246
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,510
I think those noises

247
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,910
might become less noisy.

248
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,480
Give out my order.

249
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,120
Pour this Heartbreak Powder

250
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,720
into the moat.

251
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,080
I want this water

252
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,510
to tear apart
the insides of anyone who drinks it,

253
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,510
and turn the dead bodies
to ash upon contact.

254
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,000
Your Majesty.

255
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,390
I knew you would come.

256
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,030
Threatening me?

257
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,910
Mother was right.

258
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,560
The one who poisoned
and cursed me wasn't her.

259
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,080
It was you.

260
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,480
The Yan Hui you saw before

261
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,150
was Sang Li in disguise.

262
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:27,750
Still quibbling!
