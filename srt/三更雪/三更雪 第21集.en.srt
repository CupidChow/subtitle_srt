00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,550
Mother was right.

4
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,070
She wasn't the one
who poisoned or hexed me.

Hurry.

The water from the moat

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,159

53
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,640
Issue the order.

54
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,550
Make everyone in the palace

57
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,850

58
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,320
and you will gain the empire.

Che.

60
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,610

all the water in the bowl.

63
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,950
you just said

64
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,210
only by killing them all could I do what?

65
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,850
Only then can you gain the entire empire!

66
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,020
This is spring water
I bestow upon you all.

67
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,700
Drink it.

68
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,820
Thank you, Your Majesty.

69
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,070
So sweet.

70
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,840
Mother, you're so happy.

71
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,040
You seem more like
the person who wll rule this land,

72
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,360
rather than me.

73
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,380
Mother, you want
to kill everyone in Daning,

74
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,490
including all the soldiers

75
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,560
and all the officials in the palace,

76
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,750
leaving only me,

77
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,370
a Drug Man controlled by you.

78
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,890
Then this world
will certainly be yours.

79
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,850
What does it have to do with me?

80
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,600
You...

81
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,480
Mother, you're wondering

82
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,500
why your medicine suddenly stopped working

83
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,080
and want to give me more?

84
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,830
How are you so lucid?

85
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,220
How is this possible?

86
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,250
With a mother like you,

87
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,480
no wonder Jun Che
became a tyrant in his previous life.

88
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,070
I've been wondering

89
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,840
what kind of mother

90
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,659
would cause him such suffering.

91
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,540
Today I finally see clearly.

92
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,360
They say even tigers don't eat their cubs,

93
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,070
but you not only devoured yours,

94
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,000
you didn't even spit out the bones.

95
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,510
Who are you really?

96
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,930
Weren't you the one
who put drugs in my bath,

97
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,920
making Jun Che confused

98
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,510
and hallucinate?

99
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,500
Weren't you the one
who made Sang Li control Yan Hui,

100
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,860
having him lie in my bed

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,600
to drive a wedge between Jun Che and me?

102
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,350
Lu Yingying.

103
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,360
Where is Jun Che?

104
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,450
You think you're
the only one who can control him?

105
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,480
It was all my foolishness.

106
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,870
I listened to the Saintess

107
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,310
and controlled Yan Hui's body

108
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,600
to pressure His Majesty.

109
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,760
She threatened you
with my brother's life.

110
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,490
That's why
you were forced to control my brother.

111
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,390
Control?

112
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,430
Do you still have
the Heart-Binding Poison?

113
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,310
The Heart-Binding Poison can only
be used on one person in a lifetime.

114
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,000
I've already used mine on Yan Hui.

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,830
I mean

116
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,830
a brand new Heart-Binding Poison worm.

117
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,250
You want to control His Majesty

118
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,720
the same way I controlled Yan Hui?

119
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,360
Yes.

120
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,080
His Majesty is unconscious.

121
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,620
Watch over him carefully.

122
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,770
You're the Empress?

123
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,560
Guards!

124
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,190
Seize her...

125
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,250
-Freeze!
-Freeze!

126
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,480
All your men have been captured.

127
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,480
Sang Li.

128
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,160
Don't forget

129
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,920
your lover's life

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,480
is still in my hands.

131
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,360
I see now.

132
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,490
So you've been in cahoots all along.

133
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,710
I was once deceived
by the former emperor of Daning.

134
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,590
And now I'm being deceived by you again.

135
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,169
People of Daning are truly cunning.

136
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,250
You all truly deserve to die.

137
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,080
The guilty party accuses first.

138
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,090
You're the one who wants
to kill the people of Daning.

139
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,530
How is that the Daning people's fault?

140
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,620
What do you know?

141
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,640
I was once the Saintess of Yue State.

142
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,490
I should have been respected.

143
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,150
But what did
that bastard emperor of Daning

144
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,220
do to me?

145
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,120
He abducted me by force

146
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,380
and forced me to bear that bastard child.

147
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,150
How could his blood alone

148
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,390
be enough to repay
all the humiliation I've suffered?

149
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,060
But the common people
of Daning are innocent.

150
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,970
Innocent?

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,150
They enjoy the benefits of Daning.

152
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,080
They kneel before
that bastard emperor every day.

153
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,380
How are they innocent?

154
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,840
That's absurd.

155
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,900
What about Jun Che?

156
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,510
Your own flesh and blood.

157
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,720
What flesh and blood?

158
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,090
When has he ever treated me as his mother?

159
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,120
From the moment he saw me,

160
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,320
he couldn't wait to throw me in prison.

161
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,440
When he was a child,
you treated him as a Drug Man,

162
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,030
used him, and then abandoned him.

163
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,360
Now he wants to put you in prison.

164
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,510
How is that wrong?

165
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,090
I can actually understand you.

166
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,670
You finally managed
to come out of seclusion.

167
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,390
But your enemy is dead.

168
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,120
The resentment in your heart
is hard to dissolve.

169
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,440
At the same time, you know

170
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,790
your days are numbered.

171
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,960
You're unwilling
to accept it, afraid of death,

172
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,810
terrified of everything.

173
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,140
So you want to drag more people down

174
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,370
to die with you.

175
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,050
But you've miscalculated.

176
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,630
Today, what awaits you

177
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,510
is nothing but a dead end.

178
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,950
Give me the antidote.

179
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,690
What antidote?

180
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,910
The poison you gave Jun Che

181
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,320
can only be cured by you.

182
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,340
What are you still
trying to leverage at this point?

183
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,340
You brought him into this world and

184
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,630
and never gave him even a hint of warmth—

185
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,840
only bullying and torment.

186
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,630
When he was a child,
you treated him as a Drug Man.

187
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,400
Then you abandoned him
at the Daning Palace,

188
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,360
where he was tormented
day and night by the Eldest Prince.

189
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,870
Now he has finally grown up

190
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,600
and become the emperor of the realm.

191
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,460
Yet you still want
to turn him into a walking corpse.

192
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,440
His father may have wronged you,

193
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,040
but Jun Che owes you nothing.

194
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,710
When you reappeared in his life,

195
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,440
if he had wanted to kill you,

196
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,240
he would have had
countless opportunities to do so.

197
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,000
But the reason

198
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,130
you can still manipulate him like this

199
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,440
is because he still harbors

200
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,600
a tiny bit of hope for you as his mother.

201
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,390
Hope.

202
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,240
Yes.

203
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,450
It was that bastard emperor's fault.

204
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,790
What does it have to do with Che?

205
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:24,980
The antidote.

206
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,160
Yingying.

207
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,900
I'm sorry.

208
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,700
You've been poisoned

209
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,960
and trapped in an illusion.

210
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,160
It was not your fault.

211
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,490
Yingying.

212
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,380
Yingying.

213
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,600
Yingying!

214
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,480
Yingying!
