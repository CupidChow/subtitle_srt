[Episode 19]

3
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,590
Jun Che.

4
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,840
What happened?

5
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,840
Did you kill them?

6
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,280
I'm asking you.

7
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,870
Did you kill them?

8
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,120
Yes, I killed them. So what?

9
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,030
Didn't you promise me that

10
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,030
you wouldn't kill
the innocent anymore?

11
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:30,870
Innocent?

12
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,870
None of them are innocent.

13
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,470
They all deserved to die.

14
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,360
Does it hurt?

15
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,000
It's my fault.

16
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,000
I shouldn't have killed them.

17
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,530
But when I saw these people,

18
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,710
I remembered my childhood.

19
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,370
They pinned me down in the snow

20
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,470
and humiliated me.

21
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,030
Five.

22
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,000
Five.

23
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,120
I understand.

24
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,000
They were all evil men

25
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,800
who worked for the Eldest Prince.

26
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,040
They deserved to die.

27
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,560
But they are not worth

28
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,870
having your hands stained
with their blood.

29
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,720
They...

30
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,750
None of them are worth it.

31
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,750
Five.

32
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,870
Let me ask you.

33
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,870
Does killing people really make you happy?

34
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,680
No.

35
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,630
You'll only suffer more.

36
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,220
Promise me.
Don't go on killing sprees anymore.

37
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,680
Don't take out your anger on others

38
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,630
because of these evil men.

39
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,270
Okay?

40
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,070
I didn't expect that she managed

41
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,600
to calm Jun Che down
with just a few words.

42
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,070
She seems to matter a lot to His Majesty.

43
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,510
Since Lu Yingying is his cure,

44
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,510
I'll turn her

45
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,920
into his poison.

46
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,120
You're here.

47
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,430
Yingying.

48
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,220
You're beautiful.

49
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,130
What happened?

50
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,240
Nothing.

51
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,950
Have you been too tired lately?

52
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,360
He's tired

53
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,600
but I'm not.

54
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,190
Yingying.

55
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,070
You're so beautiful.

56
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,430
What happened?

57
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,870
What's wrong?

58
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,430
Why don't you rest for a while?

59
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,230
I'll pour you some soothing tea.

60
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,370
Have a rest now!

61
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
Kill him.

62
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,160
Then, we can be together, Yingying.

63
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,950
Five.

64
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,480
What on earth is the matter with you?

65
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,680
Speak!

66
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,950
Push him away!

67
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,950
Kill him!

68
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,920
You love me.

69
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,430
Let's run away together.

70
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,430
You don't love him.

71
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,000
You only love me.

72
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,680
Let me go!

73
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,159
I'll never let you go.

74
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,800
You will always belong only to me!

75
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,560
Miss.

76
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,600
Is that you?

77
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,720
I'll be able to see you soon.

78
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,050
Thank you, Miss.

79
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,350
Is this your silk handkerchief?

80
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,400
The fragrance is distinctive.

81
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,669
I made this scent with ambergris.

82
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,150
It's unique.

83
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,450
The fragrance suits its owner.

84
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,000
Although I'm blind

85
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,080
at the moment,

86
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,840
I can sense that

87
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,030
this fragrance

88
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,910
is unique and elegant

89
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,650
like your temperament.

90
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,000
Elegant?

91
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,790
I'm afraid I'll let you down then.

92
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,240
Thanks to your attentive care these days,

93
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,870
my eyes are healing fast.

94
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,790
My gratitude is beyond words.

95
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,030
I owed you a wish.

96
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,320
Have you decided what you want?

97
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,440
For such a great favor,
words aren't enough.

98
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,000
I want you to marry me.

99
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,480
I will not

100
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,080
disappoint you.

101
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,890
After my eyes recover,

102
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,690
I will marry you
with a grand wedding procession.

103
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,410
Take this as my pledge.

104
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,670
Miss.

105
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,080
He is an idiot.

106
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,790
If he knew I'm the healer,

107
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,670
he would be angry again.

108
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,600
Push him away! Kill him!

109
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,600
You love me.

110
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,030
Let's run away together.

111
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,200
Your Majesty.

112
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,750
According to ancestral customs,

113
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,720
within a month
of a new emperor's ascension,

114
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,360
the Heaven Worship Ritual must be held.

115
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,550
Before the ritual,

116
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,870
the imperial astronomer must perform
divination ceremonies for Your Majesty.

117
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,030
According to my divination,

118
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,840
Your Majesty has recently been

119
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,360
troubled,

120
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,320
making you distraught.

121
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,830
If this continues,
it will impact the nation's fortunes.

122
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,320
What should I do?

123
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,790
There is one solution.

124
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,720
The key lies in what to offer

125
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,390
during the Heaven Worship Ritual.

126
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,080
It's not proper to offer livestock

127
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,080
nor fruits.

128
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,770
Then what should I use?

129
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,080
The lives of 100,000 Daning people.

130
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,490
[Taiji Hall]

131
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,080
Bring in the envoy from Yue State.

132
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,080
Che, why are you in such a hurry
to see me?

133
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,130
What happened?

134
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,790
This sorcerer said

135
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,030
that I should sacrifice
100,000 Daning people

136
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,680
to ensure the prosperity of our nation.

137
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,600
I'd like to

138
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,050
ask your opinion on this solution.

139
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,770
Though many people will be killed,

140
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,630
it seems worth it

141
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,730
for the fortunes of our nation.

142
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,480
Really?

143
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,000
Che, you...

144
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,800
Mother, you're really capable.

145
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,390
You even colluded

146
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,200
with the imperial astronomer of Daning.

147
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,370
How could you...

148
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,670
Yingying.

149
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,630
I didn't mean to.

150
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,600
Five.

151
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,360
I'm afraid I'll hurt you again.

152
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,480
You became like this

153
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,960
after meeting your mother.

154
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,150
Think carefully.

155
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,770
Did she do something to you?

156
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,550
Hurry up!

157
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,480
Avenge your grievances!

158
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,390
Kill them, Che!

159
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,510
I won't let her succeed.

160
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
Stop pretending.

161
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,100
You poisoned me

162
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,960
and colluded with the imperial astronomer.

163
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,360
Mother, do you think

164
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,480
you can be

165
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,720
the controller of Daning?

166
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,320
Stop dreaming.

167
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,940
Do you think
there's anything I wouldn't do?

168
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,360
I can kill you easily.

169
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,150
Guards!

170
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,840
Take her away

171
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,080
and put her in jail.

172
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,670
Yes.

173
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,300
Do you really think
all that was an illusion?

174
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,360
Don't forget that

175
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,600
eyes may deceive you

176
