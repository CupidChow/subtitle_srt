166
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,720
truly for your own good.

167
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,240
If you don't want to eat them,

168
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,510
I won't force you.

169
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,290
Just consider this as sitting here

170
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,750
with me for a while.

171
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,390
Jun Che's changes in these past few days

172
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,050
have really been too strange.

173
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,390
Now that I'm thinking carefully about it,

174
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,320
since Jun Che's mother appeared,

175
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,030
everything seems to

176
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,560
have returned
to the path of my previous life.

177
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,670
Che.

178
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,840
Now in the palace,

179
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,390
there are still many remaining supporters
for the Eldest Prince.

180
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,080
They've all hurt you before.

181
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,610
Do you still remember that?

182
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,910
Look.

183
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,910
They're laughing at you.

184
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,960
They've all bullied you

185
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,910
and insulted you before.

186
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,970
Have you forgotten all these things?

187
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,000
Hurry!

188
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,270
Take revenge for your own deep grudges.

189
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,870
Go kill them now, Che!

190
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,240
Kill them!

191
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Kill them!
