3
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,400
Father, please investigate the truth

4
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
and clear my name.

5
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,030
Wait!

6
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,630
I don't think
an investigation is necessary.

7
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,240
I have evidence of the crime right here.

8
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,300
Who is this person?

9
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,400
I don't know.

10
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,750
The Eldest Prince ordered a massacre
at Xiaohe Village last night,

11
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,910
leaving no survivors,

12
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,680
so that auspicious clouds
would appear in the sky

13
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,150
on the day of the ceremony.

14
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,530
But those were no auspicious clouds.

15
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,590
That was the fire
from the destroyed Xiaohe Village.

16
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,000
This... this isn't true.

17
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,750
Father,

18
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,430
I never did any of these things!

19
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,560
These are the confessions of your men
after they were captured.

20
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,000
What was destroyed today
was just an empty village.

21
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,870
The villagers of Xiaohe Village

22
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,730
were evacuated by us beforehand.

23
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,750
Your men have confessed

24
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,150
to all your evil deeds.

25
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,850
Take a good look for yourself.

26
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,560
Who exactly deserves to die?

27
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,560
Well...

28
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,430
Who are you?

29
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,800
How dare you enter the palace uninvited?

31
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,079
Father!

32

He called His Majesty Father.

33
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,000
This...

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,030
He's also a prince.

35
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,910
Could it be...

36
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,400
He's a prince?

37
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,240
Father, please calm your anger.

38
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,440
It's been a long time.

39
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,630
Have you forgotten

40
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,430
that you still have a son like me?

41
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,590
It's you.

42
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,280
Jun Che?

43
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,800
Weren't you dead?

44
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,910
I did die once,

45
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,840
all thanks to you.

46
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,360
Now I've crawled back from hell

47
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,950
to claim your life.

48
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,480
Jun Che,

49
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,920
I'm glad that you're back.

50
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,829
Don't be foolish.

51
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,870
Let's wait until
everything is investigated.

52
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,680
The evidence is irrefutable.

53
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,270
What's there to investigate?

54
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,510
You just want to cover it up,

55
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,070
to save the royal family's face

56
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,190
and bury the Eldest Prince's
heinous crimes

57

keeping everyone in the dark.

This son you favor so muchâ€”

you think he's
a capable and virtuous ruler,

61
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,630
but in fact,

62
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,750
he's nothing but a complete fool,

63
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,480
a worthless coward
without virtue or ability.

to discuss our father-son relationship.

67
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,360
I'm here to tear away

68
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,120
this hypocritical royal facade

69
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,920
and expose all the darkness within

Let me take a look.

76
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,480
Now throughout the entire Daning City,

77

everyone has a copy of this manifesto.

The crimes committed by the Eldest Prince

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,040
are already known to all.

80
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,180
How could you possibly

81
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,960
produce so many manifestos

82
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,870

you now find yourselves trapped here.

questioned yourselves.

to bring peace to the state,

I'd like to ask you all
to pick up your brushes again,

91
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,890
to write not praises but manifestos,

92

of the Eldest Prince.

They studied hard
to finally earn their titles.

They are children of common people,

98

00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,770
â™ª Fully enjoying it
can bring us happiness â™ª

174
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,200
â™ª That year, the pear blossoms
were filled with laughter â™ª

175
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,580
â™ª A night of snowflakes
falling in disarray â™ª

176
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,630
â™ª All the perfection in the world
hides deep regrets â™ª

177
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,370
â™ª The blood in my heart
is the spell of love â™ª

178
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,490
â™ª I'll never miss you again in my dream â™ª

179
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:53,630
â™ª When everything turns into smoke,
I hope we can stay peaceful forever â™ª

180
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,750
Did everything go well today?

181
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,160
Then congratulations, Your Majesty.

182
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,730
Rise, my beloved consort.

183
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,270
Who's your beloved consort?

184
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,870
Not consort,

185
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,320
but Empress.

186
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,550
My only wife.

187
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,240
I never agreed to be your Empress.

188
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,670
If you are unwilling,

189
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,480
then I'll have to force you.

190
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,510
I'm wicked by nature and jealous.

191
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,480
â™ª That year, the pear blossoms
were filled with laughter â™ª

192
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,320
Now that you've gotten involved with me,

193
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,120
you're in big trouble.

194
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,870
â™ª A night of snowflakes
falling in disarray â™ª

195
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:36,950
â™ª All the perfection in the world
hides deep regrets â™ª

196
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,600
â™ª The blood in my heart
is the spell of love â™ª

197
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,730
â™ª I'll never miss you again in my dream â™ª

198
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm willing.

199
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,970
â™ª When everything turns into smoke,
I hope we can stay peaceful forever â™ª

200
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,230
Come on, take it slow.

201
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,870
Align this properly.

202
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,630
Yes.

203
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,440
Just put it there.

204
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:03,870
Yes.

205
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,530
Is this silk straight?

206
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,790
Make sure the happiness character
isn't crooked.

207
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,710
[Happiness]

208
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,200
Let me tell you all,

209
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,200
today

210
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,670
is His Majesty's coronation day,

211
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,790
and also His Majesty's

212
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,960
wedding day.

213
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,150
We cannot afford any mistakes.

214
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:19,840
Yes.

215
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,920
With Heaven as our witness,

216
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,550
and Earth as our support,

217
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,340
we now share the ceremonial wine,

218
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,560
[Taiji Hall]

219
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,440
forever binding our hearts.

220
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,870
Through all reincarnations,
our love remains unshaken,

221
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,070
as steadfast as the mountains and seas.

222
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,820
â™ª The world would say â™ª

223
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,570
â™ª Romance cannot bear
the clamor of splendor â™ª

224
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,850
â™ª Her graceful shadow sways â™ª

225
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,580
â™ª New favors and old grudges
hard to dispel â™ª

226
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,870
The auspicious time has arrived.

227
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,720
The royal wedding ceremony now begins!

228
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,170
â™ª How many things are now left behind? â™ª

229
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,480
Long live the Emperor!

230
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,330
â™ª Turning through time into a ballad â™ª

231
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,840
Long live the Empress!

232
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,380
â™ª I heard the legends rise like the wind â™ª

233
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,380
â™ª Only to fall back into nothingness â™ª

234
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,230
â™ª I dare not disturb
the toll of the bell â™ª

235
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,480
â™ª Nor dare I awaken the dream â™ª

236
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,640
â™ª Fearing the retelling â™ª

237
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,340
â™ª Could never capture
that breathtaking glance back then â™ª

238
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,080
â™ª Loving you was devotion
beneath moon and breeze â™ª

239
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,840
The envoys from all states
present their gifts!

240
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,660
â™ª Both ordinary love and hate â™ª

241
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,480
â™ª Thus the era was shaken â™ª

242
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,640
â™ª In youthful years of innocence â™ª

243
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,780
â™ª When meetings would not come again â™ª

244
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,510
â™ª The mortal realm was bound
to start yet never end â™ª

245
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,870
The Nanyang envoy respectfully presents:

246
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,120
a strand of azure jade jewels,

247
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,670
a golden phoenix hairpin
with pearl adornments,

248
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,600
and a pair of twin lotus jade bracelets.

249
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,960
May Your Majesties...

250
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,750
Yingying,

251
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,840
today is the happiest day

252
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,240
of my entire life.

253
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,550
â™ª I heard that in the spring of '64 â™ª

254
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,680
Is it because you've
finally become Emperor?

255
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,930
â™ª The wind rose at the mountain gate â™ª

256
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,080
It's because I can finally

257
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,870
â™ª Strange tales unfold in a book â™ª

258
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,920
â™ª Recording their story â™ª

259
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,630
be with you forever.

260
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,130
â™ª Ridiculous words â™ª

261
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,830
â™ª Hastily blaming the cruelty of time â™ª

262
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,410
Then I wish Your Majesty

263
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,240
to become a wise ruler in the future,

264
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,080
bringing peace to Daning
and prosperity to all lands.

265
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,790
â™ª Yet it still knocks
on my heart and soul â™ª

266
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,100
â™ª Like a dream from another life â™ª

267
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,240
From now on,

268
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,910
â™ª Reincarnating in words â™ª

269
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,840
I will always stay by your side,

270
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,870
never to be parted.

271
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,020
â™ª Afraid others won't understand â™ª

272
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,030
â™ª Afraid of stirring emotions
for no reason â™ª

273
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:35,320
â™ª Better to have a beginning with no end â™ª

274
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,320
In this life,

275
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,150
my family didn't meet a tragic end,

276
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,650
and Jun Che didn't become a tyrant.

277
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
It seems fate

278
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,750
has truly been changed by me.

279
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:49,120
The envoy from Yue State presents gifts.

280
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,440
Why are you here?
