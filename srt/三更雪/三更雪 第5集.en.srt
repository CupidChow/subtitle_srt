172
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,130
Miss Li isn't receiving guests today.

173
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,840
Miss Cui is just as good.

174
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,720
Cui!

175
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,840
-Coming.
-Check the first floor and the lobby.

176
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,140
[Fengman House]

177
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,200
Yes.

178
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,460
I'll search upstairs.

179
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,170
Move aside.

180
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,670
My Lord.

181
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,930
-This...
-This...

182
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,600
Coming, My Lord!

183
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,730
Step aside. Official investigation.

184
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,150
Young Master, do you have a favorite girl?

185
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,610
Official investigation.

186
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,750
Miss.

187
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,290
What's wrong with you?

188
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,120
My Lord,

189
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
save me.

190
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,240
How dare you!

191
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,000
We, the Longxiang Guards,
are here to investigate a case.

192
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,030
How dare you toy with me like this!

193
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,270
There's no case to investigate here.

194
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,630
Now that you've entered this cage,

195
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,390
why don't you investigate me instead?

196
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,840
My Lord, do you also like

197
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,480
the scent of my cosmetics, My Lord?
