1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I still have to reach this point,

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We're here.

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,640
We should be able to find that room from here.

20
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,080
My name is Wu Xie.

21
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
I live in Hangzhou.

22
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,400
I live at Mount Wushanji

23
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,280
at the Western IV building in Hefang.

24
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,880
I â€¦

25
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,040
I'm traveling to Gellem

26
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,280
if you ...

27
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
My name is Wu Xie,

28
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,680
a man of 3 years.

29
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,240
They are my brothers

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
I'm a man with a lot of talent and a lot of fat.

31
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,240
And this cool man, Manyu Ping, Zhang Qilin.

32
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,240
I'm relying on my grandfather's book

33
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,240
and the help of these two people to take the lead.

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,240
I've been chased by the people

35
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,240
who were in the seven stars palace

36
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
and were trapped by the wild foxes.

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,240
I was forced to die because of the poor machine.

38
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,240
I was out of my body because of Manyu Ping's crazy power.

39
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,240
People thought that my life was back to normal.

40
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,240
But once something happened,

41
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,240
I was in a state of crisis.

42
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,240
In order to find my uncle,

43
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,240
I was scared to death by the sun.

44
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,240
I didn't expect to find a secret of the long life and the ultimate.

45
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:27,240
Here, I found the letter of Wu Sanxing who was left by Xie Lianhuan.

46
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,240
Then the clues of these three fish

47
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,240
were pointed to me.

48
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,240
I found the hidden treasure in the forest under the white water.

49
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,240
We found the nine-hole tavern in Guangzang Sea.

50
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,240
We saw the hand of the twelve-hands king.

51
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,240
The people who were surrounded by the war-fighting force.

52
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,240
Finally, we found the Qingpeng Gate.

53
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,240
That was Zhang Qilin's destination.

54
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,240
I needed his life to protect me.

55
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,240
I looked at him and saw what was going on in the Qingpeng Gate.

56
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
Zhang Qilin!

57
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,240
Where is your uncle?

58
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,240
Old fox, there are so many of them.

59
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,240
Don't run!

60
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,240
Hey!

61
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
Wu Sanxing!

62
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
You old fox!

63
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
Don't run!

64
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,240
Old fox, how long have you been awake?

65
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Just a little while.

66
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,240
Just watch.

67
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,240
You were the one who sent the photo of Xisha to the Gu Team 19 years ago.

68
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,240
Xie Lianhuan was killed in that operation.

69
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,240
We saw the blood on the bloodline after we arrived at Xisha.

70
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,240
It was written on it that Wu Sanxing was killed.

71
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,240
You know who the people in the garden are?

72
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,240
It's Xie Lianhuan!

73
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,240
Tell me!

74
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,240
Did you kill Xie Lianhuan?

75
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,240
I killed Xie Lianhuan!

76
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,240
Oh, I'm dizzy.

77
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
I'm dizzy.

78
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
What did you kill me for?

79
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
I killed Wu Xie's brother.

80
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,240
Who came in?

81
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,240
Zhang Qilin.

82
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Zhang Qilin?

83
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,240
Amazing!

84
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Our little brother can even kill you in the Qingpeng Gate.

85
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
Lu Xiangdan.

86
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,240
Zhang Qilin, you're not being generous.

87
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Why didn't you tell me that you had a connection with him?

88
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
How can I tell you?

89
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
You just woke up.

90
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
I'm dizzy.

91
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
I'm dizzy.

92
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,240
You...

93
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,240
You said that little brother was dead.

94
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,240
He disappeared for so long.

95
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
He had his news at the first time.

96
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
I'm sure that little brother is really a bad guy.

97
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,240
What kind of a person are you?

98
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,240
What kind of a person are you?

99
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,240
This Lu Xiangdan is an old man.

100
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Where did you get the chance to go to the airport?

101
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
I got the chance to go there.

102
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,240
Don't come here.

103
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,240
It has nothing to do with you.

104
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,240
You're so lucky to be able to share it with me.

105
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,240
We're a family after all.

106
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,240
I'll investigate my own business with your little brother.

107
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Wang Wu.

108
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,240
Go to the rescue room.

109
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,240
Two good guys can put this kind of camera.

110
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
Yes, sir.

111
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,240
You want to see it?

112
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
Fine.

113
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,240
Then you have to tell me what happened to Xi Sha.

114
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
In your heart,

115
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,240
you think that I'm the kind of person who kills people and makes them happy?

116
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
You don't have to ask me.

117
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
You're the suspect now.

118
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
Xi Sha.

119
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,240
There were too many things that happened to Xi Sha.

120
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
I don't know.

121
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,240
So many years have passed.

122
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,240
I've been investigating the test team.

123
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Wenjin, Huoling.

124
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
There are so many young people.

125
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
I don't know what happened.

126
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Too many things.

127
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
Forget it.

128
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
Forget it?

129
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Why do you always do this?

130
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
I don't mention it.

131
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
It's all because of me.

132
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
You always say that.

133
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
I'm your uncle.

134
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
I'm not good to you.

135
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,240
Who else is good to you?

136
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,240
This thing was sent from Qinghai to Ge'er Mu.

137
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Qingnou Gate is in Changban Mountain.

138
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Ge'er Mu is in the West.

139
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
This little brother is so good at shooting.

140
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
He's really good at it.

141
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
You think that little brother is also real?

142
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Why do you run so far?

143
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Even if we turn over the grass,

144
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
we have to turn it over.

145
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
We have to make it clear to my sister.

146
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,240
Why didn't you say it clearly?

147
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Okay, okay, Ermei.

148
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,240
Let's take a look at the tarp first.

149
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
20 minutes have passed.

150
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Come in.

151
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
No.

152
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Don't let anything happen.

153
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Let me tell you.

154
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
If this plate is still empty,

155
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,240
I'll bite you if you're fat.

156
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
What are you doing?

157
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,240
What if there's a self-made password in this flower?

158
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,240
What's the secret?

159
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
That makes sense.

160
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
No!

161
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
It's him!

162
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,240
It's Huoling!

163
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
The Huoling who was killed by the West Barrier Team 19 years ago?

164
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Huoling...

165
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,240
Is this the spirit of Huoling?

166
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,240
Give me the sign of the West Barrier Team.

167
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,240
We went to the West Barrier Team in 1985.

168
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
I know it.

169
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
I know it.

170
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,240
But I don't know if it's the same thing.

171
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
The same thing.

172
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
What are you doing?

173
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,240
I'm going to take you to the West Barrier Team.

174
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
We went to the West Barrier Team in 1985.

175
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
The Huoling was killed in 1997.

176
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,240
It's been 12 years.

177
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,240
He's not old at all.

178
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,240
Let me analyze it.

179
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,240
The little brother has two plates of Huoling.

180
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
One plate is empty.

181
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,240
The other plate is Huoling with a comb.

182
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,240
Wu Xie,

183
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,240
don't investigate it.

184
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,240
Lu Xiangtai,

185
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
take it as a piece of cake.

186
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
It's all gone.

187
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,240
I know what happened.

188
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,240
I'll tell him not to investigate it.

189
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,240
Are you going to be a loser?

190
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,240
I'm not going to let you investigate it.

191
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,240
It's all for you.

192
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
Grandma asked you to find a wife.

193
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
It's all for you.

194
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
Do you hear me?

195
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
It's a matter of two horses.

196
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,240
Think about it.

197
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
I'll give you Lu Xiangtai.

198
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
I'm sure he wants to seduce you.

199
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,240
You're going to investigate it.

200
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,240
Don't you want to be a loser?

201
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,240
Will the little brother harm me?

202
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
How would I know

203
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
what's keeping you from hiding anything from me?

204
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
What do you mean?

205
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
Wait a minute.

206
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,240
I have a plate of Huoling with a comb.

207
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,240
It's all for you.

208
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
Hangzhou, if you want to see it.

209
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
I told you I don't have money.

210
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,240
Stop calling me.

211
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Come here.

212
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
Who?

213
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
I'm buying a house.

214
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
I can buy a few.

215
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
Buying a house?

216
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,240
You're not a big deal.

217
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
You should have a bigger house.

218
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
If you have a house,

219
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,240
you can talk to your partner.

220
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
I'll be like you

221
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
in the next half of my life.

222
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,240
My dear,

223
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
you used to run around in the east and west.

224
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,240
You're still alive.

225
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
You're the one who's

226
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,240
keeping you safe.

227
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,240
I'll be discharged tomorrow.

228
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,240
If you're fine,

229
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
go back to Hangzhou

230
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
and take your house.

231
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
Where are you going?

232
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
To the toilet.

233
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
Why do you need it?

234
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,240
I'm the one who's

235
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
the one who's the one who gave it to me.

236
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Fine.

237
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
You're playing with me.

238
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
I'll buy it for you.

239
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
I'll buy you a house

240
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,240
and a house.

241
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,240
Buy?

242
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
What do you want?

243
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
You see.

244
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,240
In your pants,

245
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,240
you're not wearing a pair of pants.

246
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,240
Take it away.

247
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,240
I'll give you a gift card.

248
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Take it away.

249
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,240
And a piece of white and red

250
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,240
gold dragon's cup.

251
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
Dragon's cup and cup

252
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
are only one.

253
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,240
I said there's a piece.

254
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,240
I'm sure there's a piece.

255
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,240
You're my son.

256
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
Take it away.

257
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
Deal.

258
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,240
Not only the head,

259
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,240
but also the body.

260
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
The flesh.

261
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,240
Fatty,

262
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
you got the money.

263
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
Let's go back to Hangzhou.

264
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
I'll treat you to dinner.

265
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
Let's go.

266
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,240
Liar.

267
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,240
You invited me to eat instant noodles when you came to Hangzhou.

268
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
The Wushan Bureau is special.

269
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
You eat slowly.

270
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
You're meeting someone.

271
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
Who?

272
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
Ning.

273
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,240
He has Lu Xiang Dai.

274
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
So I...

275
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
You remember his phone number yesterday?

276
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,240
Only the new family agreed to let you know.

277
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
I don't know

278
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
what he's like.

279
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,240
I'm reasonable with him.

280
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
He's a jerk.

281
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
I'm more shameless

282
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
than him.

283
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Ning has Lu Xiang Dai.

284
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
We have to take a good look.

285
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
Ning.

286
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
If you don't change,

287
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
you'll know the truth.

288
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
As the saying goes,

289
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
people who wear leather pants

290
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,240
don't get upset.

291
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
You want to keep looking?

292
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
You want to keep looking?

293
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
And you want to take Lu Xiang Dai with you?

294
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,240
Good job, my boy.

295
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
You're a good boy.

296
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,240
You're not better than a good hunter

297
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,240
in a fox's fox.

298
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,240
I told you.

299
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
You're so selfish

300
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,240
to ask me

301
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
about your death.

302
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
How could you not look into it?

303
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
You're so selfish.

304
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
It was the same money.

305
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
It wasn't expensive.

306
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
It was the same as a piece of paper.

307
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
It's worth it.

308
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,240
You didn't wear leather pants today?

309
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,240
Do you know how to make up?

310
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
You're so good.

311
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,240
I remember our company's headquarters

312
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,240
a few days ago.

313
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Who remembers?

314
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,240
I don't.

315
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
You remember?

316
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
How could it be?

317
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,240
Qinghai Pavilion.

318
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,240
I've never been to the Pavilion.

319
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
Of course I know you don't remember.

320
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,240
The name is written by Ji Jian.

321
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,240
It's to keep Lu Xiang Dai with me.

322
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
You're so good.

323
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,240
You're so good.

324
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,240
You're so good.

325
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,240
You're so good.

326
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
I'm sorry.

327
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,240
Keep talking.

328
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,240
What's in your bag?

329
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,240
It's strange.

330
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
Feel it yourself.

331
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,240
I'm sorry.

332
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
Do you have any special feelings?

333
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,240
No.

334
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
Good.

335
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,240
Let's take a look at the second one.

336
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,240
Get ready.

337
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,240
From here.

338
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
It's me.

339
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
How could it be me?

340
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,240
Why did I come to you?

341
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,240
It's not like what happened a decade ago.

342
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,240
I was young then.

343
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,240
Is there anything else?

344
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
I'm sorry.

345
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,240
I'm sorry.

346
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,240
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,240
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
I'm sorry.

349
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
I'm sorry.

350
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,240
Is there anything else?

351
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,240
The only clue is this one.

352
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
It seems you don't know anything.

353
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,240
Go.

354
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
It's good to say.

355
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
Don't mention money to Fatty.

356
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,240
It's a good thing to mention money.

357
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
I can go to Beijing tonight.

358
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,240
Bye.

359
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,240
You're leaving now?

360
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,240
I just got scared.

361
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
Don't be afraid.

362
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,240
Just take it as a ghost.

363
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,240
Besides,

364
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
do you have Wang Meng?

365
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
Wang Meng.

366
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
Take care of your boss.

367
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
Okay, Fatty.

368
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,240
By the way,

369
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,240
Xiao Ge came to the tape recorder.

370
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,240
Two tapes.

371
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,240
It's a tape too.

372
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,240
And like Ning said,

373
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,240
the name of Xiao Ge

374
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
is to get the tape recorder

375
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,240
to my hand.

376
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240
Maybe this tape recorder

377
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,240
is not from Xiao Ge.

378
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,240
Yes.

379
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,240
I know.

380
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,240
You just want to figure out

381
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,240
what's going on with this tape recorder.

382
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,240
By the way,

383
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,240
if you have any news,

384
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,240
remember to tell me.

385
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,240
Bye.

386
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,240
Bye.

387
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,240
This empty bag is still in the memory.

388
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
This Xiao Ge is also quite strange.

389
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,240
Wang Meng.

390
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,240
Bring the tape recorder.

391
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,240
Boss,

392
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,240
the tape recorder is in your drawer.

393
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,240
You can take it yourself.

394
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,240
You're out of money this month.

395
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,240
No, no, no.

396
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,240
I'll take it.

397
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
I'll take it.

398
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,240
I'll take it.

399
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
This tape recorder is empty.

400
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,240
That is to say,

401
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
the content itself is not important at all.

402
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
The one who sent me the tape recorder

403
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
is the tape recorder itself.

404
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,240
There is only one reason

405
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,240
to remember this tape recorder.

406
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
There is only one thing

407
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,240
that can be found

408
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,240
when you receive the tape recorder.

409
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,240
Qinghai Provincial Museum,

410
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,240
Kunlun Road,

411
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,240
D23,

412
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
349,

413
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,240
and 5th.

414
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,240
This tape recorder is very smart.

415
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,240
Use tape recorder.

416
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,240
First,

417
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,240
you can protect the things inside

418
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,240
without getting the operation broken.

419
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,240
Second,

420
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,240
even if this thing is stolen,

421
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
for example,

422
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,240
Third Uncle,

423
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,240
you will only be interested

424
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,240
in the content of the tape recorder itself.

425
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,240
You won't find

426
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,240
anything else inside.

427
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,240
And the key.

428
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,240
306.

429
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
I've already opened the room for you.

430
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,240
Third Uncle,

431
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,240
this old fox

432
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
finally found something

433
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,240
and was taken away by someone.

434
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
By the way,

435
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
order a first-class

436
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,240
ticket to Ge'er Mu for me.

437
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,240
The fastest speed.

438
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,240
Okay.

439
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
Listen to this.

440
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
Let's go there and see.

441
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Okay.

442
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
Go and sit here.

443
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,240
Ouch!

444
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
Ouch!

445
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
Uncle,

446
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,240
I touch your drum.

447
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
It must be more than 70.

448
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,240
What are you talking about?

449
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,240
Don't look at me in the face.

450
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,240
I'm 37 this year.

451
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,240
And 37?

452
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,240
I'm not even 37.

453
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,240
I'm not even 37.

454
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,240
I'm not even 37.

455
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
I'm scared.

456
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,240
I'm scared.

457
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,240
I'm not scared.

458
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,240
I'm not scared.

459
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,240
I'm not scared.

460
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,240
Xu Pang,

461
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,240
I have a guest on my side.

462
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
Boss,

463
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
where do you want to go?

464
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,240
Qinghai Ge'er Mu.

465
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,240
The old foreigner.

466
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,240
Go.

467
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,240
There's a place to light up the dark magic shop.

468
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,240
There are many special services.

469
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,240
You're really a good person.

470
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,240
Boss,

471
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,240
I have to fly to Chengdu first

472
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,240
in Ge'er Mu.

473
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,240
So I ordered

474
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,240
a six-point gold chicken soup for you.

475
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,240
Turn the chicken in the middle.

476
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
You can ask me in the afternoon.

477
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,240
Don't worry after the fall.

478
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,240
The next flight is at 12 o'clock in the morning.

479
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,240
You have to stay at the airport for 11 hours.

480
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,240
Then go to Ge'er Mu in Xining.

481
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,240
I've checked it.

482
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,240
The scenery is beautiful all the way.

483
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,240
The night is 9 o'clock.

484
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,240
The old Ge'er Mu is stable.

485
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,240
After the car,

486
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,240
the Liao Yang Garden is in the 3rd floor.

487
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,240
This is the fastest route you've ever seen for me?

488
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,240
Yes, boss.

489
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,240
Then you let me walk in the 3rd floor?

490
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,240
There's always a 3rd floor.

491
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,240
You can go there.

492
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,240
Little boy,

493
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,240
we're here.

494
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,240
Boss,

495
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,240
this is...

496
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,240
This is the place?

497
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,240
Boss,

498
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
who is it?

499
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,240
Boss,

500
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,240
My name is Wu Xie.

501
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,240
I live in Hangzhou.

502
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,240
I live in the Wushan neighborhood on the west side of the river.

503
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,240
I'm now

504
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,240
in the Ge'er Mu Liao Yang Garden.

505
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,240
If you see me...

506
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,240
Who is it?

507
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,240
If you see this,

508
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,240
please let me go to Wushan neighborhood.

509
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
There's a man named Wang Meng.

510
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,240
Chong Xie.

511
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
I'm still here

512
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,240
according to the address on the note.

513
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,240
I should be able to find

514
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,240
that room from here.

515
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,240
I'm going to go there.

516
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,240
The room here

517
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,240
may have been a problem.

518
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,240
The second floor is blocked by a wall.

519
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
There are some traces

520
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,240
like the nail nail.

521
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
But the pattern is strange.

522
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
I can't see anything.

523
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,240
I can't see anything.

524
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,240
I'm going to go there.

525
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
I'm going to go there.

526
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,240
I'm going to go there.

527
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,240
I'm going to go there.

528
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,240
I'm going to go there.

529
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,240
The length of the stairs

530
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
should be below the ground.

531
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,240
And the temperature is getting lower.

532
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
It's a strange feeling.

533
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,240
I can't see anything.

534
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,240
There's nothing wrong with the air.

535
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,240
I'll just blow the candles.

536
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,240
How many candles do you mean?

537
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
I didn't expect

538
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
this air-conditioning hospital's

539
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
emergency lighting device

540
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
to be useful.

541
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,240
The air-conditioning hospital's emergency lighting device

542
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,240
is a new technology

543
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,240
that can be used to

544
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,240
use the air-conditioning device

545
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,240
to control the air-conditioning device.

546
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,240
This is something

547
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,240
that was built

548
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,240
about 1500 or 600 years ago.

549
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
It's moving.

550
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,240
It's moving.

551
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,240
It's moving.

552
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,240
It's moving.

553
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,240
It's moving.

554
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,240
It's moving.

555
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,240
I'll show you

556
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,240
how to do it.

557
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,240
I know

558
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,240
that I'm a good person

559
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,240
who can do it.

560
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,240
So

561
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,240
I won't touch you.

562
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,240
Don't touch me.

563
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,240
Just stay there.

564
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,240
No wonder.

565
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,240
Why is there

566
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,240
another room?

567
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,240
Since they're all here,

568
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,240
let's just die.

569
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,240
If it's me,

570
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,240
remember the road to the end of the year,

571
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,240
and bring the people here

572
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
and send them to the hospital.

573
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,240
I'll do it.

574
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,240
I'll do it.

575
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,240
I'll do it.

576
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
I'll do it.

577
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,240
I'll do it.

578
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,240
I'll do it.

579
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,240
I'll do it.

580
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,240
I'll do it.

581
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,240
I'll do it.

582
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,240
I'll do it.

583
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,240
Bring the people here

584
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,240
and find the underground room.

585
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,240
Either

586
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,240
they want me to be found,

587
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,240
or

588
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
they want me to be found

589
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,240
and keep something.

590
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,240
I hope I can find

591
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,240
something to hide.

592
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,240
No.

593
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,240
No.

594
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,240
Good.

595
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,240
Good.

596
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
I've learned it from your grandma.

597
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
She's lying on the rope.

598
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,240
I can't sleep now.

599
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,240
You're sleeping well.

600
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,240
I'm not sure if I can get out of here.

601
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,240
I can't tell.

602
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,240
I can tell it's not bad.

603
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,240
I don't know

604
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,240
which one of the three of you

605
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
is you.

606
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,240
No matter who you are,

607
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,240
when you came here

608
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,240
and found the notes,

609
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,240
I believe you've already lost your mind.

610
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,240
Li Jili

611
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,240
recorded our ten years of blood and energy.

612
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,240
But

613
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,240
I have to remind you that

614
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,240
there are huge women

615
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,240
in there.

616
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,240
You can know

617
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,240
what you want to know from now on.

618
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,240
But after watching it,

619
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,240
it's hard to get back to life.

620
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,240
The tape is the last protection

621
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,240
we set up.

622
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,240
The tape shows

623
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,240
that the person who kept the tape

624
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,240
couldn't contact me.

625
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,240
Either I'm dead,

626
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,240
or

627
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,240
he's the one

628
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,240
who found me.

629
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,240
I've left this city.

630
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,240
Why did the treasured man

631
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,240
bring three people with him?

632
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,240
One gave me

633
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,240
and the other one in Anning's hands.

634
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,240
Who else?

635
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,240
Third Master.

636
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,240
The people who kept the tape

637
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,240
in the door

638
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,240
are all dead.

639
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,240
All of us

640
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,240
are dead.

641
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,240
The people of Xie family

642
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,240
are all dead.

643
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,240
You're all dead.

644
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,240
My master is in February.

645
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,240
And the one who said

646
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,240
that you're dead.

647
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,240
What are you

648
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,240
doing all your life?

649
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,240
Me?

650
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,240
I'm not old.

651
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,240
I'm not old.

652
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,240
Ask Huo Xiu Xiu's grandma.

653
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,240
Ask my grandma?

654
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,240
My grandma has to say that

655
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,240
my aunt Huo Lin

656
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,240
can't face her now.

657
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,240
Chen Wen Jin?

658
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,240
You were in the test of Xishan.

659
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,240
My aunt Chen Wen Jin, Xie Lian Huan

660
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,240
were all dead.

661
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,240
Now you're the only one

662
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,240
who can find her.

663
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,240
You must know something.

664
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,240
We should

665
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,240
take care of

666
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,240
what we should do.

667
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,240
What we should do

668
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,240
is to take care of it.

669
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,240
I just don't want

670
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,240
you to be involved in this.

671
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,240
Now you're the only one left.

672
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,240
Look at this picture.

673
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,240
Tell me

674
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,240
what it is.

675
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,240
So Chen Wen Jin

676
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,240
asked me to send

677
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,240
the name of the little brother

678
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,240
to me.

679
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,240
And sent it to the other two people.

680
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,240
Chang Bai Mountain, Yun Ding Palace

681
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,240
and Gua Zi Miao Qixing Lu Palace

682
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,240
are the best in the world.

683
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,240
The Buddha is the best in the world.

684
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,240
The sand is the best.

685
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,240
The sea is the best in the world.

686
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,240
I've been to all these places.

687
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,240
I understand.

688
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,240
This is the long-lost dragon

689
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,240
that Lord Zhou Mu is chasing.

690
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,240
These two are together.

691
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,240
It's a dragon.

692
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,240
It's okay to chase the dragon.

693
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,240
But there's still something in it.

694
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,240
The tomb.

695
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,240
Why is there only one place

696
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,240
outside the gate?

697
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,240
The gate of the Qing Dynasty.

698
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,240
Chen Wen Jin went to the gate of the Qing Dynasty.

699
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,240
The gate of the Qing Dynasty.

700
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,240
The gate of the Shi Dynasty.

701
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,240
Sorry.

702
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,240
Is it okay?

703
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,240
Start.

704
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,240
Sorry.

705
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,240
I'll show you the picture.

706
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,240
I'll show you the picture.

707
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,240
Teacher Chen.

708
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,240
Take it.

709
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,240
Take it.

710
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,240
Take it.

711
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,240
Take it.

712
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,240
Take it.

713
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,240
Thank you for helping him.

714
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,240
After we go to the Qingsha.

715
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,240
Wait.

716
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,240
Please write down the date of the murder.

717
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,240
I'll write it down.

718
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,240
Of course.

719
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,240
I know you won't be the first.

720
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,240
Sorry.

721
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,240
I'll write it down.

722
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,240
And it's called An Ning.

723
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,240
It's the second time.

724
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,240
It's the second time.

725
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,240
It's you.

726
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,240
It's really you.

727
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,240
Just one sentence.

728
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,240
Okay?

729
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,240
Come on.

730
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,240
Come again.

731
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,240
Come again.

732
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,240
Come again.

733
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,240
Come again.

734
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,240
I don't want to do it.

735
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,240
Okay.

736
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,240
Okay.

737
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,240
Okay.

738
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,240
I'll make a mistake.

739
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,240
What are you doing?

740
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,240
Come on.

741
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,240
You're the best.

742
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,240
You're the best.

743
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,240
You're the best.

744
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,240
I hook up your father.

745
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,240
She's here.

746
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,240
assault.

747
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,240
Chase andkiego.

748
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,240
Come on.

749
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,080
Who are you?

750
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,360
Drink some more.

751
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,360
YiBos, where has that part gone?

752
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,280
I was wondering about it.
