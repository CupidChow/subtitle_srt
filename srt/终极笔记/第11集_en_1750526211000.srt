1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,600
I am not going to let you go.

2
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,080
I am going to kill you.

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,560
I am going to kill you.

4
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,120
I am going to kill you.

5
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,600
I am going to kill you.

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,240
I am going to kill you.

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,840
I am going to kill you.

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,600
I am going to kill you.

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,200
I am going to kill you.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,800
I am going to kill you.

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,400
I am going to kill you.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,960
I am going to kill you.

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,600
I am going to kill you.

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,320
I am going to kill you.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,080
I am going to kill you.

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,800
I am going to kill you.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,440
I am going to kill you.

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,000
I am going to kill you.

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,520
I am going to kill you.

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,080
I am going to kill you.

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,760
I am going to kill you.

22
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,480
I am going to kill you.

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,360
I am going to kill you.

24
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,080
I am going to kill you.

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,800
I am going to kill you.

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,520
I am going to kill you.

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,240
I am going to kill you.

28
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,960
I am going to kill you.

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,680
I am going to kill you.

30
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,400
I am going to kill you.

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,200
I am going to kill you.

32
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,000
I am going to kill you.

33
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,800
I am going to kill you.

34
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,560
I am going to kill you.

35
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,280
I am going to kill you.

36
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,980
I am going, brother.

37
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,900
Meine serves the King.

38
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,980
Well done, Jinx.

39
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,540
Play it hard, guys.

40
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,580
Whose legs are those of Mitra?

41
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,740
Damn!

42
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,060
Why are you?

43
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,380
I don't understand.

44
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,100
I won't even come.

45
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,020
Why don't you tell me to recover your feet?

46
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,020
You ran away without saying a word

47
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,020
What?

48
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,020
Food

49
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,020
Wait

50
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,020
Mr.Tang, my footwork is really good

51
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,020
How about I embroider a pearl for you

52
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,020
to keep you safe from any kind of injury

53
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,020
Come on, you

54
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,020
Let's be low-key

55
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,020
Look at your injury

56
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,020
You have already been shot by a second round of bullets

57
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,020
You are covered in fog

58
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,020
It's all skin wounds

59
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,020
It's just a body wound

60
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,020
Next time, don't work so hard

61
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,020
If you do something, you will die

62
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,020
Come on

63
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,020
It's okay

64
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,020
This is my style

65
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,020
I get hurt every time

66
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,020
But every time, I can still survive

67
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,020
You can't live like this even if your third master is targeting you

68
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,020
You are a little self-destructive

69
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,020
I can't destroy myself

70
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,020
I still miss my third master

71
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,020
We have made a deal

72
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,020
When we are old, we will live in the nursing home together

73
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,020
Didn't you say you were chasing after someone?

74
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,020
Where is he?

75
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,020
He ran away

76
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,020
Tell me the truth

77
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,020
Why did you run away after saving me?

78
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,020
Come with me

79
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,020
Come

80
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,020
Brother, why did you bring me here?

81
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,020
Brother, what are you doing?

82
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,020
What are you doing?

83
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,020
I am protecting the snake

84
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,020
You are protecting the snake

85
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,020
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

86
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,020
I will do it myself

87
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,020
By the way, Pan Zi and Fatty are still inside

88
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,020
Oh no, oh no, oh no

89
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,020
Fatty, something bad happened

90
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,020
What happened?

91
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,020
Come on

92
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,020
What happened?

93
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,020
What are you doing?

94
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,020
I am protecting the snake

95
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,020
Who said that?

96
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,020
Brother said that

97
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,020
Brother said that

98
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,020
You should have said that earlier

99
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,020
I will do it myself

100
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,020
Are you awake?

101
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,020
Are you even now?

102
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,020
Yes

103
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,020
Stop

104
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,020
The waterway is just ahead

105
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,020
When it gets dark

106
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,020
We will rest here tonight

107
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,020
Send a team to light the lamps in the waterway

108
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,020
See you tomorrow morning

109
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,020
You send some men in first

110
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,020
Arrange the rest of the men to cook

111
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,020
Let them go outside

112
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,020
Yes

113
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,020
I found the entrance

114
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,020
Take the smelly shrimp and the red cabbage apart

115
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,020
We will start tonight

116
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,020
Boss, do we still have to do it?

117
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,020
We have not succeeded in doing it so many times

118
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,020
Can you think about it?

119
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,020
They have been paralyzed by us

120
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,020
It's a good time to start tonight

121
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,020
Boss is really boss

122
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,020
He is good at planning and planning

123
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,020
I am not a bad person

124
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,020
I am a good person

125
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,020
I am a good person

126
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,020
I am a good person

127
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,020
I am a good person

128
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,020
I didn't notice

129
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,020
Impossible

130
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,020
Go

131
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,020
Boss, you can find a good place in Shenzhou

132
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,020
Let's go down and explore the road

133
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,020
We can't handle the situation at night

134
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,020
I will go

135
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,020
I will go

136
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,020
I will go

137
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,020
I will leave the temperature to you

138
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,020
Keep it

139
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,020
Is he always so active?

140
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,020
Normally, he is always sitting down

141
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,020
It's rare to see him today

142
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,020
Little Master San

143
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,020
Can we really let go of him?

144
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,020
Of course

145
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,020
Brother said he is back

146
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,020
I know

147
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,020
They are putting mud on the tent

148
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,020
Pan

149
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,020
You can't dip your back

150
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,020
I will cover it with a mud

151
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,020
Okay

152
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,020
I didn't expect that the fat man's fencing skill is good

153
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,020
It's just that it looks weird

154
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,020
It's like I've seen it before

155
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,020
He is the real method of taking blood

156
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,020
Fat man is indeed talented

157
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,020
Wu Xie

158
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,020
Come out

159
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,020
I have put mud on it

160
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,020
It has nothing to do with mud

161
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,020
Your third uncle left you a message

162
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,020
Hurry up

163
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,020
Don't move

164
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,020
I will tell you the situation when I come back

165
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,020
Brother and I were going to put mud on the lamp

166
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,020
We saw it when we opened the door

167
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,020
We have found the entrance to the final

168
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,020
But there is no way to enter

169
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,020
We have decided to leave

170
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,020
We have decided to leave

171
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,020
Wuhan is in danger

172
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,020
You must leave quickly

173
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:16,020
Your third uncle didn't plan to come back alive

174
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,020
Your third uncle didn't plan to come back alive

175
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,020
Naive

176
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,020
Who is Wu Sanxing?

177
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,020
He is real and fake

178
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,020
Don't worry

179
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,020
We will chase him tomorrow

180
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,020
This old fox

181
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,020
He wants me to go back without any means

182
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,020
Come

183
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,020
I will go to put mud on it

184
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,020
What did your third uncle say?

185
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,020
He said the road ahead is dangerous

186
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,020
Tell me not to chase him

187
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,020
I will go in first

188
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,020
Your third uncle is right

189
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,020
Your third uncle

190
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,020
You should listen to him

191
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,020
It is so dangerous

192
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,020
I can't let him go in alone

193
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,020
Your third uncle did it for your own good

194
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,020
I did it for his own good

195
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,020
Actually I can understand my third uncle

196
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,020
If it was me

197
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,020
The secret of life is right in front of me

198
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,020
The road ahead is so dangerous

199
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,020
I don't want my eldest nephew to follow me

200
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,020
I can't tell him the truth

201
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,020
I can only say such a word

202
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,020
If it was your old third uncle

203
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,020
I guess you should cry now

204
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,020
Yes

205
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,020
If it was before

206
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,020
I heard that my third uncle was going to die

207
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,020
I would cry for a long time

208
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,020
But now I know that these secrets

209
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,020
are not under my third uncle's control

210
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,020
Do you know?

211
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,020
When you were little

212
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,020
My third uncle took you with him

213
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,020
And a group of kids who played with you

214
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,020
Strolled the streets together

215
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,020
And the ones who were counting on you

216
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,020
Said that you were confused

217
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,020
And confused

218
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,020
I can't count the things that I'm worried about in the future

219
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,020
What happened next?

220
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,020
My third uncle was upset when he heard this

221
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,020
And said that it was a lie

222
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,020
He said that you were clean from your name to your identity

223
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,020
And he had to take you to Qi's place

224
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,020
To make up for it

225
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,020
Is Qi still there?

226
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,020
Actually my third uncle

227
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,020
Didn't take you to make up for it

228
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,020
He said that everyone has a life

229
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,020
You should take a good look

230
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,020
At what kind of life you have

231
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,020
I don't know

232
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,020
He said Wu Xie

233
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,020
Didn't you give him the fortune teller?

234
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,020
He just gave you and Wu Xie a fortune

235
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,020
It's not a good thing

236
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,020
It can't ruin his business

237
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,020
I asked my men to send him some money

238
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,020
And then?

239
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,020
Don't tell me

240
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,020
I haven't seen this person before

241
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,020
Don't you want to know

242
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,020
What that old man is counting on you?

243
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,020
Even if you tell me

244
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,020
I don't believe it

245
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,020
Okay

246
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,020
Then I'll just say it

247
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,020
And you just listen to me

248
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,020
He said

249
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,020
You are a noble

250
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,020
Noble?

251
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,020
I will meet a noble

252
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,020
No

253
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,020
You are a noble yourself

254
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,020
You are a noble who has come and gone

255
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,020
But you don't know yourself

256
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,020
The Xie family died so strangely

257
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,020
Like being cursed

258
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,020
I was only eight years old when I became the leader

259
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,020
I am not a noble

260
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,020
You are wrong

261
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,020
Master San

262
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,020
Have some tea

263
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,020
Take some honey

264
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,020
Thank you

265
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,020
Thank you

266
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,020
Now

267
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,020
Are you still trying to hide the truth from the people in your direction?

268
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,020
You know

269
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,020
Keep it a secret

270
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,020
Don't let them know

271
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,020
What you are thinking and doing

272
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,020
You know better than the evil

273
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,020
How to protect yourself

274
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,020
Take this

275
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,020
Here you go

276
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,020
Your third uncle's camp

277
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,020
Is a little strange

278
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,020
Equipment is complete

279
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,020
But no one knows where to go

280
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,020
Could it be

281
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,020
Too happy to find the entrance

282
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,020
Didn't bring anything

283
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,020
Or less people when they left

284
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,020
That is to say

285
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,020
Many people may have died here

286
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,020
This death

287
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,020
Should happen after the explosion

288
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,020
You

289
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,020
There are still traces of snakes on this stone

290
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,020
Snake snake

291
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,020
Let's go to the six branches tonight

292
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,020
I'll take you

293
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,020
I'll accompany you for the night

294
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,020
Leave tomorrow

295
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,020
I'm afraid

296
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,020
No

297
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,020
You guard the plate

298
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,020
Why do I always have eyes like this?

299
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,020
You are too tired

300
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,020
Here you go

301
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,020
This is Pan's

302
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,020
You sleep in the tent tonight

303
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,020
Don't come out

304
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,020
Why do you want to go to the road for me?

305
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,020
He is afraid you can't come back

306
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,020
I can't come back

307
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,020
Give me his clothes

308
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,020
Pick a pair and wear it

309
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,020
Pick a pair to protect against the wind

310
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,020
I'll go to the house

311
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,020
Third Master

312
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,020
What are you doing in the dark at night?

313
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,020
Isn't this fire too self-sufficient?

314
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,020
I want to burn it and I'm afraid of my eyes hurting

315
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,020
This person is a little older

316
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,020
It's really not as good as you young people can burn

317
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,020
What about the flower?

318
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,020
I don't want to see dirty things

319
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,020
Come

320
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,020
Or you can wear one too

321
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,020
No, no, no

322
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,020
It's too long

323
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,020
I can't wear it

324
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,020
I can't wear it

325
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,020
Boss

326
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,020
The old and the young over there

327
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,020
They are all wearing sunglasses

328
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,020
It must be wrong

329
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,020
Should we also wear it?

330
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,020
Wait

331
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,020
Wu Sanxing asked me if I wanted to wear sunglasses

332
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,020
This is called the ancient zong

333
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,020
I added some material in their water

334
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,020
When the medicine comes up later

335
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,020
We'll do it

336
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,020
Brothers

337
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,020
Be more careful

338
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,020
Okay

339
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,020
Come

340
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,020
What a big fire

341
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,020
What a big fire

342
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,020
One more and one less

343
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,020
You are too inconspicuous

344
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,020
You are too inconspicuous

345
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,020
Sorry, Black Lord

346
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,020
Boss told us to break it one by one

347
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,020
We can only obey orders

348
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,020
If you are lucky

349
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,020
You can have a snake

350
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,020
Take a bite

351
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,020
You can also have less pain

352
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,020
If you are unlucky

353
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,020
You can have a blind bear

354
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,020
Then I'll have to trouble you to stop

355
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,020
Little friend

356
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,020
You can read more

357
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,020
There is no blind bear in this rain forest

358
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,020
You talk too much

359
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,020
You really don't want to show your face?

360
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,020
Don't you want to see

361
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,020
What kind of person he is with his sunglasses on?

362
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,020
Wait

363
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,020
The Taoist said

364
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,020
The people who have seen his eyes are dead

365
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,020
I want to see

366
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,020
What kind of person he is

367
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,020
Okay, okay, okay

368
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,020
I'm going to die anyway

369
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,020
Otherwise

370
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,020
I'll tell you

371
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,020
Why I always wear sunglasses

372
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,020
The reason is simple

373
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,020
Because

374
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,020
Because

375
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,020
I'm going to be completely blind

376
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,020
Then do you know why they call me black blind

377
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,020
Don't call me blind

378
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,020
Your surname is black

379
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,020
They call me black blind

380
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,020
Because I have a little

381
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,020
The ability that others don't know

382
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,020
What ability

383
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:21,020
I can take your eyes away

384
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,020
I'm going to die anyway

385
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,020
I'm going to die

386
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,020
Who turned off the light?

387
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,020
Why did the fire go out?

388
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,020
Wait, wait

389
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,020
It's also gone

390
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,020
I'm going to die anyway

391
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,020
You're already sleeping in the desert

392
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,020
Stop joking

393
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,020
How can you take our eyes away?

394
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,020
Then why don't you dare to look at my eyes?

395
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,020
Who said I dare not look at you?

396
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,020
I

397
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,020
Why can't I see

398
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,020
What happened?

399
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,020
Come with me

400
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,020
I can't see

401
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,020
What happened?

402
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,020
I can't see either

403
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,020
Now we are connected

404
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,020
The world is like a family

405
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,020
Why do you make me suffer

406
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,020
I make you suffer

407
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,020
I can't see anything

408
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,020
Brothers

409
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,020
In the future

410
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,020
Learn a little from me

411
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:15,020
Blind people can also raise their family

412
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,020
Let's go

413
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,020
Pan Zi

414
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,020
Pan Zi

415
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,020
Pan Zi

416
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,020
Pan Zi

417
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,020
Pan Zi

418
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,020
Why is it so hot?

419
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,020
Fire

420
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,020
Pan Zi

421
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,020
Hold on

422
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,020
I'll find Xiao Ge and Fatty

423
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,020
Wait for me

424
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,020
what is this?

425
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,020
is it a fat cat?

426
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,020
don't panic

427
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,020
i can't see

428
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,020
take this

429
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,020
don't panic

430
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,020
take this

431
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,020
you will see later

432
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,020
there is a poison outside

433
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,020
please don't talk loud

434
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,020
there is a snake all over the place

435
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,020
where did it go?

436
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,020
don't think it is over

437
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,520
Continue!

438
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,740
Put her in the coffin!

439
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,340
Don't talk.

440
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,160
Come out!

441
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,020
Hey, where are you going?

442
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,020
Where is Xiao Ge?

443
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,020
Xiao Ge is being bitten by a snake.

444
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,020
I'm going to bring her blood.

445
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,020
Don't move around here.

446
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,020
You'll see it later.

447
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,020
No, Xiao Ge is bitten.

448
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,020
Don't move around.

449
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,020
Boss, let's go to sleep.

450
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,020
Let's go.

451
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,020
Let's go.

452
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,020
Come on.

453
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,020
Monkey, come on.

454
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,020
Bear.

455
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,020
You're pretty good at this.

456
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,020
And you.

457
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,020
Didn't you get bitten?

458
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,020
You're so naughty.

459
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,020
Are you stupid?

460
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,020
If I don't blow on you, I'll be...

461
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,020
Boss.

462
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,020
I'll be so...

463
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,020
Boss.

464
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,020
What's wrong?

465
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,020
Are you going to blow on me?

466
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,020
It's getting darker.

467
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,020
I think so.

468
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,020
Don't you think...

469
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,020
I can't see anything?

470
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,020
I think so.

471
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,020
Who is it?

472
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,020
Boss.

473
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,020
I'll be so naughty.

474
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,020
I'll be so mean to you.

475
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,020
Aren't you a good boy?

476
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,020
You even gave me medicine.

477
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,020
Boss.

478
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,020
Take your hand.

479
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,020
Let's go.

480
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,020
Boss.

481
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,020
There's nothing wrong with the entrance.

482
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,020
And the lights are all right.

483
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,020
We can leave tomorrow morning.

484
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,020
Okay.

485
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,020
You look better than me.

486
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,020
What's wrong?

487
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,020
I'm dirty.

488
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,020
Hurry up and clean their eyes.

489
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,020
Or we'll have to take the oil bottle.

490
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,020
I want to tell you something.

491
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,020
In this team,

492
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:15,020
I'm the only one who looks handsome.

493
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,020
Boss.

494
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,020
When did you know about the weapon?

495
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,020
Before we entered the forest,

496
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,020
when did you know?

497
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,020
When you asked me to pick a protective mirror.

498
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,020
The one with dark glasses is not protective, right?

499
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,020
Why isn't he blind?

500
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,020
Why isn't he blind?

501
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,020
He's just capable.

502
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,020
Boss.

503
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,020
I'll apply the medicine.

504
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,020
You can't open your eyes in half an hour.

505
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,020
Remember.

506
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,020
You can't wash your face in half a year.

507
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,020
Or you'll have to wait for the next life.

508
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,020
I remember.

509
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,020
Boss.

510
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,020
Boss.

511
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,020
Oh, no.

512
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,020
Oh, no.

513
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,020
Boss.

514
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,020
How are you?

515
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,020
I got the medicine.

516
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,020
I'm fine.

517
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,020
Thank God.

518
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,020
He gave me the blood.

519
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,020
I have to save him.

520
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,020
Where is he?

521
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,020
He's bleeding.

522
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,020
You can't use it.

523
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,020
You'll get killed.

524
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,020
Leave me alone.

525
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,020
I'll go.

526
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,020
No, don't be silly.

527
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,020
You'll die if you go out.

528
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,020
I'm not dead.

529
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,020
I won't stop you if you have to go.

530
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,020
But you have to be careful.

531
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,020
You have to be careful with every move.

532
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,020
Take the water.

533
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,020
Okay.

534
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,020
Oh, no.

535
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,020
Brother.

536
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,020
Let's go.

537
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,020
Let's go.

538
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,020
Hurry up.

539
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,020
Hurry up.

540
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,020
Where is he?

541
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,020
Hurry up.

542
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,020
Brother.

543
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,020
We have to get the wound off.

544
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,020
Hurry up.

545
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,020
Be careful.

546
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,020
The wound is so deep.

547
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,020
The wound is so deep.

548
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,020
Finally, we're over.

549
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,020
Oh, my God.

550
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,020
Oh, my God.

551
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,020
Come on, Pan.

552
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,020
Have something.

553
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,020
Have something.

554
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,020
You three didn't see yesterday.

555
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,020
You were blind all of a sudden.

556
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,020
You were so reckless.

557
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,020
You said you were done for.

558
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,020
Did the camp get cursed?

559
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,020
What did you say?

560
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,020
You said you were done for.

561
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,020
You said you were done for.

562
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,020
Did they get cursed?

563
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,020
So what?

564
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,020
There was also the snake...

565
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,020
and the poison gas.

566
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,020
The gas脱 out in theound...

567
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,020
was all the water.

568
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,020
TheFire closed the gas.

569
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,020
Water was clean before.

570
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,020
It's clean here.

571
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,020
There isn't any During the mechanisms.

572
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,020
Everything is dirty.

573
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,020
If there is water,

574
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,020
there must be something over here.

575
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,020
You can only see it this way.

576
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,020
Don't start talking nonsense.

577
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,020
You're naive.

578
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,020
Didn't you say damages would be obvious?

579
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,020
What's the point in getting over there?

580
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,020
My father called his vendors off-the-wr sledge.

581
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,020
They didn't stop him.

582
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,020
I never seen any damage.

583
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,020
It was easy getting back out since it was still there.

584
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,620
You are not perfect

585
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,020
You are so unreasonable

586
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,020
Brother, are you okay?

587
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,020
Have some porridge

588
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,520
Let's leave after we finish eating

589
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,020
I can't stand the second snake fight

590
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,020
But we still don't have news of Sanye

591
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,520
Where can we go?

592
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,520
Go up

593
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,020
I took my glasses last night and looked at this bag

594
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,520
There is a temple in that direction

595
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,520
Whatever it is

596
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,520
Let's leave this place first

597
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:50,020
I feel so thin after all this trouble

598
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,020
Look, my belly is smaller

599
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,020
By the way, last night when I was blind

600
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,020
I think I saw something in my tent

601
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,020
And I smelled something fishy

602
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,520
Is it that woman?

603
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:05,020
Chenchen, is that woman in love with you?

604
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,020
She is a woman

605
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,020
You didn't see it the last time

606
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,020
Just like that

607
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,020
Don't joke

608
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,020
Who is joking with you?

609
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,020
I am a shopkeeper in the climbing garden

610
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,520
Even if there is a layer of mud

611
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,020
Even if there is a layer of mud

612
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,520
I can see it clearly

613
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,020
Just blow it

614
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,020
Think about it

615
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,520
You know all the women

616
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,020
You know all of them

617
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,020
My mom, my grandma

618
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,520
Anning, Dingzhu, Zhuo Ma

619
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
Her daughter-in-law Huo Xiu Xiu

620
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,520
And

621
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,520
Where are they?

622
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
Tell me the point

623
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,520
The point

624
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,520
There is another one

625
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,520
The one who was killed by the nursing home

626
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,520
It's half of it

627
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,520
There is another one

628
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,520
But I am not sure if it is still alive

629
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,520
Chen Wenjing

630
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,520
And Chen Wenjing

631
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,520
Leave a message to Dingzhu, Zhuo Ma

632
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,520
Said to wait for us for ten days at the destination

633
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,020
If she can't wait, she will go in by herself

634
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,020
It hurts

635
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,020
Yes

636
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,020
Do you remember the one in Chen Wenjing's diary?

637
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,020
Chen Wenjing was afraid of her

638
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,020
She

639
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,020
Then this woman is Chen Wenjing

640
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,020
No wonder she has been hiding from us

641
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,020
There is someone among us

642
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,020
How is that possible?

643
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,020
There were only four of us

644
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,020
Is there anyone who took someone

645
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,020
to get in with a mask on?

646
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,020
I am a real man

647
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,020
Look

648
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,020
Just this name?

649
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,020
You don't know

650
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,020
You came back in the middle of the festival

651
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,020
I have to check

652
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,020
You are a fake

653
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,020
You are a fake

654
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,020
When Pan Zi was having a fever

655
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,020
I also checked his forehead

656
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,020
It must be real

657
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,020
Yes, he can't be a fake

658
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,020
His body is not easy to fake

659
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,020
Brother, come

660
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,020
Come here, the water is big

661
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,020
It's big

662
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,520
How about we check it together?

663
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,520
It's so big

664
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,520
It's real

665
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,520
It's too hot

666
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
You can't remember it

667
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,520
Brother

668
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
You have to remember our hands

669
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,520
Waiter

670
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,520
Why is the water getting smaller and smaller?

671
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,520
Make it bigger

672
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,520
Are you not human?

673
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,520
You are torturing the wounded

674
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,520
And you are asking for so much

675
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,520
We are not torturing you

676
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,520
Pan Zi

677
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,520
Didn't you just sew the needle on your back?

678
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
You can't get wet

679
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,520
We are taking care of you

680
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,520
Pan Zi

681
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
Let's go

682
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,520
Hurry

683
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,520
Hurry

684
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,520
That's it

685
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,520
Come

686
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,520
Slowly

687
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,520
Slowly

688
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,520
I am far away from you

689
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,520
I feel much better

690
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,520
Hold it

691
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,520
Hold it

692
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,520
Oh no

693
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,520
I shouldn't have said that

694
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,520
But I did

695
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,520
Sorry, I was wrong

696
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,520
Don't you want to know

697
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,520
What the old man is counting?

698
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,520
Sorry, what's the word?

699
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,520
Good night

700
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,520
Fat man is really not good

701
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,520
Brother, the stick is very heavy

702
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,520
Your hand is very heavy

703
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,520
I didn't think about the overall balance

704
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,520
So

705
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,520
Sorry

706
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,520
Sorry

707
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,520
Sorry

708
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,520
Sorry

709
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,520
Sorry

710
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,520
Sorry

711
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,520
Sorry

712
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,520
Little Third Master

713
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,520
What did you say?

714
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,520
Again

715
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,520
Again

716
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,520
Be careful

717
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,520
Go to hell

718
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,520
Sorry

719
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,520
This cigarette

720
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,520
Don't sing

721
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,520
It seems to be

722
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,520
No

723
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,520
I didn't hurry to give you a treatment

724
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,520
We should take a few potholes

725
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,520
Sorry

726
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,520
I am sorry

727
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,520
Come on, come on

728
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,520
Be careful

729
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,520
Be careful

730
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,520
I am sorry

731
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,520
I am sorry

732
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,520
Oh my God

733
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,520
I am packing my things

734
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,520
I have to go

735
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,520
This is the last one

736
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,520
Oh my God
