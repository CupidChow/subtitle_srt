1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah!

2
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The King of Blaze

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
If the main character likes it, we have to help him find it.

4
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We can't ask more questions.

5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Where did he go?

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's what the Three-Dedged Man is like. He's gone in three days.

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I heard he's dead.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The Three-Dedged Man

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Episode 16

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Please be prepared.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The auction is about to begin.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If you can't call your grandma, you should go back as soon as possible.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Don't delay my business.

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Mrs. Huo, don't make fun of me.

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You don't have to bother my grandma's family.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
After my grandpa died, my grandma was in her hometown.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
She's a bad person. She's a short-lived ghost.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Your grandma and I are in the same age.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's been decades. She hasn't come to see me.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm in Hangzhou.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Now I'm asking her to see me.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Is it a joke?

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Mrs. Huo, how can I be late for your last-life grudges?

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
How about this? I'll go back and burn paper for my grandpa.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Let him dream of you. You two talk alone.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Let's go.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Brother Wu Xie, why don't you go back first?

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The auction will start soon. You can't walk around.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll go.

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
She's a bad person. You're a bad person too.

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Mrs. Huo, don't blame us for being bad people.

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I have to ask about the sample.

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Otherwise, the three of us will follow you.

34
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We'll follow you wherever you go.

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You have to sit.

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We have to sit too.

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Who told you to sit here? Stand up.

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Why is he sitting there?

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let the brothers prepare.

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay.

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If you don't say it, I won't stand up.

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Tell them to pull these rascals out.

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Mrs. Huo, you're a little too much.

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We're really bad people.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's not good to pull them out and hurt you.

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Brother Wu Xie, this is...

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Don't say it.

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He wants to sit. Let him sit.

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Mrs. Huo, you're a bad person.

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Mrs. Huo, I really did what I said.

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You just have to be happy. Don't pull them out.

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If my grandfather does anything that hurts you,

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
you can slap me.

54
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Okay.

55
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm afraid of you.

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You just sit here.

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Sit here until 4.30.

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If you can sit, I won't make it hard for you.

59
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Just sit here and tell me about Yang Shi Lei.

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Everyone, please sit.

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The New Moon Hotel auction is about to begin.

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's starting.

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The New Moon Hotel

64
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Look at this.

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
This is a good show.

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Hello, the number you have dialed is unavailable.

67
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm telling you to sit.

68
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm afraid that's not what I meant.

69
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Fatty, look.

70
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Why is no one sitting in this position?

71
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Mrs. Huo, you're not going to sit in the wrong position, are you?

72
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You're starting to see it.

73
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Since the time that Count Zhang sat in the wrong position,

74
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
no one has sat in this position for a long time.

75
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But the things we're shooting today are also very rare.

76
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
There are some people who don't want to die.

77
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
They're just a little bit of a tough guy.

78
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Please wait.

79
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What's going on?

80
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Mrs. Huo, has the Buddha ever sat here?

81
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That year, Count Zhang sat in this position

82
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
to get the New Moon.

83
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Do you think you can also count the auspicious day

84
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and get the beauty back?

85
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Mrs. Huo, can you stop joking with me?

86
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That guy is the one who drank the tea with 7,000 degrees.

87
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
These are from the New Moon Hotel.

88
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If you have any other orders, you can call us anytime.

89
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Ghost blood?

90
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The ghost blood that was auctioned today?

91
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Fatty, look.

92
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Ghost bird dragon fish jade seal, start the auction.

93
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It really is a ghost blood.

94
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
How is it? Is it young?

95
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's a young ghost blood.

96
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Isn't this the scene from the movie

97
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
that was shown in the movie

98
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
that was shown in the movie?

99
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Ghost bird dragon fish jade seal.

100
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Above the jade seal is the shape of a ghost.

101
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The ghost is standing on three heads.

102
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The ghost's claws are on the claws of the ghost.

103
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And this ghost looks like it's made up of countless ghosts.

104
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
If you look at the ghost from another angle,

105
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
you can see the shape of the dragon fish in the shape of the jade.

106
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The original owner of the ghost is Lu Shang Wang.

107
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It is said that Lu Shang Wang found a purple jade box

108
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
in the belly of a giant cat.

109
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The box was filled with ghost blood.

110
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It is said that if you get the ghost blood as a token,

111
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
you can get the name of the ghost.

112
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
There are also rumors that only ghost blood can open the blue and red gates

113
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
to witness the power of the ghost.

114
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The end.

115
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The end.

116
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Where is the jade?

117
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The end.

118
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Master Hua, your bell.

119
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What's the use of giving me this bell?

120
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That silly boy is sitting there.

121
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Light the lantern.

122
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Great!

123
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's been a long time since anyone has dared to light this lantern in this restaurant.

124
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You have been a leader of your family.

125
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
From now on, no one knows or respects you.

126
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You are the prestige of the Wu family.

127
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Lighting the lantern?

128
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But it's just a moment.

129
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm afraid your family will be burned down by this lantern.

130
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Fatty, what time is it?

131
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's four o'clock.

132
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
We have half an hour left.

133
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Half an hour left.

134
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

135
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
No matter who takes pictures of the lantern in the auction house,

136
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I will add a ticket to the auction house automatically.

137
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That means I will take the whole place.

138
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That means no matter how high the price is, you will pay for it.

139
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
How much is the value of the jade?

140
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The price of the whole house is not high enough.

141
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
No wonder you made me sit here and wait.

142
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Mrs. Huo, if I can't light the lantern today,

143
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Xin Yue Hotel will be in trouble.

144
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
If I have any problems,

145
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yang Shi Lei will have to die with me.

146
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You can't get anything.

147
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So you want to borrow money from me?

148
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It depends on whether Yang Shi Lei is important or money is important.

149
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You don't have to ask.

150
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I have never said that I only do business with living people.

151
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's more convenient for me to take it when you're dead.

152
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The third master of the Wu family is sitting in the position of lighting the lantern.

153
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Don't you care?

154
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
How can I care?

155
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But only the Buddha has ever sat in that position.

156
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
If Wu Xi wants to light the lantern, let him do it.

157
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm going to go.

158
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Now we're going to start the auction.

159
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,920
The Dragon and Fish

160
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Dragon and Fish is going to start the auction.

161
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
The price will be calculated by the ratio.

162
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Each auction will be worth at least one million.

163
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The highest price will be ten million.

164
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Five thousand?

165
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Please start.

166
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Five thousand and one million.

167
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Six thousand and one million.

168
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The second floor is worth six thousand and one million.

169
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The Wushan Jun is gone.

170
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Six thousand and five million.

171
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Seven thousand and ten million.

172
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The Changsha stall is gone.

173
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Seven thousand and five million.

174
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
The Zhu Zhanmei is gone.

175
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Xiu Xiu, go and order a Mu Kezhai for the young master of the Wu family.

176
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Nothing is left.

177
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's a warning.

178
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Eight thousand and five million.

179
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Twenty-seven.

180
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I can't let this burn down.

181
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Thirty-sixth, nine thousand and one million.

182
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm so frustrated.

183
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's almost one hundred million.

184
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
One million.

185
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The second floor is worth one million.

186
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The Wushan Jun is gone.

187
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's time for a break.

188
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm seeing things.

189
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
This girl is a fairy.

190
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
She's got a bell.

191
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
She's called Jia.

192
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
She's got a song.

193
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
She never missed a beat.

194
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The second floor is worth one million.

195
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Two and one million.

196
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I've figured it out.

197
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I can't even get one million.

198
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm sure I'll make it.

199
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Don't just watch the fun.

200
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Get ready to run away.

201
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
No way.

202
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I can hear it.

203
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
How can it be so good?

204
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm sure you've fallen in love with it.

205
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Look at it.

206
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Little girl.

207
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
We'll be crazy in a minute.

208
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Shut up.

209
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
They're going to destroy the light.

210
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Come on.

211
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Oh, no.

212
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I can hear it.

213
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's locked.

214
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Sit here.

215
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'll leave it to you.

216
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Okay.

217
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You're crazy.

218
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Hey.

219
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Hey.

220
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What do you mean crazy?

221
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'll be the boss.

222
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'll make you crazy.

223
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's four o'clock.

224
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's really late.

225
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Little girl.

226
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Little girl.

227
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Good girl.

228
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What's going on?

229
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's four o'clock.

230
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Get him up from the chair.

231
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Hurry up.

232
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Stop.

233
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You can't be stupid.

234
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You can hit the factory.

235
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
My bodyguard can protect me.

236
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Do it.

237
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You're going to get it.

238
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You're going to get it.

239
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Old bastard.

240
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You're going to get it.

241
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You're going to get it.

242
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Old bastard.

243
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
The electric pole is going to be smashed.

244
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Old bastard.

245
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
What's wrong with you?

246
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You're crazy.

247
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You don't have any energy, do you?

248
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
People with you won't go to work.

249
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,700
You don't have any

250
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,000
power or blood, will you?

251
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,860
Turn around and add some power.

252
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,860
Bring背.

253
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:06,920
Let's get him!

254
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,120
YEEEHAHHHH!

255
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,720
B lange Extremadura!!!

256
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
One!

257
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Two!

258
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,720
Three!

259
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,720
Four!

260
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
Five!

261
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
Six!

262
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Seven!

263
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Eight!

264
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
Nine!

265
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Ten!

266
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
Eleven!

267
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,720
Twelve!

268
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,720
Thirteen!

269
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Fifteen!

270
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Why don't I have a meatball?

271
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
Boss,

272
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,720
it's better not to move during the auction.

273
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Let's go.

274
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
Go away.

275
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,720
You're not going to fight with me.

276
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,720
Xiao Ke!

277
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Stop fighting!

278
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,720
You broke the rules of the Xiyue Hotel.

279
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
The King of Hell will not spare you.

280
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
Master Hua,

281
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
the goods are in this state.

282
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,720
You don't have to worry about it.

283
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
Fine.

284
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
I don't care about you.

285
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
When you want to sell ghost laundry,

286
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
come to the store and find me.

287
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
You guys do it yourself.

288
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,720
Listen,

289
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
what is he doing inside?

290
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,720
He seems to be listening to two butterflies.

291
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,720
I can't run away.

292
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
My face is going to be smashed.

293
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
I can't run away.

294
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Did you hear that?

295
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
Madam.

296
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,720
Brother Xiao Hua,

297
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
you're here.

298
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
Madam,

299
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
I have a favor to ask of you.

300
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
A favor?

301
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
It seems to be a small matter.

302
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
The situation is so chaotic,

303
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
I'll just say it.

304
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,720
I want to ask you about Lu Huang Bo.

305
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,720
You're investigating Lu Huang Bo?

306
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
This uncle said that the Ninth Gate

307
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,720
brought him out of the Four-Girl Mountain.

308
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
You also participated in it.

309
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,720
I think only you know about this.

310
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,720
There's one more thing.

311
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
I know that you've been collecting ghost laundry.

312
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
When Wu Xie said he wanted to sell the picture,

313
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
I knew that the buyer was you.

314
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,720
It's just a ghost laundry.

315
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
You're thinking too much.

316
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
The Huo family is very famous.

317
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
Only you are not here.

318
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
Aren't you just waiting for this picture of Wu Xie?

319
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
I'm old.

320
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,720
He said that he's old,

321
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
his skin is loose,

322
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
and he's going to do beauty.

323
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
The restaurant has been open for too long.

324
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,720
The owner is too busy.

325
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
The owner is too busy.

326
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,720
I'm too busy.

327
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
Today,

328
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
we'll make the right decision

329
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
and give you a good one.

330
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
You've said so much.

331
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,720
What do you want?

332
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,720
Madam,

333
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
if you want to act,

334
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
please bring us.

335
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
I know it's time.

336
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,720
Sit.

337
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,720
Why should I cooperate with you?

338
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,720
The Huo family is no longer the same as before.

339
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,720
The best partner

340
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,720
is our Xie family.

341
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,720
Our Jiumen has always been in the middle.

342
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,720
You and Xie Lian Huan

343
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,720
have not been released from it.

344
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
Now it's our turn.

345
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,720
Madam,

346
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,720
you're helping us

347
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
and yourself.

348
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,720
Fine.

349
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,720
There will be more cooperation in the future.

350
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Madam,

351
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,720
this light is not Wu Xie's intention.

352
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,720
Since you want to cooperate with me,

353
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
then I should help you,

354
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,720
not Wu Xie.

355
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
Get up.

356
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,720
Let Wu Xie

357
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,720
handle it himself.

358
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,720
Don't let me down

359
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,720
Your beauty

360
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
I'm with you

361
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,720
I'm with you

362
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Flying through the world

363
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,720
I'm with you

364
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,720
When autumn wind blows

365
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
Autumn leaves fall

366
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,720
I can be with you

367
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,720
He's practicing his handwriting again.

368
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
What should we do now?

369
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,720
He doesn't care, neither do we.

370
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,720
Go back to the room and lock the door.

371
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,720
Listen to the song.

372
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
Tianzhen, catch him.

373
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
What?

374
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,720
You can't take him back to Ximen Street.

375
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
Madam

376
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,720
Madam

377
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,720
We have to change the plan.

378
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
Fine.

379
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,720
I'll wait for you.

380
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,720
Go.

381
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
Go.

382
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
It's too big a goal for us to run like this.

383
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
If the people of Xunyue Fang's family come back,

384
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
and pull another group of people,

385
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,720
it will be awkward if we are attacked by the King Yi.

386
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,720
No.

387
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
We are not familiar with the roads in Beijing.

388
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,720
If we separate,

389
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
Xiao Ge will not be able to find it.

390
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,720
And the things are in our hands.

391
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,720
They definitely dare not to attack us.

392
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
If we separate,

393
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
people who have nothing will be in trouble.

394
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
There.

395
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
Go.

396
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
Go.

397
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
Little Third Master.

398
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,720
You are very impressive.

399
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,720
What?

400
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
You haven't seen enough of the scenes of the Xinyue Hotel.

401
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
You still want to play here?

402
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,720
I came here today for the ghost.

403
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,720
I didn't expect to be lit by you.

404
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,720
If you can shoot it well,

405
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
I won't say much.

406
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
But you broke the rules.

407
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,720
Don't blame me for not being reasonable.

408
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,720
Your third uncle didn't teach you the rules of the martial arts world.

409
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
I, Liuli Sun,

410
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
will teach you a good lesson today.

411
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,720
Bring the ghost flag back to me.

412
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,720
Come on.

413
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
Brother.

414
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,720
The new thief is the new king.

415
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,720
Are we late?

416
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
Not at all.

417
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
That scene just now is not suitable for you.

418
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,720
You go to my house with my uncle first.

419
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
I'll fight with you later.

420
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,720
Get in the car.

421
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
Second Master.

422
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,720
Is Changsha's mother's cloth yours?

423
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,720
That guy ran away.

424
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
Second Master, if you look for him,

425
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,720
I'll find him for you.

426
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,720
Thank you, Second Master.

427
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,720
For coming to save me this time.

428
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,720
No.

429
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,720
I'm not here to save you.

430
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
I'm here to beat you.

431
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,720
Second Master.

432
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Liuli Sun has already entered.

433
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
It's not easy to beat him.

434
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,720
Xiao Hua.

435
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,720
You're in a good mood.

436
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,720
I was depressed when I was in the New Moon Hotel.

437
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,720
But I feel much better after seeing Liuli Sun being caught by the police.

438
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,720
I feel much better after seeing Liuli Sun being caught by the police.

439
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,720
I have to go now.

440
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,720
I'll see you later.

441
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,720
You're that...

442
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,720
You're Huo Xiuxiu, right?

443
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,720
Yes.

444
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,720
I'm...

445
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,720
I know.

446
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,720
You're Wang Fatty.

447
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,720
Take it.

448
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,720
You...

449
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,720
and that young brother,

450
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,720
His name is Zhang Qiling.

451
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,080
You don't have to be so cartoonish

452
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,960
I'm in Beijing

453
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,480
and I'm the only one with the same hair

454
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,080
It doesn't suit me

455
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,520
It's not bad to have a hairpin

456
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,640
Why do you pick it?

457
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,840
I just finished talking about you

458
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,120
By the way, Senior

459
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm not safe here

460
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,600
People from Xin Yue Hotel will come to me at any time

461
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,520
Use the phone

462
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,920
Where can they go?

463
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,560
A very suitable place

464
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,520
your orgasm

465
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,420
This is the old store

466
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,600
This old shop is full of treasures.

467
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,600
Usually, no one comes here.

468
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,600
It's safe for you to stay here.

469
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,600
Xiaoxiao, you're fat, but I...

470
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,600
I ate a piece of lamb today and a pound of melon seeds.

471
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
I ate two.

472
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,600
I'm hungry now.

473
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
Is there anything to eat?

474
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Why don't you order first?

475
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,600
I'll go prepare food and supplies now.

476
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
It's good to eat something.

477
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,600
The ham is also meat.

478
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,600
Remember, don't go out.

479
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,600
Hurry up.

480
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,600
This sample is definitely left by your third uncle.

481
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,600
The buyer invited you to the New Moon Hotel.

482
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,600
But there is a auction today.

483
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,600
You took back the ghost.

484
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
You took back the ghost.

485
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
What a coincidence.

486
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,600
I was still arranged by someone.

487
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,600
Have you ever thought that

488
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,600
he was actually guiding your curiosity

489
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,600
and let you explore all the way?

490
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,600
You mean I was arranged by the Ninth Gate?

491
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,600
No, the Ninth Gate chose you.

492
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
That's right.

493
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:21,600
You are the chosen one.

494
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,600
Tianzhen, while we're free,

495
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,600
take out that treasure and open your eyes.

496
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,600
Hurry up.

497
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Hurry up.

498
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
Hurry up.

499
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,600
Maybe we won't be able to touch it tomorrow.

500
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,600
One, two, three, four.

501
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
Oh my.

502
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
What's wrong?

503
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,600
This is a silk one.

504
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
Why is there one missing?

505
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,600
There's more than one missing.

506
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,600
This is called the ghost.

507
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,600
This corresponds to the sound of the ring.

508
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,600
The owner of this ghost will definitely

509
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
wear three rings all the time.

510
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
Look.

511
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
When you grab it like this,

512
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,600
the ring is exactly in the cut.

513
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Come on.

514
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,600
That's right.

515
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,600
We've been working on this for a long time.

516
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,600
I'll go wash my face.

517
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,600
I'll go wash my face.

518
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,600
I'll go wash my face.

519
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,600
I'll go wash my face.

520
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
Okay, cut.

521
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
Okay, cut.

522
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,600
Excuse me.

523
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
Excuse me.

524
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Excuse me.

525
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,600
Okay, cut.

526
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
Seven thousand.

527
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,600
Where's the house?

528
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,600
Seven thousand and five million.

529
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,600
There's nothing.

530
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
This girl is a fairy.

531
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,600
She can bear a ring.

532
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,600
She'll be a good price.

533
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,600
Come on, come on.

534
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,600
Okay, come in.

535
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,600
How much is the ghost worth?

536
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,600
I'm afraid this house is not expensive.

537
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,600
I'm sorry, but you keep asking me to sit here.

538
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,600
Okay, cut.

539
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Don't look back

540
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,600
Because I'm not here

541
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,600
See you again

542
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,600
But I'll be back

543
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:50,600
I'll give you my life

544
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,600
The only thing left is the obsession of life

545
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,600
I'll run to the end of the world

546
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,600
I'll wait for you to come back

547
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,600
Where's the boy?

548
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,600
I'll go wash my face.

549
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,600
I don't need you

550
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
I have a place to go

551
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
Please take the chance

552
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,600
To hear the worry of meeting again

553
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,600
I'll give you my life

554
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,600
Come on, come on, come on.

555
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,600
Come on, come on, come on.

556
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,600
Come on, come on, come on.

557
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,600
