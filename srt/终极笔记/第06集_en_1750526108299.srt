1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,840
I am not a fool.

2
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,920
I am a man of my word.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I am a man of my word.

4
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,080
I am a man of my word.

5
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,160
I am a man of my word.

6
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,240
I am a man of my word.

7
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,320
I am a man of my word.

8
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
I am a man of my word.

9
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,480
I am a man of my word.

10
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,560
I am a man of my word.

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,640
I am a man of my word.

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,720
I am a man of my word.

13
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
I am a man of my word.

14
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,880
I am a man of my word.

15
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,880
I am a man of my word.

16
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,880
What is this?

17
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,960
It seems that the Queen Mother is really a tyrant.

18
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
Enough, fatso. Stop playing.

19
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,040
This is not right.

20
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
I am sorry, gentlemen.

21
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
I have disturbed you. We are leaving now.

22
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,720
How can this be so evil?

23
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
This is not human at all.

24
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,880
What is that?

25
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Look carefully.

26
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,040
It is a cloud.

27
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,640
Tell me.

28
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,720
Why haven't we seen the transfer?

29
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,720
That is not certain.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Look.

31
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,960
This is...

32
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,040
The human's spine.

33
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
It is not that short.

34
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
This is the fish bone.

35
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
Yes.

36
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,360
This is a legendary animal.

37
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,440
It is called the human fish.

38
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
Human fish?

39
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
It has been thousands of years.

40
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
The human fish fossil is in this place.

41
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
And the structure of the rock layer.

42
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,840
Basically, it can be judged that this place was a valley.

43
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
Do you remember the ancient ship?

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The ship?

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The ship that was sent by the Queen Mother...

46
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
should have been sent by the Queen Mother.

47
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,160
So...

48
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,240
There must be a river.

49
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,320
That's right.

50
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Enough.

51
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
Let's not waste time. Let's go.

52
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Don't go.

53
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,640
You can take it back and study it.

54
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,720
Do you know why they are so human?

55
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Why?

56
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,880
Because...

57
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
You...

58
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
You know too much.

59
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
What is this?

60
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
It is a kind of pain.

61
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,440
It used to be a kind of pain.

62
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,520
But it is not that now.

63
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
But you can try it.

64
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,680
Try what?

65
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,760
You go first.

66
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,840
Why should I go first?

67
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,840
I am going.

68
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
I said, when is it?

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Why are you still in the mood for creation?

70
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,080
Don't move.

71
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
I think...

72
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
we should split up.

73
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
We should go first.

74
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
We will gather here in 15 minutes.

75
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,040
No need.

76
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,120
If this is the ancient river...

77
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,200
that the ship was sent by...

78
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,280
then the mural in the ship...

79
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
should be this ancient river.

80
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
I have been studying it.

81
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,520
Give me some time.

82
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
You want to judge the location by your memory.

83
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
It is a bit difficult.

84
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,760
I remember the mural...

85
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
even the changes in the sun.

86
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,920
We can judge the direction of the river...

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
by the direction of the sun...

88
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
and the height of the river.

89
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
We have a 30 degree difference...

90
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,240
between the ancient river and the current one.

91
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Pan Zi.

92
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
This direction.

93
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,480
Wait.

94
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,480
If we go to the cold water...

95
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,560
the mural in the grave...

96
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,640
is not necessarily the West King's tomb.

97
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,720
It might be a tomb, a grave...

98
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
or a treasure house.

99
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
This...

100
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
What is that?

101
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
What is that?

102
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
You have restored the mural?

103
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
You are so talented, young man.

104
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,880
It is a bit rough.

105
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,960
But this mural is still worth the effort.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
A human face?

107
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
You have seen it.

108
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Have you heard of the Cloud Sky Palace?

109
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
Changbai Mountain?

110
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Yes, there is a human face in the sky.

111
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,320
The sky is in Changbai Mountain.

112
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
But we are in Tangtou.

113
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,480
The connection between them...

114
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,560
is interesting.

115
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
The bird is one of the traditional statues of the West King's tomb.

116
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
The human face is an upgraded version of the bird.

117
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
But this thing can appear here.

118
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
Maybe this is the core of the West King's tomb.

119
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
Let's go in and see.

120
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,920
Wait.

121
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What is this?

122
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
My eyes.

123
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
I have been standing here for a long time.

124
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,240
You drew my eyes here.

125
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,320
Your main function is to make a ratio.

126
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
I drew your eyes out of respect.

127
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,480
Okay, let's find a way.

128
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
This should be the right place.

129
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
You drew it wrong.

130
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
What is wrong?

131
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,440
The mouth of the human face bird is closed.

132
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,520
You drew it with your mouth open.

133
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
Among the four human faces,

134
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
three are in the shape of a kite.

135
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,760
Only one is standing.

136
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
Okay, let's dig here.

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This is our equipment.

138
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
Our people should be nearby.

139
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Let's go.

140
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,280
Not only the equipment,

141
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,360
there is also a car.

142
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Let's go.

143
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
It seems to be here.

144
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
This should be the entrance of the West King's tomb.

145
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,960
Okay, let's go in and see.

146
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
Let's go.

147
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,280
I didn't expect this car to be blown here.

148
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
This is a car that comes with seven colors.

149
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,440
It's faster than us.

150
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,520
But it looks like this car can't drive.

151
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
There are some equipment here.

152
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,680
Supplies and medicines.

153
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Let's share them.

154
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,840
Okay.

155
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Let's share them.

156
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,280
Brother, is there a problem?

157
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
Stop.

158
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,880
I think the hill is moving.

159
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Let's go.

160
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
It's the King of Ice.

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You promised.

162
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Run.

163
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
It's a big pit.

164
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,480
It's a big pit.

165
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,560
What should we do now?

166
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,640
Don't go down.

167
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
We don't know if we have enough safety nets.

168
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
If we don't have enough nets,

169
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
it will be awkward if we don't go down.

170
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Let's go down first.

171
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
No, the fog is very heavy.

172
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
It's too dangerous if we go down.

173
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Let's go down.

174
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
Or you can continue to discuss.

175
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,640
Let's ask them.

176
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
Let's go.

177
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
You can do it.

178
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
What should I do?

179
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
We have to reduce the weight.

180
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,760
We can't just die.

181
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,840
We can't just leave these bugs.

182
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
This is a heavy truck.

183
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
Let's go.

184
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
What did I say?

185
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
The rope fell off.

186
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
We can't go down now.

187
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,560
What should we do?

188
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Where are they?

189
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
They won't fall down, right?

190
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,640
They cut the rope themselves.

191
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,640
We can't go down.

192
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,520
I didn't expect there to be such a big pit in the desert.

193
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
It's really a place of exploration.

194
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,680
The environment here is complicated.

195
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
We have to be careful.

196
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Don't make a scene.

197
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,680
They can't hold on.

198
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,760
They can go down.

199
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,840
I can't go down.

200
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
Then you stay here.

201
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Wait until the wind blows.

202
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Listen to me.

203
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,680
We seem to have found the right place.

204
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
The West Lake is in the rain.

205
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,840
It's poisonous and cruel.

206
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
But you dare not come down here.

207
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
You dare not come down here.

208
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
There must be something more terrifying than this.

209
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,080
I thank you for telling me such good news.

210
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
Take it.

211
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
No.

212
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
I will never give my life to these big mountain tigers.

213
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
I said, take it for me.

214
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
Hurry up.

215
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
And then?

216
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,640
And then?

217
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Goodbye.

218
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Wu Xie, you're a big man.

219
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
I told you.

220
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I have to tell you everything after I go down.

221
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,080
If there's anything wrong with me...

222
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,160
Fatty!

223
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Sun, are you okay?

224
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
I'm fine.

225
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
I'm fine.

226
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Are you okay?

227
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
I'm fine.

228
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
It hurts.

229
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I said, is there anyone who can pull Fatty?

230
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,280
I'll do it.

231
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
I'm afraid of the police.

232
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Wait.

233
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,640
Wait.

234
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,120
Wait.

235
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
Don't touch it.

236
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
What's going on?

237
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
It looks like an animal's egg.

238
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
Egg?

239
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
What animal is it?

240
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
It's a snake.

241
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
Snake.

242
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,840
You're so rude.

243
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,920
Why didn't you save me?

244
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's heavy.

245
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,080
You're talking to Fatty.

246
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
Don't you care about manners?

247
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
You're so rude.

248
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Let me go.

249
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Tianzhen, you're so nice to me.

250
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,680
Brother!

251
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,760
It's his neck.

252
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,840
Let me see.

253
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Why did it get like this?

254
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Give me a hand.

255
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
This thing doesn't look like snake eggs.

256
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,540
It feels soft, like a mushroom.

257
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,580
Anning, what is this?

258
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,580
Are you okay?

259
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Take off your clothes.

260
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,440
You were not far from these things.

261
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,440
See if there is anything on your body.

262
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,960
See if there is anything on your body.

263
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,560
Fatso.

264
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,560
Fatso.

265
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,760
This guy, his hand is too heavy.

266
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,360
Be careful.

267
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
Who? Who hit me?

268
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
Who? Who hit me?

269
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,560
Who?

270
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,560
Who?

271
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,560
Who?

272
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
Who?

273
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,560
Look at the layout of this room.

274
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,560
This is the master bedroom.

275
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,560
This is the guest bedroom.

276
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,560
It looks like a place to entertain guests.

277
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,560
Green bird?

278
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
It looks like this is the queen's palace.

279
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,560
This thing is interesting.

280
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,560
Green bird is the ambassador of the queen.

281
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,560
Except for her, no one is interested.

282
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
Is this the queen's palace?

283
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,560
We didn't find it so easily.

284
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,560
I don't know if this is the queen's palace.

285
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
But I'm sure of one thing.

286
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
There is a mechanism here.

287
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Thank you for saving my life.

288
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,560
I'll take it.

289
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,560
You fatso.

290
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,560
Mother, your clothes are too hot.

291
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
I'll go get them.

292
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,560
Tianzhen, did you find anything new?

293
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,560
It's just an environmental record.

294
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,560
The altitude here is low.

295
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,560
The heat is very high.

296
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,560
The steam is very strong.

297
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,560
I don't know if our anti-toxic mask can handle it.

298
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,560
As long as the road is not wrong,

299
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,560
the water will be clear.

300
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,560
According to the record,

301
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,560
this is the only entrance to the queen's palace.

302
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,560
But where exactly is it?

303
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,560
Did your aunt not tell you?

304
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,560
This map is very creative.

305
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,560
There is no reference or direction.

306
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,560
It's all questions.

307
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,560
The best thing is,

308
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,560
we don't even know where we are.

309
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,560
The queen's palace is in the deep corner of the rain forest.

310
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,560
We are going deep into the rain forest.

311
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,560
We are not wrong.

312
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,560
Chen Wenjing is really a cheat.

313
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,560
He told you that there is something in front of you,

314
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,560
but he didn't tell you what it is.

315
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,560
He should have told us that there is a map.

316
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,560
He should have told us to walk like a thunder.

317
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,560
Fatso,

318
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,560
you should be polite to my aunt.

319
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,560
When did Chen Wenjing become your aunt?

320
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,560
Third Master is my master.

321
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Wenjing is my aunt.

322
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,560
You just called her your aunt.

323
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,560
Fine, fine.

324
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,560
I can't be a part of your family.

325
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,560
There is water, food,

326
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,560
lighters, cold fireworks, medicine,

327
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,560
and I gave two bags of food to each person.

328
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,560
Even if I have an accident,

329
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,560
I can't guarantee the rest.

330
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,560
Let's hurry up and eat something.

331
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,560
Let's change our ways.

332
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,560
Brother, go ahead.

333
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,560
Let's go.

334
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,560
Slow down, Fatso.

335
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,560
Give me your hand.

336
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,560
Let's go.

337
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,560
Let's go.

338
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,560
There is a lot of hot water in the bag.

339
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,560
You can spray it.

340
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,560
It's better not to use it.

341
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,560
The environment here is different from the normal environment.

342
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,560
It's very likely that you have removed the mosquitoes.

343
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,560
The smell of mosquitoes

344
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,560
has attracted other things.

345
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,560
So, it's not good.

346
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,560
The equipment we bring this time is limited.

347
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,560
Even if we run into a wild boar,

348
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,560
it's enough for us to take care of it.

349
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,560
It's raining.

350
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,560
There is some clean water.

351
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,560
Once you enter the swamp,

352
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,560
you must not go to the pond.

353
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,560
You must not touch the mud.

354
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,560
You are good, Fatso.

355
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,560
You know a lot.

356
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,560
I have seen a person

357
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,560
who's feet are stuck in the swamp.

358
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,560
It's less than a minute.

359
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,560
When he pulled it out, it was a hole.

360
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
It was empty.

361
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,560
I don't know why it was bitten.

362
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,560
In this environment,

363
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,560
it's better not to use it.

364
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
It's very likely

365
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,560
that you have removed the mosquitoes.

366
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,560
Look, there's a trap.

367
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,560
Okay.

368
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,560
Take the money.

369
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
Don't waste it.

370
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,560
Be careful.

371
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,560
Come with me.

372
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,560
Beat them.

373
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,560
Come on.

374
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,560
Flying away?

375
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,560
Normally, it takes only one punch.

376
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,560
But this bird can go so far.

377
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
It seems that it's not afraid of people.

378
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,560
Isn't this bird an ambassador?

379
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,560
Is this how you do public work?

380
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,560
When the door was just opened,

381
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,560
these two people fell in.

382
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,560
Someone deliberately put them on the door.

383
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,560
Who else?

384
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,560
Third Master.

385
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,560
Look at this.

386
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,560
Money.

387
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,560
It seems that you are right.

388
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,560
Wu Sanxing, in order to prevent people around him,

389
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,560
can only take advantage of the time

390
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,560
to deal with the body

391
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,560
and secretly get rid of it.

392
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,560
It seems that the person Third Master is looking for

393
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,560
is not only bad,

394
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
but also very good.

395
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,560
He's just a flyer.

396
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
He's just a flyer.

397
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,560
Let's go.

398
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,560
We have to find Third Master as soon as possible.

399
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
We've been walking for two hours.

400
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
There's water here.

401
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
Do you want to rest?

402
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,560
How is it?

403
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,560
I'm dizzy.

404
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,560
You should rest.

405
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,560
The rain is heavy.

406
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,560
You need to replenish your water.

407
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,560
You don't feel well?

408
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
You don't have a fever.

409
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
Here, give you a blanket.

410
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,560
Brother, is there a problem with the water?

411
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,560
Be careful.

412
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,560
There's a snake in the water.

413
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,560
I'll go wash my face.

414
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,560
Fatty, my body

415
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,560
is the foundation of revolution.

416
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,560
Even if Wu Xie is thin,

417
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,560
he can't handle it at critical moments.

418
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,560
Brother, did Mrs. Wenjin

419
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,560
tell you that you must go to the

420
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,560
West Palace the next day?

421
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560
I understand.

422
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
The rain is heavy.

423
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,560
There's water in the West Palace.

424
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,560
All the water will flow to the same place.

425
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,560
You mean West Palace?

426
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,560
I've been thinking

427
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,560
why Mrs. Wenjin

428
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,560
chose the rain.

429
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,560
It seems that's the only reason.

430
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,560
So, we can find the entrance

431
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,560
if we follow the water?

432
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,560
I think so.

433
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,560
Let's toast.

434
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,560
I just don't know

435
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,560
how is Master San.

436
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,560
Don't worry.

437
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,560
We're not as close as Master San.

438
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,560
Don't worry.

439
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,560
Why does he have to wash his face?

440
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
Wu Xie, you're taking a bath.

441
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,560
Do you need a bath?

442
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
I can help you.

443
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,560
Wu Xie!

444
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,560
Wu Xie!

445
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,560
Wu Xie!

446
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,560
Wu Xie!

447
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,560
Tianzhen!

448
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Why is your stomach aching?

449
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,560
What's wrong with you?

450
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,560
Did you get bitten by a bug?

451
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
Why is there a mold?

452
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,560
There's something in the mold!

453
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,560
Isn't it...

454
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,560
It looks like an animal's egg.

455
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,560
Isn't it the thing I stuck on my ass?

456
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,560
It's smaller than this.

457
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,560
The early things in Yushan Mountain

458
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,560
were handled in time.

459
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
Wu Xie was accidentally bitten.

460
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,560
It was not cleaned in time.

461
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
It's spread now.

462
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,560
I want to know

463
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
how he got bitten.

464
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,560
Wu Xie!

465
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,560
Tianzhen!

466
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,560
Master San!

467
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,560
Listen to me!

468
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,560
Stop fighting!

469
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,560
Otherwise, I'll only be able to get you out of here!

470
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,560
Don't fight!

471
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,560
Master San's illness

472
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,560
is related to this mold.

473
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,560
Let's see if we can just scratch it.

474
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,560
This mold is too close to the skin.

475
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,560
It can't be separated.

476
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,560
Is it like

477
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,560
a snake egg

478
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,560
under the mold?

479
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,560
Why is Tianzhen growing mushrooms here?

480
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,560
What should we do?

481
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,560
Wait for the mushrooms to grow.

482
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,560
Wait for the mushrooms to grow?

483
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,560
How can we do that?

484
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,560
The blood is all dried up!

485
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,560
We can't fight!

486
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,560
Listen to me!

487
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,560
There's no other way.

488
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,560
Let's go find a place to camp tonight.

489
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,560
These thorns are placed here.

490
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,560
They're for the party.

491
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,560
Don't worry.

492
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,560
I'll protect you.

493
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,560
I'll go check it out.

494
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,560
Go to Lao Hao's house.

495
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,560
500.

496
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,560
Come and help me!

497
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Tianzhen, you must be safe.

498
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,560
Otherwise,

499
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,560
I'll regret it for the rest of my life!

500
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,560
Stop!

501
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,560
What's wrong, Xiao Ge?

502
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,560
Why don't we rest here?

503
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Let's take it here.

504
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,560
Wait.

505
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,560
I'll go check over there.

506
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,560
Tianzhen,

507
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,560
can you hear me?

508
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,560
I'm fine.

509
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,560
I'm here.

510
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,720
Can you hear me?

511
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,240
Why is this thing so big?

512
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,840
Oh no, the mushroom is growing inside the meat.

513
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,360
The third master is still hot.

514
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,640
It's all because of the mushroom.

515
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,760
Tianzhen, hang in there.

516
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,080
I'll think of something.

517
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,880
Here, take the rice box.

518
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,800
Rice box, the thermometer.

519
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,320
Tianzhen.

520
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,360
35 degrees.

521
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,440
What?

522
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,800
It's below normal temperature.

523
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,120
If it goes on like this, something will happen.

524
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,840
Brother Xiao, we can't wait any longer.

525
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,360
Didn't you say we should wait for the mushroom to grow?

526
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,120
Is the mushroom big enough now?

527
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
The thermometer.

528
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,560
Here.

529
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,640
Fatso, help me.

530
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,920
Is this a good idea?

531
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Don't scare him.

532
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,720
Brother Xiao won't harm him.

533
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,800
Don't let him bite your tongue.

534
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,200
The wound on his stomach is too big.

535
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,760
I don't think anyone can survive on fire.

536
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,920
Let's just use the knife.

537
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,280
Tianzhen, listen to me.

538
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,200
I'll kill you.

539
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,520
Brother Xiao, this time it's going to be tough.

540
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,360
This...

541
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,640
This is it?

542
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,640
It's been half an hour.

543
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,720
He hasn't woken up yet.

544
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,960
36.5 degrees.

545
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,480
Thank you, brother.

546
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,760
The temperature is finally normal.

547
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,320
Don't be too happy.

548
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,760
I've seen a snail that was infected by a parasite in the wild.

549
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,880
Snails like the environment of the eagle.

550
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,880
But after being infected by a parasite,

551
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,600
they climb under the sun to get sun exposure.

552
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,320
In the end, they will die.

553
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,280
But I've never seen such a type of snake before.

554
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,880
I've never seen such a type of snake before.

555
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,800
It's the first time I've seen such a type of snake.

556
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,000
These mushrooms like low temperatures.

557
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,920
It will disturb the body temperature.

558
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,280
After the third master was born,

559
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,720
his body temperature has been abnormal.

560
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,600
It's still hot.

561
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,880
He wants to go to a colder place.

562
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,800
Fortunately, you and Brother Xiao helped me deal with it.

563
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,240
Otherwise, I would be the only one who would be born here.

564
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,880
You came to help me.

565
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,200
How did you get hit?

566
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,800
It's the time. Take off your bag.

567
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Help me.

568
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,240
What did you catch?

569
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,840
Stop talking nonsense. Hurry up.

570
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,400
Oh my God.

571
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,280
What kind of death is this?

572
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,840
Little Third Master.

573
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,080
Little Third Master.

574
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,680
You're finally awake.

575
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,080
Fatty.

576
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,200
You're awake.

577
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,120
What happened to me?

578
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,640
You just hit someone.

579
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,520
Hit someone?

580
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,680
Who did I hit?

581
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,600
You hit everyone.

582
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,760
You're so clumsy.

583
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,160
You even kicked Pan Zi.

584
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,000
Pan Zi, are you okay?

585
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,600
I'm fine, Little Third Master.

586
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,600
Have a good rest.

587
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,200
You're asking me if I'm okay.

588
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,240
Why don't you ask me?

589
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,760
You should have a good rest.

590
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,160
You were infected by the Jisheng army.

591
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,560
You were unconscious.

592
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,520
Thanks to my brother.

593
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,720
He helped you to cut the knife.

594
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,680
He took out several mushrooms.

595
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,640
Jisheng army?

596
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,080
What are they?

597
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,480
They're the mushrooms that look like snake eggs.

598
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,160
They grew on my stomach.

599
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,800
You're fine now.

600
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,840
But you gave birth to several big mushrooms.

601
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,800
It's too hard.

602
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,000
You're the one who needs to protect your partner.

603
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,520
Don't touch me.

604
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,200
Don't touch my stomach again.

605
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,280
It's so disgusting.

606
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,520
Since you're awake, let's go.

607
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,520
No.

608
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,800
Little Third Master needs to rest.

609
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,400
We've wasted a lot of time.

610
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,040
And the roots of the mushrooms left a scar on Wu Xie's stomach.

611
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,800
It's too damp here.

612
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,680
If you don't want him to get infected,

613
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,840
let's go and find a cleaner place to cover it.

614
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,120
I'm fine.

615
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,360
Let's go.

616
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,200
No.

617
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,720
Don't touch me.

618
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,400
I can do it myself.

619
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,920
You'll definitely affect your team's speed.

620
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,240
Don't be a burden to your team.

621
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,760
What is it?

622
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,360
Well, it's important to find a cleaner place to leave for home.

623
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,480
Fun track in the plane they had taken to China the other day.

624
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,840
So the only place it is,

625
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,360
is Message Evacuation Anti你想 structural sltopia

626
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,520
in front of you.

627
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,240
Afterari isn't a big thing.

628
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,720
We can go insistently.

629
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,120
By God's grace,

630
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,200
this episode would get another chance this time.

631
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:15,880
So?

632
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Of course.

633
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,080
But you're right, it's important.

634
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,520
Which channel later,

635
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,240
I will tell you that.

636
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,800
There's no way out. What should we do?

637
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
Wu Xie's situation now...

638
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
It's a bit difficult to climb over.

639
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
I'm fine.

640
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,400
Look at this stone.

641
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,400
The front is very neat.

642
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
It's obvious that someone has opened the door.

643
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,400
There must be a way behind.

644
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
It's just that we're blocked by the rock.

645
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
It's too dangerous for us to climb over.

646
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
It's simple. Just blow it up.

647
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
If the explosion causes a collapse,

648
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
isn't it more dangerous?

649
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
This kind of mountain is more stable.

650
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,200
Normally, we wouldn't climb over.

651
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
But we still have to be careful.

652
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,200
Come on.

653
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,200
Hey, don't go!

654
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,200
You can't...

655
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,200
It's too hot to buy a hat.

656
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
There's someone walking behind us.

657
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Maybe...

658
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Let's try again.

659
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Over there.

660
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
It's not necessarily the West Bank.

661
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It could be the cemetery.

662
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
It could be the battlefield.

663
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Pan.

664
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I'm going to shoot you!

665
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Stop.

666
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,800
Stop.

667
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,800
Where do I start?

668
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
Come on.

669
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,800
You promised me!

670
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
Don't touch me.

671
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,800
You promised me!

672
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,800
Run!

673
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,800
Wait for them.

674
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,800
Wait for them.

675
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
Stop!

676
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,600
You can go down.

677
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,600
Sorry.

678
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,600
It's too late.

679
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,600
You can go down or you'll get hurt.

680
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,600
If I have a fan...

681
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,600
Stop!

682
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,600
Stop!

683
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,600
Stop!

684
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,600
Stop!

685
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,600
Stop!

686
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,600
Okay, cut.

687
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
Go on.

688
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,600
Okay.

689
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,600
Okay.

690
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,600
Okay.

691
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,600
Start.

692
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,400
Stop.

693
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,400
Stop.

694
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,400
Stop.

695
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,400
Stop.

696
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,400
Stop.

697
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,400
Stop.

698
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,400
Stop.

699
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,400
Stop.

700
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,400
Stop.

701
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,400
Stop.

702
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,400
What's the age?

703
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,400
Wait.

704
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
Stop.

705
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
Stop.

706
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,200
Stop.

707
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
You move first.

708
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
You have to move forward.

709
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Stop.

710
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Stop.

711
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Stop.

712
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Stop.

713
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Stop.

714
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Stop.

715
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Stop.

716
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Okay, let's go.

717
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Stop.

718
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Stop.

719
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Stop.

720
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Stop.

721
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Stop.

722
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Stop.

723
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Stop.

724
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Stop.

725
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Stop.

726
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Stop.

727
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Stop.

728
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Stop.

729
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Stop.

730
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Stop.

731
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Stop.
