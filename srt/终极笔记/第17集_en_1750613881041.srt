1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to try.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The End

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The End

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The End

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The End

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Go back to Hangzhou. I'll tell you in person.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay, see you tomorrow.

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
How is it? You're getting back to work?

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Do you want me to help you?

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's Uncle Wang's phone.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He's even more ruthless than that old fox.

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I told him I'd go back to Hangzhou tomorrow to find him.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But if I go back tomorrow, he'll be already at the building.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So I'm going to set off now and kill him.

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Okay, take care. If Xiao Ge gets better, I'll take her to see you.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
They're all liars.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
They're all liars.

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Boss, I've dialed four different numbers for the number you gave me.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But I can't get through them all.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I said I'd go back to Hangzhou and tell you in person.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I can't see anyone when I go back.

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I can't get through the phone.

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
There's no reliable cat in this shop.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Boss, you're not here these days.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
There's no business in Wushan Jun.

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But I upgraded my computer.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I wiped all the old firewood and cleaned the floor.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll send it in a couple of days. Remember that.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay.

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll be right back.

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You've been reading this notebook for so long.

39
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You must have gotten used to it.

40
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Boss, I told you.

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I planted a box of instant noodles the other day.

42
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It tastes great. Do you want to try it? I'll get it.

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Enough.

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'll pay you after I finish drinking this.

45
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Get out. Don't bother.

46
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm telling you, ancestors.

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Can't you write something about the wine family?

48
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Boss.

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I haven't finished drinking.

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't bother me.

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, boss.

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
A guest is looking for you.

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He wants to get a box of Wu San Xing from Wushan Jun.

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Where did you get that from?

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let him go back.

56
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This guest said his name is Jing Wan Tang.

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Jin Ye?

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Big nephew.

59
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What is it?

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I owe Jin Wan Tang a big vase.

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll pay you back in half a month.

62
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Jin Ye.

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
My third uncle owes you something. Why are you looking for me?

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He said you have it.

65
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I have it? How could it be with me?

66
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Why is your Wu family like this?

67
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Why is it so difficult to get something from you?

68
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Either your third uncle is cheating on you,

69
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
or you're cheating on me.

70
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Anyway, I have to get something that I don't see today.

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Right?

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What big vase?

73
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
A bird's beak powder vase.

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
How much?

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
120,000.

76
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No vase, no money.

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I don't care.

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Your third uncle told me personally

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
that if he doesn't send it to me in half a month,

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll ask you for it.

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I either see something today,

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
or I'll ask you for it.

83
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Or I'll borrow some money.

84
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Boss, we haven't seen anything in a year.

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm here every day.

86
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I haven't seen any vase.

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
No. Wang Meng.

88
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Did you say you got a box of instant noodles?

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yes.

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Move it here.

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Hurry up.

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Instant noodles?

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Where's my instant noodles?

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Qianye, look.

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Is it this?

96
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's this.

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It looks like a fake.

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
How could you two be fooled by this?

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
How could it be a fake?

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's just a light.

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
How is it impossible?

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You said it was a fake.

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
How could you two be fooled by this?

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
How is it impossible?

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I believed it when you said it was burnt last year.

106
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
How could you do this now?

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Look at this pattern.

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Look.

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Tell me.

110
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He came to me in half a month.

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sure he said something else.

112
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll teach you a lesson today.

113
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Your uncle gave me 20,000 yuan.

114
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He asked me to come to you in half a month.

115
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And he also told me

116
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
that if I broke this vase,

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
you would have to ask for money from me.

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I didn't get the money.

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I had to give it to you.

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But now, you broke this vase.

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It has nothing to do with me.

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I earned 20,000 yuan.

123
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Old fox.

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Say it.

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I said my third uncle.

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
By the way,

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
the Taoist priest said something happened to your third uncle.

128
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
He's not dead, is he?

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't know.

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
If this is a long story,

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
then this plate will be loose.

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The one who finds trouble is like a fly.

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You have to be careful.

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I understand. Thank you.

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
See you.

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I hope we can get through this.

137
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Wu Xie.

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If you can see this video,

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
it means

140
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm completely deaf.

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Maybe I'm dead.

142
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You may already know the truth.

143
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You may still have a lot of questions.

144
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But anyway,

145
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I owe you an explanation.

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I owe you less.

147
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's a face mask.

148
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You have to be brave.

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
For thousands of years,

150
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
you may think I'm lying to you.

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes.

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm lying to you.

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Including Wu Sanxing and me.

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We're both liars.

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Wu Xie.

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No matter if I'm Wu Sanxing or Xie Lianhuan,

157
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
you've been my nephew

158
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
for so many years.

159
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm your uncle.

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I've lied to you so many times.

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But I've always wanted to protect you.

162
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I never thought I'd hurt you.

163
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Wu Sanxing and I

164
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
won't do anything to

165
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
the Wu family or Xie family.

166
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Actually,

167
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I can't tell

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
whether I'm Xie Lianhuan

169
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
or Wu Sanxing.

170
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I've been wearing a mask for too long

171
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and I can't take it off.

172
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But actually,

173
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
everything has a reason.

174
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's all because

175
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
there was an accident

176
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
at the bottom of the sea.

177
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Wu Sanxing and I

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
had to change our identities.

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But we were caught in the middle.

180
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
We couldn't get back.

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The West Sand Sea 19 years ago

182
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
was a very important part of my life.

183
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Wu Sanxing and I

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
lost contact with Wenjin

185
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and we never found them.

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Then,

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
we investigated the entire archaeological team.

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
There were several people

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
who couldn't find the background.

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Even we couldn't find it.

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It means that

192
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
there's something behind it.

193
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
No matter where we are now,

194
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I have to do something.

195
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Wu Sanxing and I

196
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
have to investigate this.

197
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Even if we die,

198
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
we have to find the answer.

199
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But Wu Xie,

200
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
for you,

201
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I hope this will end

202
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and you won't investigate it.

203
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Live your life well.

204
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Don't get involved in it.

205
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It has nothing to do with you.

206
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Nothing to do with me?

207
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You always say that.

208
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
In the end, you still have to investigate.

209
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes, I know.

210
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I said it was useless.

211
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You still have to investigate.

212
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But as the last word from the neighbor,

213
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
remember,

214
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
this is a word from your grandfather.

215
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What's more terrifying than the ghost god

216
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
is the human heart.

217
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What's more terrifying than the ghost god

218
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
is the human heart.

219
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Boss.

221
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Boss.

222
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Stop yelling.

223
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'll pay you when I'm done.

224
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
No.

225
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Boss.

226
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
We have a guest.

227
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
We're here.

228
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Why don't you set up a red carpet

229
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
to welcome us?

230
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Why are you two here?

231
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You're so naive.

232
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I miss you so much.

233
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What are you waiting for?

234
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Make some tea and treat the guests.

235
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We finally got out of the hospital.

236
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You've been taking medicine for him.

237
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Why don't you take him out for a walk?

238
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Come on, brother.

239
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Sit here.

240
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
There are so many of them.

241
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Come on.

242
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You can sit here.

243
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Brother.

244
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Wu Xie is usually not like this.

245
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yes.

246
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You came so suddenly.

247
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Why didn't you inform me?

248
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Brother is updating his brain.

249
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You must leave a good impression on him.

250
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Please contact your family when you leave.

251
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You must be grateful.

252
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
My memory is broken now.

253
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The doctor said he needs some mental stimulation

254
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
to get better.

255
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
He's been so stupid every day.

256
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
He doesn't even eat pig's brain.

257
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Brother, do you remember me?

258
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Wu Xie.

259
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Since you're here, where do you want to go?

260
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'll take you out for a walk.

261
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
There's a place I remember.

262
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Okay, you stay here.

263
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'll go get you some brain stimulation.

264
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Okay.

265
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
He's going to recover.

266
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
He can't remember any useful information.

267
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
He wants to get his memory back.

268
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What should we do?

269
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
He has no other family.

270
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
There's only the two of us.

271
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Let him go.

272
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
He can only be a wanderer on the street.

273
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's not impossible to arrange him with me.

274
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But I can't even find a wife

275
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
in my room.

276
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Why are you so heartless?

277
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Why am I heartless?

278
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You're heartless.

279
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You're heartless.

280
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Brother has saved our lives more than once.

281
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Why are you so worried?

282
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I think we should listen to him.

283
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Let's get him a tour.

284
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Give him some money.

285
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Let him go out for a walk.

286
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
He'll get lost.

287
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's no different if we throw him away.

288
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I think

289
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
we should get him married.

290
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Find a rich woman.

291
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
We'll take care of him.

292
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You're so stubborn.

293
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
He only wants to get his memory back.

294
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But the more he does, the more I feel bad for him.

295
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm afraid he'll go back to the old path.

296
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
He keeps losing his memory.

297
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
He keeps losing his memory.

298
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm a person who has no past or future.

299
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
If I disappear in this world,

300
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
no one will notice me.

301
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Didn't you work with Brother before?

302
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Ask Tong.

303
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You think I didn't think about it?

304
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Those people were all gathered together.

305
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
They all disappeared when they came out.

306
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Where did you find them?

307
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I remember someone.

308
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
When we went to the Cloud Sky Palace together,

309
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
he colluded with someone and tricked my third uncle.

310
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Then my third uncle took care of him.

311
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Now he's probably still in the prison.

312
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I hope he's been remodeled.

313
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
He can give us some useful information.

314
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Little Third Master, Fat Master.

316
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I've been remodeled.

317
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I've been in prison for a year.

318
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I've been awarded twice.

319
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So now I'm released.

320
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm not the same Chu Guang Tou

321
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,960
who was

322
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
the one who helped me.

323
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Brother, you've counted four times.

324
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm sorry.

325
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Don't worry.

326
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You'll definitely pay the 100,000 yuan.

327
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's just a question of the mute Zhang.

328
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I can tell you now

329
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
something that no one else knows.

330
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Back then, Third Master was looking for someone

331
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
who was very skilled.

332
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
At that time, I went to check

333
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
the mute Zhang's background.

334
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Do you know

335
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
who the mute Zhang was before Third Master?

336
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Who?

337
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
The man of the Fourth Grandpa.

338
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Little Third Master was a member of the Fourth Grandpa?

339
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Yes.

340
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Why did he follow the Fourth Grandpa?

341
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Have you heard of the mute Zhang?

342
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
We've heard of him before.

343
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm afraid that he's not the one.

344
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I think it's not the one.

345
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
We've heard of him before.

346
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
We've heard of him before.

347
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm afraid that he's not the one.

348
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
We've heard of him before.

349
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
This time, he asked us to come.

350
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
We came here to see the dead.

351
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Come.

352
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
This is it.

353
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
What's that smell?

354
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Let's go down and take a look.

355
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Wait.

356
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Let me check first.

357
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Hurry up.

358
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Hurry up.

359
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Hurry up.

360
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Let's go.

361
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Someone?

362
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
This is not human-like.

363
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Two layers.

364
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
All buried.

365
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
All buried?

366
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's too shallow.

367
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's only a meter deep.

368
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
There's water in it.

369
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I think the coffin is in the water.

370
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's so smelly.

371
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You, you, you, go inside and take a look.

372
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Hurry up.

373
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Hurry up.

374
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Help!

375
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Help!

376
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Hurry up.

377
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Help!

378
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Don't move.

379
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Wait, there's someone else.

380
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Help!

381
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
This place is too scary.

382
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
We can't come.

383
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Grandpa Si.

384
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
He's not a person who's afraid.

385
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
He's just trying to scare the Tao family back.

386
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
He's trying to swallow it.

387
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
After a week,

388
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
he's taking someone back.

389
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Qi Lue, move the stone.

390
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Grandpa Si, this is really scary.

391
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You can say we go down.

392
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
But if you go down, what if...

393
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Move.

394
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yes.

395
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Come on.

396
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Hurry up.

397
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
There's something in here.

398
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You?

399
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
How is that possible?

400
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You're married.

401
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You're not dead yet.

402
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What are you drinking?

403
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You go in.

404
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You'll die.

405
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Where did you find the Tao family?

406
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
In a village in Guangxi.

407
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
When I saw him,

408
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I thought he was a fool.

409
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So I tied him up and put him in a bait.

410
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
He's still in such a bad situation.

411
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
We're raising him to be a good person.

412
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
He has a good temper.

413
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
It's not easy.

414
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
All these years,

415
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
he's been doing this alone.

416
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
It's fake.

417
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It's fake.

418
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It's fake.

419
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It's fake.

420
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It's fake.

421
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Later, Grandpa Si

422
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
brought the bait back.

423
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
He took it as a friend.

424
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
After a few years,

425
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Grandpa Si borrowed the bait from Grandpa Si.

426
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
He cares about this person very much.

427
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
He asked me to take a picture and ask around.

428
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It took me two months

429
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
to run through many villages in Guangxi.

430
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I found it in the village

431
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
called Ba Nai.

432
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I found some clues in the village.

433
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Ba Nai?

434
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Yes, it's Ba Nai.

435
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
There's a tall building there.

436
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
A mute lived there.

437
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
There's only one bed and one table.

438
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
There are many photos under the glass.

439
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Wait.

440
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
This one was taken from there.

441
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Why is his shoulder so big?

442
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Do you think this place is familiar?

443
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Grandpa Si, turn around.

444
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Turn around.

445
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
The Gormulia Hospital.

446
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Judging from the setting,

447
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
this Gormulia Hospital

448
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
is a bit earlier than the one in Lu Xiang.

449
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Are there any other photos?

450
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Grandpa Si, don't joke around.

451
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I was just checking.

452
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I can't leave too many traces.

453
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
How is it?

454
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Is the money worth it?

455
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
If you're interested,

456
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
you can go back and see.

457
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Maybe you can find the rest.

458
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Right.

459
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Here it is.

460
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
This is Ba Nai's address.

461
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
If you really want to go there,

462
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
you'll be punished.

463
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
The plane changes the train,

464
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
the train goes to the dam,

465
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
and the last train goes to the dam.

466
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It's okay.

467
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It's not the first time.

468
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Look at this.

469
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
This is real.

470
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
This is our treasure.

471
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Touch it.

472
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Is it?

473
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I think it's...

474
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Hello, boss.

475
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
This guy wants to help me...

476
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Go to Guangxi.

477
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You're going to Guangxi?

478
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
The earlier, the better.

479
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
No, I...

480
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'll send it to you when I get back.

481
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Hurry up.

482
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Okay.

483
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Xia Er Dan.

484
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Okay.

485
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's not far ahead.

486
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Be careful.

487
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Boss, this is my house.

488
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
How is it?

489
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Is it big enough?

490
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Even if you come to 30,

491
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
you can still live here.

492
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
This place is good for retirement.

493
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
The house is new.

494
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's good for investment.

495
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Boss Pang, you're right.

496
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
We have so many women here.

497
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
We have a few tourists here.

498
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
So we decided to

499
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
invest in tourism.

500
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
We're waiting for a good boss like you.

501
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I'll see how it goes.

502
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Please.

503
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Come on, Boss Pang.

504
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Uncle A Gui, look.

505
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
This is on top of our village.

506
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's been abandoned for a long time.

507
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'll take you there tomorrow.

508
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It's dark at night.

509
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
You can't see clearly.

510
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
We just walk around

511
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and visit the village.

512
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Come on, buddy.

513
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Let's have another drink.

514
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Okay, another one.

515
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Cheers.

516
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Oh, roasted chicken with herbs.

517
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Come on, try it.

518
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
My daughter is talented.

519
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
The mountains are beautiful,

520
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
the water is beautiful,

521
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
and the people are more beautiful.

522
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Boss Pang,

523
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
in our village,

524
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
we have a lot of tourists.

525
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
They're all from the countryside.

526
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
In our village,

527
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
we have the first tourist

528
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
with foreigners.

529
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And I've always thought that

530
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
our village

531
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
is very suitable for tourism.

532
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Buddy, no, uncle.

533
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Let me tell you.

534
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
These years,

535
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I've been wandering in the city

536
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
in the red city.

537
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I've been living in the city for so many years.

538
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I have nothing left.

539
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I only have money left.

540
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Really.

541
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
But the vast world

542
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
has its own ways.

543
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Slow down, slow down.

544
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Sit down, sit down.

545
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Look, we can

546
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
get closer.

547
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Okay, okay.

548
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Boss Pang.

549
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Boss Pang,

550
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Chen Wenjing.

551
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You started the business in our village.

552
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
In 1976,

553
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Chen Wenjing came to Bana.

554
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I always thought

555
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Xisha was the starting point of Chen Wenjing.

556
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Now I see,

557
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Bana is their starting point.

558
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Uncle A Gui, this photo is...

559
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Oh, this photo

560
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
is the glorious history of our family.

561
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Look, this is my father.

562
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
This woman is from the investigation team.

563
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
This little girl is me.

564
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Investigation team?

565
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Have you been to the investigation team?

566
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'm not very clear.

567
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
They said they found something on the mountain.

568
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
After several years,

569
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
there was no more news.

570
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
There's a story.

571
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Come on,

572
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
tell us.

573
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I'll tell you the truth.

574
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Really?

575
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Yuncai, count for me.

576
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
At that time,

577
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I was...

578
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Brother,

579
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
tell us the truth.

580
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Okay.

581
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Our village

582
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
is poor.

583
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And very, very,

584
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
very...

585
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
You can't repeat it.

586
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
No.

587
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Our village

588
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
can have an investigation team.

589
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
How big is this?

590
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Uncle A Gui,

591
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
how many people

592
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
are there in this team?

593
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
More than ten.

594
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
This woman is right.

595
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
She said

596
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
there were some

597
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
archaeologists from the city.

598
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
They want to do

599
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
an archaeological investigation in our village.

600
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
My father is a contact.

601
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I arranged this accommodation

602
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
and the island for them.

603
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
How long did they stay here?

604
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Six or seven months.

605
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
They usually

606
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
go out of the mountain.

607
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It's nothing.

608
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's weird.

609
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
The woman is the one who is weird.

610
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
She told the islander

611
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
that every three days,

612
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
she went to the mountain.

613
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
She said

614
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
she went to the mountain

615
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
and she was watching

616
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
whether she could go or not.

617
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
She was forcing her.

618
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
The islander

619
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
went to the mountain

620
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
every three days.

621
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
She didn't find anything.

622
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
One time,

623
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
she was cleaning

624
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
the house for her relatives.

625
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
She thought

626
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
she would be fine one day.

627
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
But on that day,

628
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
she just arrived at the camp.

629
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
She found that

630
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
there was no one.

631
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
She was like a human.

632
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
She was scared.

633
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
She thought

634
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
she was in trouble.

635
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
She didn't dare to say anything.

636
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
She went to the mountain

637
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
alone.

638
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
She searched the mountain

639
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
and found nothing.

640
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
But the next day,

641
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
she went to the camp again.

642
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
She found that

643
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
there were people.

644
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It was so noisy

645
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
that nothing happened.

646
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
She was so scared.

647
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
The islander

648
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
thought she was in trouble.

649
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
She didn't dare to say anything.

650
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
After the investigation team left,

651
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
they told the villagers

652
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
about this.

653
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I'll drink some wine.

654
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I'll drink some wine.

655
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
When the investigation team left,

656
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
they took a dozen boxes of stuff.

657
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
It's said that they found them around here.

658
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
This picture

659
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
was taken when they left.

660
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
My brother

661
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
did a good job

662
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
in the modern work.

663
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Then he became a village official.

664
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Yuncai.

665
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
How many words?

666
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I...

667
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Yuncai.

668
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
You're drunk.

669
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I'm kidding.

670
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm fat.

671
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I'm so strong.

672
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
This little wine...

673
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Hey.

674
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Did you see it?

675
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Where?

676
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
There.

677
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
You're really drunk.

678
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
No.

679
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I saw it. It's there.

680
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Boss Pan.

681
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Are you drunk?

682
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm drunk.

683
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm drunk.

684
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You're drunk.

685
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
What's the use of these pictures?

686
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I don't know what's inside.

687
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
No content.

688
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So there's only snowflakes.

689
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So many tape.

690
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I've seen it

691
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
a dozen times.

692
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I'm so blind.

693
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
There's only snowflakes.

694
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
But

695
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
there's only

696
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
half of the content.

697
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
What content?

698
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
A woman

699
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
crawling on the ground.

700
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Wow.

701
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Brother.

702
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Your house is luxurious.

703
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Brother.

704
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Do you remember this tomb?

705
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Let's go.

706
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Let's go inside.

707
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Go.

708
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Go.

709
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I'm sorry.

710
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm sorry.

711
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Come on.

712
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
But actually

713
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
everything

714
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
has a reason

715
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
to be here.

716
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Behind the scenes.

717
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Come on.

718
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
There's a guest.

719
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Mr. Fatty is here.

720
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
He's not going to the red carpet.

721
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Why are you two here?

722
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Come on.

723
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
So naive.

724
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I miss you so much.

725
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I'm not a good guy.

726
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I'm not a good guy.

727
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I'm not a good guy.

728
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I'm not a good guy.

729
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I'm not a good guy.

730
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Why are you so worried?

731
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
All

732
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
are

733
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
here.

734
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
All

735
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
are here.

736
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
OK.

737
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Ready.

738
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Come on.

739
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
What's going on here?

740
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Maybe they're here for the first time.

741
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Come on.

742
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Come on.

743
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
One more.

744
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
This way.

745
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
This way.

746
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
This way.

747
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
OK.

748
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Come on.

749
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Got it?

750
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Come on.

751
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Come on.

752
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Come on.

753
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
OK.

754
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
This photo.

755
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
The wrong position, right?

756
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
One more.

757
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
One more.

758
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I said you gave me...

759
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000

I said you gave me these photos.
