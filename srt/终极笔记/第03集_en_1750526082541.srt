1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of anything

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of anything

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of anything

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of anything

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of anything

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of anything

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of anything

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of anything

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of anything

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of anything

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of anything

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of anything

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of anything

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of anything

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The King of Blaze

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 1

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Xiao Ke

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm tired

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Where's Xiao Hua?

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Behind you

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
There's no one behind you

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Xia Min

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Xiao Hua

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Xiao Ke, let me down first

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I can

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Xiao Hua

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm having a fever

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
35 degrees, north west

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's go back

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,780
with him.

31
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,540
Hurry

32
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,880
The

33
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,800
Police, through and through

34
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,320
They go here

35
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,160
again

36
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,780
Let's

37
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,200
go

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,840
Hey, I heard that

39
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,840
anyone who lives around the desert

40
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,480
knows the rule of Sandstorm

41
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,320
Did you deliberately

42
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,360
lure us here?

43
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,080
What do you mean?

44
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,920
Are you saying that my grandma lied to you?

45
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,200
I won't tell you whether she lied or not

46
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,320
I just want to ask

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,000
The route to Tamutuo

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,200
was made by your grandma

49
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,680
Why didn't she go around

50
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,800
and go to the desert?

51
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,240
This is the way

52
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,960
to the next stop

53
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,040
If it weren't for the Sandstorm

54
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,560
we would have arrived long ago

55
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,680
Besides, this used to be a river

56
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,880
not a desert

57
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,680
The desert is still far away

58
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,720
These places are swallowing each other

59
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,840
The landmines are changing day by day

60
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,560
How can we control the old heaven?

61
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,120
I've never been to a river

62
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,480
But I've never been to such an un惊讶的河道

63
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,400
I can't get out of the county

64
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,680
How long have you been to the river?

65
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,480
We've been to the river

66
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,080
for less than half a year

67
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,720
Half a year?

68
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,520
What are we going to do in the future?

69
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,360
We'll die

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,920
What are you doing?

71
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,800
You're so annoying

72
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,720
You're so mean

73
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,520
Enough

74
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,720
Don't make a fuss

75
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,360
This is indeed a river

76
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
We're going

77
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,160
to the river

78
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,880
If the river hasn't been changed

79
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,240
there must be a ancient city around here

80
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,800
We'll know it tomorrow

81
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,960
Mr. Wei

82
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,120
Apologize to him

83
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,200
Right, you're not helping the old man

84
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,080
That's right

85
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,680
There's a devil city

86
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,880
more than 20 kilometers away

87
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,360
Devil city?

88
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,400
What is it?

89
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,880
A large mountain

90
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,680
It's said that it used to be a stone castle

91
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,480
What does it have to do with the devil?

92
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,480
It's said that a long time ago

93
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,640
there was a city

94
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,520
People were old and brave

95
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,680
living a life of the Fengyi clan

96
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,800
But

97
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,880
gradually, people there changed

98
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,280
They became addicted to fun

99
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,520
and wine

100
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,600
and fighting

101
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,880
In order to exchange people's food

102
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,640
God of Heaven turned into a beggar and came to the city

103
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,160
to save them

104
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
But

105
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,040
Not only did the beggar not be treated well

106
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,240
but also humiliated him

107
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,760
God burned down the city on the way

108
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,040
Everyone was crushed under the ruins

109
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,600
So

110
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,280
every night

111
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,320
there would be a rumor in the city

112
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,160
Will this rumor really come out?

113
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,960
Yes

114
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,720
It's said that it was a tragic story

115
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,320
that they were burned by the fire

116
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
You're so evil

117
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,720
Why do you take us there?

118
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,760
You'll know the way to the devil city

119
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,000
We're just staying in the city

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,640
and not going in

121
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
You're still yelling

122
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,640
It's almost night time

123
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,520
You're in charge of preparing for tomorrow's departure

124
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,000
Call me if you need anything

125
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,040
Okay, where are you going?

126
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,080
The power supply is not enough

127
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,400
I'll go up and find a car

128
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,160
and try to contact Lao Gao and the others

129
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,520
by car

130
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,840
I'll go with you

131
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,880
Religion

132
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,280
You're not like the Ning that I remember

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,960
How is that?

134
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,960
I didn't think you would you look for a buddy

135
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,920
The old you

136
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
I'm not good at using the machine

137
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
You haven't met the machine yet

138
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Yes

139
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,920
That's why I shouldn't have come out with you

140
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Since you're here

141
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Then let's get to work

142
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
I'm Wu Xie

143
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Can anyone hear me?

144
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,920
Can anyone hear me?

145
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,920
Master Hua

146
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Master Hua

147
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,920
You've been closing your eyes for a long time

148
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Are you dead?

149
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,920
It's good that you're dead

150
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,920
Later

151
00:07:42,920 --> 00:08:05,940
I'll drag you out to kill the

152
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,920
Do you think you can really find them?

153
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
I have to try

154
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
Don't you want to find someone?

155
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
I'm different from you

156
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
No matter if you can find it or not, the posture is here

157
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
Everyone won't panic

158
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
You're really that Ning

159
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Let's go

160
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,920
Drink water

161
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
It's so dark

162
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,920
You're wearing a sunglasses

163
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
You can still see

164
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,920
The darker it is, the clearer I see

165
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,920
Thanks

166
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,920
Do you want to eat fried rice with green pepper?

167
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,920
I don't like green pepper, thank you

168
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Pressed cookies

169
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
It's too dry

170
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,920
I tell you, such a pressed cookie can be eaten in the desert

171
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,920
It's too luxurious

172
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
According to what you said

173
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,920
This piece of cookies should be very expensive

174
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,920
500

175
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,920
You're so smart

176
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,920
But even if I give you this card

177
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,920
You can't get it

178
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Because there is no signal

179
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,920
Then you owe me

180
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,920
I don't like to owe others

181
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,920
I'm sorry

182
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,920
I'm sorry

183
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,920
I've opened everything I could find

184
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Attention, team

185
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
Pack up the luggage

186
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Five minutes later, we'll go to Devil City

187
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
This is not so empty

188
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,560
They didn't just hijack the joint

189
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
The red Taoist calm the Col saved

190
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
You two are a variety

191
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,560
I think these will blow up

192
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,920
Oh no

193
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,920
Oh my kid

194
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,780
This is Wells Fargo

195
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,780
The strategic part

196
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,660
I think we haven't worked in a long time

197
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,660
So today on the question

198
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,660
One of the meat hearts

199
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,580
Don't be a scoundrel

200
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,540
Mr. Hua

201
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,180
You're out of the hospital

202
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,060
Do you want a big tent

203
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,500
How much

204
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:25,900
Two hundred

205
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,340
Fifty

206
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,740
One hundred

207
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,100
Brother

208
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,060
Is this okay

209
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,740
不要动

210
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,460
Still staying still

211
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,020
Somebody's here

212
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:24,720
There's a man

213
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,460
Hurry

214
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,680
Do you think very well?

215
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,420
I went for a cruise

216
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,180
for 15 years in the past 12 years

217
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,520
I've already

218
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,700
200 million largor

219
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:49,880
conflict

220
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,980
I feel that

221
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,420
if i die

222
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,820
i'll never make it

223
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,060
Then

224
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,220
how about

225
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,940
telling Shen Yi

226
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,580
OK

227
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,260
Screw you

228
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,500
I'm in for a lesson

229
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,380
Teraz

230
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,060
Li

231
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,420
I will hear this

232
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:21,860
OK

233
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,400
You can ask me

234
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,260
I'm at your service

235
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:25,940
OK

236
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,220
OK

237
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,380
Wait a minute

238
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,500
I want to talk to you

239
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,100
OK

240
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,740
Black Eye, Wu Laosi, search around.

241
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,240
If you need anything, contact me by phone.

242
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,540
Zha Xi, Lao Jia, Ah Hu, Dao Zai,

243
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,740
follow me. Go to Mo Ge City to find someone.

244
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,540
I'm not going into Mo Ge City.

245
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,540
Listen, listen.

246
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,740
Don't be afraid.

247
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,740
This is the typical feature of Yadan's landform.

248
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,740
Because of the wind,

249
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,740
the landform has formed these strange rock mountains.

250
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,540
The rock mountains are not even, and the wind blows,

251
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,940
so that it makes this sound.

252
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,540
Just like us blowing trees.

253
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,740
Qinghai and Xinjia also have a lot of Yadan landforms.

254
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,940
This is normal.

255
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,140
No, no, no. I'm not going.

256
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,140
No one can walk out of Mo Ge City.

257
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,340
Enough. Let's take action.

258
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,740
Wu Laosi, I'm leaving this to you.

259
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,540
Okay, don't worry, boss.

260
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,940
You come with me.

261
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,740
Why?

262
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,140
Because Xiao Ge can ignore anyone,

263
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,940
but she won't ignore you.

264
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,940
Let's search outside.

265
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,340
We won't go in.

266
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,340
Stop.

267
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,540
Don't force me anymore.

268
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,140
I can't go in here.

269
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,940
I'll die.

270
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,740
You have to believe in natural science.

271
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,140
What? Do you know what?

272
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,340
In 1997,

273
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,740
an underground investigation team came to Mo Ge City.

274
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,340
Everyone was missing.

275
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,140
Two years,

276
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,940
for two years, we found two bodies that were separated.

277
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,340
We still haven't found the others.

278
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,740
You can't be afraid of death if you want to explore.

279
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,540
Not to mention we have GPS to point to Beizhen.

280
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,340
There's nothing to worry about.

281
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,540
If we find them earlier, we can respond earlier.

282
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,940
You're so filial.

283
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,740
You shouldn't want your grandma to worry.

284
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,140
I have a request.

285
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,340
Say it.

286
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,940
I'll put a pile of stones in every crossroad.

287
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,140
If we see the pile of stones while we walk,

288
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,740
it means we're in the same place.

289
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,740
We have to go back.

290
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,340
No problem.

291
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,540
Will the pile of stones have any special meaning?

292
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,140
Don't worry.

293
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,340
I have the life of this guy.

294
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,340
Qi Dan!

295
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,940
Gao!

296
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,540
Gao!

297
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,540
Qi Dan!

298
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,340
Dawang!

299
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,540
Gao!

300
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,740
Qi Dan!

301
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,940
Stop yelling!

302
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,940
Why are you yelling?

303
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,940
The more you yell, the more chaotic it gets.

304
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,740
Gao!

305
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,740
Please reply.

306
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,140
I can't see the end of the path even if there are more than 20 piles.

307
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,340
How big is it?

308
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,740
There's a sound.

309
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,540
It should be nearby.

310
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,740
Gao has to press the walkie talkie so that we can receive it.

311
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,140
They must still be alive.

312
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,940
Get the walkie talkie out!

313
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,740
Find the signal.

314
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,740
Where did you get it?

315
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,340
I beg you

316
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,780
This business is not a man's business

317
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,820
We've been here for so long

318
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,140
Take us back

319
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,540
The captain can receive the business

320
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,980
It means they are nearby

321
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,220
Keep looking

322
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,660
It's been a long time

323
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,380
Maybe people are in front

324
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,580
Let's go ahead

325
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,460
Let's go

326
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,500
Hurry up

327
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,460
Hurry up

328
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,660
It's getting dark

329
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,260
I'll go with you

330
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,300
Hello, brother

331
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,020
Do you hear me?

332
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,220
There's a signal in the Devil City

333
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,340
We're going to find someone

334
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,220
Zhang Qi is here, don't worry

335
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,420
Did you hear me?

336
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,500
I heard you

337
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,060
This dumb guy can't talk

338
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,900
You know that

339
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,380
They haven't come back yet

340
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,660
Yeah

341
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,100
They've confirmed the signal

342
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,900
They're looking for someone

343
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,740
The Devil City is so big

344
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,740
They don't bring in any supplies

345
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,900
That's not the point

346
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,780
They just need to send a signal

347
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,300
We might go to that room

348
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,140
Who are you eating?

349
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,300
Give me one

350
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,540
Don't

351
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,060
You don't eat green pepper

352
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,020
Well

353
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,740
Liu Xiaoye

354
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:33,760
Sc Tournament

355
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,300
Off the stage in 25 seconds ,

356
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,500
a half still safe

357
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:49,540
and Enter gallery 6

358
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,540
It's a demon.

359
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,540
Master, look.

360
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,540
What?

361
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,540
Zha Xi, it's just an ancient ship.

362
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,540
No, the demon is in the ship.

363
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,540
The ship is real.

364
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,540
We can't go any further.

365
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,540
If we go any further, we can't go back.

366
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,540
What are you afraid of?

367
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,540
It's just a ship.

368
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,540
An Ning.

369
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,540
The demon is in the ship.

370
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,540
The demon has been in the ship for 3,000 years.

371
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,540
It's been in the dark for a while.

372
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,540
An Ning.

373
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,540
She seems to be really scared.

374
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,540
Jia, what did she say?

375
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,540
The demon.

376
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,540
Wait for us here.

377
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,540
If you dare to go,

378
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,540
don't think of going out alive.

379
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,540
Let's go up and see.

380
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,540
They are likely on the ship.

381
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,540
The Demon is in the ship.

382
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,540
Have you confirmed the location with Jia?

383
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,540
Why did you send the signal three times?

384
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,540
The plan has changed.

385
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,540
We won't follow An Ning's team.

386
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,540
Master will change the route tomorrow morning.

387
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,540
We'll leave a mark along the way.

388
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,540
Let's get Xiao Ge and Master San first.

389
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,540
Then we'll meet with Master San.

390
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,540
Who?

391
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,540
Tian Zhen?

392
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,540
What's wrong?

393
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,540
If Tian Zhen knows that I took Master San's job behind his back,

394
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,540
he will have to cut my back.

395
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,540
I know you love money.

396
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,540
It's not embarrassing.

397
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,540
Am I for money?

398
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,540
Master San took the permission from the relevant departments

399
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,540
to bring me to investigate.

400
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,540
I have to agree.

401
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,540
Xiao Ge,

402
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,540
you wait downstairs.

403
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,540
Watch Zha Xi.

404
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,540
We'll go first.

405
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,540
Okay.

406
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,540
Be careful.

407
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,540
This ship is badly damaged.

408
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,540
There's also a hole here.

409
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,540
Everyone, be careful!

410
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,340
I think there's something under the lamp.

411
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,460
It seems that this floor should be a fake one.

412
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,140
I'll go down and have a look.

413
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,740
The Third Master's

414
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,540
It seems that it was arranged by the Third Master.

415
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:58,940
You too.

416
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,940
A powerful man like me

417
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,340
is a gunman.

418
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,140
The Third Master found me at the front.

419
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,620
An Ning also found me at the back.

420
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,060
The Third Master

421
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,620
asked me to join An Ning's team.

422
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,980
I also took some money.

423
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,380
Anyway, it's not conflict.

424
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,420
The one who sent the signal bomb just now

425
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,940
is a panther

426
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,020
or a fat man?

427
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,380
In front.

428
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,340
The Third Master

429
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,580
The sound may not be transmitted from below.

430
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,740
There is another floor below.

431
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,780
Go down and have a look.

432
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,780
The Third Master

433
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,380
I said it's my man.

434
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,900
Come on, eat it.

435
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,900
Give it to him.

436
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,020
He doesn't eat green pepper.

437
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,780
Wu San Xing is indeed an old fox.

438
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,620
It seems that Wu San Xing

439
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,820
has a lot of people.

440
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,500
I'm not his man.

441
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,540
This old fox also came here.

442
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,380
He told me that he knew nothing.

443
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,860
It seems that

444
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,980
we need to ask him again.

445
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,660
We do need to ask him.

446
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,620
Do you know how to contact him?

447
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,460
I know everything.

448
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,580
You tell me where he is.

449
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,100
You ask me.

450
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,700
You are right.

451
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,660
I have a unique way of contacting the Third Master.

452
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,300
Wait.

453
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,780
The Third Master

454
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,780
Prepare the needle.

455
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,020
Wait for the direction later.

456
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,460
It's all sand.

457
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,220
Where did the sound come from?

458
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,500
The sand is accumulated and easy to collapse.

459
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,780
Be careful.

460
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,460
OK.

461
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,820
What's that?

462
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,100
It's Lao Gao.

463
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,620
He's still alive.

464
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,420
Come on, save him.

465
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,420
Come on.

466
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,220
There's someone over there.

467
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,900
It should be the big dragon and the big leather.

468
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:58,860
I'll go and see.

469
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,860
Save him with the silver flag.

470
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,500
Come on.

471
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,460
It seems that

472
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,260
he was killed by the sand.

473
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,660
Why is there a sound in the speaker?

474
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,460
The nail is on the speaker.

475
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,180
It will cause friction.

476
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,700
Let's leave it alone.

477
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,820
Let's dig them out.

478
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,300
Look there.

479
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:34,980
Let's go.

480
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,900
Now?

481
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,420
We have to work overtime at night.

482
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,620
In your eyes,

483
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,540
is there a difference between day and night?

484
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,540
Let's scan the card.

485
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,340
草ningen

486
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,540
Pan位

487
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,100
Separate them down.

488
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,500
騎ARS

489
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,540
Come and help me.

490
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,080
Brother.

491
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,420
Let's just smash this box.

492
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,420
No.

493
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,700
If you smash it, the power will fall on Erhuo.

494
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,900
His internal organs can't stand it.

495
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,600
Let's take off the lid first.

496
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,940
We'll do it after we cut the weight.

497
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,460
Wait.

498
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,180
This is not an ordinary box.

499
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,460
This is a coffin.

500
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,540
It doesn't look like a ship at all.

501
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,540
It's a tomb.

502
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,020
The patterns on the box are all connected.

503
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,540
Does it have no lid?

504
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,540
It's because the patterns are connected.

505
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,540
That's why you think it doesn't have a lid.

506
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,540
That means the designer hid the lid.

507
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,540
Have you heard of the Jiaojiang wood of the Han Dynasty?

508
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,540
First, put the body in.

509
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,540
Then seal it.

510
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,540
Then carve patterns on it.

511
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,540
But this coffin doesn't use any gas.

512
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,540
It's something like the Sanhe soil.

513
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,540
It seems that its age is going to be far ahead of the Han Dynasty.

514
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,540
Since it's a coffin,

515
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,540
it must be able to open.

516
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,540
I have an idea.

517
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,540
Here, pour water.

518
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,540
I found the lid.

519
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,540
It's a coffin.

520
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,540
Then seal it.

521
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,540
Then carve patterns on it.

522
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,540
That's it.

523
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,540
Now seal it.

524
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,540
Put the body in.

525
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,540
Then carve patterns on it.

526
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,540
Then seal it.

527
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,540
That's it.

528
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,540
That's it.

529
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,540
Put the body in.

530
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,540
Then seal it.

531
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,540
Put some steam on it.

532
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,540
I really want to know. Is it a waste of money?

533
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,540
First, I don't want to hear it.

534
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,540
Second, are you stupid?

535
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,540
You forgot that there is no signal here.

536
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,540
The world is so bitter.

537
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,540
You have to let me earn some money.

538
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,540
We haven't walked for so long.

539
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,540
Did you take the wrong way?

540
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,540
Absolutely not.

541
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,540
If you don't believe me,

542
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,540
I'll send him a signal.

543
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,540
Okay, wait.

544
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,540
It's not right.

545
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,540
Let's go.

546
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,540
Who is it?

547
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,540
Who is it?

548
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:17,540
The darkening of the eye is the normal phenomenon after the switch is turned on.

549
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,540
You and I lift the coffin.

550
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,540
An Ning, you drag him out.

551
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,540
Hold on, it will be done soon.

552
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,540
How is it?

553
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,540
Where is it?

554
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,540
The coffin?

555
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,540
I saw it.

556
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,540
I saw it.

557
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,540
I saw it.

558
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,540
You are really stupid.

559
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,540
You forgot that there is no signal here.

560
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,540
This is the normal phenomenon after the switch is turned on.

561
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,540
You take the wrong way.

562
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,540
I've said it before.

563
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,540
This is the normal phenomenon after the switch is turned on.

564
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,540
You took the wrong way.

565
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,540
Are you stupid?

566
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,340
It is said that he is not only the messenger of Queen Mother Xi,

567
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,220
but also the three-leafed bird, just like the dragon in our country.

568
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,660
Only the royal family can use it.

569
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,780
It seems that the identity of this tomb owner is definitely different.

570
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,100
Do you feel that it is not right?

571
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,780
Why is the size of this dress so big?

572
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,380
Judging from the size of the bones, it is a child.

573
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,220
How can this child wear an adult's clothes to be buried?

574
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,180
There is something wrong with this body.

575
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,220
What are you looking at?

576
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,940
This mind green exudes a strong sense of touch.

577
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,060
I沒關係.

578
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,460
May the skill may come bye.

579
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,860
I've been away for a while.

580
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,780
The camp is so neat.

581
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,340
I don't think there's any danger.

582
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,220
They probably changed the route temporarily.

583
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,740
Wu San Xing is such a old fox.

584
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,500
He's really a good man.

585
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,860
If San Ye wants to leave,

586
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,220
he'll leave a mark.

587
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,780
It seems that you don't know

588
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,860
Wu San Xing's mark.

589
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,540
Master Hua.

590
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,820
This fire is interesting.

591
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,580
Come on.

592
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,900
Let me use your shoulder.

593
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,060
Do you want to hit me?

594
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,580
Okay.

595
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,380
Young man.

596
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,140
Can you be gentle to us?

597
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,340
Don't move. Stand still.

598
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,620
So beautiful.

599
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,460
What did you see?

600
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,460
Let's go.

601
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,660
No.

602
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,820
Go north?

603
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,180
Did he write a north

604
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,460
or a arrow?

605
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,580
Well.

606
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,820
Or did he write in English?

607
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,260
Five hundred.

608
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,620
You're kind to me like me.

609
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,700
How could you be so cruel to me?

610
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,660
Five hundred.

611
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,300
Five.

612
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,420
Five yuan.

613
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,660
You can't take more?

614
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,220
I said five hundred.

615
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,300
Okay. Five hundred.

616
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:25,980
Tell me.

617
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,700
Kun.

618
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,180
Kun is north.

619
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,500
It's a loss.

620
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,860
He hit the horse back.

621
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,060
And he lost five hundred yuan.

622
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,140
Did she just read it?

623
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,980
It should be here.

624
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,380
What do you think?

625
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,420
Choose one.

626
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,740
I like this one.

627
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,020
It can tool and set up.

628
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,300
It's practical

629
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,940
But I prefer that one

630
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,140
Malida, Lafeng

631
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,460
It's my style

632
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,140
OK

633
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,020
Come on

634
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,580
Cui Dingke

635
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,820
Who's afraid of who?

636
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,780
Cui Dingke

637
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,100
Fatty, I'm so lucky

638
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,660
Get in the car

639
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,380
I'll go straight to A'Ning Camp

640
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,980
and have a horse ride

641
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,660
OK

642
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,140
Mr. Zhang

643
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,020
What are you doing?

644
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,420
A'Ning boss told me

645
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,820
you can't go

646
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,300
Mr. Zhang

647
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,620
Mr. Zhang

648
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,820
Mr. Zhang

649
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,580
I'm a scholar

650
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,220
I want to talk to you

651
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,140
You want to play this with me?

652
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,820
I'll offend you

653
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,540
Brother, long time no see

654
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,180
Isn't this our car?

655
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,660
I told you three

656
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,940
to treat me as air

657
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:35,900
Pan wine

658
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,020
Give my brother a packing bag

659
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,140
Bro, kill them

660
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,340
Brother, Sanye has found the way.

661
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,140
Let my Panzi come and get you.

662
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,940
Stop!

663
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,340
Brother, where's Tianzhen?

664
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,740
I don't know.

665
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,540
Why did she go there?

666
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,140
I don't know.

667
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,740
The climbing button is nice.

668
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,340
The flashlight is nice too.

669
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,340
Panzi, this is for you.

670
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,540
That's enough.

671
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,540
Let's go, Panzi,

672
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,140
and find your Sanye.

673
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,340
Sanye isn't here?

674
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,740
You should have told me earlier.

675
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,340
Let's go find Sanye.

676
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,540
You can't go!

677
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,340
Guys, get up!

678
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,740
You talk too much.

679
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,140
What are you doing?

680
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,140
What are you doing?

681
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,740
Fatty gave you this.

682
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,340
What are you doing?

683
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,140
Don't go, Fatty!

684
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,340
Turn off the fire!

685
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,740
Hurry!

686
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,340
There's a character on the wall.

687
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,140
What does it say?

688
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,140
The goods of the owner of the wooden house.

689
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,940
And...

690
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,940
The pill.

691
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,340
The pill?

692
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,940
And then?

693
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,540
It's so strong.

694
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,940
I can't see it clearly.

695
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:10,940
The

696
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,140
You're not like the An Ning in my memory.

697
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,140
You're not like the An Ning in my memory.

698
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,140
This is just the beginning.

699
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,140
I'm sorry.

700
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,140
My phone.

701
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,140
Sorry.

702
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,140
My phone is a five-star hotel.

703
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,140
Bye.

704
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,140
Stop!

705
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,140
Okay, cut!

706
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,740
Let's go.

707
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,540
Brother, what's the time?

708
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,140
Go!

709
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:49,940
Okay.

710
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,140
One, two, three!

711
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,140
Hurry!

712
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,140
One, two, three!

713
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,140
Okay, one, two, three!

714
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,140
Go!

715
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,140
So early.

716
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,140
Come on, come on.

717
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,140
You're not good at this.

718
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,140
This time, we can start to retreat.

719
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,140
Come on, come on.

720
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,140
I'm sorry.

721
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,140
I'm sorry.

722
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,140
I'm sorry.

723
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,140
I'm sorry.

724
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,140
I'm sorry.

725
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,140
I'm sorry.

726
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,140
I'm sorry.

727
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,140
I'm sorry.

728
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,140
I'm sorry.

729
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,140
I'm sorry.

730
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,140
Sorry.

731
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,140
I'm sorry.

732
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,140
That...

733
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,140
Hurry up.

734
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,140
Hurry up.

735
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,140
Let's go up and have a look.

736
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,140
They might be in the boat.

737
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,140
I'll take care of them.

738
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,140
Okay.

739
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,140
Wait.

740
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,140
I'll add it.

741
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,140
Let's go.

742
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,140
Okay.

743
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,140
No.

744
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,140
I'm leaving now.

745
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,140
No, no.

746
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,140
I want to say five hundred first.

747
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,140
One hundred and fifty.

748
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,140
I'm not counting you.

749
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,140
You're not a ghost.

750
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,140
Director.

751
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,140
Are they sure?

752
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,140
They received it.

753
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,140
Sorry.

754
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,140
Wait.

755
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,140
I didn't turn it off.

756
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,140
If I had turned it off,

757
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,140
I'd have weren't the driver.

758
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,140
It мы't very Gabriella Chang's fault.

759
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,140
It was Masong Chen who won out.

760
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,140
It's all right.

761
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,140
Let's take a look at the show.

762
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,140
Paul Cheung is also surprised.

00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,140
We're just like the late Aaron Chu and Other then.

764
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,140
Can you hear it clearly now?

765
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,140
It never did that before.

766
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,140
As long as you understand me.

767
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,140
Didn't you say this already?

768
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,140
It didn't.

769
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,140
We shouldn't trust more than you.

770
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,140
We need to take some care of it.

771
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,300
Thank you.

772
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:03,880
Thank you.

773
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,900
