1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah!

2
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,520
The legend we once knew

3
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,240
Since it's a big talk

4
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,960
I'm not good for last minute things

5
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,280
My son will give you

6
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,480
a lesson today

7
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,120
Your daughters

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,100
Enter your room!

9
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,000
True handsome!

10
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,520
Save me!

11
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,520
Dongshan

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I called you two to save me.

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You two are so annoying.

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm about to fart.

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Shut up.

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Lie down.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You said you were going to lie down.

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
How can I lie down?

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Sit down first.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You...

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You...

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You...

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You...

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You...

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You...

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You...

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You...

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You...

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You...

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You...

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You...

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You...

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You...

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You...

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You...

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You...

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You...

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You...

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You...

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Come on, pull your legs out.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Slow down.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Don't move too much.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We're under the toilet.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If I shake my legs,

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
will there be any kind of danger?

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Shut up.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't care anymore.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Give me your hand.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You bastard.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The entrance is closed.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Look! There's a door!

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The door should be east.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't know if we can get out.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Let's go.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Why is there something so bad under the fire?

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Uncle Xiu Ru said this is a scrap shop.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I think it's for training.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This old lady is really something.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Just a scrap training ground.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
She almost buried me in the soil.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:15,840
This is your

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This is an entrance.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I think there's an exit.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
How about we go in and have a look?

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
How dare you put me in?

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You can't go in.

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Come.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm going to kill you.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm going to kill you.

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm going to kill you.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm going to kill you.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm going to kill you.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Let's go.

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's go.

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
God gave me a pair of black eyes.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let me find light.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This is the first floor.

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I think there will be a second floor.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But why is there no place to go upstairs?

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The shape of this room is a square.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I think the house is a replica of the building.

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Either a tower or a building.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The face of the face.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The face of the face.

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is a replica of the mechanism and the setting of the place.

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It looks like it's really a training ground.

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We have to be careful.

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
If these faces are washed into the lung,

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's enough for us to lose weight.

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What is this?

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
A heater?

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Don't talk nonsense.

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Your heater is not closed.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If it's not closed, it's smoke.

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The countdown.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This Huo family won't be able to stimulate him to go to the training ground again, right?

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What if he kills someone?

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The alarm is ringing.

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Let's leave the city.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Look at that window.

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The window is exactly the same as the picture.

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Could it be that the person who imitated here is a foreign object?

104
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If that's the case, it's too much of a coincidence.

105
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This old lady Huo has long been thinking about your picture.

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
She's been thinking about you.

107
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
She's been thinking about you.

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
She's been thinking about you.

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This old lady Huo has long been thinking about your picture.

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
She's been thinking about you.

111
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This is probably the same place as the sample of the mine you have.

112
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It looks like a training ground.

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And it's related to the sample.

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
There's probably a trap here.

115
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Please.

116
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Boss Huo, can you hear me?

117
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Let's discuss it.

118
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Turn off this prop.

119
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Let's sit down and have a drink.

120
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Let's talk slowly, okay?

121
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't you just want the sample?

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
If you don't show up, I'm dead.

123
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm really dead.

124
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Enough, enough.

125
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Stop messing around.

126
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It looks like this old lady Huo doesn't know that we were brought here by her granddaughter.

127
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
If she knew, she would have brought someone to kill us.

128
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
There's not much time left.

129
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Hurry up and think of a way to get out.

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Hurry up and think of a way to get out.

131
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Hurry up and think of a way to get out.

132
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Little brother, is there a problem?

133
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Have you been here before?

134
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Look,

135
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
there are four identical pillars.

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But this Qilin

137
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
is always facing that pillar.

138
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
There must be something fishy.

139
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What is this?

140
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Qilin's head,

141
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
dragon's body.

142
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What is this?

143
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Green copper, gold, and gold Qilin's head.

144
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Look.

145
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Your pattern on the sample

146
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
is the same as the one on the nail, right?

147
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's really the same.

148
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There are also numbers.

149
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
From one to seven.

150
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Could it be

151
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
the corresponding floor?

152
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's possible.

153
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The patterns on it

154
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
correspond to this nail.

155
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And the floor above

156
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
corresponds to

157
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
the pattern on the sample.

158
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Then we will find the corresponding nail

159
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
according to this pattern.

160
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Press it.

161
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Is the door open?

162
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What?

163
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Could it be that

164
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
there is a time limit?

165
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
No.

166
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't be angry.

167
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So this is where the sample came from.

168
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Did Hu Laotian push it too hard?

169
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Is this nail Qilin really the one?

170
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Wu Xie, you can press it.

171
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Don't rush.

172
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I have to see which one is it.

173
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
All of them.

174
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Go.

175
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I heard it.

176
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Go.

177
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Go.

178
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Go.

179
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Welcome to the second floor of the hotel.

180
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I didn't expect this sample

181
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
could be used to pass the test.

182
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
No wonder this old lady Huo wanted it.

183
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But now it seems

184
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
this old lady Huo

185
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
will know we are here.

186
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Think about it.

187
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
If we go to this old shop,

188
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and Fatty falls from above,

189
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
it's not a coincidence.

190
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's been arranged.

191
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What do you think this old lady wants?

192
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
She wants to trap us here

193
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and put it in your hands.

194
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's a pity that with this sample,

195
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
this old lady Huo

196
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
won't be able to trap us.

197
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I think we should go.

198
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I think we should go.

199
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I think we should go.

200
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I think we should go.

201
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I think we should go.

202
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I think we should go.

203
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I think we should go.

204
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I think we should go.

205
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Let's go.

206
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Let's see what's in this sample.

207
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This sample is designed to be a set.

208
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
During the reign of the Leisong people,

209
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Fan Zhongyan set up a set in Suzhou

210
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
to trap the people.

211
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Later, it became

212
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
a place to hide the coffin.

213
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It was used to stop the people from dying

214
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
in the city.

215
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
According to the theory of Fengshui,

216
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yizhuang is the place of the big brother.

217
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The more people die,

218
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
the more unlucky Yizhuang is.

219
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
This old lady Huo is really not a coward.

220
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Why is there no staircase in this building?

221
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Ancient people believed it.

222
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So Yizhuang

223
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
usually doesn't design stairs

224
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and exit-like things.

225
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
He was afraid of destroying Fengshui.

226
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But there will always be some hidden passageways

227
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
for the people who are buried

228
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
and the craftsmen to enter and exit.

229
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
This sample is marked on the thunder.

230
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I guess it's a way to open these passages.

231
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Just now,

232
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
you and Xiao Ge were smart enough

233
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
to make this sample.

234
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Otherwise,

235
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't know how much

236
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I have to eat to lose weight.

237
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The pattern on the sample is large and small.

238
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's small and big.

239
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's small and small.

240
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
From the perspective of the clay sculpture of the Qilin,

241
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
the shape of the roll is thunder.

242
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It corresponds to the nail on the pillar.

243
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I should have learned to draw

244
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and learned some tricks.

245
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I would have used it to escape from this secret room.

246
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I always feel that this old lady

247
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
is cheating on us.

248
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Let's see.

249
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
How about we try a trick?

250
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Scold her a little bit and blow her out.

251
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Do you think that old lady

252
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
is a person like you?

253
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's right.

254
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This Qilin is in this direction.

255
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
This way.

256
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
There is a slide here.

257
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It was a moving maze.

258
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But this is still a chessboard.

259
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
There are eight doors here.

260
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Pick one.

261
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
In that room just now,

262
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
the Qilin team is the pillar that opens the door.

263
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Let's go in the direction of the Qilin.

264
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The Qilin team is the door.

265
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The Qimen Dunjia Li,

266
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Northeast,

267
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
is the door.

268
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The door is the door.

269
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The Qimen Dunjia Li,

270
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Northeast,

271
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
is the door.

272
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Actually, when we were in the Western Mughal Empire,

273
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
we used this trick.

274
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I didn't expect that after a few thousand years,

275
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
it would still be the same.

276
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Then let's see

277
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
if there is anything new.

278
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Let's go.

279
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Let's go around.

280
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Let's go.

281
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What do you think these iron bars are for?

282
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I don't think it's easy to pass.

283
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I don't know.

284
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't know if this old lady

285
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
is going to be able to get out of here.

286
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I don't know.

287
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't know.

288
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I don't know.

289
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I don't know.

290
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I don't know.

291
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I don't know.

292
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I don't know.

293
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't know.

294
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't know.

295
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I don't know what this old lady

296
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
is going to say.

297
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
No.

298
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
We were supposed to go through the door.

299
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Why can't we get out?

300
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Let's go further.

301
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Luckily, Xiao Ge reacted quickly.

302
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Otherwise, we would have been caught.

303
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
How can we get people into the dead end?

304
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Let's go.

305
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You go first, Tianzhen.

306
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Hurry up.

307
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Xiao Ge.

308
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
No, no.

309
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
We can't go like this.

310
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
This place is really a moving maze.

311
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
We walked through the door.

312
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What's wrong?

313
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
This is a dead end.

314
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
A dead end.

315
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
There used to be a place that looked like this.

316
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
A dead end.

317
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That's right.

318
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's a place where dead people are stopped.

319
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Where do dead people go through the door?

320
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It should be the dead door to the southwest direction.

321
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That makes sense.

322
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Southwest.

323
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Let's go and try.

324
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Let's go.

325
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Tianzhen.

326
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Wait.

327
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
We've been in this maze for so long.

328
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Where is the direction?

329
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:09,400
Restore the Qilin

330
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What's going on?

331
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Xiao Ge.

332
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You mean the sculpture is spinning?

333
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Fine.

334
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
We've been in this maze for so long.

335
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I don't know how many degrees the sculpture has turned.

336
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The Qilin has changed.

337
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
They're really stubborn.

338
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
They won't let us go back.

339
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You're right.

340
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But it's also wrong.

341
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
If this is the original building,

342
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
there's probably no turning back.

343
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's just that this is a model building of the Huo family.

344
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So there must be something we can use.

345
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
What we have to do now is to find a reference point

346
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
to clearly defend it.

347
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
If this is in the wild,

348
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
there are many ways.

349
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
In this place,

350
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
what can we use as a reference point?

351
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Stop.

352
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
The Qilin

353
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's the mechanism of that room just now.

354
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The southwest.

355
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
The room just now

356
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
is facing northeast.

357
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The exit of this room

358
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
is also on the wall of the northeast.

359
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yes.

360
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So this direction is southwest.

361
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Southwest.

362
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
South.

363
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Southeast.

364
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Thank goodness the Huo family didn't put their efforts on the soundproofing.

365
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Otherwise, we would be in real trouble.

366
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
No matter how the iron armor moves,

367
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
how the waist is rotated,

368
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
how the outside changes, it will be chaotic.

369
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
The directions of the southwest and southwest will not change.

370
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It won't interfere with us.

371
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
This old woman is playing tricks again.

372
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,400
The

373
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
This powder will be sprayed for three minutes.

374
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
We must go out within three minutes.

375
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It can help us find the direction.

376
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Let's go.

377
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
This should be the pillar pointing to the dead door.

378
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Living is dead.

379
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Dead is living.

380
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,860
I think this

381
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Tianzhen, let's open the door and go.

382
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
What is this?

383
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Why would the people of the Huo family put their information here?

384
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Isn't this your third uncle?

385
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Who is the little girl next to him?

386
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
She looks pretty elegant.

387
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
She is not a little girl.

388
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
She is a little flower.

389
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Little flower?

390
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I didn't see that coming.

391
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But to be honest,

392
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
the flower is quite elegant now.

393
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And this person is not my third uncle.

394
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
1983.

395
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
This team has not been to Xisha yet.

396
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
She is Xie Lianhuan.

397
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
What does the Huo family mean by taking Xie's photo?

398
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Put the information here.

399
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Otherwise it is not important.

400
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It is not worth taking away.

401
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Otherwise it is too important.

402
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I put it here on purpose.

403
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
This time it is really the third uncle.

404
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It was Xie's family just now.

405
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Now it is Wu's family.

406
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It seems that other families will not leave it.

407
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
The old lady Huo has not been idle these years.

408
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
She collected a lot of information about the old door.

409
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
This is when I was a child.

410
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
This is the third...

411
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
No.

412
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
1989.

413
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It is Xie Lianhuan.

414
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Xie Lianhuan is celebrating my birthday.

415
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Where did you get this old lady Huo's photo?

416
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I will tell you.

417
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
This person looks exactly like me.

418
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Chen, you...

419
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You have also got the opposite sex memory disorder, right?

420
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It is the same as Xiao Ge.

421
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Loss of memory and not old.

422
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
How is that possible?

423
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I was only 12 years old in 1989.

424
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And these two photos are only two days apart.

425
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Could it be that you have also been replaced?

426
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Is it you?

427
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
How can a person with a mask be called a gang?

428
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And think about it.

429
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
This person is much older than me.

430
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
If I want to replace someone, I will replace him.

431
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It makes sense.

432
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
No matter what you say,

433
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
you are the only person in my heart.

434
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
The rest are all fake.

435
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
No.

436
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
This is an old fake.

437
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Let's see if there are any other clues.

438
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Brother Wu Xie.

439
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Where is he?

440
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Where is he?

441
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Brother Wu Xie.

442
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Brother Wu Xie.

443
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Brother Wu Xie.

444
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Oh no.

445
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It's a phone.

446
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
It's a phone.

447
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
These are old photos of the nine gates.

448
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It's a life-threatening photo.

449
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Only this one is different.

450
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
It seems that this photo was deliberately shown to me.

451
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
This old lady is not kind.

452
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Do you still want to continue?

453
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Continue.

454
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
We can't waste her thoughts.

455
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
She put so much effort into arranging us here.

456
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Just to get the sample.

457
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But what is she calculating?

458
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Where did she get these photos?

459
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I have to find out.

460
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I have to find out.

461
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
My grandma asked you to take me home?

462
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Yes, Miss.

463
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It seems that it was grandma who arranged to bring them here.

464
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Where are my friends?

465
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I don't know.

466
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Where is my grandma?

467
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
This...

468
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I don't know.

469
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
The head of the family just asked me to take you home.

470
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I can't even ask my grandma.

471
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Can't I ask you guys?

472
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Miss.

473
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
What are you doing?

474
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
The head of the family just asked me to take you home.

475
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It should be this pillar.

476
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Yes.

477
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Be careful.

478
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I wonder what this old lady has prepared for us.

479
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Here.

480
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
No problem.

481
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It's fake.

482
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And this is a treasure that the Huo family can't get.

483
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
The organs of the two rooms before were made exactly the same.

484
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
There are no organs in this room.

485
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It's not normal.

486
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Human face turtle?

487
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,640
It's said that in the

488
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Tudong of the harem of the Shennong clan,

489
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
there are human faces.

490
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
One of them is a human face turtle.

491
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Taiping Yulan mentioned it before.

492
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
What does it mean to put it here?

493
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
If the human face turtle is real in the building of the Huo family,

494
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
it's too hard to believe.

495
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
This thing is very rare in the market.

496
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Not many people know it.

497
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
What kind of wealth can make such a big human face turtle?

498
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
It's not normal for the model to design a table by hand.

499
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
In this room, there is nothing valuable except the human face turtle.

500
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Let's take a look at the next room.

501
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Grandma, I don't even know.

502
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
There is a training ground under the old shop in our house.

503
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You led them there,

504
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
just to get the key in his hand.

505
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Is it necessary for everyone to do this?

506
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Can't we sit down and talk?

507
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You said it yourself.

508
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
That's just a training ground.

509
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It's a secret room escape.

510
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
What kind of danger can there be?

511
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
They will definitely come out.

512
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Our training ground is for exploration and inspection.

513
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Is it necessary for them to go in?

514
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
They are my friends anyway.

515
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I can't let them get in trouble.

516
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
If you don't let them go, I'll go by myself.

517
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
If you dare to go, I'll break your legs.

518
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
You usually make a mess.

519
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
But now I'm doing something big.

520
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I won't let you go.

521
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I didn't make a mess.

522
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You don't tell me anything and you use me.

523
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
If you don't let them go,

524
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I'll sit here and I won't go.

525
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Get up.

526
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Is this your seat?

527
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm so used to you.

528
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Go back to your room.

529
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Three.

530
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
This group.

531
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I said this is the pattern on the thunder.

532
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It's quite detailed.

533
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Look.

534
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
This pattern is a positive circle.

535
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It represents the positive side.

536
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
This one here is only half.

537
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
The corresponding one should be the side one.

538
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
This one is the opposite.

539
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
This one is the opposite.

540
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
This one is the opposite.

541
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Something's wrong.

542
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
This should be the oval one.

543
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
That's right.

544
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It's oval.

545
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It's a bit angular.

546
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Right.

547
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It's a bit angular.

548
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Wrong.

549
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
So that's how it is.

550
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
What do you mean by that?

551
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Hurry up and press it.

552
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
No, I think I...

553
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
What's going on between you two?

554
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
You're so secretive.

555
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Secretary какаяrection?

556
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
What's so secret you need?

557
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Why are you trying to get me to say this?

558
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,920
White

559
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And the key to Wu Xie's hand is still unclear.

560
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It's okay.

561
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
He's walking down the stairs,

562
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
and he handed it to me.

563
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It's nothing.

564
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Yes.

565
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
The first two floors have been restored to the ground

566
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
according to Wu Xie's actions.

567
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I just smelled something dangerous.

568
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It seems that Xiao Ge has also smelled it.

569
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Something dangerous?

570
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Why didn't I smell it?

571
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
You two are playing dumb here.

572
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
What?

573
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I'm not playing dumb.

574
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I'm just playing dumb.

575
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I'm just playing dumb.

576
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You two are playing dumb here.

577
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
If it's dangerous here, then get out of here.

578
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
It's not that dangerous to say it's dangerous.

579
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
It's a legal society now.

580
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Besides, this old lady is also my senior.

581
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
She won't act rashly.

582
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Since you're all here,

583
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
you can't go back empty-handed.

584
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Although this room is not mysterious,

585
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
the statue of the Human Face Turtle

586
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
actually revealed a lot of information.

587
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I'm sorry, Professor Wu.

588
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
The big logic you're talking about

589
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
has already been exposed to my IQ.

590
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
The statue of the Human Face Turtle was mentioned in the Peace Preview.

591
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Come here.

592
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I'll give you a lesson, and you'll understand.

593
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Professor Wu, if we're going to have a lesson,

594
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
can we go out and give it to me?

595
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Can we just leave it here?

596
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Is there a pen?

597
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Can you write something?

598
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Yes.

599
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
You...

600
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You can do this.

601
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I...

602
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I can't.

603
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Professor Wu, stop being so arrogant.

604
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
You have something called a bag on you.

605
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Right.

606
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
This one?

607
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You have to write it down to see it.

608
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Look at it carefully.

609
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Okay.

610
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
You really think you're a professor.

611
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Come on.

612
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Hurry up.

613
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Come on, get ready.

614
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Hurry up.

615
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Come on, get ready.

616
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Hurry up.

617
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Where's Mei?

618
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Come on, let's go.

619
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Either sit down, or move.

620
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I'm sorry, I forgot.

621
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Either move, or move.

622
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Come on, come on.

623
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Come on, get up.

624
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
But...

625
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
You can do it.

626
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Come on, get up.

627
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
If Lei draws this,

628
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
it'll be too ugly.

629
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
In the Qimen Dunjia,

630
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
the northeast is the door of life.

631
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
One more time.

632
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
This time, the Qilin team is...

633
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
This one?

634
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Turn.

635
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
The door has a slide.

636
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Where's the door of life?

637
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
It should be the door of death.

638
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Where's the door of death?

639
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
It should be the door of death in Xinnan.

640
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Xinnan.

641
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Director Feng, one.

642
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Wait a minute.

643
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
The exit is on the north-east wall.

644
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Yes.

645
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Come on.

646
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Come on.

647
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Thanks to this old lady,

648
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
she didn't work on the sound.

649
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Come on, take it.

650
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I'm sorry.

651
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Come on.

652
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
This guy...

653
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I'm a man.

654
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Don't say that.

655
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Impossible.

656
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I was 12 years old in 1989.

657
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And these two photos are only two days apart.

658
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Look.

659
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Where are they?

660
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Are you a man?

661
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Grandma, I don't know.

662
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Our old man hid a training center.

663
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Stop.

664
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
The next man is...

665
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
The one who is in the front is the representative of heaven.

666
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
He can summon the power of the evil.

667
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
The one in front is the representative of earth.

668
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
He can summon the power of the earth.

669
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
The question is...

670
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
What's the word?

671
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
The teacher.

672
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
If we're going to class,

673
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
can we go out and go up in a daze?

674
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Can we not stay here?

675
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Can we write something on paper?

676
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
You're not good at this.
