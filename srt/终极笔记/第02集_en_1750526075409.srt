1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Look at this picture.

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Tell me what it is.

5
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You found Lu Huang Bo?

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's useless.

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Xiao Hua,

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I found this thing a few decades ago.

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I still don't understand it.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If you want to investigate,

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
you have to be like me.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
After several decades,

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
you still have nothing.

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm doing this for your own good.

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Xie Yu Chen,

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
keep your Xie family safe.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Do you want to investigate?

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
There's no truth in the mouth of the Third Master of the Wu Family.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This picture is

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
on Lu Huang Bo's hand.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He can't be innocent.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Since he can find it,

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
we can find it too.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Where do we start?

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You found the clue from your aunt's goods.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That thing is in Qinghai.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
In a village called Lan Cuo.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This is the dragon vein

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
that King Zhou Mu was after.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's a dragon

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
that's been connected.

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's not a big deal to chase after Chang Sheng.

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Why is there someone else

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
who's following the trend?

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Chai Da Mu

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Ta Mu Tuo

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Why is there only one point

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
outside the Dragon Gate?

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Qing Tong Gate?

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Chen Wen Jin has been to Qing Tong Gate?

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
On May 30, 1993,

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
we entered the area of Changbai Mountain.

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The weather was terrible.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
On June 15,

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
we lost contact with them.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We kept moving forward.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
On June 17,

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
we reached the bottom of the Heavenly Palace.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The situation was very bad.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The other people were probably very angry.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We didn't have time to hesitate.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We decided to enter Qing Tong Gate

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
to see what was inside.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It was on June 18, 1993.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It was June 18, 1993.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It seems that I saw the bell.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The bell.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You didn't tell me the key?

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
How could you do this to me?

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
On February 8, 1995,

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
we started planning to find Ta Mu Tuo.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What exactly was going on?

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I must find out.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Ta Mu Tuo

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Ta Mu Tuo

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Why is it all Ta Mu Tuo?

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You've been looking for people

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
but you didn't find them.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What does this mean?

70
00:04:52,300 --> 00:05:10,160
Bai

71
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,260
Are you Hu Lin Rebellion pom-pom?

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why did you become like this?

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Don't come over!

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't move.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're a hand-hitting man?

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I... I won't see you again!

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Turn around!

78
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let go of me!

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What are you doing here?

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I haven't asked you yet!

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Why are you here?

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Didn't you enter the Qing Tong Gate?

83
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What are you doing?

84
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Let's go.

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You have to make it clear today!

86
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Didn't I just bow to you?

87
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Big hand, I found a box and you found a person.

88
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's you.

89
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This belt is for him.

90
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Let's go.

91
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Wait for me!

92
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Wait for me!

93
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I haven't gotten in the car!

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Stop the car!

95
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I haven't gotten in the car!

96
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Luo Xue.

97
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Hi.

98
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Boss Wu.

99
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's you.

100
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Why are you in the car?

101
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You pretended to be so similar in Hangzhou.

102
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I thought you really didn't know anything.

103
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So you're trying to test me on purpose?

104
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
There's a fake in your video tape.

105
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It seems that you're not the innocent Wu Xie anymore.

106
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Good thing I acted fast this time.

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Otherwise, you would have been in trouble.

108
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You're so mean.

109
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What did you find in the Liao Youyan?

110
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Didn't I ask you to find it first?

111
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I found it.

112
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Xiao Ge, why are you with these people?

113
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
When did you come out of Qing Tong Gate?

114
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Right, tell me. I want to hear it too.

115
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're not allowed to leave if you don't tell me today.

116
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Say it or not!

117
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You took my leather bag.

118
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I have to take something to tie my pants.

119
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Don't say it.

120
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Xiao Ge!

121
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I have it here.

122
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Are you crazy? You're walking into the mirror.

123
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
No, I told you to look at this.

124
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Leather bag.

125
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But the top layer is awesome.

126
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The quality is very good.

127
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'll give you a real love without a price.

128
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
444. How about it?

129
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I can still use this rope.

130
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
No, no, no.

131
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Half a discount. 222.

132
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Who are you?

133
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Black-eyed.

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The Taoist priest is called Black-eyed.

135
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He and Zhang Qilin are our consultants for this operation.

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Consultant?

137
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Xiao Ge is your consultant?

138
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Why?

139
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
These two are the best.

140
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
If your third uncle can afford it,

141
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I can't afford it.

142
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Wu Laosi, hurry up.

143
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
As expected, money can make ghosts fall.

144
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's not impossible to make me fall.

145
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
By the way, do you want that mirror?

146
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
We'll use it when we enter the desert.

147
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Desert?

148
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You don't know?

149
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We'll go to the desert later.

150
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Desert?

151
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
No, do you want it or not?

152
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
No, no, no.

153
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Brother, I want to ask you.

154
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Why are you going to the desert?

155
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Just call me Lao Gao.

156
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The boss told us that

157
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
the desert is the capital of the Western King's desert.

158
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The Western King's desert is there.

159
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Western King's desert?

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
How can I go there?

161
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I have to go and see

162
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
what they brought from the Liao Yan Garden.

163
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Thank you.

164
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'll go with you.

165
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
This old lady

166
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:43,000
is the guide of the

167
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
long-legged dragon,

168
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
the king of the desert,

169
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and the king of the desert.

170
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The dragon's name is

171
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Tar-Mustor.

172
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It means the tail of the dragon.

173
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It is said that

174
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
it appears only when the rain is heavy.

175
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What happened later?

176
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Nobody knows.

177
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This old lady

178
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
is the only clue.

179
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
This plate

180
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
is the letter of him and Chen Wenjing.

181
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It is written on it

182
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
that they are going to Tammut.

183
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,680
I'm afraid it's not suitable for you

184
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,480
It's not suitable for you

185
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,840
It's not suitable for me

186
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,960
My grandma said the plate is not complete enough

187
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,520
It's missing a part and can't be removed

188
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,560
Do you know where the porcelain is?

189
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,600
It's in the front

190
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,480
I'll go and check

191
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,880
It was taken to Lan Suo

192
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,080
Go to Lan Suo

193
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,720
Brother

194
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,960
It seems that he has something to tell you

195
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,600
How about I go to Lan Suo?

196
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,240
What small door, small house, and a farm

197
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,400
It seems that this is where I should go

198
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,200
You go back

199
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,720
OK, I'll go back

200
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,840
But you have to answer me a few questions

201
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,120
I'm looking for the answer

202
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,800
We quarreled

203
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,000
You're eavesdropping

204
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,240
Do you know manners?

205
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,960
This is my camp

206
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,360
There is a long-distance car station a few kilometers away

207
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,120
You can take my car

208
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,360
When will you set off for Tamu Tuo?

209
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,320
We'll set off when the map is complete

210
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,520
OK, I'll go with you

211
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,480
If I can't go

212
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,960
You don't think about going either

213
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,960
If you want to report us, I'll tell you

214
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,360
Our visit

215
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,240
has been granted

216
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,280
Then I'll tell you

217
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,440
Since Sister Chen Wen chose to send me the tape

218
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,280
It means she wants me to go

219
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,200
In other words

220
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,040
She needs me to go

221
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,360
You have clues to hide from me

222
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,720
You're hiding from me too

223
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,360
She cares about your life

224
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,560
I don't care

225
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,600
Come with me

226
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,880
Is it this?

227
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,600
Yes

228
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,880
Boss, your painting is good

229
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,360
My father left it to me

230
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:21,960
Do you sell it?

231
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,120
No

232
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,880
I don't sell things in the house

233
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,360
You give me a thousand

234
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,800
I don't sell it either

235
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,880
Then I'll pay five times the price

236
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,080
Five times

237
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,360
Can you scan the card?

238
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,720
Yes

239
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:56,020
Mr. Jiang 저는 bah

240
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,200
My car

241
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,480
Go

242
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,080
Let's go

243
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,440
My car

244
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,520
I really don't understand

245
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,560
My car

246
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,400
I really don't want to sell

247
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,080
what my father gave me

248
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,240
Don't worry

249
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,160
I'll give you another one thousand yuan

250
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,520
Your car money will be back

251
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
I tell you

252
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,160
Our family's painting

253
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,760
is really rich

254
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:41,880
No

255
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,400
You blind

256
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,960
Go

257
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,600
Pretend to be blind

258
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:04,960
면.

259
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,060
Five thousand yuan.

260
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,600
Buy yours.

261
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,560
Why do you want this one?

262
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,960
so that he won't give me any themeplich pain again.

263
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,280
What?

264
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,940
Cheng mechanisms are criminal.

265
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,780
He can kill me with a few himself,

266
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,260
he can be killed forever with my body.

267
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,760
I can show you what I'm capable of.

268
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,340
I will accept your other plans.

269
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,420
Good luck to the crew.

270
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:04,860
No.

271
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,120
No.

272
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,080
I won't talk.

273
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,600
No.

274
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,680
No?

275
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,440
Let's talk.

276
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,160
He is far away now.

277
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,560
Ruan, follow him.

278
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,760
Follow me.

279
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,640
My grandma wants to see you.

280
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,880
Just飯粥酒了?

281
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,900
Correct

282
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,220
Get lost

283
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,020
Come here

284
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,480
Have some food

285
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,300
What does Chen Wenjing know about money

286
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,100
And what do you think about her

287
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,440
My grandma says

288
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,240
Chen Wenjing asked me to bring you a message.

289
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,200
They are going to send the message.

290
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,800
They are going to send a message

291
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,840
to the people of the West Lake.

292
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,120
If you can go to the West Lake

293
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,760
and send the message,

294
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,200
we will retreat.

295
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,000
He will wait for you in the West Lake.

296
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,480
But if you can't get there in ten days,

297
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,800
he will go in himself.

298
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,520
You don't have much time.

299
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,240
Hurry up.

300
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,800
When did he say that to you?

301
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,280
He said that he would be back in ten days.

302
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,680
I don't know if he is going to come back.

303
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,840
I don't know.

304
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,320
He said that he would be back in ten days.

305
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,200
He is going to send a message.

306
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,280
My grandma said that he was just passing the message.

307
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,760
He doesn't know anything else.

308
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
Don't ask him.

309
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,760
There are many people here.

310
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,920
Old man,

311
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,840
why did Chen Wenjing ask me to go?

312
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,960
Chen Wenjing is not going to send a message.

313
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,200
Chen Wenjing is dead.

314
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,640
His grandma and grandpa

315
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,400
are all dead.

316
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,200
He also said that

317
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,200
it was between you two.

318
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,760
You must be careful.

319
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,240
Why did Chen Wenjing

320
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,480
send a message to us alone?

321
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,000
Don't go.

322
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
I ask you again.

323
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,480
Why did you enter Qingtong Gate?

324
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,400
When did you come out?

325
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,640
Why didn't you contact me?

326
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,000
What can't you say?

327
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,840
This is my business.

328
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
Why should I tell you?

329
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,840
Yes.

330
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,480
This is really your business.

331
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,440
You don't have to tell me.

332
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,520
You shouldn't have gotten involved.

333
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,960
Your third uncle

334
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,040
must have done a lot for you.

335
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,480
Actually, my request is very simple.

336
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,560
I just need to know

337
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,920
what the hell is going on.

338
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,080
I'm satisfied.

339
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,360
But everyone

340
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,640
doesn't tell me why.

341
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,120
Do you know the pain of not knowing anything?

342
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,240
I know you better than you.

343
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,240
I'm sorry.

344
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
I know you also want to

345
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,320
remember the past.

346
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,360
I'm a person who has no past and future.

347
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,560
If I disappear in this world,

348
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
no one will find me.

349
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,680
No one will find you.

350
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,760
If you disappear,

351
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,920
at least I will find you.

352
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,920
You have to answer me at least one question.

353
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,200
What did you see

354
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,800
behind the Qingtong Gate?

355
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,840
The end.

356
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,360
Everything is over.

357
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,520
What is the end?

358
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,640
I'm standing next to you.

359
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,040
Actually, your problem

360
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,600
is already my problem.

361
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,560
If there is an answer

362
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,560
in the West Palace,

363
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,680
then I have to go with you.

364
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,960
What is the end?

365
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,160
Between you and your desire.

366
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
Let me tell you.

367
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,640
This porcelain

368
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,360
is really useless to you.

369
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,440
It's not worth it.

370
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,280
It doesn't matter how much money I have.

371
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:16,800
OK.

372
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,400
Come on.

373
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,040
Let's drink.

374
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,840
Let's drink.

375
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,000
Come on.

376
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,600
Why are you here?

377
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,520
Wu Xie.

378
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,520
Come on.

379
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,040
Let me introduce you

380
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,040
to this old-fashioned businessman.

381
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,040
Jiumen Xie.

382
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,960
You are not from the Wu family.

383
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,840
You should know each other.

384
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,560
You are from the Xie family.

385
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,160
When we were young,

386
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,080
we used to play together.

387
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,520
You are Xiao Huang.

388
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,000
Xiao...

389
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,360
Isn't Xiao Hua a woman?

390
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,760
You remember it right.

391
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,360
You are a woman.

392
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,720
I was too shy when I was a kid.

393
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,400
Then you must be Huo Xiu Xiu.

394
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,880
It's me, Brother Wu Xie.

395
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,800
Why are you here?

396
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,120
It's easy now.

397
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,840
You know each other.

398
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,560
Come on.

399
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,440
Sit down.

400
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:17,920
Come on.

401
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,840
Sit down.

402
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,120
Wu Xie.

403
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,360
Brother Hua

404
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,680
has two porcelain pieces.

405
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,880
We need them

406
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,800
to go to Tamu Tuo.

407
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,480
Why do you need porcelain pieces?

408
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,680
The man who led the camp is called Ning.

409
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,760
He has a ceramic plate.

410
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,840
He needs your two pieces.

411
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,440
After it's assembled,

412
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,720
it's the map to Tamu Tuo.

413
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,520
We are going to Tamu Tuo too.

414
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,400
How about this?

415
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,000
You take us to see your boss.

416
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,880
I'll talk to him.

417
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,120
No.

418
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,080
You are not good enough for me.

419
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,000
They are all in the wine.

420
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,120
I know your surname is Xie.

421
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,720
Your surname is Huo.

422
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,160
You are both from the Nine Gates.

423
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,600
Even if I stop you,

424
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,840
you will go to Tamu Tuo.

425
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,520
And you have porcelain pieces.

426
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,800
I have no reason to stop you.

427
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,720
But I have a condition.

428
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,960
Listen to me

429
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,120
when you go to Tamu Tuo.

430
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,240
Deal.

431
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,120
And

432
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,560
I won't pay for your money.

433
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,720
You even charge me?

434
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,960
The video tape of A-plate

435
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,560
is back to the Gormu.

436
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,600
Now it's back to the plate.

437
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,080
You are fooling around to Tamu Tuo

438
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,080
to find the West King's mother.

439
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,320
Do you think

440
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,400
all the people in our generation like this?

441
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,480
Video tape?

442
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,560
In fact, the video tape itself

443
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,480
is a cover.

444
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,000
Open the video tape.

445
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It's the key.

446
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,560
There is a clue in the video tape.

447
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,560
There is a mark on the Tammu Tuo on Luhuang Bo.

448
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,120
According to them,

449
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,720
it should be the West King's mother.

450
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,440
It's hard for me to find the entrance alone.

451
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,760
I have to rely on them to find the way.

452
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,400
Then you go with them, Brother Xiaohua.

453
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,440
What about you?

454
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,160
I saw the video tape

455
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,760
Wu Xie mentioned just now

456
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,760
at my grandma's place.

457
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,360
My grandma hid it well.

458
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,560
I think

459
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,560
there should be more important clues

460
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,360
in the video tape.

461
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,160
That's good.

462
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,840
We two will act separately.

463
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,040
There will be one who can succeed.

464
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,560
Okay.

465
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,240
By the way,

466
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,520
I always think that Xiaoqi's black glasses

467
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,840
are not good.

468
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,280
Don't worry.

469
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,240
She's nothing.

470
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,560
Drive safely.

471
00:28:50,560 --> 00:29:15,540
A wolf.

472
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,560
You're done?

473
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,560
So that's how it is.

474
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,560
Ren Xi, such a great view!

475
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Wu Xie, why didn't you sit in the car with that unlovable guy?

476
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,560
I'm afraid that the dark-eyed will make things difficult for you.

477
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,560
After all, it's so blinding. Let them be happy on their own.

478
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,560
But you are quite bold.

479
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,560
Aren't you afraid that if you hand over the chips, that An Ning won't bring you here?

480
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,560
An Ning would even bring you here?

481
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,560
It's obvious that if you bring one more, you'll bring one less. It won't affect much.

482
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Let's go.

483
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,560
The wind has risen. Keep the formation.

484
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,560
Stop the car!

485
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,560
All equipment, get in the car!

486
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Stop the car.

487
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,560
Otherwise, we'll be in danger.

488
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Stop the car!

489
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,560
Hello? Is anyone there?

490
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Hello? Is anyone there?

491
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,560
Can you hear me?

492
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,560
What should we do? The signal is too poor. We can't reach them.

493
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Stop the car!

494
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Is anyone there?

495
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,560
Stop the car!

496
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
Is everyone in the car?

497
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
Give me a hand!

498
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,560
If you don't want to die, I'll stop the car for you.

499
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
Let's go.

500
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,560
The other equipment is still behind us!

501
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,560
It's too late!

502
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,560
Don't move!

503
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,560
Don't move!

504
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Leave here!

505
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,560
Such a big wind tunnel is too low.

506
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,560
They might not be able to find us.

507
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,560
Once the Yamazangs' weapons are taken by the wind tunnel,

508
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,560
we'll find a place to hide from the wind.

509
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,560
Let's get out of the car first.

510
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,560
We'll be surrounded by cars. Let's go!

511
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,560
Follow me! Don't get lost!

512
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,560
No! The signal is getting lower!

513
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,560
We have to find a place to hide from the wind!

514
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,560
God! Look over there!

515
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,560
The signal is here!

516
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,560
The signal is here!

517
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,560
The signal is here!

518
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,560
The signal is here!

519
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,560
The signal is here!

520
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,560
The signal is here!

521
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,560
It's Bei Zhen!

522
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
Hurry and check the direction!

523
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,560
The wind is at 125 degrees!

524
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,560
My book!

525
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,560
My book!

526
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,560
Don't move!

527
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,560
Bei Zhen is holding it.

528
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,560
Can he find a way?

529
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,560
Let's hurry and ask the others to meet up!

530
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Let's go!

531
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
Let's go!

532
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,560
Hurry and go!

533
00:34:47,560 --> 00:35:04,380
The

534
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,380
We can only go together if we want to go!

535
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,380
A kind person like me,

536
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,380
I'll stay and accompany you, okay?

537
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,380
I still have a gun!

538
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,380
Five minutes at most!

539
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,380
Wu Xie, look!

540
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,380
A signal bomb!

541
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,380
We have to hurry!

542
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,380
Let's go!

543
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,380
The wind is getting lower!

544
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,380
Look at the sky!

545
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,380
There's still a big sandstorm coming!

546
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,380
We have to hurry and find a place to hide!

547
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,380
We really have to retreat now!

548
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,380
But the sandstorm is getting lower now!

549
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,380
What if they come over later?

550
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,380
Come!

551
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,380
I'll tie the signal gun here.

552
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,380
When they come over,

553
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,380
they'll know that we're nearby.

554
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,380
Or else,

555
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,380
we have to find a stronghold.

556
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,380
When the sandstorm stops,

557
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,380
I'll go with you to find them.

558
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,380
Let's go!

559
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,380
Be careful!

560
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,380
No!

561
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,380
No!

562
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,380
I'm hurt!

563
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,380
I'm hurt!

564
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,380
I'm hurt!

565
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,380
Let's take a break.

566
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,380
Walking in the desert,

567
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,380
it feels like we're in the desert.

568
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,380
Wu Xie,

569
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,380
there's bad news.

570
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,380
It's been a long time since I saw a signal bomb.

571
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,380
It's very likely that it's a scam.

572
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,380
I have good news to tell you.

573
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,380
Look down.

574
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,380
There's a safety net watching us.

575
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,380
Alright,았어!

576
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,380
It's the Niu obelisk.

577
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,380
This place is big...

578
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,380
and it can be impossible to reach.

579
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,380
It's safe in no case.

580
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,380
Treat this place as our stronghold.

581
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,380
Is this the right place?

582
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,340
No?

583
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,920
I have to go to the commission

584
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,780
If it is well planted it can store our equipment

585
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,060
Throwing

586
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,200
Come, prop your société to climb out

587
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,760
Okay

588
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:38,960
Wu Xie

589
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm almost there

590
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,560
Are you ready?

591
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,760
One, two, three

592
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,280
Go

593
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,520
Wu Xie

594
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,560
Wu Xie

595
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,120
Wu Xie

596
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,920
I'll go with you

597
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,440
It's not easy to find here

598
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,800
Don't go

599
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,000
I'll bring her back

600
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:04,800
No

601
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,560
I have to find the fixed horse

602
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,320
They won't find her when they come back

603
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,440
We'll be separated again

604
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,400
We must find the fixed horse

605
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,240
Don't worry, boss

606
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,200
Wu Xie

607
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:34,800
Wu Xie

608
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,680
I'm okay

609
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,920
I just got out of the sand pit

610
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,120
I've walked so much

611
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,080
I'm so tired

612
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:40,880
Jiahe

613
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,520
Wu Xie

614
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,600
We must find a place to hide

615
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,880
Otherwise, we'll be frozen to death

616
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:48,960
No

617
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,400
I have to drink enough water first

618
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,320
It's okay, Wu Xie

619
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,240
Here you are

620
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,600
I want to go back

621
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,000
Wu Xie

622
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,120
You can't go now

623
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,640
Wu Xie

624
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,720
I have to rest for a while

625
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,520
Wu Xie

626
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,200
Wu Xie

627
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,560
Sev... Think about it

628
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,440
Wu Xie

629
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,840
Wu Xie

630
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:34,960
Ezze

631
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,960
Try to catch a水兽

632
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,560
Yes, that's right

633
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,700
Hand icon

634
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,760
Found it!

635
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,940
What are you doing here

636
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,320
I haven't asked you yet

637
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,560
You haven't lost a single point so far

638
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,860
you could stay ahead as our White Behind

639
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,560
She wants to divide the eggs

640
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,520
Next is grabbed by Oke

641
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,580
Yeah

642
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,580
Play that guy again

643
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,840
One two three that is XIANG

644
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,560
Come one

645
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,320
Let's go

646
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,720
Wait for me

647
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,920
See more

648
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,920
I'm here.

649
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,920
Where's the inside?

650
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,920
I have it.

651
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,920
I have it.

652
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,920
This is the rope.

653
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,920
I'll give it to you.

654
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,920
Since the car is running,

655
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,920
I'll put the rabbit on the...

656
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,920
I forgot again.

657
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,920
Stop.

658
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,920
Let me see.

659
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,920
I forgot.

660
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,920
The rope.

661
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,920
Sorry.

662
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,920
I forgot.

663
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,920
The rope.

664
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,920
Sorry.

665
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,920
The rabbit is gone.

666
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,920
The rabbit is gone.

667
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,920
Sorry.

668
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,920
It's okay.

669
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,920
The rabbit is gone.

670
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,920
Right.

671
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,920
Dream is so high.

672
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,920
The most beautiful person.

673
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,920
Don't look back.

674
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,920
I'll go with you.

675
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,920
Why are you laughing?

676
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,920
I have to find the custom table.

677
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,920
When we meet again,

678
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,920
I'll meet you in the answer.

679
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,920
You must find the custom table.

680
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,920
I didn't think of it.
