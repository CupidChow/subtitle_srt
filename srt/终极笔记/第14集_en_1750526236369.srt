1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this in the future, but I'm going to try.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

14
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:43,000
See very clearly ,

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Aren't we about to go find her?

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I want to find him.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But I have to deal with the Xie family first.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Okay.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's go.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Tuoba.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You guys go over there.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Tianzhen.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Wait for us.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I can't be idle either.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll go over there and take a look.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You still want to go up the window in your room?

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You know?

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't think I have any strength to step back.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You can't tell if you're not good.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You can tell if you're not bad.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm doing this for your own good.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Xie Yuchen.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Take care of your Xie family.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What I want to say is still that.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Take care of your Xie family.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Take care of your Xie family.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Let him rest first.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Before I came to the Tantra,

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
the last thing you said to me was to take care of the Xie family.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You still say that when you come here.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I've been wondering.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You're Wu Xie's third uncle.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Why didn't you let him take care of the Wu family?

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Why did you let me take care of the Xie family?

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
When the death message came,

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I was only six years old.

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This is 19 years in the past.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's been 19 years!

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I've been thinking.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The Xie family has been doing everything since the ninth night.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But Xie Lianhuang died without a trace.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I just want to know.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Since you chose to kill him,

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
what is the reason you stayed?

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You're the reason.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You're really Xie Lianhuang.

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Pooer...

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Tianzhen!

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Are you sure you can find an entrance here?

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Do you remember the two reservoirs before?

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Either there's water, or there's a military終 West.

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But it was all dry in here.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So...

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,200
It's not a pool.

65
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,120
It's the

66
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,680
Let's keep looking.

67
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Let's go.

68
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,560
Xie Lian Huan didn't die.

69
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,600
The one who died at the bottom of the sea

70
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,080
was Wu San Xing.

71
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
Wu San Xing didn't die either.

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The bottom of the sea

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
was Xie...

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Jiu Qi.

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You didn't die.

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Wu San Xing didn't die.

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Xie Lian Huan didn't die either.

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's the bottom of the sea.

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Where did the bottom come from?

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Xie Lian Huan came back with Wu San Xing's identity.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He told me to guard the Xie family.

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What was he doing?

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Why did he go to the Wu family?

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You can only ask him.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay.

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You don't say anything.

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Then listen to me.

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Xie Lian Huan faked his death.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He came back with Wu San Xing's identity.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The real Wu San Xing is hiding in the dark.

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's because you need a transparent identity

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
to complete a thing that

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
a living person can't do.

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's probably to avoid that person.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Then why did you have to choose Wu San Xing's identity?

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Unless there's another very important thing

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
that can only be done as Wu San Xing.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Am I right?

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Go on.

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
All these years, he hasn't been married.

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He hasn't expanded his business.

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Instead, he often goes out.

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But every time, there's Wu Xie.

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Wu Xie followed him to the Seven Stars Luch Palace.

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He killed the sea,

106
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
he went to the sky,

107
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
he went to the sky,

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and finally he went to the front door of the Qing Tong.

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
In the nine generations,

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
only Wu Xie has experienced these things.

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So Wu San Xing's mission

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
is to train Wu Xie.

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
No wonder he's apparently blocking Wu Xie.

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But Wu Xie still came.

115
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Because Wu Xie was supposed to come.

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He's the biggest descendant of the nine generations.

117
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
There's a wind.

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Let me ask you.

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You gave An Ning a tape recorder,

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and gave her one,

121
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and gave Wu Xie one.

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You know that Wu Xie is the one that the nine generations are going to train.

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I didn't give Wu Xie.

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The first tape recorder

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I gave her.

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The second tape recorder I gave Zhang Qilin.

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But I didn't think

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
that Zhang Qilin's tape recorder was in An Ning's hands.

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It should have been her arrangement.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What about the third tape recorder?

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Qiu De Kao.

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
An Ning's boss?

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Aren't you afraid that she'll steal the tape recorder?

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
For Qiu De Kao, the nine generations have never been afraid.

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What's wrong with having too many people?

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Qiu De Kao is the same as our goal.

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
With more of his participation,

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
we have a higher chance.

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But I didn't expect

140
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
that the tape recorder was in Wu Xie's hands.

141
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The tape recorder was still written by Zhang Qilin.

142
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It could only be her arrangement.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is not the first time.

144
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Who do you mean by her?

145
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
She's not a person.

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
She's a ghost.

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
A tape recorder?

148
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's a stone door.

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Your hand is broken. Take a break.

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Xiao Ge, look at her. She's not listening to me.

151
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Tuoba!

152
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Tuoba!

153
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Tuoba!

154
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Let's go.

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Because of her,

156
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
you recorded the tape recorder in the nursing home.

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You have established a security mechanism.

158
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yes.

159
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
To survive,

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and to leave some clues.

161
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
She brought the tape recorder to Wu Xie.

162
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
She hopes that she can also come here.

163
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It seems that Wu Xie was not only chosen by the nine generations,

164
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
but also chosen by her.

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Maybe only Wu Xie

166
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
is the one who can really find the nine generations' secret.

167
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The real descendant.

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
All of you are living a life of carelessness.

169
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm just curious

170
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
what you have experienced in the West Desert.

171
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Slowly.

172
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Slowly.

173
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
This is an underground room.

174
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Peng Peng,

175
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
what are you doing here?

176
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm here to find the missing person.

177
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm here to find the missing person.

178
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm here to find the missing person.

179
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Mr. Peng,

180
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
the West Desert has hidden something good.

181
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Don't pretend to understand

182
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
the whole story.

183
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The West Desert has hidden a secret mechanism.

184
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Do you know that?

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Even if you really find something,

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
you have to report it to the government.

187
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Be careful.

188
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Brother,

189
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
if you need anything, just call me.

190
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
How is it?

191
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
She was seduced?

192
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And then?

193
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
When we woke up,

194
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
we spent a few years in the nursing home.

195
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We researched the information

196
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
we brought from the bottom of the West Desert.

197
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
We found the clue to the White Mountain.

198
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But it was during that period

199
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We found ourselves losing our ability to sleep during the whole time.

200
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
After that, you went to the Cloud Sky Palace?

201
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We saw it there.

202
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The ultimate.

203
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Ultimate?

204
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What is ultimate?

205
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Ultimate is...

206
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The ultimate of everything in the world.

207
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You want to know?

208
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You can only see it yourself.

209
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What exactly is there in the West Palace?

210
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't know.

211
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I only know that this kind of youthful eternity has side effects.

212
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And the solution is right here.

213
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What side effects?

214
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
We will eventually become a ghost.

215
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
We have no time.

216
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh my god.

217
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Where is she?

218
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:48,480
She is in the Gormu

219
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The Gormu

220
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
They are all gone, boss.

221
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What should we do?

222
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Should we go find Third Master?

223
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Hua is here. Third Master will be fine.

224
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
We are not sure.

225
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
We should follow them.

226
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
At most, we will be scolded.

227
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Boss is indeed boss.

228
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
He is planning to stop us.

229
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You.

230
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Go back and see Third Master.

231
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I have an answer for him.

232
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Me?

233
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You.

234
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Go.

235
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Before Huo Ling died,

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
she didn't want her family to know about her situation.

237
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
She wanted you to keep this secret for her.

238
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Hua Yan, the Gate of Stone has been found.

239
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
They are going down.

240
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Tell me to come back and take care of Third Master.

241
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Okay.

242
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The end point is right ahead.

243
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Aren't you going?

244
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Someone needs to take care of this place.

245
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You go and explore.

246
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I will meet you later.

247
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Then I will leave Lian Huan in your care.

248
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I will leave Lian Huan in your care.

249
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I will leave Lian Huan in your care.

250
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't need you anymore.

251
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You are the only one

252
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
who can help me with her mystery.

253
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I don't know if I have a chance in this life.

254
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Lian Huan.

255
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Take care.

256
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Little Third Master!

257
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,320
Little Third Master!

258
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,040
Why did you follow me?

259
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,640
I told you to look after Third Master.

260
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Don't worry, Fatty.

261
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,920
I sent my men to look after Third Master.

262
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,520
Besides, there's also Master Hua.

263
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,440
He's here to guard.

264
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,440
Don't worry.

265
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,520
Let's go.

266
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,840
Little Third Master has spoken.

267
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,000
We'll follow Little Third Master.

268
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,200
Let's go.

269
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:37,840
Let's go.

270
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,840
What kind of soldiers

271
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,640
did your Third Uncle find this time?

272
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
He's not my Third Uncle.

273
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,760
Stop hiding.

274
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,440
Come out.

275
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,920
How could Chen Wenjing not know

276
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,720
that you're hiding here?

277
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
He knew it was me,

278
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,360
so he's fine.

279
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,560
You smell too much.

280
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,120
I really want to let you sleep.

281
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,400
This is Chen Wenjing's scent,

282
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,360
not the scent of the funeral.

283
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,560
Of course not.

284
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,480
This is the scent of his bones.

285
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,440
He has no time.

286
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,960
He just said

287
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,280
he was going to become Huo Ling.

288
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,560
Chen Wenjing is really dying.

289
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
So he said

290
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
he was anxious.

291
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,560
Yes.

292
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,760
Anxious.

293
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,560
Anxious.

294
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:00,920
Here.

295
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,720
You care about him, don't you?

296
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,660
I care about him,

297
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
but not you.

298
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,880
He told me

299
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,160
it's too obvious.

300
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,500
How could you

301
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,760
know?

302
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,520
Actually,

303
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,560
we know about him.

304
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,880
He's from Xie's family.

305
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,880
But I never called him.

306
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,880
I don't have a father.

307
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,880
Besides, after Xie Lian Huan went to Xi Sha,

308
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,880
he never came back.

309
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,880
After a few years,

310
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
my father and my uncles in the family

311
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
have both passed away.

312
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,880
Women are fighting over the divorce.

313
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,880
So you became the youngest person in the family.

314
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,880
What's the use of being the person in the family?

315
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,880
What does the family want?

316
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,880
I don't know what secret the Nine Gates have.

317
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,880
You forgot?

318
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,880
He just said you were the backer.

319
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,880
What backer am I?

320
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,880
I asked him so many questions.

321
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,880
He knew all the answers.

322
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,880
But he only asked me to protect the Xie family.

323
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,880
But I don't even know the enemy.

324
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,880
How can I protect the Xie family?

325
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,880
I don't know.

326
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,880
Young man, don't be angry.

327
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
Eat something.

328
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,880
I don't want to eat.

329
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,880
You don't need money. It's free.

330
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,880
I don't want to eat.

331
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
How about this?

332
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,880
Eat it.

333
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,880
I'll tell you something you're interested in.

334
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,880
As far as I know, there is a kind of pill.

335
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
It contains the blood.

336
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,880
It has the effect of the young life.

337
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
This is called the blood pill.

338
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,880
I've seen it.

339
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,880
You've seen it?

340
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
Blood pills are rare. How could you have seen it?

341
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,880
I found a red-red book in Xuelian Bay's remains.

342
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,880
There are some specific locations on the book.

343
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,880
I went to one of them. It was very dangerous.

344
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,880
It's a place for burial.

345
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,880
So you found a way to live?

346
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,880
Did you eat it?

347
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,880
No.

348
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,880
That's good.

349
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,880
You can't eat that.

350
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,880
The legend and the history of the book

351
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,880
all record the mother of the king of the west.

352
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,880
Do you remember the murals in the palace?

353
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,880
There were many people asking for the pill.

354
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,880
I don't know if it's the blood pill.

355
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,880
I don't know if it has anything to do with Chen Wenjing.

356
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,880
Apart from the blood pill,

357
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,880
there are other places in the book.

358
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Tamutu is one of them.

359
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Chen Wenjing

360
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,880
and her

361
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,880
have come here.

362
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,880
What does Chen Wenjing mean?

363
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
I don't know.

364
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,880
Maybe we'll find out after we pass the mother of the west.

365
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,880
The Book of the Stone

366
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
Look.

367
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,880
These jade statues are the stone sculptures of the ancestors.

368
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,880
They are the treasures of Chinese culture.

369
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,880
There are so many.

370
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,880
What is a jade statue?

371
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,880
It's a human figure made of jade.

372
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,880
Do you understand?

373
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,880
The mother of the west is good.

374
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,880
There are the human-faced birds in the sky.

375
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,880
There are the seven-star palace jade statues.

376
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,880
But she dug a big palace

377
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,880
just to put these things.

378
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,880
This is the holy place of the mother of the west.

379
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,880
The little flower and the black eye stayed to take care of her.

380
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,880
Listen.

381
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,880
Do you think it's the same as the legend?

382
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,880
The mother of the west has a medicine that will last forever.

383
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,880
Everyone brought their own specialties

384
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,880
and came here to ask for a long life.

385
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,880
Brother said that after the jade statue was removed,

386
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,880
it was no longer a small statue.

387
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,880
It's all dried up.

388
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,880
Besides, it's not expensive.

389
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,880
Look carefully.

390
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,880
These jade statues are not good at anything.

391
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,880
You're right.

392
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,880
It's a bit scary to look at it for a long time.

393
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,880
After I became the leader,

394
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,880
I found that many generations of the Nine Gates

395
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,880
were all controlled by a power.

396
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,880
What happened to the Nine Gates?

397
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,880
What are they hiding?

398
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,880
Maybe...

399
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
he knows.

400
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,880
I'm such a kind person.

401
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,880
I'm good at forcing people to attack.

402
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,880
How about I ask San Yan for you?

403
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,880
He's not San Yan.

404
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,880
His surname is Xie.

405
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,880
Oh, right. I'm used to it.

406
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,880
But all these years,

407
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,880
everyone started from the Seven Stars Luch Palace,

408
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,880
went to the Cloud Sky Palace, Qin Liang,

409
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,880
and then to West Desert.

410
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,880
And then we got here.

411
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,880
Wu Xie is the same.

412
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,880
You can find this place with a book.

413
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,880
Although you're good at it,

414
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,880
think about it.

415
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,880
He...

416
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,880
probably helped you, too.

417
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,880
What's this?

418
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
Why is it so bright?

419
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,880
It's probably Xiao Ge's mechanism.

420
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,880
He triggered the fire on the lamp.

421
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,880
The Sky Tower!

422
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,880
The Demon of West's Lamp!

423
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
The Sky Tower is not on the ground.

424
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,880
It's the whole Dragon's essence.

425
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,880
Boss.

426
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,880
Look over there.

427
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,880
It's you.

428
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
Tuoba, don't touch it!

429
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,880
Don't worry. I won't eat it.

430
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,880
I told you not to touch it. Put it down!

431
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,880
Did you hear that?

432
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,880
The distribution of these pills should be regular.

433
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,880
The Demon of West's Lamp

434
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,880
Run!

435
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,880
Hurry!

436
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,880
It's over. We can't get out!

437
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,880
Something happened. Let's go check.

438
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
Come here.

439
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,880
Look after Third Master. We'll go check.

440
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,880
Okay.

441
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,880
That guy is Pan Chi's mechanism.

442
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,880
The pills are placed on the planet's map.

443
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,880
They triggered the mechanism by taking the pills.

444
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,880
Come and help us.

445
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,880
The horse knocked on the door and the guest is down.

446
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,880
Come on, brothers.

447
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,880
Do it with them!

448
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,880
Tear it up!

449
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,880
It smells of her.

450
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,880
You can't carry her!

451
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:14,460
greed!

452
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,880
Why wouldn't you kill a man for you if the Heros are Lily?

453
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,880
It's the smell on my body

454
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,880
When?

455
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,880
I can smell it.

456
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,880
Can you smell the smell of a man and a woman?

457
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,880
You shameless bastard!

458
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,880
Watch me finish him off!

459
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,880
Why can't you kill these two people?

460
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,880
Hide!

461
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,880
Little Third Master!

462
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,880
Little Third Master! Fatty!

463
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,880
Please!

464
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
You bastard!

465
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,880
Cut him down!

466
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,880
One person can't fight back, two can!

467
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,880
It's all just a thought!

468
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,880
Cut him down!

469
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,880
Hold on, I have an idea!

470
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,880
Who touched the star plate again?

471
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,880
No, Little Third Master.

472
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,880
I want to put the poison in the weapon to save everyone.

473
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,880
I might have put it in the wrong place.

474
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
Who are you?

475
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
Are you trying to kill us?

476
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,880
No!

477
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
Little Third Master!

478
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
This hero won't die!

479
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,880
Over there.

480
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,880
It's a snake!

481
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
Use the six-sword!

482
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
Use the six-sword!

483
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,880
Use the six-sword!

484
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,880
Use the six-sword!

485
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,880
It's a snake again!

486
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,880
I'm going to kill you!

487
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,880
Look at me.

488
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,880
One, two, three!

489
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
No, I can't open it.

490
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
We have to find another entrance.

491
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,880
Ancient craftsmen

492
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,880
will definitely find a way to escape

493
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
when they see a secret chamber with a trap.

494
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,880
Let's find it.

495
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,880
Be careful!

496
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
You're so useless.

497
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
I'll kill you!

498
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,880
You're useless.

499
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,880
These Yu Yong are brave enough to not hit women.

500
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,880
The smell of me protected me.

501
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,880
The one controlling Yu Yong is the black-haired snake.

502
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,880
They can smell the smell of the pill I took.

503
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,880
Yu Yong is a man-hunt tactic.

504
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,880
It's not a way to fight back.

505
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,880
We have to find another way.

506
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,880
I'm looking for it again.

507
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,880
I have a mine on me.

508
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,880
Open the stone door.

509
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,880
Why do you still have it?

510
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
I'm going to help you save your life.

511
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,880
Isn't this killing yourself?

512
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,880
It's a good time to kill yourself.

513
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,880
I only have four mines.

514
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,880
Everyone must follow me to the mine.

515
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,880
If we blow the stone door open, we can get out.

516
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,880
But this is a ruin.

517
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,880
The door I blew

518
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,880
is not that big.

519
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
Cover me!

520
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
Come on,

521
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
taste the power of Fatty.

522
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,880
It's been blown for three days.

523
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,880
Are we going to blow the stone door open?

524
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,880
It's best to blow it open.

525
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,880
The insurance is on the line.

526
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,880
Keep looking for a way.

527
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,880
Okay.

528
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
Here.

529
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,880
Let's go.

530
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,880
Come on.

531
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
Come on, baby.

532
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Get down!

533
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,880
Open the stone door.

534
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,880
Run!

535
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,880
It's not open.

536
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,880
This is the bronze door.

537
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,880
It can't be opened.

538
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
It's over now.

539
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,880
Move!

540
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,880
Come on.

541
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,880
It's okay.

542
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,880
It's full of oxygen.

543
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
This place

544
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
is like the previous one.

545
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,880
It's a notice.

546
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,880
It's too shallow

547
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,880
compared to the fake palace

548
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,880
that needs to blind people's eyes.

549
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
The underground palace here

550
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,880
is not as good as the fake palace.

551
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,880
It's more like a secret.

552
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,880
But it's not a secret.

553
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,880
The underground palace here

554
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,880
is a secret.

555
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,880
It's a secret.

556
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,880
The underground palace here

557
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,880
is not as simple as it looks.

558
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,880
Look at these walls.

559
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,880
Look at the ground.

560
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,880
It's shiny and soft.

561
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,880
It's all made of the best diamond.

562
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,880
It's been 3,000 years.

563
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,880
Look at the mural.

564
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,880
It's complete.

565
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,880
It's not scattered at all.

566
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,880
It must have been made of the best materials

567
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,880
and craftsmen.

568
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,880
It's very hardworking.

569
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,880
It took a lot of effort

570
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,880
to repair three water tanks

571
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,880
just to hide this basement.

572
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,880
The basement of this floor

573
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,880
is likely to be the real Xiao Mu Palace.

574
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,880
Let's figure out

575
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,880
what this room is for

576
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,880
and then we'll prove it together.

577
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,880
It's so big.

578
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Xiao Ge!

579
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,880
This size should be

580
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,880
the unsealing knife.

581
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,880
Don't ask why I know.

582
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,880
Don't ask.

583
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,880
Okay, okay, okay.

584
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,880
I'll tell you.

585
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,880
This is called the unsealing knife.

586
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,880
Why do I know?

587
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,880
Because back then,

588
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,880
I was the one who

589
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,880
used to cut the knife.

590
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,880
I was the one who

591
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
used to cut the knife.

592
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,880
Why do I know?

593
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,880
That's because back then,

594
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,880
I learned how to unseal in Germany.

595
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,880
I even got a degree.

596
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,880
Second Master.

597
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,880
This thing is quite fresh.

598
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,880
Is this a specimen?

599
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,880
The specimen technology

600
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,880
was invented in the South Hall.

601
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,880
These should be all water tanks.

602
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,880
It's the same as the thousand-year goddess

603
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,880
who came out of the desert

604
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,880
of the King of Horse Mountain.

605
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,880
The medicine that soaked the thousand-year goddess

606
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,880
hasn't been completely broken yet.

607
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,880
Could it be that the Queen Mother

608
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,880
has already discovered

609
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,880
this kind of rich medicine?

610
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,880
It's possible.

611
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,880
What are you doing?

612
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,880
I'm going to help Little Brother.

613
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,880
Little Brother lured the snake away

614
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,880
just to get some time for us.

615
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
These snakes are not a problem

616
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,880
for you to get some time.

617
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,880
This is a human's head,

618
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,880
a snake's body,

619
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,880
a fish's tail.

620
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,880
This is a game of cross-country.

621
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,880
The King of the Heart is quite talkative.

622
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,880
Dragon, bird, insect, and snake.

623
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,880
These are all spiritual beings.

624
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,880
In the cultural heritage of the New Stone Age,

625
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,880
the archaeology found

626
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,880
a large number of human-beast

627
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,880
co-born jade statues.

628
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,880
Just like the one on this mural.

629
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,880
And among the prey and the sun,

630
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,880
the female frog of Fuxi is a human-faced snake.

631
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,880
Less fire, hundred years old.

632
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,880
More fire, thousand years old.

633
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,880
This is the longevity of Fuxi.

634
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,880
Look at this.

635
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,880
This is the longevity of the human body.

636
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
Look at this.

637
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
It seems that the female frog of the King of the Heart

638
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,880
is the longevity of the Fuxi.

639
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,880
Then this is her laboratory.

640
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,880
Probably.

641
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,880
And she chose to raise snakes

642
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,880
according to the climate of Tamutu.

643
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,880
But looking at this,

644
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,880
she probably didn't use this longevity.

645
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,880
Do you remember the mural of the Gya Wang Gong?

646
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,880
She was wearing a wedding dress

647
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,880
and met the King of the Heart in a human-faced manner.

648
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,880
Go.

649
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,880
Little Brother is so righteous.

650
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
If you didn't meet the King of Heart,

651
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,880
there would be no war.

652
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,880
Sorry, my lord.

653
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,880
I was just out of curiosity.

654
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,880
Insufficient city-dwellers.

655
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,880
I'll go find...

656
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,880
There they are.

657
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,880
Little Brother, go.

658
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,200
gets ready for another

659
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:18,200
kick-ass

660
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:24,980
PAD

661
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,660
один

662
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:35,300
That's the one

663
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,300
Xiao Ge!

664
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,300
Xiao Ge!

665
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,300
Think about it.

666
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,300
How did you get out?

667
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,300
Why did you leave this mark?

668
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,300
Don't joke around.

669
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,300
Xie Lian Huang's young look...

670
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:15,300
Sorry, come again.

671
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,300
I'm going to turn it off.

672
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,300
Sorry.

673
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,300
Ready.

674
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,300
Yes!

675
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,300
Yes!

676
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,300
Xiao Ge, you're...

677
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,300
Xie Lian Huang.

678
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,300
I've been missing you for a long time.

679
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,300
Okay.

680
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,300
What about the next one?

681
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,300
How about it?

682
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,300
Hold on!

683
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,300
I'm going to turn it off.

684
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,300
I'm going to turn it off.

685
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,300
Okay.

686
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,300
Come on.

687
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,300
Don't worry.

688
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,300
Sorry.

689
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,300
That...

690
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,300
The smell of the hair.

691
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,300
Okay, that's right.

692
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,300
Okay, that's right.

693
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,300
All these years,

694
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:11,300
everyone has been to Xisha from the Seven Stars Palace.

695
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,300
Then Qin Ling,

696
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,300
Cloud Sky Palace.

697
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,300
Again, sorry.

698
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,300
Okay, that's right.

699
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,300
Qin Ling,

700
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,300
Cloud Sky Palace.

701
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,300
I'm sorry.

702
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,300
I'm sorry.

703
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,300
I'm sorry.

704
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,300
What is this?

705
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,300
This is a jade.

706
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,300
It's just a common thing.

707
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,300
It's just a common thing.

708
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,300
Hold on.

709
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,300
Okay, let's do it again.

710
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,300
Don't move!

711
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,300
Go!

712
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,300
Run!

713
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,300
Hurry!

714
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,300
Stop!

715
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,300
Stop!

716
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,300
Stop!

717
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,300
Li Hao, Li Hao, get ready.

718
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,300
Hurry.

719
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,300
I'm going back to the hotel.

720
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,300
Let go!

721
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,300
Hey, this is Yu Yu.

722
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,300
Why are you still doing the Seven Stars Palace?

723
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,300
You're not even in the scene.

724
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,300
I'm sorry.

725
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,300
Go!

726
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,300
Fatty, I have a power tube.

727
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,300
Why do you still want it?

728
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,300
I'm just kidding.

729
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,300
I'm sorry.

730
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,300
Fatty, I have a power tube.

731
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,300
Just blow the door open and I'll go out.

732
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,300
Why do you still want it?

733
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,300
Fatty, you're a stockholder.

734
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,300
I still have it.

735
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,300
Hey, that shoe...

736
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,300
Big Brother, who just bought it?

737
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,300
Is it just to hide this painter?

738
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,300
I'm sorry.

739
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,300
What am I saying?

740
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,300
Painter.

741
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,300
Just to hide this painter.

742
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,300
Hey!
