00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What is that?

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't mess around!

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You're keeping my grandma in the Grand Park?

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's weird.

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Isn't that just skinning?

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Why are you blaming the skin?

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Why?

10
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Brother, why?

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's so cold.

12
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We didn't bring any thick clothes.

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If we can't find an exit,

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
we'll have to go back on our way.

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
How about we burn these bamboo sticks

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and get some horses?

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
No.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
These are good stuff.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
They'll be ruined.

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Besides, it's better to be cold.

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Colder.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
There's no Mi Luotuo.

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Take a photo.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Uncle,

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
send this photo to Miss Si.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Brother,

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I think I've touched your Zhang family's side.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Blood.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
How can there be blood?

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This is a blood-stained silk.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's not a piece of silk.

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's a piece of silk.

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's a piece of silk.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's a piece of silk.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's a piece of silk.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This is a blood-stained silk.

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's empty.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
There must be a mechanism down here.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Could it be that we can open the door with blood?

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Brother,

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
your Zhang family is really cruel.

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No wonder there are so many animal fur.

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But there's nothing on it.

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What's the use of blood?

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Uncle,

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
don't you feel bad for me?

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Fatty picked grass for me.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He's not as cruel as you.

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm not as cruel as you.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I broke your blood vessel.

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Say that again.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I said I broke your blood vessel.

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I was just kidding.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Kidding?

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes.

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You're so boring.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm not kidding.

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You're so boring.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's better to be a black blind.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm not boring?

63
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Boss,

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
it's not easy to walk.

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We're late.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Where's the black blind?

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't worry about that.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There's no news from Grandma.

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Not yet.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'll send it to you as soon as I get the news.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay.

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Get a few lighters.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And a blower.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Does it cost any money to boil the south cameras?

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,360
zł Fi,

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
please do me a favor.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's know whose blood we'll choose.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This is the 11-athon stick.

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Whoever uses the longest stick

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
will have free blood by chance.

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I said,

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
who of you is doing this?

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It would've put people's lives on the line if they choose.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Why don't you join the game with me?

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Me too.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,840
You're so stupid.

88
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,040
You let a girl do it.

89
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,960
You didn't expect it.

90
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,600
Miss, I'll help you.

91
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,720
Give me the long one.

92
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,200
The short one.

93
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,120
All short.

94
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,400
Come on.

95
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,280
Snow.

96
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,080
Short.

97
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,720
Short.

98
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,040
All short.

99
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
It's all short-circuited.

100
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
It's all short-circuited.

101
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,000
Fatty, come on.

102
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,000
I will never draw.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,200
If you don't want to draw,

104
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,600
I have no choice.

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Then I can only listen to everyone.

106
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,200
Fatty's blood is definitely more than ours.

107
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,000
Let go.

108
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Maybe you don't want to die.

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,400
The rest is long.

110
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,400
You kid,

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
you are a hand.

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,400
Huo San, what are you doing?

113
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,400
Miss, we don't want to hurt people.

114
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,200
But we can't stop here.

115
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,000
Xiao Ge is the key to passing the pass.

116
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,000
Then only trouble Fatty to give some blood.

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,800
Enough.

118
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,000
Stop pretending to be a fool.

119
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,400
Just want something ugly.

120
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,200
As for the real blood,

121
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,000
Fatty, I have a suitable person to choose.

122
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,800
Here is the picture of Ba Na.

123
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,400
Wu Xie, look at this.

124
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,800
This pattern is so beautiful.

125
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,600
This pattern is very similar to the iron plate inside.

126
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,400
No.

127
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
It's exactly the same.

128
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,800
The pattern around the iron plate is not in the hole.

129
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,000
Look at this.

130
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
This should be good.

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,200
Legend has it that it is the ancestor of Qilin.

132
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,000
It is the highest level of food chain.

133
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,000
But this mouth is tied by something.

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,400
This one looks like a few people are running away.

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,400
And they don't have any right hand.

136
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,200
Next one.

137
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't understand this one.

138
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,600
These are obviously not Han people.

139
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,400
I haven't seen them with a long knife.

140
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,600
It looks like they are burying something.

141
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
This one is so simple.

142
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Only three holes.

143
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,200
Do you have any ideas, Wu Xie?

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,200
These people are like children.

145
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,200
And the other group is like a fox.

146
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
I can only think of so many of these.

147
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,200
But if you look at it separately,

148
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,600
the meaning may be completely different.

149
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,800
Let's go.

150
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It should be almost done.

151
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,400
Let's go in in the iron plate.

152
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,400
Okay.

153
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Are you ready?

154
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Yes.

155
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,400
Xiao Ge, are you ready?

156
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,600
Xiao Ge, are you ready?

157
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,200
He was chasing us before.

158
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Now I'm going to take him as my key.

159
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,000
Brothers,

160
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,400
go.

161
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Go.

162
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,400
Move.

163
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Come out.

164
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Come out.

165
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
How dare you catch you fat guy?

166
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,400
I'll give you a good lesson.

167
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Go.

168
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Go.

169
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Go.

170
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Go down.

171
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Go.

172
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
The pattern is the same.

173
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,200
But I just don't know where the red is.

174
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Where is the person?

175
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
Wu Xie,

176
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,400
let's turn in the direction of the rotation of this iron plate.

177
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,400
Turn in the direction of the rotation of this iron plate.

178
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
One, two, three.

179
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
I can't get up.

180
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
Just push it.

181
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
One, two, three.

182
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
One, two, three.

183
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
I can't push it.

184
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
We have to find a way

185
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,400
to make this iron plate strong.

186
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,400
You look uncomfortable.

187
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,200
Wipe it.

188
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Wipe it.

189
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
Why is the broken thing still hanging?

190
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Xiaohua,

191
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
it's blood.

192
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Blood?

193
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,000
Why is there blood?

194
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The blood should be poured layer by layer.

195
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,600
I don't know how many layers it took to make it so thick.

196
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The pattern of the red is the blood.

197
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,600
This is not an ordinary iron plate.

198
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
This is a record plate.

199
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,400
This is the way to use it.

200
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,800
Are we going to pour so much blood on it?

201
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Can't we use water?

202
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Look.

203
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There is no change in the water.

204
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,400
It means that the water is not enough.

205
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,000
It can't move the mechanism below.

206
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Let's go.

207
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Let's go.

208
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Let's go.

209
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Let's go.

210
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Let's go.

211
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Let's go.

212
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Let's go.

213
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Let's go.

214
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Let's go.

215
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Let's go.

216
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Let's go.

217
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Let's go.

218
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,600
We have to use much blood.

219
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
How about this?

220
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,400
Let the outside workers

221
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
do some blood work.

222
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,200
We must seal it well.

223
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Great.

224
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's all stones.

225
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,600
Finally, we won't find anything strange in there.

226
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Let's continue.

227
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Brother.

228
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,200
Let's get some fresh air.

229
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Take a break.

230
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Let's go.

231
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Oh my god.

232
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Let's go.

233
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I think there is something strange.

234
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
This wall

235
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
should be a complete image of the talisman.

236
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But the talisman on the wall outside

237
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
was knocked down.

238
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Only the talisman inside is left.

239
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
If we use the mechanism normally,

240
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
the talisman inside will be pushed out

241
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and form a complete image of the talisman.

242
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's like a puzzle.

243
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's like a puzzle.

244
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But

245
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
we can't see the complete image now.

246
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Maybe there is a clue on the remaining pattern.

247
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Let's take a closer look.

248
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Hua, give me the photo.

249
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Here.

250
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Look.

251
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
The little hands on it

252
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
are the same as the photos.

253
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yes.

254
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
These are Hou's eyes.

255
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Let me see.

256
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Wu Xie, look.

257
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That means

258
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
this wall is the talisman.

259
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
If I look back now,

260
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
the one on my left

261
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
is Hou.

262
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
If you say so,

263
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
then this wall

264
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
is the one without the right hand.

265
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
On the right side are the photos of these ethnic groups.

266
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
There are three empty photos.

267
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
They correspond to your back.

268
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
They are completely opposite.

269
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So,

270
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
there is a connection between

271
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Ba Nai and Miss Si.

272
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The Qianju lock.

273
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Master,

274
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
there is enough water.

275
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
But there is not much left to eat.

276
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
How many bottles of water are there?

277
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Eleven.

278
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Why do ten people take eleven bottles?

279
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Do you want to drink more?

280
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Let me tell you.

281
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
If you drink too much water,

282
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
it will be easy to get a brain injury.

283
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
No problem.

284
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It is eleven.

285
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Did Mr. Qu teach you this math?

286
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
How could it be eleven?

287
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

288
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Ten.

289
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Ten.

290
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I can count on Mr. Qu to teach me.

291
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Five of you.

292
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Eight of you came down from the Huo family.

293
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Me, Xiao Ge, Xiu Xiu.

294
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Sixteen of you.

295
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The one who just came down.

296
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Two of you were killed by the Huo family.

297
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You are so drunk.

298
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Now it is your time to show your techniques.

299
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
He already presented a Already Pretty Life.

300
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Amazing.

301
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Exactly.

302
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Eleven bottles are left.

303
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
After Huo Da fell down from the bridge,

304
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
he didn't come back.

305
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
At that time,

306
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
when he drew the line, he was also a person.

307
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
This is the 11th tombstone.

308
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Whoever draws it,

309
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
please write it down on the line.

310
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Go.

311
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Check your people one by one.

312
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'll go find Xiao Ge.

313
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Okay. Let's go.

314
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Let's go.

315
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Xiao Ge, it's time to ask the right questions.

316
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Ask two questions that only we know.

317
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What's the name of the guy who was in the Seven Stars Lujuan Palace?

318
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,420
Huang Yuanxi.

319
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,920
Huang Ye.

320
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,000
Huang Yuanxi.

321
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,200
스

322
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,500
I always forget this tea.

323
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You're an old man now.

324
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,020
Change another one.

325
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'll give you that most precious thing.

326
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,920
Xiao Qi, you're reliable.

327
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,080
Keep an eye on him. I'll go catch Qian Xi.

328
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,400
Xiao Xiao.

329
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,200
What are you doing, Fatty?

330
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,120
Nothing. I suddenly feel a little nostalgic.

331
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,440
When did we first meet?

332
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,600
At the tower...

333
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,400
At the tower.

334
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,240
Oh, right.

335
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,880
You and Xiao Hua have been taken care of by Fatty.

336
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,880
Yes.

337
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,520
I've never had the chance to thank him.

338
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,200
You're a loser!

339
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,960
Don't bully our lady.

340
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,760
I've never seen you at the tower!

341
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,800
Speak.

342
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,600
Who are you?

343
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,040
Where is Huo Xiu?

344
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,280
I should send you and Huo You Xue to go abroad together.

345
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,800
Grandma, you can stop me today.

346
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,720
You won't let me go.

347
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,000
But tomorrow, you'll be unable to stop me.

348
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,120
The Huo family doesn't live on obsession.

349
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,640
Everyone has their own mission.

350
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,120
Going down Zhang's drum building is my old lady's life.

351
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,080
It's not yours.

352
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,320
Then what am I?

353
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,520
You still haven't figured it out?

354
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,520
Then continue sitting.

355
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,840
Grandma! Grandma!

356
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,440
Who are you?

357
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,440
Huo Xiao Yao?

358
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,880
Why are you here?

359
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,280
Fatty, I'm not a bad person.

360
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,720
It's the old lady who asked me to come down for you.

361
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,720
I didn't mean any harm.

362
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,360
No matter what,

363
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,720
Jia Xiu Xiu has always been here.

364
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,720
She's not the person who hid herself.

365
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,520
Hey, friend, I think I've never seen you before.

366
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,520
She's a spy.

367
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,920
Who do you think is a spy?

368
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,120
What did you say?

369
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,920
Don't think I can't beat you if you're too many.

370
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,520
That's right.

371
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,920
Don't think you have a strategy if you're too many.

372
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,920
If you fight, it's not sure who will win.

373
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,120
What? You're still fighting?

374
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,520
You go first.

375
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,920
What are you afraid of?

376
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
Who's afraid of who?

377
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
Come on.

378
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,520
Hey, why is this seat gone?

379
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,920
They all know how to shoot.

380
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,120
Hey!

381
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,720
You're moving.

382
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,120
You...

383
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
Where's my grandson?

384
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,120
He ran away.

385
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,920
It's that guy again.

386
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
I just shot his shoulder.

387
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,520
The bottom of his clothes is empty.

388
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,920
He's sneaky.

389
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,720
He deserves it.

390
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,320
Did you catch him?

391
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,320
Yan Min Xiu Xiu.

392
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,720
Come here.

393
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,520
Fatty.

394
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,120
Why do all the people of the Nine Gates

395
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,520
like to imitate Huo Xiu Xiu?

396
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,320
What's wrong?

397
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,920
Huo Xiu Xiu is imitating Xiu.

398
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,520
No.

399
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,720
But you're much better at imitating than Hua Yue.

400
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,120
You won.

401
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,120
I didn't even see the fire eyes of Fatty.

402
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,520
That's right.

403
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,720
My figure is like the one our lady practiced.

404
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,320
How is it?

405
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,920
Don't be so arrogant.

406
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,120
I'll settle the score with the old lady when I get there.

407
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,720
Take your men and go.

408
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,920
Okay.

409
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,320
Let's go.

410
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,120
Actually, this thousand-mile lock is not difficult to unlock.

411
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,520
To be honest,

412
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,720
we're the ones who use our information to open the lock of the bar.

413
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,520
The thousand-mile lock of the Zhang family is not that simple.

414
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,920
There are three holes on the iron plate in the photo.

415
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,320
If I compare them,

416
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,720
if I'm not wrong,

417
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,320
there should be three locks.

418
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,320
It depends on how to unlock them.

419
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,920
There are two ways.

420
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,120
The first way is to push the iron plate to the same position as the bar.

421
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,920
Head to head, tail to tail.

422
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,320
Then you can get the answer.

423
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,920
It's not reliable.

424
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,520
There was no photo that could send us hurt.

425
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,720
And if we don't push the iron plate,

426
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,320
we can get one point right in a week.

427
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,520
This method is not safe.

428
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,120
That's true.

429
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,320
Brother,

430
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,720
this looks like a door.

431
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,920
But this door is a bit rough.

432
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
Let's see.

433
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,820
Want the real reason!

434
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,720
I saw a flower.

435
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,620
A flower.

436
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,120
I'm wondering if I can guess the problem of this door.

437
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,120
What flower is this?

438
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,560
We come to report

439
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,280
when there are big laws

440
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,680
Your Majesty

441
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,120
Sorry

442
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,280
Sorry

443
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,280
I am sorry

444
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,040
But I will go

445
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,280
Go

446
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,000
Wait

447
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,780
Yanyan

448
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,160
Come

449
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,160
What's up?

450
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,040
Take him

451
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,780
to take downmakutou

452
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,720
the door of our Zhang family.

453
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,720
It seems to be possible.

454
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,560
Don't touch it.

455
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,800
Did you drink soy sauce

456
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,760
and put a lot of salt in it?

457
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,360
Ye Pingxiu,

458
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,800
send a photo to Miss Si.

459
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,480
Let's see what Tianzhen says.

460
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,640
Tianzhen!

461
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,200
Look.

462
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,520
Fatty.

463
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,720
This is

464
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:09,880
the first lock onρο.

465
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,120
I think it's a match with the one on the talisman.

466
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,720
Wu Xie, let me see.

467
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,320
The talisman is cute.

468
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,120
How can I just press it and see yours?

469
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,320
It seems that if you turn the iron plate correctly,

470
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
the wall will change.

471
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,920
It's not that easy.

472
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
The wall will change.

473
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,520
The talisman of change is the answer.

474
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,520
By the way, you said there's another way.

475
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
What's that?

476
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,520
Unlock it from the inside.

477
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,120
Yes.

478
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,920
I want to see how this mechanism works

479
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,320
inside this machine.

480
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,320
Come on, bring water in.

481
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,520
Bring it in as fast as possible.

482
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,320
There is no news from Wu Xie.

483
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,920
I'm the one who does all the work.

484
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
You're just standing there.

485
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,560
I don't mind being dirty.

486
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,920
I don't mind being dirty.

487
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
I don't owe you anything.

488
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,800
Are you sure, Wu Qian?

489
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,880
Here.

490
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,880
I'm back.

491
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
Wu Qian,

492
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,720
there's a shadow underneath.

493
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,400
I don't know what it is,

494
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
but it's very dangerous.

495
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
Also,

496
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,840
come on.

497
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
It's hidden in the chest and back.

498
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,360
It's a secret.

499
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
After you put it on,

500
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
put your hands on the iron plate.

501
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
Okay.

502
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,840
Come on.

503
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,020
Fantastic

504
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,040
Good

505
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,120
Guys

506
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,480
Let's make another teleportation

507
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,040
One

508
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,480
Eight.

509
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,680
Three.

510
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,360
Four.

511
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,600
Five.

512
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Six.

513
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,240
Seven.

514
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,440
Eight.

515
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,680
Nine.

516
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,280
Ten.

517
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,840
The hole on the iron plate has three wall of the mechanism.

518
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,440
And the chain here is just divided into three groups

519
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,240
and has three channels.

520
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,480
This structure

521
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,440
just proves that there are three mechanisms.

522
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,840
These holes

523
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,240
correspond to each other on one side of the wall.

524
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,240
That is to say,

525
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,640
as long as these chains are pulled,

526
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,960
they can change the position of the

527
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,240
floating position on the wall.

528
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,840
The chain that connects our rear channel

529
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,240
is the lowest.

530
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,240
It should be the first mechanism.

531
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
The chain that connects our rear channel

532
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,440
is the first mechanism.

533
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,040
Look.

534
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,840
There is a water wheel.

535
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,440
It seems that the water wheel

536
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,240
is providing the power to the iron plate.

537
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,040
Let's find the black-eyed mirror first.

538
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,440
Let's break the mechanism first.

539
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,040
Why are you standing there?

540
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,840
Wu Xie.

541
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,840
We are the ones who are asking for more.

542
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,040
Not the black-eyed mirror.

543
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,040
Let's go.

544
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,840
These peach cans here

545
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,640
are the same as those in the Devil City.

546
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,840
What's inside

547
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,040
is definitely not a good thing.

548
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,240
The stones on it

549
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,840
weigh at least a few thousand pounds.

550
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,640
If we break this,

551
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,840
we will be thrown into the meat sauce pot.

552
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,240
If the things inside

553
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,640
are out,

554
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,040
we will still not be able to live.

555
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,440
No. It's too thin.

556
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
I can't step on it.

557
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,440
Let's try to move it.

558
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,240
No.

559
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,640
Something on the bottom is stuck.

560
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,640
I can't move it.

561
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,440
The Zhang family

562
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,240
really doesn't let outsiders live.

563
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,240
It would be great if Xiao Ge was here.

564
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,440
The person who is difficult to handle

565
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,040
is a perfect match for the difficult mechanism.

566
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,440
You

567
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,440
are used to being surrounded by these living things.

568
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,040
You don't solve any problems yourself.

569
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,240
My life is good.

570
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,640
Fortunately, these are all repaired by people.

571
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,640
There should be a way.

572
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,440
Come on.

573
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,240
Take it.

574
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,640
Find a place to fix it.

575
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,240
You have to lean against the rope later.

576
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,240
I'll lie down first.

577
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,240
Are you crazy?

578
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,440
It's broken in such a short time.

579
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,840
Are you sure?

580
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,240
If you're not sure, you can do it.

581
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,840
I'm still responsible for praying for you.

582
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,640
Come on.

583
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,040
This time,

584
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,240
I have to bless you.

585
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,040
Be careful.

586
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,840
Bless me.

587
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,440
Come on.

588
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,440
Come on.

589
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
Xiao Hua.

590
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,440
Slow down. No one is fighting with you.

591
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,840
If you're tired, take a break.

592
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,640
How can I rest in such a place?

593
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,840
If the things on it

594
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,040
fall down,

595
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,040
I'll be smashed into a meat filling.

596
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,640
When I go back with my dark eyes,

597
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,440
I'll make you dumplings.

598
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,440
Okay.

599
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,640
Come on.

600
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,240
I can't help you now.

601
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,040
You don't want me to read the scriptures for you, right?

602
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,240
How about this?

603
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,240
I'll sing a short song for you.

604
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
Okay.

605
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,240
A king's farewell is the longest for a noble consort.

606
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,040
Two tigers, two tigers,

607
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,640
run fast, run fast.

608
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,640
One has no eyes, one has no ears.

609
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,040
Enough. Stop singing.

610
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,840
I'm tired of your singing.

611
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,440
Keep climbing.

612
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,840
Don't stop, okay?

613
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,240
Xiao Hua.

614
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,840
You've been climbing for so long.

615
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,440
How can you be so tired?

616
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
Tired?

617
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
I'm not tired.

618
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,440
Aren't you tired?

619
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,440
Don't tease me.

620
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,640
Don't tease me.

621
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,640
I'm not tired at all.

622
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,040
Why are you so angry?

623
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,640
Wu Xie, what happened?

624
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,040
Why are you fine?

625
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,640
I'm fine.

626
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,240
I'm here to save you.

627
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,640
Be careful.

628
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,240
Come here.

629
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:50,840
Come on.

630
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,840
There's something more fresh here.

631
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,440
Come on.

632
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,440
Wu Xie!

633
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,240
Are you really okay?

634
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,640
Wu Xie.

635
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,040
Wu Xie!

636
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,440
What is that?

637
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Don't move!

638
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,440
What is that?

639
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,440
It's full.

640
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,440
Don't change.

641
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,440
Don't change.

642
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
Don't change.

643
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,440
Don't change.

644
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,440
Don't change.

645
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,440
Don't change.

646
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,440
Don't change.

647
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,440
Don't change.

648
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,440
Don't change.

649
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,440
Don't change.

650
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,440
Don't change.

651
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,440
Start.

652
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,440
Start.

653
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,440
Sorry, don't shoot.

654
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,440
The black hair on the peach leaf

655
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,440
is not a real body.

656
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,440
Stop.

657
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,440
Start after you finish the call.

658
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,440
Okay.

659
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,440
But,

660
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,440
Xiao Ge is very special.

661
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,440
Don't change.

662
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,440
Excuse me.

663
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,440
Sorry.

664
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,440
Come on, I'll pick you up.

665
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,440
Come on.

666
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,440
Come on.

667
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,440
Let a girl do it.

668
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,440
You want to come out?

669
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,440
Put it down.

670
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,440
Come on.

671
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,440
We don't want to hurt you.

672
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,440
I'm not blind.

673
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,440
Okay.

674
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,440
Ready.

675
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,440
Come on.

676
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,440
Take a step.

677
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,440
Take a step.

678
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,440
Start.

679
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,440
This way.

680
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,440
Come on.

681
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,440
I'm blind.

682
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,440
Maybe the rest of the patterns will be lucky.

683
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,440
Let's take a closer look.

684
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,440
Next one.

685
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,440
The position is not good.

686
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,440
Where did we meet for the first time?

687
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,440
It's on that tower.

688
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,440
There's a lot of people.

689
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,440
Yes.

690
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,440
Last time, you and Xiao Ge...

691
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,440
I'm sorry.

692
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,440
Thank you.

693
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,440
No, thank you.

694
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,440
I thank you for your ass.

695
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,440
I've never been to the car wash.

696
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,440
Don't touch my lady.

697
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,440
I'm sorry.

698
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,440
I made a mistake.

699
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,440
I'm sorry.

700
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,440
I've never been to the car wash.

701
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,440
Thank you.

702
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,440
Thank you for your ass.

703
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,440
I've never seen you in the car wash.

704
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,440
Don't bully my lady.

705
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,440
I didn't see you in the car wash.

706
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,440
I've never seen you.

707
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,440
No.

708
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,440
Don't bully my lady.

709
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,440
I'm sorry.

710
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,440
I'm sorry.

711
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,440
I'm sorry.

712
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,440
Stop.

713
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,440
Go ahead.

714
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,440
Go ahead.

715
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,440
Go ahead.

716
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,440
Go ahead.

717
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,440
Stop.

718
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,440
It's gone.

719
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,440
It's gone.

720
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,440
It's gone.

721
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,440
Stop.

722
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,440
I'm going to hit a big one.

723
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,440
There are a lot of things.

724
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,440
You have to hit the one that's inside.

725
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,440
Xiao Ge, I'll go to the bathroom.

726
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,440
Come on.

727
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,440
Stop.

728
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,440
Stop.

729
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,440
Stop.

730
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,440
Stop.

731
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,440
Let go.

732
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,440
Let go.

733
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,440
Let go.

734
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,440
Let go.
