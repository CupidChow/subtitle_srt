1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The stone-bending pills were made by Queen Mother Xi?

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Then Queen Mother Xi fed them the stone-bending pills

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and tested them.

6
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The stone-bending pills

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I saw this in the Gormu nursing home.

8
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Chen Wenjing said

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Huo Ling doesn't know if he can be a human.

10
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It seems that this is Huo Ling.

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It seems that Chen Wenjing and others

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
may be used by others to experiment with the Long-Lifetime Technique.

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Maybe the Third Master found out.

14
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So he chose to fake death

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and investigated in the secret as a transparent person.

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He and Xie Lian Huan got into this situation today

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
is also a helpless situation.

18
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This underground palace was made by you?

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This hole doesn't seem to be left by someone.

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Let's climb out.

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Stop talking nonsense.

22
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Just go out.

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't know what's going on in front of us.

24
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Everyone be careful.

25
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Go.

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Look at this person's dress.

27
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's exactly the same as the person who disguised as the King of the Palace.

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It should be King Zhou Mu.

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There is him in the fake palace.

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
There is also him in the real palace.

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What did King Zhou Mu do to Queen Mother Xi?

32
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's why Queen Mother Xi is so attached to him.

33
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Feelings.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't know.

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't know.

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't know.

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Feelings.

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Feelings.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Legend has it that Queen Mother Xi and King Zhou Mu did meet.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But do you think this story is credible?

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's true.

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But Queen Mother Xi is a cruel person.

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Seeing her expression of unwillingness

44
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
seems to have moved the true feelings.

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If Queen Mother Xi really has feelings for King Zhou Mu

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
then she might tell him about her longevity tree.

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Do you remember the magic of Queen Mother Xi turning her head three times in the fake palace mural?

48
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
She must be looking forward to meeting King Zhou Mu.

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The eight rites are repeated 30,000 times a day.

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
When will King Mu not come out?

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's a pity.

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's a pity that he's never come back.

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't worry about the legend.

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This is the point now.

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What did you think of?

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Nothing.

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It seems that this is Queen Mother Xi's final secret.

58
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's also what I'm looking for.

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I think Wu Xie and Chen Wen Jin's target is also her.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But what is this?

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Let's go.

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Go find Wu Xie and the others.

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I can finally relax.

64
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Who knows Wu Xie might be her kill move?

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Definitely.

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
After a while, Wu Xie might have gotten some information.

67
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What information?

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The secret to his white body is...

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Se studying for the escape,

70
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's very crispy.

71
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let it go. Don't bother.

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
If this shrimp is a special species,

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
it's a pity that you killed a few.

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Look at this. It's so small.

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's not even 1,800.

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's okay to catch a few.

77
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Why is it this big again?

78
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's not good to see this thing.

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Seeing the statue of a human face,

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
it's probably not far from the center of the palace.

81
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Everyone be careful.

82
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
12 palace walls?

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
This is the head of a man.

84
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The head of a woman.

85
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The upper body of a woman, the lower body of a man.

86
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The upper body of a man, the lower body of a woman.

87
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This is a map.

88
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Can these two bricks of heads move?

89
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It may take some time.

90
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm afraid it's not enough.

91
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It may take some time.

92
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This seven-leafed devil really has a lot of work.

93
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Is it a defense?

94
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Second Master,

95
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
share the credit.

96
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'll solve the jade dragon. You'll share the map.

97
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's easy.

98
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Don't rub heartfeltly.

99
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
My comrade gives me plenty of Chinese liquor.

100
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Chicken legs,

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'll replace one today,

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and give it to you later.

103
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm crazy.

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Good table!

105
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Such a loyal man will play well.

106
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
If you have your gold coins,

107
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll buy you a car ticket

108
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and you'll have fun.

109
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
My friend,

110
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
take it.

111
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Get out.

112
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,400
But I can't get rid of a man and a woman.

113
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,600
Can you hurry up?

114
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,880
I'm looking for inspiration.

115
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,800
Think carefully and take your time.

116
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,200
Look behind you.

117
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,400
The Seven Royal Mother Research Institute is a human-bearing co-sacrifice, right?

118
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,280
This is a great thing. She must see it.

119
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,480
Maybe opening this door

120
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,280
is to make it look like a human-bearing co-sacrifice.

121
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,280
These bricks should be for making a face.

122
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,280
Are you here to travel?

123
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,680
Young man, don't be angry.

124
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,080
I've figured it out.

125
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,080
Since you've figured it out, hurry up.

126
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,080
But the key is to know what you're using to put it on.

127
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,280
Try this.

128
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,480
Try this.

129
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,880
Master Hua, help me get one.

130
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,680
I'm here.

131
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,680
The woman is...

132
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,280
a human-bearing snake.

133
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,080
Then the man is...

134
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:25,020
a human-bearing

135
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,020
The dragon's headache is caused by this eye.

136
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,020
Such a disgusting bug.

137
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,420
It's the dragon's original form.

138
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,220
If you've been to the Cloud Sky Palace,

139
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,820
you'll know that man and eye can coexist.

140
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,420
You've been there?

141
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,820
I heard about it.

142
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,420
Each box weighs differently.

143
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,020
It seems that the door is a set of gravity mechanisms.

144
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,420
Come on.

145
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,820
Come on. Why are you standing there?

146
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,020
The Dragon's Head

147
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,420
Did you think of something?

148
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,020
We're here.

149
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,020
You still can't remember anything?

150
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,820
Xiao Ge, you can't remember anything.

151
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,820
Why did you leave such a hidden mark?

152
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,220
Next time, remember to leave something that we can understand.

153
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,220
It's okay.

154
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,220
With a mark, it means that we didn't go wrong.

155
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,020
That man was making a statue of a bird.

156
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,620
It's very likely that he's warning the outsiders.

157
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,820
I don't know what's ahead. I'll go check it out.

158
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,420
I'll go too.

159
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,220
I'll go with you.

160
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,020
Then let's go together.

161
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,620
How hard did it take to get here?

162
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:28,340
How many treasures did the West

163
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,820
We've done too much on this trip.

164
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,420
Don't forget An Ning.

165
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,220
Pan Zi is also seriously injured.

166
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,020
And I, the third...

167
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,620
That's right.

168
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,020
Let's go.

169
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,820
Let's go.

170
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,220
Let's go.

171
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,820
Let's wait over there.

172
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,420
Yes.

173
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,420
What is this?

174
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,220
Taoguan shards.

175
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,620
There are patterns on it.

176
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,620
It's very similar to the ones in the Demon City.

177
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,220
This thing is very sharp.

178
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,620
You'd better be careful.

179
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,620
So many shards.

180
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,420
It's a souvenir.

181
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,420
I was scared by a peach shard.

182
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,620
I've seen it today.

183
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,620
I'm also curious.

184
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,820
Listen.

185
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,820
Why do I feel like this thing is getting brighter?

186
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,020
It's true.

187
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,620
It feels very red.

188
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,020
Let's go. I'll go check it out.

189
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,420
There seems to be something in the water.

190
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,820
It seems like a worm is sucking our blood.

191
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,620
No wonder it's getting redder.

192
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,820
So we've been sucking it's blood.

193
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,420
Hurry. Cut the worm.

194
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,220
Hurry.

195
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,020
Hurry.

196
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,820
Hurry.

197
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,420
Hurry.

198
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,220
Hurry.

199
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,620
Hurry.

200
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,620
There are too many of them. You can't kill me.

201
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,420
Xi Chen.

202
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,620
It's dangerous.

203
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,820
Hurry.

204
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,020
This worm is sucking our blood.

205
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,820
It's getting heavier.

206
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,420
It's pushing the coffin and the mechanism.

207
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,220
Xi Chen, look up there.

208
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,220
There are ten bags of them all around the human chain.

209
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,220
We've just seen one.

210
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,020
We've opened it.

211
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,420
There's nothing else.

212
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,420
There's nothing else.

213
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,220
Let's go, Brother.

214
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,420
Brother.

215
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,420
No. It's useless.

216
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,420
We've cut the worm and let it bleed.

217
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,020
The worm's tongue is sucked away by them.

218
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,420
Hurry.

219
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,820
Be careful.

220
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,420
Cut the worm. Give me the snake.

221
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,820
Okay.

222
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,220
Fatty, save me.

223
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,820
I'm busy even without seeing Fatty.

224
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,220
Brother.

225
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,420
Throw away the snake's eyes.

226
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,020
There are not many left.

227
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,820
But there's a mechanism.

228
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,620
Shao An, let's go.

229
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,220
Go.

230
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,420
It's the first time.

231
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,220
It doesn't look like it.

232
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,020
Something must have scared Li Qi.

233
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,420
There's something more powerful than him.

234
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,620
It doesn't matter.

235
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,420
Let's go up first.

236
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,420
There are bugs in the water.

237
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,820
I'll go with you.

238
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,420
Go.

239
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,020
Go.

240
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,820
Is this...

241
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,020
The one who deserves to be the King

242
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,420
is probably the Queen Mother.

243
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,220
The Queen Mother is well-groomed.

244
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,020
What kind of technique is this?

245
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,420
To make her sit here for a thousand years.

246
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,220
No.

247
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,420
This isn't the Queen Mother.

248
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,420
The face doesn't look right.

249
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,020
It looks like she's wearing a mask.

250
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,020
Look at this face.

251
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,020
She probably wore a mask too.

252
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,020
But she's not wearing it anymore.

253
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,220
It looks like this mask

254
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,020
not only changes her appearance,

255
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,620
but also protects her.

256
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,220
Fatty,

257
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,420
do you think the Queen Mother

258
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,220
is pretending to be sitting here

259
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,620
to make a fake product?

260
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,220
Why did she go there?

261
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,620
You're asking me?

262
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,220
Who am I asking?

263
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,620
Maybe

264
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,020
she's just pretending.

265
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,820
She's just pretending.

266
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,620
She's just pretending.

267
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,020
Maybe

268
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,820
the Queen Mother doesn't want others to know

269
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,220
that she's left.

270
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,420
The Queen Mother found a replacement.

271
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,020
She must have gone somewhere else.

272
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,620
I said I didn't see

273
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,220
any treasures along the way.

274
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,420
It was all on this old woman.

275
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,620
Touch it.

276
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,420
There must be no poison on it.

277
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,020
Who left a message to whom?

278
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,020
The Queen Mother left a message to the Queen Mother.

279
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,820
The owner of the water tank

280
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,020
must be the Queen Mother.

281
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,420
Look at that face.

282
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,420
That face must be the Queen Mother.

283
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,020
When we were down there,

284
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,020
that face looked so scary.

285
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,220
Now, from the high platform,

286
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,620
it's quite gentle.

287
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,620
The Queen Mother left the gentlest side

288
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,820
to the Queen Mother.

289
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,820
Who is the Queen Mother?

290
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,020
It's said that the one who guarded the Queen Mother

291
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,820
was not only the special envoy of the Queen Mother,

292
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,220
but also a general.

293
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,620
He's good at military, military and military affairs.

294
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,820
Simply put, he's the commander of the guards.

295
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,820
Fatty, what does it say on the tablet?

296
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,820
Why are you the envoy?

297
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,820
It says that it's probably the Queen Mother

298
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,220
who left the letter to the Queen Mother.

299
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,220
The Queen Mother knows that she won't live long.

300
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,620
She's afraid that after she dies,

301
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,620
no one will guard the Queen Mother's territory.

302
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,020
So she turned her own official position into a secret.

303
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,820
She'll keep guarding the Queen Mother after she dies.

304
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:05,420
The Queen Mother is really affectionate to the Queen Mother.

305
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,420
This is a trap.

306
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,420
Why is the trap here?

307
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,020
If the Queen Mother stands up from the throne,

308
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,220
she'll trigger the trap.

309
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,020
The trap might not be lethal.

310
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,620
The Queen Mother can't harm the Queen Mother.

311
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,820
The Queen Mother can't escape from her own trap.

312
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,220
Get up.

313
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,020
Lady-in-waiting Xue.

314
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,420
This is great.

315
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,620
The bugs have all been removed.

316
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,420
It looks like once the trap is triggered,

317
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,020
the blood bugs on the coffin will take the lead.

318
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,420
This is great. We're safe now.

319
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,020
It looks like the Queen Mother

320
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,020
is trying to make the Queen Mother

321
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,020
safely cross the pool.

322
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,820
Hey.

323
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,620
Do you think this person is dead?

324
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:33,620
If he's dead, why would he design this?

325
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,220
If he's not dead,

326
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,420
isn't the Queen Mother

327
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,020
the one who studied the immortality?

328
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,220
Could it be...

329
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,020
The Queen Mother?

330
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,820
I'm not sure.

331
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,820
But I'm sure that it's the Queen Mother.

332
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,620
I'm sure that it's the Queen Mother.

333
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,020
That's right.

334
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,420
After all, this is a fake.

335
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,020
Hold this.

336
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,820
What's this?

337
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,820
It's a secret item.

338
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,860
I'm sorry.

339
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,100
These are not what I'm looking for.

340
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,700
Aunt Wenjing, what are you looking for?

341
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,620
I don't know what it is.

342
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,580
But it's definitely not the throne.

343
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,100
I don't have time.

344
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,580
I don't have time.

345
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,460
Aunt Wenjing, what are you looking for?

346
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,300
Come on.

347
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,980
This is the final fate of King of Xie.

348
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,460
This is my end.

349
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,740
Your end

350
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,660
It's the end of the stone of King of Xie.

351
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,580
This is not an ordinary stone.

352
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,980
This is an angel.

353
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,420
What angel?

354
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,220
Isn't this a meteorite?

355
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,260
It's going to kill me.

356
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,980
This is a big one.

357
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,260
Think about it.

358
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,180
Such a big stone

359
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,580
fell from the sky.

360
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,420
I guess this grave

361
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,180
was all smashed by it.

362
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,060
This is not an ordinary angel.

363
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,540
This is a meteorite.

364
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,980
meteorite

365
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,500
That is to say, this thing is made of meteorite.

366
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,180
It's just called meteorite.

367
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,020
Even if it's a meteorite, you can't take it away.

368
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,420
Great.

369
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,020
I only read a little bit

370
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,140
of the meteorite in the ancient books.

371
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,700
I didn't expect that there was such a big one

372
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,980
in the King of Xie's tomb.

373
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,340
What I'm looking for

374
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,140
must be in the meteorite.

375
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,940
Are you going in?

376
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,460
Yes.

377
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,500
Wait a minute.

378
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,460
Put on the rope.

379
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:20,980
If there's any news,

380
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,060
you must notify us.

381
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,460
Aunt Lin Jian.

382
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,460
Be careful.

383
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,420
Wen Jun.

384
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,220
Just stay calm.

385
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,780
Don't worry.

386
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,060
Chen Wen Jin is more than you.

387
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,260
Oh no! He didn't grab the rope!

388
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,660
Aunt Guan Ji, your rope!

389
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,660
Xiao Ge!

390
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,460
Xiao Ge!

391
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,460
Fatty, get down!

392
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,060
What do you think I am?

393
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,860
Xiao Ge!

394
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,260
Xiao Ge!

395
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,260
Again!

396
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,260
How do you slide?

397
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,460
No, you can't. It's too slippery.

398
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,460
What are you looking at?

399
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,860
With this size, you can go in.

400
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,060
But I have to get stuck in there.

401
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,060
If you can't do it,

402
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,260
I can't do it either.

403
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,860
I didn't want to do it.

404
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,060
It's not a good idea.

405
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,660
Why are you here, Aunt Hua, University of Technology?

406
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,860
Where did you guys come out from?

407
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,460
We finally found you.

408
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,060
We just walked another street,

409
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,160
It was empty when we came out of the passage.

410
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,860
It was full of corpses in the원 blanks.

411
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,260
I wasn't expecting

412
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,760
that it was an ordeal.

413
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,460
Why is Wu Xie and the rest only having you?

414
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,860
We had an approach.

415
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,860
feeder this year.

416
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,860
I'm going to the prison.

417
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,860
The prison?

418
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,660
The ball on the wall is this thing.

419
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,460
This is the prison?

420
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,860
You know?

421
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,860
Not really.

422
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,260
I heard from the people on the street.

423
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,660
But I didn't expect this thing.

424
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,060
It's still in the West Kingdom.

425
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,060
Do you know what's in here?

426
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,660
I don't know.

427
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,260
Anyway,

428
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,860
the ball is in there.

429
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,860
According to the plan we saw,

430
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,460
Queen Mother went in there too.

431
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,260
She went in there too?

432
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,660
No wonder she found a substitute.

433
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,860
Why did she go in there?

434
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,060
For Changsheng.

435
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,860
Since she went in there,

436
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,060
does it mean

437
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,260
it's not that dangerous up there?

438
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,860
It's not dangerous.

439
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,660
And for Chen Wenjing,

440
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,660
it should be a good thing.

441
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,660
Didn't you say Chen Wenjing

442
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,660
doesn't have time?

443
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,260
But she still made it.

444
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,060
Yes.

445
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,060
Aunt Wenjing did say

446
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,860
this is her destination.

447
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,460
She rushed here

448
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,060
to get into the prison.

449
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,060
So this prison

450
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,260
could probably stop her body from changing.

451
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,260
The information we got

452
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,460
is only a kind of elixir called?

453
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,860
It can make the body change.

454
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,660
Aunt Wenjing said before

455
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,460
that after they were in the West Desert,

456
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,260
they were locked in the Gormel nursing home.

457
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,460
From there,

458
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,860
her body started to change.

459
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,860
So it's very possible that

460
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,460
they were locked in the stone bowl.

461
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,660
It's very possible.

462
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,260
Wait.

463
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,860
Brother also went to the West Desert?

464
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,460
He didn't get cold at all?

465
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,260
You mean

466
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,060
Brother was also locked in the stone bowl

467
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,260
and followed in?

468
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,860
No way.

469
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,660
No way.

470
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,260
How could such a precious thing

471
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,660
be wasted on him?

472
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:45,860
Wait.

473
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,660
What if Brother went in?

474
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,460
Will he and Aunt Wenjing come out?

475
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,660
Chen Wenjing probably won't come out.

476
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,860
As for Brother,

477
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,660
he should come out.

478
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,860
Do you think it's reliable?

479
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,660
Okay.

480
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,460
I'll wait for him here.

481
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,860
Since we've found it,

482
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,260
I'll go up and have a look.

483
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,660
I know you're good at it.

484
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,260
But I don't suggest you go.

485
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,060
What's so scary?

486
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,060
I've always been scared.

487
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,660
You're not a mute.

488
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,460
Forget it.

489
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,660
Anyway, I don't think

490
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,660
this place can give me the most important answer.

491
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,660
But this trip is a good one.

492
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,260
It's not bad.

493
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,660
Master Hua.

494
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:52,860
Master Hei.

495
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,260
Let's go.

496
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,860
I'm too poor.

497
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,260
I've lost all my brothers.

498
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,660
I haven't got any benefits.

499
00:31:59,060 --> 00:31:59,660
By the way,

500
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,860
there was a dress just now.

501
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,660
It should be very valuable.

502
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:04,860
How about this?

503
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,260
You go get it.

504
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,860
I dare not, Master Hei.

505
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,660
I just want to go home alive.

506
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,060
What do you say?

507
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,260
Okay.

508
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,460
Okay.

509
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,460
I'm leaving.

510
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,660
Wu Xie.

511
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,860
Are you sure you want to wait for Xiao Ge?

512
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,060
I didn't wait for her

513
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,860
when I went to Cloud Sky Palace.

514
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,660
Now,

515
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,060
I'll wait for her till I die.

516
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,060
I have a lot of things to ask her.

517
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,460
This mute

518
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,060
has many secrets.

519
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,460
If you can make her

520
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,660
understand the secrets,

521
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,860
you can't even figure it out.

522
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,060
Then we'll leave first.

523
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,460
Wu Sanxing is injured.

524
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,460
She's still outside.

525
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,860
There's only one man by her side.

526
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,260
You should leave now.

527
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,060
Take care of your Xie Lianhua.

528
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,260
Tuoba.

529
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,860
Leave the supply to them.

530
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,660
Master Hei.

531
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,660
Are we really not going to leave any supplies?

532
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,860
Leave?

533
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,460
You.

534
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,060
I'll leave the supplies to you.

535
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,860
Leave when there's only half left.

536
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,060
Don't starve to death here.

537
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,660
It seems that the second message

538
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,060
that Lu Huangbo pointed out

539
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,860
is the secret of the Queen Mother of the West,

540
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,460
which is the Cloud Jade.

541
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,660
After you take the body,

542
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,060
enter the Cloud Jade.

543
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,860
This is the long-living skill of the Queen Mother of the West.

544
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,860
The long-living skill of the Queen Mother of the West.

545
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,260
Long life?

546
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,860
That's ridiculous.

547
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,860
Who can live a long life in this world?

548
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,060
Who has ever seen a real long-living person?

549
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,460
Young man.

550
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,260
Don't like it too much

551
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,260
to put something unknown in it.

552
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,260
Even if you really see it,

553
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,460
you might not know

554
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,060
that it's a long-living person.

555
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,060
After all,

556
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,660
you're just an ordinary person.

557
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,060
I don't care if this long life really exists.

558
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,260
I don't believe that

559
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,660
the people of the Nine Gates

560
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,860
are chasing after you.

561
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,060
It's just such a boring thing.

562
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,060
And you also told me that

563
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,060
I've been investigating the Queen Mother of the West

564
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,460
for such a short time.

565
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,260
If it's really like what you said,

566
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,860
I've been in the Nine Gates for so many years,

567
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,860
so many wrongs and wrongs,

568
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,660
I'll never forgive you.

569
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,460
The original talent of the Queen Mother of the West

570
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,260
has long been realized.

571
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,260
How could so many people die?

572
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,860
I'm still a little upset

573
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,860
to hear you say that.

574
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,860
This is the focus of Chen Wenjing,

575
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,460
but it's definitely not my focus.

576
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,060
When I go back,

577
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,460
I will continue to investigate.

578
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,260
I'll follow these signs first.

579
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,660
Then I can walk less detours.

580
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,460
Don't worry.

581
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,460
Little Third Master

582
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,860
is a man of his own.

583
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,460
Let's go.

584
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,660
Tianzhen,

585
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,460
let's play something.

586
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,460
What?

587
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,260
Fight.

588
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,460
One less.

589
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,660
If only Master Hua and the others didn't leave,

590
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,860
they could be our partners.

591
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,660
Maybe we can also get rid of the horse.

592
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,660
That's right.

593
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,060
This is the right field.

594
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,060
I was standing for a while at the pool.

595
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,860
I scared my brother away.

596
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,260
There's nothing more important here, right?

597
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,860
Since it's like this,

598
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,460
let's go.

599
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,460
I want to do something

600
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,660
that's particularly meaningful.

601
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,260
I want to do something that's particularly meaningful.

602
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,660
I've searched everywhere.

603
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,660
There's no shadow.

604
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,860
The dead body is also not there.

605
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,060
There's a snake coming here.

606
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,860
This is the clothes I gave him.

607
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:29,860
Do you think the snake

608
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,260
has taken it away?

609
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,260
I don't know about others.

610
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,260
But Third Master didn't stop the snake

611
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,260
As long as we don't see the body, we don't have to worry too much

612
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,020
That's right

613
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,820
I was pitied by him for 20 years

614
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,060
I still understand this

615
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,100
Yes, yes

616
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,580
Third Master will definitely be brave

617
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,460
Two masters, let's go

618
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,260
Who knows if this snake will come back

619
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,780
Maybe he left first

620
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:51,900
Let's hurry up now

621
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,860
Maybe we can catch up

622
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,180
Yes, go

623
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,100
I don't even blink

624
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,500
Drip the water for 30 seconds

625
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,340
Is it fun?

626
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,180
Tianzhen, I'm not kidding

627
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,380
When this pot of water is full

628
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,180
We really have to go

629
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,540
Okay

630
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,780
I said you took this road

631
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,980
I didn't make a mistake, right?

632
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,580
If I didn't make a mistake

633
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,420
I would have left a mark on my shoes

634
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,780
No problem

635
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,900
They see these shrimp

636
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,260
They know this is from our care

637
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,940
Boring

638
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,740
You don't understand

639
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,540
Come here, come here, come here

640
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:24,900
Come here, come here

641
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:28,940
Are you done?

642
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,180
Oh

643
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,500
Oh, mom

644
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:37,780
Eat

645
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,760
We fed you

646
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,420
Have a good Spring Festival

647
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,060
You vomited

648
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,680
skinny

649
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,340
Ta군

650
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,700
After it becomes fun,

651
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,780
things are getting easier.

652
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:48,740
A night Hey06

653
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:53,540
A night Hey06

654
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,220
OK.

655
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,440
Everyone has his own way

656
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,060
Where did blueberries begin?

657
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,700
Up there I think.

658
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,100
Ok. We don't say.

659
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,860
Say that again.

660
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,180
Go for it again.

661
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,980
We don't say.

662
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:14,380
I don't know, don't ask my thoughts

663
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,640
Stop you guys.

664
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,520
Marco-arry.

665
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,640
Just the dream

666
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,720
Is it right?

667
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,180
Of course it's fine.

668
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,460
Justlao.

669
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,060
Look!

670
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,060
Are you here for the trip?

671
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,740
Hey young lady.

672
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,940
Don't get excited.

673
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,380
OK.

674
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,180
Cheers!

675
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,180
There are some theories

676
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,180
I don't know

677
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,180
The reason is that I need you

678
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,180
Three!

679
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,180
Two, three!

680
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,180
Master Fang, here

681
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,180
Okay, I'm sorry for not having enough rest

682
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,180
Ready, start!

683
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,180
Can you get me a drink?

684
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,180
Great, let's continue

685
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,180
What is this?

686
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,180
It's like you on this painting

687
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,180
Sorry, sorry

688
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,180
Let's go together

689
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,180
It's a desert and a rainforest

690
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,180
You said it's a desert and a rainforest

691
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,180
Let's go together

692
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,180
It's a desert and a rainforest

693
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,180
You said it's a desert and a rainforest

694
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,180
Let's go together

695
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,180
I'll go with you

696
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,180
I'll go with you

697
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,180
Let's go together

698
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,180
Look up!

699
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,180
I didn't expect that the new king

700
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,180
is so smart

701
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,180
I hope I can be a king

702
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,180
I want to say that

703
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,180
I'm lucky because of you

704
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,180
Let me understand

705
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,180
There are some theories

706
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,180
Hurry up!

707
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:37,180
The reason is that I need you

708
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,180
Listen

709
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,180
One more

710
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,180
Don't worry

711
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,180
Master Fang, you're so...

712
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,180
Let's go together

713
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,180
Let's go together

714
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,180
Okay, cut

715
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,180
One more

716
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,180
Okay, cut
