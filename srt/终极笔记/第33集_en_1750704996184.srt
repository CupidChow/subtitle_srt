I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

32

I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

38

I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:13,620
The

41
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,620
Do you want to take a break?

42
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,620
Study the map.

43
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,620
Everyone, take a break.

44
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,620
We will leave in half an hour.

45
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,620
Don't get too close to the rock. Be careful of the camel.

46
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,620
Okay.

47
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,620
I will go and handle some big matters.

48
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,620
Okay.

49
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,620
Su, it's the sky.

50
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,620
Help!

51
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,620
No, the camel!

52
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,620
No!

53
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,620
Don't let it die!

54
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,620
There's something here! Hurry, prepare to pull the rope!

55
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,620
Too many! This is not a way!

56
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,620
Hurry!

57
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,620
The equipment!

58
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,620
Xiao Ge!

59
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,620
Xiao Ge!

60
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,620
No!

61
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,620
The weapon!

62
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,620
Go!

63
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,620
The weapon!

64
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,620
We finally made it! We can go now!

65
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,620
How can we go through such a small hole?

66
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,620
Climb over!

67
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,620
I can't dig anymore.

68
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,620
I'm tired.

69
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,620
I'm tired.

70
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,620
You continue digging. I'll give you three heads of sheep.

71
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,620
Five heads?

72
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,620
Four heads. You can't have too many.

73
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,620
I can still collect the bones.

74
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,620
Okay, deal.

75
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,620
Old friend,

76
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,620
you're so cool.

77
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,620
There's still hair.

78
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,620
This passage doesn't look short.

79
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,620
Look carefully.

80
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,620
It's a long passage.

81
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,620
It's a long passage.

82
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,620
Look carefully.

83
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,620
There are some main characters in this passage.

84
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,620
This is a long passage.

85
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,620
The ancient text translated by Jingwan Hall

86
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,620
should have been moved from here.

87
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,620
That means

88
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,620
it's not something valuable.

89
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,620
It's just not valuable to them.

90
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,620
You said

91
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,620
how did the people of the Nine Devils go through?

92
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,620
Look at the bottom.

93
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,620
The peach tree is not broken.

94
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,620
They flew over.

95
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,620
These are too simple for them.

96
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,620
You come first. I'll come first.

97
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,620
I'll come first. I'll go give you a thunder.

98
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,620
You're not counting the accounts?

99
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,620
Look at this.

100
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,620
If I can come back alive,

101
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,620
we'll be even.

102
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,620
If I can't come back,

103
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,620
it's useless to have as many sheep as possible.

104
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,620
You owe me.

105
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,620
You can't pay me back in half an hour.

106
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,620
Besides,

107
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,620
with your look,

108
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,620
the King of Hell won't take you.

109
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,620
Yes.

110
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,620
A delicate person like you

111
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,620
must be taken care of by the King of Hell.

112
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,620
So I'll do it.

113
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,620
It's dark.

114
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,620
The peach tree here looks like the one they painted.

115
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,620
There may be a?

116
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,620
Let's go together.

117
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,620
We can't be together.

118
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,620
Let's go.

119
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,620
You're not thinking too much.

120
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,620
You're very relaxed.

121
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,620
Relax?

122
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,620
I'll take you in.

123
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,620
Okay.

124
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,620
Xiao Hua said that

125
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,620
the money is in the hands of the Xie family.

126
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,620
Let's settle the accounts with him.

127
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,620
Wait. There's something.

128
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,620
What?

129
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,620
No.

130
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,620
You're going to give me money?

131
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,620
Black-eyed.

132
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,620
Black-eyed.

133
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,620
Don't joke, okay?

134
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,620
Black-eyed.

135
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,620
No, I'll go and see.

136
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,620
It's the end.

137
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,620
Did you find the blind man?

138
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,620
I didn't see him.

139
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,620
Where is he?

140
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,620
There's something.

141
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,620
It's made of iron.

142
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,620
I don't know how to describe it.

143
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,620
What can't you describe?

144
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,620
It's big, short, long, round and thick.

145
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,620
A huge iron plate.

146
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,620
It's like a drum.

147
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,620
It's spinning on its own.

148
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,620
Xiao Hua, come out first.

149
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,620
Find a way to get me in.

150
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,620
Let's find Black-eyed together.

151
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,620
Wait.

152
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,620
What's wrong?

153
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,620
Xiao Hua.

154
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,620
Don't talk. Don't scare me.

155
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,620
Xiao Hua.

156
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,620
Xiao Hua.

157
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,620
Why don't you talk?

158
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,620
Don't scare me.

159
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,620
Xiao Hua.

160
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,620
The blind man is in trouble.

161
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,620
Find someone to help.

162
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,620
Okay, Mr. Xiao.

163
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,620
Find someone.

164
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,620
Xiao Hua.

165
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,620
Brother Fatty.

166
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,620
There's no way to the other side.

167
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,620
It's a wall.

168
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,620
Brother Xiao, give me the map.

169
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,620
Brother.

170
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,620
Is your map reliable?

171
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,620
Yes.

172
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,620
Look, there's a passage across the cliff.

173
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,620
It's very likely behind that wall.

174
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,620
It's impossible.

175
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,620
Since it's reliable.

176
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,620
Then which way?

177
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,620
I...

178
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,620
Xiao Hua.

179
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,620
Xiao Hua.

180
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,620
Xiao Hua.

181
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,620
Xiao Hua.

182
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,620
Xiao Hua.

183
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,620
You...

184
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,620
You...

185
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,620
Can you move?

186
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,620
Can you talk?

187
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,620
If you can't,

188
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,620
I'll go first.

189
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,620
Let's make it clear.

190
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,620
I won't move. You won't move.

191
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,620
That's it.

192
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,620
You...

193
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,620
Didn't you say you won't move?

194
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,620
You...

195
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,620
You...

196
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,620
You...

197
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,620
Mr. Fatty.

198
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,620
I just talked to everyone.

199
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,620
No one dared to go.

200
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,620
That's normal.

201
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,620
I'll go first.

202
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,620
How about this?

203
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,620
One on one.

204
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,620
Fair and reasonable.

205
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,620
Xiao Xiao.

206
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,620
We're a family.

207
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,620
We're a team.

208
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,620
Who didn't trust us?

209
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,620
Now you're going to be a team with us?

210
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,620
That's not impossible.

211
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,620
But I have one condition.

212
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,620
You have to listen to me.

213
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,620
The goods are ready.

214
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,620
We'll listen to you.

215
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,620
Okay.

216
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,620
Then we're a team.

217
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,620
I...

218
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,620
Mr. Fatty.

219
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,620
Let's go.

220
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,620
If you don't come out, we have no place in our hearts.

221
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,620
Your rope

222
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,620
is reliable.

223
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,620
It's reliable.

224
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,620
Look, this kind of rope

225
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,620
can't be broken.

226
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,620
Okay, okay.

227
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,620
What if it breaks?

228
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,620
Go, go, go.

229
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,620
Take it.

230
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,620
Okay.

231
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,620
I have to go out myself.

232
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,620
Take it.

233
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,620
Give it to me.

234
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,620
No.

235
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,620
Xiao Ge, what do you remember?

236
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,620
What do you remember?

237
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,620
What should we do?

238
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,620
You go.

239
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,620
Be careful.

240
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,620
Be careful.

241
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,620
Be careful.

242
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,620
Come on.

243
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,620
Xiao Hua.

244
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,620
Xiao Hua.

245
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,620
There's no way out.

246
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,620
Where did you go?

247
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,620
This should be the iron plate Xiao Hua said.

248
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,620
I'll hit you two.

249
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,620

252
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,620
Black eyes.

253
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,620
Is it you?

254
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,620
I'll hit you.

255
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,620
I'll hit you.

256
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,620
I'll hit you.

257
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,620
I'll hit you.

258
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,620
Go.

259
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,620
Go.

260
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,620
Be careful.

261
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,620
We're at the end of the bridge.

262
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,620
Be careful.

263
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,620
You want to kill me?

264
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,620
Okay, Master Fang.

265
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,620

00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,140
Xiao Ge, you really are a loser.

382
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,140
I told you to go.

383
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,140
What do we do now?

384
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,140
We're done for.

385
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,140
There's a hole over there.

386
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,140
We can't go in.

387
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,140
Boss, how long can we hold on to the rope?

388
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,140
We can save some time.

389
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,140
Let's hold on for a little longer.

390
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,140
How is it? Did you find the hole?

391
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,140
Boss, we haven't found it yet.

392
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,140
Where's the other one?

393
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,140
We haven't found it.

394
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,140
Why are you so badly hurt?

395
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,140
There's something very dangerous under the iron plate.

396
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,140
After I went in, I found the iron plate was open.

397
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,140
I went down to take a look.

398
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,140
What's wrong?

399
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,140
I'm fine.

400
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,140
There's another hole under the iron plate.

401
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,140
The black eye is probably down there.

402
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,140
I went down to look for it.

403
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,140
I didn't expect that I would lose my voice before I could tell you.

404
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,140
I can only go back up and turn off the iron plate.

405
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,140
Let's turn off the iron plate.

406
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,140
The black eye is locked inside, right?

407
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,140
Don't worry, Wu Xie.

408
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,140
He's fine.

409
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,140
He told us to go find him.

410
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,140
The other side.

411
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,140
Let's go.

412
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,140
Don't...

413
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,140
Don't look for me.

414
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,140
Even so, we still have to find him.

415
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:37,140
Wu Xie, if I can solve the following situation, he can solve it too.

416
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:42,140
But if he's in trouble, we can't do anything about it.

417
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,140
All right.

418
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,140
What about these things?

419
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,140
What are they?

420
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,140
Why are they stuck to your body?

421
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,140
It's a silk.

422
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,140
I think I was stuck to it when I was there.

423
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,140
But these things are very strange.

424
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,140
When I encounter blood, I get very excited.

425
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,140
I'm afraid that I'll wrap my whole body.

426
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,140
Then I found this iron dress.

427
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,140
The words of the blind are engraved on it.

428
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,140
I was thinking of putting on the iron dress and going out.

429
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,140
Then I saw you suddenly come in.

430
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,140
You still have the nerve to say that?

431
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,140
You almost scared me to death in this dress.

432
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,140
You blame me?

433
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,140
I'm so tired that I can't even understand the signal of the stick.

434
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,140
I wasted so much blood.

435
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,140
Who knows it's you?

436
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,140
Didn't I knock the code for you?

437
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,140
No, then you won't knock the night god dust in the bane?

438
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,140
I'll know as soon as I knock it.

439
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,140
By the way, Wu Xie.

440
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,140
The air in the space below the iron plate is not right.

441
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,140
It won't last long.

442
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,140
We have to find some men to get a blower.

443
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,140
Brother, what are you doing?

444
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,140
Climb over.

445
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,140
Climb over.

446
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,140
Sister, they're out.

447
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,140
Look, over there.

448
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,140
Great.

449
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,140
They're still alive.

450
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,140
Hurry up, go find them.

451
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,140
Sister, let's go.

452
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,140
Be careful.

453
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,140
Hurry up.

454
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,140
Hurry up.

455
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,140
Hurry up.

456
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,140
Sister, run.

457
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,140
Miss, we can't go back.

458
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,140
You're a waste of your life.

459
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,140
Let's go. Hurry up.

460
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,140
Hurry up.

461
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,140
Brother Pan, Brother Xiao.

462
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,140
Let's go over there.

463
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,140
You, go find the way.

464
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,140
Okay.

465
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,140
Pan,

466
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,140
Xiao, Xiao, Xiao.

467
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,140
You're still laughing.

468
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,140
What kind of map did you give them?

469
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,140
You almost killed us.

470
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,140
No, we've been following the map all the way.

471
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,140
It's not that bad.

472
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,140
Let me see.

473
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,140
That's right.

474
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,140
Look.

475
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,140
There's a passage in the cliff.

476
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,140
It's three-dimensional.

477
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,140
The map is flat.

478
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,140
This is solid.

479
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,140
Gao, what kind of machine is that?

480
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:24,140
The map shows where it's connected and where it's solid.

481
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,140
You can't tell where the top and bottom are.

482
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:31,140
This space is not behind the door opposite the bridge.

483
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,140
It's here.

484
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,140
You keep saying it's reliable.

485
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,140
If we all listen to you,

486
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,140
we'll be dead.

487
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,140
It's reliable.

488
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,140
Pan,

489
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,140
did you find anything on the cliff?

490
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,140
I saw Xiao's mark.

491
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,140
Does that mean it's dangerous?

492
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,140
It's not dangerous at all.

493
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,140
When I saw you last time,

494
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,140
I almost lost my life.

495
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,140
Xiao,

496
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,140
do you remember this place?

497
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,140
It's beautiful.

498
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,140
Pan,

499
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,140
what is this?

500
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,140
I don't know it.

501
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,140
A circle with a square.

502
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,140
I know it.

503
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,140
It was a coin.

504
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,140
What is a square with a circle?

505
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,140
It's a combination.

506
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,140
It's a long-range high-end.

507
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,140
It could be a symbol.

508
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:42,140
The location on the map should be solid.

509
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,140
What about the circle?

510
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,140
It's a spiral.

511
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,140
Where's my brother?

512
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:57,140
Your brother is here.

513
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,140
I asked you to come to take care of them.

514
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,140
Why didn't you save them?

515
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,140
How do you know I didn't save them?

516
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,140
If it weren't for Xiao,

517
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,140
I would have saved them.

518
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,140
Besides,

519
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,140
you care about your brother so much.

520
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,140
Why didn't you jump?

521
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,140
Huo San, it was an accident.

522
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,140
No one was killed.

523
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,140
Boss,

524
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,140
there's a spiral staircase ahead.

525
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,140
Isn't the spiral staircase

526
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,140
a spiral?

527
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,140
It's amazing.

528
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,140
If we go down the stairs,

529
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,140
we can find the square.

530
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,140
It could be a room.

531
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,140
Let's go and have a look.

532
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,140
Let's go.

533
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,140
Here.

534
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,140
I'll pick it for you.

535
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,140
Turn your head.

536
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,140
I had a mushroom when I was in the rain forest.

537
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,140
Do you think I'm afraid of this?

538
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,140
Wait.

539
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,140
I'll go.

540
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,140
Does it hurt?

541
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,140
You haven't started yet.

542
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,140
How much did you pay for the meal?

543
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,140
I finally know

544
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,140
why Boss Huo let me take you.

545
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,140
Why?

546
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,140
Because your blood is special.

547
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,140
The military silk on this peach leaf

548
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,140
didn't grow on you.

549
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,140
It didn't grow outwards,

550
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,140
but it ran outwards.

551
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,140
This thing is afraid of your blood.

552
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,140
Maybe it's because I've eaten the Qilin knot.

553
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,140
But Xiao Ge's blood is special.

554
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:52,140
Even the king of the stone wall has to go around it.

555
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,140
Your blood is a bit like Xiao Ge's.

556
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,140
Boss Huo's distribution is quite right.

557
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,140
The big mistake is the big one.

558
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,140
We use your little number here.

559
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,140
I'll open up all the wounds you have.

560
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,140
More?

561
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,140
Hurry up.

562
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,140
There's still a little left.

563
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,140
Be gentle.

564
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,140
It hurts.

565
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,140
Ah.

566
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,140
Ah.

567
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,140
Ah.

568
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,140
Xiao Ge, look.

569
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,140
There's still water here.

570
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:18,140
Master Pang, my map is very reliable.

571
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,140
You're so arrogant.

572
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,140
It's so cold here.

573
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,140
What is that?

574
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,140
Yun Luo!

575
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,140
Xiao Ge.

576
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,140
One, two, three!

577
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,140
Xiao Ge!

578
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,140
I can't do it anymore.

579
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,140
Again.

580
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,140
Brother Han.

581
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,140
There's no way to the other side of the wall.

582
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,140
It's like a wall.

583
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,140
Look at my picture.

584
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,140
Look.

585
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,140
There's a passage across the street.

586
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,140
It's very likely that it's on the other side of the wall.

587
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,140
No, it's not.

588
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,140
It's on the other side.

589
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,140
It's very likely that it's on the other side of the wall.

590
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,140
blurry

591
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,140
We're going.

592
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,180
You need to catch one more

593
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,440
Stop It it

594
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,440
I'm going to meet you again

595
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,440
I will meet you in the answer

596
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,440
My heart is clearly wounded

597
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,440
I will not regret

598
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,440
As long as you look, look, look

599
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,440
You are the language

600
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,440
As long as you look, look, look

601
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,440
You are the language
