Go away!

You're too much!

15
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,720
Did you see that?

16
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,720
The one who chased after our Jin Po is Chen Wenjin!

17
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,720
You must be mistaken!

18
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
How is that possible?

19
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,720
No, I'm not mistaken!

20
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,720
Fatty, my woman's body is so beautiful!

21
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
I'm not saying it's certain.

22
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,720
She's the one who's got the most beautiful body!

23
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,720
How did she get here from Kamut?

24
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,720
What is this place?

25
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:27,680
Isn't this inside the

26
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Guangxi?

27
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,720
You said he had been down there for a long time.

28
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,720
He could have fainted at the bottom of the lake or something happened.

29
00:03:39,720 --> 00:04:02,720
Is the oxygen out yet?

30
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,720
I think he's heading in the right direction and he's looking for the right thing.

31
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,720
What are you looking for?

32
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,720
More important than someone's life?

33
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
Take it easy, man.

34
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,720
I will send my men down for him before it's too late.

35
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,720
I'm not going to risk losing my partner.

36
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:29,720
How could I trust you now?

37
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,720
If you don't want your men to go down, then I'll go down by myself.

38
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,720
I'm not going to leave my friend in danger.

39
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,720
Understood?

40
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,720
He's my big boss.

41
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,720
I have to protect him.

42
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,720
Wait a minute, please.

43
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:30,720
What are you going to do?

44
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Steal the equipment.

45
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
Steal the equipment?

46
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
Steal what equipment?

47
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
How can we steal the equipment?

48
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,720
Don't you understand what it means to beg for the flower?

49
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,720
He's going to risk his life to find what he wants.

50
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,720
We're going to mess up his plan.

51
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,720
He's not going to give us the equipment to save us.

52
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,720
It's not that simple.

53
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
There are a lot of people who are willing to beg for the flower.

54
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,720
If he's determined to stop us from going down,

55
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
then we can steal the equipment.

56
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,720
We can't beat them.

57
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
We can steal it.

58
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,720
I can't just leave it to the devil.

59
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
I'm the one who took the money.

60
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,720
I have to take care of your life.

61
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,720
You want to stop me?

62
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:25,720
Can I stop you?

63
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Listen to me first.

64
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,720
How could I let Wu Xie get in trouble in front of me?

65
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,720
I have to find him a second uncle to pay the fine.

66
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Take it away.

67
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,720
I can understand your mood, but you can't be impulsive.

68
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,720
You don't want to think about how many people are begging for the flower.

69
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,720
If we really do something, we're going to suffer losses.

70
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
What do you mean?

71
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,720
What I mean is...

72
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,720
Wait a minute.

73
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:07,720
I heard that the Gormu nursing home was built according to the structure of Zhangjia Gulu.

74
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Then the video tape I received was taken in Gormu or here?

75
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,720
The quality of this door is reliable.

76
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,720
I won't rush you.

77
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
Go.

78
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Don't even think about Gormu or Moerhe.

79
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Go!

80
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
I told you to go to the middle!

81
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:49,720
Go!

82
00:07:49,720 --> 00:08:04,720
It's really Chen Wenjing.

83
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,720
Why is Aunt Wenjing here?

84
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,720
When did she come out of the tomb?

85
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Or...

86
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,720
This smell is so familiar.

87
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Does it taste the same as the smell on my body?

88
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:28,720
This smell means that soon I will also start to change.

89
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,720
My body will be able to survive this death.

90
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:40,720
I will become a monster from living.

91
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,720
She also changed.

92
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,720
Then we arrived here.

93
00:08:47,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Let's go.

94
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,720
As expected, the black coffin is also here.

95
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
As expected.

96
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,720
You should have known that there is a coffin here.

97
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:32,720
This place is exactly the same as the Gormu nursing home.

98
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Jinzhen, you're going to die!

99
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
There may be another coffin there!

100
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,720
Who are you?

101
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:17,720
Brother, why did Tianzhen talk to Jinbo?

102
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,720
Uncle Huo, who am I?

103
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,720
Wu Xie, you are not pure in this world.

104
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,720
Not pure, you are dead.

105
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,720
Wu Xie!

106
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,720
Wu Xie!

107
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Tianzhen, why does Jinbo look exactly like you?

108
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,720
And it's gone after a search!

109
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,720
Who am I?

110
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,720
This place is not right. Let's go.

111
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:11,720
Go.

112
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,720
I've been to this room before.

113
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:32,720
I found Chen Wenjin's handwriting in the same room as this one.

114
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
How could this be?

115
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:44,720
Chen Wenjin wrote two letters, and they are divided into two parts.

116
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,720
I don't know which one of you is among the three.

117
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,720
No matter who you are, when you come here and find the handwriting...

118
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,720
I believe you are involved in it.

119
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Is it the same?

120
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,720
In fact, the Gormu nursing home was built according to the structure here.

121
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,720
There is no reason for the handwriting on the notebook to be the same.

122
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
It's not clear.

123
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Think about it.

124
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,720
How many things have we explained along the way?

125
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,720
Someone is here.

126
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,720
Ourself!

127
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,720
You are here.

128
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,720
Grandpa Hua is here.

129
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
We are tense.

130
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:50,720
No idea.

131
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,720
Let's get out of here.

132
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
Can you tell it by yourself?

133
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,520
Enough, stop joking. Let's get down to business.

134
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,040
That old man, Qiu De Kao, finally confessed.

135
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,660
He wanted to find that thing in a black coffin.

136
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,600
Could it be that old man has been lying to me?

137
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,000
He's just pouring me some honey soup and asking me to come down alone.

138
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,840
What on earth is he after?

139
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,360
What do you care?

140
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,700
Brother Qiao and Fatty have found it. Let's take the things outside.

141
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,880
Go back and explain to Qiu De Kao. One pat, two scatter, one split, two split.

142
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,080
That thing is outside. Let's go and have a look.

143
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,720
Let's go.

144
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,940
It's the thing in this coffin.

145
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,880
I've been looking for it for decades.

146
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,880
Then let's open it and see.

147
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,600
We have to examine the good stuff first.

148
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,960
Don't send it out in a foolish way.

149
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,760
Tianzhen, don't move.

150
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,920
If you open the coffin, something will definitely happen.

151
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,640
Come on, brothers, let's shake hands.

152
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
Now!

153
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,160
Now!

154
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,380
No!

155
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
Next!

156
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,160
Come on!

157
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,720
You should come up

158
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,320
You are in good position

159
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,780
Thank you

160
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,480
Kings, you guys are rude

161
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,880
Take over

162
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,980
The mask of the fox with the iron face in the tomb

163
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,380
This is what I've been looking for for a long time

164
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,780
I really don't understand what the relationship between this and longevity

165
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,180
I had a hallucination when I was wearing it

166
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,760
I almost killed you

167
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,760
You almost killed me

168
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,760
Let go

169
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Come on, see if I've got longevity

170
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,100
Come on, catch me

171
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,200
I can't

172
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,460
Any offensive

173
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,580
One penny

174
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,380
One coin

175
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
großer

176
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,560
A rascal

177
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,580
A horror

178
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,220
NoHeaven

179
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,000
Do you understand now

180
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,860
Have this mask

181
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,860
Take off your mask!

182
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,860
Yes, sir!

183
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,860
I told you,

184
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,860
it's not good to see this fox mask.

185
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,860
Look at me, you bastard!

186
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,860
I just felt something wrong.

187
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,860
There can't be two Chen Wenjin's notes.

188
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,860
Even if it's done,

189
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,860
it can't be exactly the same.

190
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,860
Since Chen Wenjin has already been in prison,

191
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,860
it's impossible to become Jin Po.

192
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,860
It's impossible to appear here.

193
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,860
So, Xiao Hua and the black eyed man

194
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,860
have never appeared.

195
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,860
We are already in the illusion.

196
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,860
Illusion?

197
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,860
Then you've already found it.

198
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,860
No wonder I was talking to you just now.

199
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,860
I think you're not right.

200
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,860
You asked me what's in the coffin.

201
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,860
I deliberately said a bronze fox mask.

202
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,860
I didn't expect this mask to really appear inside.

203
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,860
You said,

204
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,860
we can see whatever we want.

205
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,860
It's really an illusion.

206
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,860
When did you start to enter the illusion?

207
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,860
From the moment Xiao Hua and the black eyed man appeared,

208
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,860
we are already in the illusion.

209
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,860
Hold it.

210
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,860
Just now,

211
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,860
Qiu Degao found me.

212
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,860
He said,

213
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,860
I should kidnap you,

214
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,860
and not let you go into the water.

215
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,860
I'm such a kind person.

216
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,860
How is that possible?

217
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,860
So,

218
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,860
I pretended to promise him.

219
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,860
Then,

220
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,860
while he's relaxing his body,

221
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,860
we'll go steal the equipment.

222
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,860
After that,

223
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,860
I'll go into the water with you.

224
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,860
You say this.

225
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,860
Is it perfect?

226
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,860
Come on,

227
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,860
let's fight.

228
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,860
I said,

229
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,860
are you sure?

230
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,860
Of course.

231
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,860
How smart Qiu Degao is.

232
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,860
I made this rope for you.

233
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,860
It's made of your shank.

234
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,860
Can you believe it without pushing it?

235
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,860
It's almost done.

236
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,860
Let's go steal the car.

237
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,860
Wu Xie has been in the water for too long.

238
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,860
We can't delay it any longer.

239
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,860
Let's wait a bit.

240
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,860
Is it tied?

241
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,860
It's all tied.

242
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,860
Don't worry.

243
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,860
Your boss paid a lot.

244
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,860
You can't spend this money for nothing.

245
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,860
Here.

246
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,860
Thank you.

247
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,860
You're really something.

248
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,860
Now you're a member of Qiu Degao.

249
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,860
You can really make money for anyone.

250
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,860
It's not easy for me to break the law of life.

251
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,860
Here, eat.

252
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,860
Here.

253
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,860
You lied to me with all your might.

254
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,860
Is it necessary?

255
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,860
My new employer Qiu Degao

256
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,860
spent money to take care of you.

257
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,860
He didn't want us to go into the water.

258
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,860
Do you think he did it for our safety?

259
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,860
He's a good man.

260
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,860
He's a good man.

261
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,860
He's a good man.

262
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,860
He's a good man.

263
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,860
He's a good man.

264
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,860
Is he doing it for our safety?

265
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,860
No.

266
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,860
He's afraid that we'll disrupt his plan to find Zhang's share.

267
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,860
If we force ourselves into the water,

268
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,860
he'll definitely stop us.

269
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,860
If that's the case,

270
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,860
why don't we take a break here?

271
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,860
We can make money.

272
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,860
I'm entrusted by my new employer Qiu Degao

273
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,860
to negotiate with you.

274
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,860
As long as you don't disrupt his plan,

275
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,860
he'll give you whatever you want as a reward.

276
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,860
What?

277
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,860
My new employer Qiu Degao said

278
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,860
that he'll give you the money

279
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,860
after the mission is completed

280
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,860
or after it's completely failed.

281
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,860
My old employer Wu Erye

282
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,860
also spent money to protect you.

283
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,860
So, whether it's my new employer

284
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,860
or my old employer,

285
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,860
I can't let you go.

286
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,860
Have you ever thought

287
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,860
that your so-called new employer

288
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,860
doesn't care about our life?

289
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,860
How can he care about Wu Xie's life?

290
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,860
My new employer doesn't care about it.

291
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,860
How can my old employer not care about it?

292
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,860
Wu Erye will definitely not let anything happen to Wu Xie.

293
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,860
Don't forget that I'm also your employer.

294
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,860
Yes, Mr. Xie.

295
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,860
I've safely sent you to Guangxi.

296
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,860
Your order has been completed.

297
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,860
I'm leaving.

298
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,860
The illusion should start from here.

299
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,860
Someone is here.

300
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,860
It's my own people.

301
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,860
Dark eyes?

302
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,860
You're really here.

303
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,860
Grandpa Hua is here.

304
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,860
You're so amazing.

305
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,860
We came here according to your location.

306
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,860
We found the mark of Xiao Ge along the way.

307
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,860
You're really here.

308
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,860
Xiao Ge's mark,

309
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,860
the dark eyes of Xiao Hua,

310
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,860
are impossible to know.

311
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,860
So, the four of them

312
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,860
don't exist.

313
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,860
When should I

314
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,860
enter the environment?

315
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,860
I'm a master of construction.

316
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,860
The gravity is impossible to be absent.

317
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,860
In the same space,

318
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,860
the double gravity is impossible to appear.

319
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,860
The single gravity is impossible to appear.

320
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,860
We can't live in water.

321
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,860
I've been in the illusion

322
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,860
since Xiao Ge appeared.

323
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:19,700
the

324
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:48,560
I shouldn't have appeared in Zhang's

325
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:59,120
Yes, when I came in, I did hear the bell

326
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,520
will

327
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
No.

328
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,000
Boss, Wu Xie's signal is moving again.

329
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,720
Look!

330
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,440
Wu Xie, can you hear me?

331
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,480
Your oxygen is almost gone, come up!

332
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,280
It's coming up!

333
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,440
Wu Xie, can you hear me?

334
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,440
Your oxygen is almost gone, come up!

335
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
Wu Xie, can you hear me?

336
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
Wu Xie, can you hear me?

337
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,440
Wu Xie, can you hear me?

338
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
Wu Xie, can you hear me?

339
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
Wu Xie, can you hear me?

340
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
Wu Xie, can you hear me?

341
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
Wu Xie, can you hear me?

342
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
Wu Xie, can you hear me?

343
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
Wu Xie, can you hear me?

344
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
Wu Xie, can you hear me?

345
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,440
Wu Xie, can you hear me?

346
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
Wu Xie, can you hear me?

347
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
Wu Xie, can you hear me?

348
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,360
Wu Xie, what are you doing?

349
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,360
Come up!

350
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,360
I found them!

351
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,360
I can't go up yet!

352
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,360
Xiao Ge and Fatty are waiting for me!

353
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
Take them home!

354
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,360
Wu Xie!

355
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,360
Wu Xie!

356
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,360
Wu Xie!

357
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,360
Wu Xie!

358
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,360
Wu Xie!

359
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,360
Boss, he's gone through the siphon.

360
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,360
He's crazy!

361
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,360
Now we've lost Wu Xie again.

362
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,360
Wu Xie disappeared again.

363
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,360
You still won't let me go down?

364
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,360
You stupid!

365
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,360
Wu Xie is in danger this time!

366
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,360
You don't care?

367
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,360
You're not going to let me go down?

368
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,360
You're not going to let me go down?

369
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,360
I'm going down.

370
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,360
Where is he?

371
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,360
I'm coming.

372
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,360
Wait for me.

373
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,800
Zhe col de Bothnia

374
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,800
I'm so tired being an actor.

375
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
I can't like it.

376
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
You're too into Dragon Ball!

377
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,800
I'm so tired.

378
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
But...

379
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
But if it's like this,

380
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
I'll lose a lot of money.

381
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
You'll lose money if you go to Wu Xie.

382
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,800
If Wu Xie doesn't give you money, you'll just go to me.

383
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
If you say so,

384
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
I'm relieved.

385
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Let's talk.

386
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
What should we do next?

387
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
This lake

388
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
is at least 70 meters long.

389
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
If we jump straight down,

390
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
we'll die in the same area.

391
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
There are not many people who can get the test.

392
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
Let's borrow two from him.

393
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
Steal?

394
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
Don't be so polite.

395
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
Do you know where his equipment is?

396
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
I'm just a temporary worker.

397
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,800
How could I know such an important thing?

398
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
I've observed his camp.

399
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,800
These tents have high defense.

400
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Such important equipment

401
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
must be hidden in a certain tent.

402
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
There are so many tents.

403
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800
Everyone has someone to hold them.

404
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
If you find one,

405
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,800
you'll be dead.

406
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
I've tried so many ways, but I can't do it.

407
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
Brother,

408
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,800
why don't you try

409
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,800
the one in the fairy tale?

410
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
I was scared to death.

411
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
I was scared to death.

412
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
I was scared to death.

413
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
I was scared to death.

414
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Wu Xie.

415
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Wu Xie, what are you doing?

416
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Don't be naive.

417
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
It's not a fantasy.

418
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,800
I've never seen you so embarrassed.

419
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
So it's definitely not a fantasy.

420
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
If you come two days later,

421
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
we'll be in a fantasy.

422
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
I see.

423
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Zhang's Mansion

424
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,800
can't go in from above.

425
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
This is the real entrance.

426
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,800
What are you talking about?

427
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
What mansion? What entrance?

428
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Didn't you see it when you came down?

429
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
It's at the bottom of the lake.

430
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
There's a Chinese-style mansion

431
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
with the name Zhang's Mansion.

432
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
But it's all bronze.

433
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
I went in and fell into the fantasy.

434
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
I almost died in it.

435
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Why are you getting more and more confused?

436
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,800
You said there was a ancient building in the lake?

437
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
Yes.

438
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
I was so shy

439
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
that I found a map of Zhang's Mansion.

440
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
The map marked

441
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,800
all the positions of Zhang's Mansion.

442
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
This is one of them.

443
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
Brother,

444
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,800
this is your hometown.

445
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Do you remember this?

446
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Do you remember your childhood?

447
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
You haven't answered me yet.

448
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
You haven't answered me yet.

449
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Did you really not see the ancient building?

450
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
No.

451
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
Then how did you get in?

452
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
Well,

453
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,800
here's the thing.

454
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
When I was waiting for you,

455
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
Brother and I were free and had nothing to do.

456
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
We went to the bottom of the lake

457
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:44,540
to search for the broken

458
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,540
and I was hungry.

459
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,540
I had to eat fish.

460
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,800
You know, I'm a good man.

461
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
I went down to fish for him.

462
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
While fishing,

463
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
I met Hongxi.

464
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
I was here

465
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
when I opened my eyes.

466
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
So you fell down?

467
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
You have good equipment.

468
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Who gave it to you?

469
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,800
You are so amazing.

470
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
I'm not a man.

471
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
I'm a man.

472
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,800
I'm a man.

473
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,800
I'm a man.

474
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Hee,Wan.

475
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
Hey.

476
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
Bye neighborhoods.

477
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
See who the cause is.

478
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
What if she been亡.

479
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Filthy bike.

480
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
Listen,

481
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
one more.

482
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Get out of my way.

483
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
Like we're not partners.

484
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
Right,

485
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,960
Let me talk to you!

486
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,060
Looks like it is me

487
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,540
Well, welcome

488
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,100
I'm a certain securities準備

489
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,660
I want to get up the knee

490
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,700
And I'll show you vane

491
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,060
A vane?

492
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,060
I'll give you some space to do it.

493
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,060
I didn't expect so many things to happen

494
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,060
while we were leaving.

495
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,060
If you disappear,

496
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,060
will Qiu Dakao send someone to find you?

497
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,060
If they come down,

498
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,060
they will see Zhangjiagu Building first.

499
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,060
If nothing happens, they will go in directly.

500
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:50,060
Then they will meet Six-Footed Tonglin.

501
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,060
And then, like me,

502
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,060
they will be trapped.

503
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,060
Six-Footed Tonglin of Qinling?

504
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,060
Tonglin?

505
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,060
That's a perfect defense mechanism.

506
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,060
What do you mean by Zhangjiagu Building?

507
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,060
I don't know the full name.

508
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,060
Only the top two floors are in the lake.

509
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,060
It's probably the appearance of the Han's Gu Building.

510
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,060
But the rest of the parts are probably buried in the lake.

511
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,060
The lake is on the top of the mountain.

512
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,060
Zhangjiagu Building is at the bottom of the lake.

513
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,060
So the main building should be in the mountain.

514
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,060
So I guess

515
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,060
to enter Zhangjiagu Building,

516
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,060
we must go through Hongxi and enter from the mountain.

517
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,060
I really didn't expect

518
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,060
that Zhangjiagu Building was designed so well.

519
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,060
Hongxi?

520
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,060
You mean

521
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,060
we can enter Zhangjiagu Building from here?

522
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,060
What else?

523
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,060
No.

524
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,060
No?

525
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,060
We've been here for so long.

526
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,060
If we can enter Hongxi,

527
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,060
we would have already entered.

528
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,060
You mean

529
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,060
this is also a dead end?

530
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,060
It's not as bad as a dead end.

531
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,060
At least there is an entrance.

532
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,060
There is only one water pipe here.

533
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,060
How did you get the fish?

534
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,060
From this water pipe.

535
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,060
But it's really hard for us to find this.

536
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,060
Let's turn left.

537
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,060
Ooh.

538
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,060
Another gasparts.

539
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,060
This one?

540
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,060
Anything we can use.

541
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,060
Are you sure?

542
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,060
I want to see this one.

543
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,060
Adjustable for this.

544
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,060
It'll be nice.

545
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:02,060
It looks cool.

546
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,060
He can move by himself.

547
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,060
Not really seen today.

548
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,060
Maybe he has room here?

549
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:12,060
Even if you escape from the bell town and get caught by Hongxi,

550
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:16,060
you will still die if you touch these mechanisms.

551
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:26,060
Hey, Brother Qiao, what treasure did your family hide in the ground?

552
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,060
There are so many mechanisms.

553
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,060
This is your home.

554
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,060
Think about it.

555
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,060
I'm such a kind person.

556
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,060
How can you do this to me?

557
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,060
Of course, there's a need for that.

558
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,060
This is the self-improvement of an actor.

559
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,060
I'm not an actor, I'm a singer.

560
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,060
You have a full set of equipment.

561
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,060
And a signal gun.

562
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:28,060
Haven't you ever thought about opening the water mouth?

563
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,060
Stop dreaming.

564
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,060
We've thought about everything you can think of.

565
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,840
This is a

566
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,060
human power.

567
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,060
Is this stone in the corridor?

568
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,060
Not in the living room.

569
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,060
Living room?

570
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,060
We are waiting for you in the hall.

571
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,060
The living room is over there.

572
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,060
Here.

573
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,060
How is it, Tianzhen?

574
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,060
You're warm now, right?

575
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,060
Tianzhen, your arrival is very meaningful.

576
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,060
The most meaningful thing is that

577
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,060
someone finally talks to me.

578
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,060
You know, Xiao Ge can't say a word in a day.

579
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,060
I'm almost sick of it.

580
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,060
Uncle, are these jade?

581
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,060
At least it's not like this.

582
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,060
When I first came here,

583
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,060
I thought I made a big mistake.

584
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,060
Such a big jade mine.

585
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:43,060
I'm going to be rich from now on.

586
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,060
Two rings, one mile.

587
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,060
Three four-hole courtyards.

588
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,060
You have a small black set, I have a set.

589
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,060
Take the clouds to Beijing.

590
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,060
Buy whatever you want.

591
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,060
I have money.

592
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,060
I said you would die if you talk less.

593
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,060
What's that sound?

594
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,060
No sound.

595
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,060
No sound, you heard it wrong. Come here.

596
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,060
Sit down, it's late.

597
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,060
Listen to me.

598
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,060
When I first came here,

599
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:15,060
I thought of all kinds of ways to spend money.

600
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,060
But such a big jade mine,

601
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,060
I can see it,

602
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,060
I can't move it.

603
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,060
I'm so worried.

604
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,060
I'm so worried.

605
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,060
Don't dream about it.

606
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:34,060
We should think about what to do.

607
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,060
This place is built by man.

608
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,060
It means there is no real secret space.

609
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,060
Otherwise, those people can't get in.

610
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,060
There seems to be a thorn under it.

611
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,060
It's dangerous.

612
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,060
What's dangerous?

613
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,060
What else can it be?

614
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,060
It must be our current situation.

615
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,060
We have nothing to eat and drink.

616
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,060
Look at me, I'm fat.

617
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,060
I have to stay here for a few days.

618
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,060
I'm not that slim.

619
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,060
Isn't it dangerous?

620
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,060
Not this.

621
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,060
What's that?

622
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,060
It's a black set.

623
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,060
It's a black set.

624
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,060
It's a black set.

625
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,060
OK, I'll check it out.

626
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,060
OK.

627
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,060
All right.

628
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,060
All right.

629
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,060
Thank you.

630
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,060
There's nothing in it.

631
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,060
I'm very tasty.

632
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,060
Have you tried the tea?

633
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,060
Try it, have a try.

634
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,060
I'm very tasty.

635
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,060
Do you need a stick?

636
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,840
She's not here.

637
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,280
Are you trying to put an end to something?

638
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,560
I just want to get back to my reality.

639
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,360
This game is over.

640
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,700
I want you to之 wary of foolish things.

641
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,840
I am going home,

642
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
where you don't want me to be loved and to forget you.

643
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,440
No.

644
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,120
I'm already sick.

645
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,640
I'm entirely alone.

646
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,560
Will you ever forgive me?

647
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:17,880
No.

648
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:18,840
No.

649
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,900
One more?

650
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,420
Section Chief Ganqing has been under rain's1

651
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,300
Sister, why is rain so CSS shifting?

652
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,660
Rain is 좋 similar to the seed of sunshine

653
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,360
No wonder rain is strong

654
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,660
He can fly

655
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,940
Hejin, stepped up

656
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:58,960
So difficult to use automatic

657
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:05,600
He got furniture

658
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,080
So many level Lilies

659
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,140
Otherwise it's an automatic Americans

660
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,240
B had to go jot all the numbers

661
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,240
Can't finish

662
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,140
Literally just Department of Invest Christmas

663
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,140
Listen to me

664
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,420
To protect this family

665
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,380
my everything

666
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,380
What?

667
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,380
That big beast

668
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,500
is that giant beast

669
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,140
Do you mean that huge ha Creature

670
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,980
that never Rohan

671
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,380
was able to take Dylan

672
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,980
As soon as the tree changed shape

673
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,820
you asked them

674
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,900
what their plans were

675
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,900
That big Jerk

676
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,620
I've been screaming for a long time.

677
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,620
No one cares about me.

678
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,660
My throat is hoarse.

679
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,180
Listen.

680
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,420
When did he run away?

681
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,540
Well...

682
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,340
Just now.

683
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,340
I thought he ran away after he disappeared.

684
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,180
You're so skilled.

685
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,460
You can't beat a tied-up man.

686
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,980
It's not my fault.

687
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,340
Although I'm skilled,

688
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,340
I'm a man of three levels.

689
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,940
I went to the toilet just now.

690
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,740
Before I left,

691
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,940
I told you a thousand times to keep an eye on me.

692
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,460
But...

693
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,460
I'm so lucky to be back.

694
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,460
If my lord is going to save Wu Xie,

695
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,460
he won't do it alone.

696
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,460
Go and check the equipment.

697
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,460
Yes.

698
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,460
Come with me.

699
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,460
Come on!

700
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,460
Open the door!

701
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,460
This is the place.

702
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,460
This is the place.

703
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,460
This is the place.

704
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,460
I'm going to kill you!

705
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,460
How can I be with him?

706
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,460
Let's do it again.

707
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,460
Again.

708
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,460
How can we steal the equipment?

709
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,460
You don't understand.

710
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,460
Okay, okay.

711
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,460
One, two, three, go!

712
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,460
Go!

713
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,460
It's really him.

714
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,460
Chen Wenjie.

715
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,460
I told you I was going to the basement.

716
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,460
This room is for you.

717
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,460
You're in the same room as this one.

718
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,460
Look, Chen Wenjie wrote two books.

719
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,460
You mean this is Chen Wenjie?

720
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,460
You mean this is Chen Wenjie?

721
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,460
One, two, three, go!

722
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,460
Go!

723
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,460
It's him.

724
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,460
One, two, three, go!

725
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,460
It's him.

726
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,460
Go!

727
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,460
Go!

728
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,460
Hurry up!

729
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,460
Hurry up!

730
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,460
Go!

731
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,460
My new host said

732
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,460
no, we have to wait until

733
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:59,460
Okay, come on.

734
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,460
I'll call you.

735
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:18,460
I know, it's not clear

736
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:25,460
The reason is that you need to listen

737
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,460
Xiaoba

738
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,460
You love the idol group, right?

739
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,460
What time is it?

740
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,460
You still won't agree?

741
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:37,460
I promise you.

742
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,460
I promise you.

743
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,460
I promise you everything.
