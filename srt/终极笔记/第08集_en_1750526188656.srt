1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Pick a leaf and pull it

3
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Tang Zi, come and help

4
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm busy

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's raining so hard

6
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Stop being so stubborn

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Are you trying to raise me?

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm really raising you

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm done

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
My butt is itchy

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Should I take a shower?

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Stop it, okay?

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I feel itchy when I look at you

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I really feel itchy

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Get up

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh my god

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Be careful

18
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's useless to move

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Let's find a place to deal with the bugs

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
There are at least two or three hundred layers of stairs

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If you don't have enough strength

22
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You can't be a guest to the Queen Mother

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I have to take a break

24
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Eat something, you'll be better

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're so naughty

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You're really not particular about what you say

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't believe in ghosts

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I believe in myself

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're quite interesting

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Although I can live until now

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't have any credit for you

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But for the sake of you being my guide dog

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll treat you to dinner when we get back

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Treat me to dinner?

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're naughty

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How much is the fried rice with green pepper and shredded pork?

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's boring to eat this

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay, when we get back

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'll invest in a food factory

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And I'll produce the special snacks for you

42
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't say that

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
After we get back

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We'll be far apart if you say that

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Didn't you say you have no money?

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Why are you so timid now?

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I eat more salt than you eat rice

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So I have no money

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You young man

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Don't talk nonsense

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What's going on in here?

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No, I...

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What are you doing?

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This...

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:56,980
There's something malicious

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Forget it.

58
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,120
I'll do it first.

59
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
I'll do it first.

60
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
So fast.

61
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
Run!

62
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Run!

63
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
This tree has no seeds.

64
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,960
This fish can't stop for a while.

65
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
Let's fight here.

66
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Come on.

67
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,640
That tree has been cut by the worm.

68
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
What a bad luck.

69
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,240
This thing will find a place.

70
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,440
Still itchy?

71
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Yes.

72
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
Xiao Ge.

73
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
Where are you going?

74
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Go to find it.

75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
An Ning.

76
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,120
Do you think this worm has poison?

77
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
You.

78
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
Take off your pants.

79
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
What do you want to do?

80
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,920
What do you want to do?

81
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,720
She is still a child.

82
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,400
This thing is a grasshopper.

83
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,960
It's troublesome to be bitten by them.

84
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,360
But you two

85
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,080
should be more serious than me.

86
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
OK.

87
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
Don't be stubborn.

88
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
If you don't want to sleep in the future,

89
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,080
take off your pants.

90
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,200
When she gets into the closet,

91
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,680
her life will be over.

92
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
I'll handle it myself.

93
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Let's handle it together.

94
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,080
Come on.

95
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
It's a man.

96
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
Only one floor left.

97
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
Do you dare to compete with me again?

98
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,080
What?

99
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,080
Run faster.

100
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
What about the loser?

101
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
These are not important.

102
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
You have to win.

103
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
Hurry up.

104
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
Hurry up.

105
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
I can't stand it anymore.

106
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,080
What's wrong with you?

107
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,080
Be quiet.

108
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,080
Why are there so many?

109
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
This is too much.

110
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
When I was turning over the stone,

111
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
I accidentally made a hole in my pants.

112
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
I was still feeling cool.

113
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,080
I forgot to check it when I entered the mountain.

114
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
Stop talking nonsense. Hurry up.

115
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,080
There are more worms on the butt than the waist.

116
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
This kind of worm

117
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
is very dangerous.

118
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
It's very dangerous.

119
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
It's dangerous.

120
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,080
It's dangerous.

121
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,080
It's dangerous.

122
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
It's dangerous.

123
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
It's dangerous.

124
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
It's dangerous.

125
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
It can suck blood for two or three days.

126
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,080
It can take six or seven times of its own.

127
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
Hurry up.

128
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
I'll start.

129
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
Wait.

130
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
Do you know how to do it?

131
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Just dig it directly.

132
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
No.

133
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
Fortunately, I asked you.

134
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Otherwise, it would be in your hands.

135
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Take it.

136
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,080
You have to heat the knife first.

137
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,080
Then, use the knife to burn the worm.

138
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
Don't pull it directly.

139
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
If you leave the worm's head inside,

140
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
it will be infected.

141
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
Hurry up.

142
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
You have to be careful.

143
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,080
Okay, fatso.

144
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
It's my turn.

145
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Hurry up.

146
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
Naive.

147
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
Don't do it.

148
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
You are not gentle to me at all.

149
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
I have so many grasshoppers.

150
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
I have to help you.

151
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
Can I be gentle?

152
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
I'm not gentle.

153
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
I'm not gentle.

154
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
I'm not gentle.

155
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
I'm not gentle.

156
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Can I be gentle?

157
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
Okay.

158
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
Hurry up.

159
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
Take off your pants.

160
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,080
Tianzhen.

161
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,080
Your worm's life conditions are not good.

162
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,080
It's a little dry.

163
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
Why don't you feed it more?

164
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
Fatso, if you keep talking nonsense, I'll...

165
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
Mr. Huang.

166
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080
I...

167
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
I owe you a favor.

168
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,080
Next time, I'll give you a discount.

169
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,080
No need.

170
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
You saved me.

171
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,080
Don't say these useless nonsense.

172
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
This slope is too steep.

173
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
Why can't we go down?

174
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
We are trapped here.

175
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
There must be other ways.

176
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
There must be other ways.

177
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,080
Or we can let these steps restore.

178
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,080
Otherwise, how can we get through Wu Sanjing?

179
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
Yes.

180
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,080
Let's find it again.

181
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Hurry up.

182
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
Slow down.

183
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
Slow down.

184
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Min, it looks so smooth.

185
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
You are back, Mr. Huang?

186
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,080
Mr. Tong.

187
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
Do not touch me.

188
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,080
If you keep coming back, don't blame me.

189
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,080
This is 19,000 yuan.

190
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,080
even the King of the Ten-House was afraid of him

191
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,080
Don't look at me as a loser

192
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
The key moment is really close

193
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,080
Let's be alert

194
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,080
Don't underestimate me

195
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
When I was doing projects in Africa

196
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,080
I saw a long-distance road

197
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,080
and died in this thing

198
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,080
It was covered with blood

199
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,080
It was very scary

200
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
Good guy

201
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,080
So that grass-nosed man came from Africa

202
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,080
He could run better than a human or a bird

203
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
It's stopped raining

204
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Let's spend the night here tonight

205
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
Little Three Eyes

206
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
If it wasn't seen by your own eyes

207
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,080
I don't believe it

208
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,080
There will be such a big rain forest in the desert

209
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,080
In fact, the whole desert is a big basin

210
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
This is the lowest point of the basin

211
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,080
All the rainwater and groundwater

212
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
Will be collected here

213
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
To feed this rain forest

214
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
And make the surrounding mountains and mountains

215
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
A lot of plants grow

216
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,080
This scene is what the ancients said

217
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,080
Hide the wind and water without moving

218
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
It's also what the ancients said

219
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
The wind and water are full

220
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
The wind and water are full

221
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
This West King Demon King really knows how to find a place

222
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,080
Wu Sanxing, this old guy, what are you doing?

223
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,080
When you need him most

224
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
Don't give any hints

225
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
Okay, don't worry

226
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
Still that sentence

227
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,080
If you come, you settle

228
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
We've been tossing around for a long time

229
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
Let's take a break

230
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,080
Don't say it looks like this

231
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
There is a different scenery

232
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,080
Where is Xiao Ge?

233
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,080
Xiao Ge is gone again

234
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,080
No, he's there

235
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,080
Xiao Ge is always a slip of the tongue

236
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,080
It's really easy to make people feel sick

237
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
Xiao Ge is like this

238
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,080
He has only one world

239
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,080
So there is no need to explain to others

240
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
You go to sleep again

241
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
I'll go see him

242
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,080
Xiao Ge, what are you doing?

243
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Xiao Ge, what did you find again?

244
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,080
What is this? It's so smelly

245
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,080
What is this?

246
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,080
It's so smelly

247
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,080
What is this?

248
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,080
What is this?

249
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
It's so smelly

250
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,080
Snake

251
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
Such a big snake

252
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
It's been dead for a long time

253
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,080
Grasshopper, be careful

254
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,080
Hold on

255
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,080
What are you thinking?

256
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,080
There is no crossroads in the whole palace

257
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,080
We have come here by one road

258
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,080
It's just a regular entry

259
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,080
Besides, there is nothing else here except for the layers of the mechanisms

260
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,080
It's absolutely abnormal

261
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,080
Besides, the elixir of the queen mother

262
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,080
Thousands of people want to ask for it

263
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,080
Her queen mother will never let anyone in easily

264
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,080
Did you catch a sparrow when you were a kid?

265
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,080
It's just a small wooden stick to make a loquat

266
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,080
Sprinkle rice on it

267
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,080
The sparrow came in to eat rice

268
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,080
The sparrow came in to eat rice

269
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,080
And was caught by the loquat

270
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,080
This palace is the loquat of the queen mother

271
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,080
You and I are the little sparrow

272
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,080
That's right

273
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,080
This underground palace is just a cover-up

274
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,080
Not a real palace

275
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,080
It seems that it is not a simple thing to understand the secret of the queen mother

276
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
Let's leave here first

277
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
Let's go

278
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
There is nothing around

279
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,080
The queen mother wants us to starve to death here

280
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,080
Get up and walk

281
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,080
It's not that I don't want to get up

282
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,080
What did I do?

283
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,080
Maybe it's a mechanism

284
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,080
Why don't you say it earlier?

285
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
I think you slept too well

286
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
I didn't have the heart to bother you

287
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
Then do I have to rest?

288
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,080
You're welcome, Master Hua

289
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,080
But if you're ready

290
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
I'm going to get up

291
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,080
Fire oil

292
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,080
This cut off the back road and then the oil

293
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
It's time to put out the fire

294
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,080
No torture

295
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,080
I'm sure I'll fall down

296
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
Go behind

297
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,080
Brother, you are really powerful

298
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,080
You are really unrivaled

299
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,080
Just for a while

300
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,080
These grassy skins have disappeared

301
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,080
Tian Tian

302
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,080
I said you were fooled by the grassy skins

303
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,080
It's still so hard to give birth

304
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,080
There is nothing here

305
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
I don't think so

306
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,080
I don't think so

307
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,080
I don't think so

308
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
I don't think so

309
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,080
I don't think so

310
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,080
I don't think so

311
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
I don't think so

312
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,080
It's still so hard to give birth

313
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,080
There is nothing here

314
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,080
You didn't see the driver just now

315
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,080
Suddenly there are so many grassy skins

316
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,080
You have to call it

317
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,080
Okay, don't explain

318
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,080
Too deliberate

319
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,080
This thing is so hard to smell

320
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,080
Except for the smell of the body rot

321
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,080
The smell of the body rot

322
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,080
And mixed with the smell of the grassy skin

323
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,080
It seems that the grassy skin

324
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,080
Dried the blood of the snake

325
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,080
Is this also from the snake's belly?

326
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,080
Look at this

327
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,080
It should be from the eight or nine decades

328
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,080
Fatty

329
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,080
Who do you think will use such a big flashlight now?

330
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,080
Brother

331
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,080
I understand

332
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,080
The grassy skin ate the snake

333
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,080
The snake ate the person

334
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,080
This thing

335
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
Is the bone of a woman

336
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,080
This tombstone is not a tourist attraction

337
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
Can be equipped with such a big thing

338
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
It's not a tourist attraction

339
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
It's a tombstone

340
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,080
The person who can be equipped with such a big thing

341
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,080
Appeared here

342
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,080
Either the archaeological team

343
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,080
Or the mining team

344
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,080
But there is another possibility

345
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,080
The most terrible possibility

346
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,080
This is Chen Wenjin's person

347
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,080
That's easy

348
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,080
Let's take out all the things in the snake's belly

349
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,080
Then we will know who it is

350
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,080
Little Third Master

351
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,080
Just one snake

352
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,080
You stay here and rest

353
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,080
I'll call you if anything happens

354
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,080
Be careful

355
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
Don't worry

356
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,080
Run

357
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,080
There is no way

358
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,080
Jump

359
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
Are you crazy?

360
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,080
There is still hope

361
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,080
If you don't jump, you will die

362
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
Isn't this the sign of An Ning's company?

363
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
This is impossible

364
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,080
The people in our company

365
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,080
There is no way to talk about it

366
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,080
An Ning

367
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,080
Didn't you say that you are the person who can be equipped with such a big thing?

368
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,080
Why did you say that?

369
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,080
I don't know

370
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
Why did you say that?

371
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,080
It's not possible

372
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,080
Let's just take it as an excuse

373
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
Let's just take it as an excuse

374
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,080
Let's just take it as an excuse

375
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
Let's just take it as an excuse

376
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,080
Let's just take it as an excuse

377
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,080
Let's just take it as an excuse

378
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,080
Didn't you say that you will share the information of the cooperation?

379
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,080
What is there to hide about you?

380
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,080
Our company has been giving employees

381
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,080
a metal name tag since 1997

382
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,080
In case of an accident in the wild

383
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,080
The identity cannot be identified

384
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,080
But there is no name tag on this body

385
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,080
All the project materials of the company before 1997

386
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,080
I have seen it

387
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
No one has ever been to Tamutu

388
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,080
How can this be called a loan?

389
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,080
You are lying

390
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,080
What are you holding back?

391
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,080
Fatty

392
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,080
It's weird

393
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,080
It's your body

394
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,080
What do you mean?

395
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,080
No need to look at it

396
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
It's the money at that time

397
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,080
Seven dollars in total

398
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,080
The money at that time was very rare

399
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,080
You spent so many years

400
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,080
To collect seven dollars

401
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,080
Who else has such ability and financial power?

402
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,080
Collecting so much money

403
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,080
And made a same bracelet

404
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,080
This is completely impossible

405
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,080
Brother

406
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,080
Tianzhen

407
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,080
What's wrong with you?

408
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,080
I had a dream

409
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,080
Where is Xiao Ke?

410
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,080
Still playing?

411
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,080
Yes, I told you to go and see him

412
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,080
Sleep there

413
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,080
What are you looking at?

414
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,080
Nothing

415
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
Nothing

416
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,080
How is it?

417
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
Any new findings?

418
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,080
How can there be hand grenades?

419
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,080
Hand grenades are weapons

420
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,080
No matter how powerful the people of Chodek

421
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,080
They can't use this

422
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,080
No one said this was Chodek's people

423
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,080
I had a dream

424
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,080
I dreamed that this was Chodek's people

425
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
To put it back

426
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,080
This hand grenade is used by the killer

427
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,080
The firewood is useless

428
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,080
Who can do this?

429
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,080
I heard that many years ago

430
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,080
In this generation

431
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,080
There were illegal people making trouble

432
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,080
But later

433
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,080
Illegal people were basically killed

434
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,080
The rest of the Yixiao Valley

435
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,080
Missing in the desert

436
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,080
According to what you said

437
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,080
This is very likely

438
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,080
A body of illegal people

439
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,080
What is this?

440
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,080
What is this?

441
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,080
This is a good thing

442
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,080
Still usable

443
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,080
Too amazing

444
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,080
It's been so long

445
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
It can still be used

446
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:19,580
I'm going to the

447
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,080
Second Master

448
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
Don't move

449
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,080
Don't fall down

450
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,080
You broke yourself

451
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,080
Not this

452
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,080
Amazing

453
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
Second Master

454
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
Help me

455
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
You find a way by yourself

456
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,080
I'm really heartless

457
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,080
Far worse than Wu Xie

458
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,080
You get down quickly

459
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,680
You're so kind

460
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,440
You just want to save me

461
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,200
I'm afraid you'll trample my feet

462
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,160
It's easy to get a fever in the rain

463
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,760
If you're tired, take a break

464
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,040
I'll give you a fever

465
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,920
I can't

466
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,680
Copper

467
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,080
Xu Sanyuan, I'll go with you

468
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,040
Okay

469
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,480
This gun is more precious than anyone

470
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,600
It's been in the snake's belly for so many years

471
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,000
It's really not easy to use it

472
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:10,920
Pan Zi

473
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,160
You must have experienced a lot of battles

474
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,920
when you were a soldier

475
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,600
You must have seen a lot of big scenes

476
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,200
at that time

477
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,640
It's all the old stories

478
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,120
But

479
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,480
I've been through a lot

480
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,240
I can't die easily

481
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,240
Young Master

482
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,600
Don't worry

483
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,560
I'm very brave

484
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,920
I'm here with you

485
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,440
I'll keep you safe

486
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,680
Don't move

487
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,080
Don't let out the rain

488
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,840
Look at him

489
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,880
It's not safe

490
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,040
Go save Fatty

491
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,920
Let's go

492
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,400
Run

493
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,760
Burn more

494
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,320
Song Ziyan

495
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,240
ches

496
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,260
Shen Xun!

497
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,300
Go!

498
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,780
Don't move!

499
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,020
Shen Xun!

500
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,720
There is no signal.

501
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,320
The signal is no signal.

502
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,480
You need to take a look.

503
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,360
Brother Xiao.

504
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,280
Brother Xiao, start running.

505
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,280
Go

506
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,280
Go

507
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
This is the last one

508
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,280
Wu Xin, are you okay?

509
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
I'm fine

510
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
But Brother Xiao lost his knife

511
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,280
Brother Xiao's black gold-bone knife

512
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,280
is worth a lot of money

513
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,280
It's all because of the big bugs

514
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,280
If I see him again

515
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
I'll kill him and stew him

516
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
Enough, stop bragging

517
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
If you didn't sleep so well

518
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
we would have run away

519
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,280
We can't lose anything

520
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
Let's make a deal

521
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,280
Brother Xiao lost his knife

522
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,280
to save you

523
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
Brother Xiao, he lost his knife anyway

524
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,280
I'll keep the knife for you

525
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,280
That's Brother Xiao's

526
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,280
I'll keep it for him

527
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
What if it's worth money?

528
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,280
You're a genius

529
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,280
Fatty, I'll stew you

530
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,280
It's okay, go

531
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,280
I'll spare your life

532
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,280
There's no way out

533
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
There's a hole

534
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
Go, go

535
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
Go

536
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,280
Fatty, hurry

537
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,280
What are you looking at?

538
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,280
My hand, come

539
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,280
Fatty, take a breath

540
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,280
Thank you, hero

541
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,280
for saving my life

542
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,280
You can fly

543
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
We can count on you

544
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,280
We can't risk our lives

545
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,280
How can we run away?

546
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,280
Stop

547
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,280
I'll go

548
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
I'll go

549
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,280
I'll go

550
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,280
I'll go

551
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,280
I'll go

552
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
I'll go

553
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,280
I'll go

554
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,280
I'll go

555
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
What's that sound?

556
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
Wild Goose

557
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,280
Go

558
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,280
Brother Xiao, did you follow the snake?

559
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,280
I did

560
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,280
We almost got together with these bones

561
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
Isn't this the electric wire

562
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,280
that the West King's Tomb prepared for us?

563
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,280
The West King's Tomb

564
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
didn't expect

565
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
there would be bones here

566
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,280
This time, we were lucky

567
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,280
That's right

568
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,280
But it's wet enough here

569
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
Through that path

570
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,280
there should be a green boat in front

571
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,280
It's not a long way

572
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,280
Look at the snake prints on these stones

573
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,280
Legend has it

574
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
that the snake is the best partner

575
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,280
of the West King's Tomb

576
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,280
It likes wet places the most

577
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,280
It's a good place

578
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,280
The path in front

579
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,280
should be the place

580
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,280
where the West King's Tomb is

581
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
The hall above

582
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
is just a barrier

583
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,280
The people in the desert live in the water

584
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,280
If I were you

585
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,280
I would build a palace in Luezhou

586
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,280
Let's go out and have a look

587
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,280
See if there are any signs of Wu Sanxing

588
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,280
Xiao Ge

589
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,280
That chicken neck

590
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,280
won't chase us, will it?

591
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
No

592
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,280
Wild chicken neck

593
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,280
is the most poisonous species in the snake

594
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,280
It has a strong territory

595
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
That big cat just

596
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,280
cleared its territory

597
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,280
and found its existence

598
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,280
It ran away

599
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,280
Wild chicken neck is so powerful

600
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,280
It usually doesn't attack humans

601
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,280
But it's not

602
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,280
It's a very dangerous animal

603
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
It's a very dangerous animal

604
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,280
It's a very dangerous animal

605
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,280
It's a very dangerous animal

606
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,280
It's a very dangerous animal

607
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,280
It's a very dangerous animal

608
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,280
It usually doesn't attack humans

609
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,280
You just made a big move

610
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
It just stood up

611
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,280
Fortunately, it didn't get angry

612
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,280
Otherwise, we would all be dead

613
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,280
You are right

614
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,280
If I knew

615
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,280
Wild chicken neck was inside

616
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,280
I would have been scared

617
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,280
It was it that

618
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,280
drove that big cat away

619
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,280
If you say so

620
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
You should thank me

621
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,280
I said, Fatty

622
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,280
You should thank me

623
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,280
Your body shape

624
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
is really annoying

625
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,280
I know, I know

626
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,280
I will lose weight when I go back

627
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,280
That big cat is afraid of wild chicken neck

628
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,280
It shouldn't follow up

629
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,280
It shouldn't follow up

630
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,280
It's safe here

631
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,280
Let's find a place to rest

632
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,280
Okay

633
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,280
Rain forest

634
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,280
To be exact

635
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,280
It should be the rain forest in the desert

636
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,280
It's more like a snake den

637
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,280
than a green state

638
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,280
That means

639
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,280
We are not far from Wu Sanxing

640
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,280
Let's go.

641
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
One more time.

642
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,280
Come on.

643
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,280
Pick a...

644
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,280
Sorry.

645
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,280
Start from there.

646
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,280
Pick a leaf and cover it.

647
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,280
A little higher.

648
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,280
Okay.

649
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,280
Okay.

650
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,280
Okay.

651
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,280
Okay.

652
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,280
Okay.

653
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,280
Okay.

654
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,280
Okay.

655
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,280
Okay.

656
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,280
Wait.

657
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
Okay.

658
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,280
I'm sorry.

659
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,280
Sorry.

660
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,280
I'm sorry.

661
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,280
I'm sorry.

662
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,280
Give me a cookie.

663
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,280
One more time.

664
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,280
One more time.

665
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,280
One more time.

666
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,280
One more time.

667
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,280
Okay.

668
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,280
If you don't want to sleep,

669
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,280
take off your pants.

670
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,280
Here.

671
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,280
This is too much.

672
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,280
This is too much.

673
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,280
Or else, you'll be fat in the stomach.

674
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,280
If you fly to the sky now...

675
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,280
Ah!

676
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,280
Ah!

677
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,280
Okay.

678
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,280
Ah!

679
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,280
Okay, now...

680
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,280
Come on, captain.

681
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,280
Come on.

682
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,280
Why aren't you paying attention?

683
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,280
He can run better than the human face.

684
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,280
I'm sorry.

685
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,280
Sorry.

686
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,280
One more time.

687
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,280
Pick a leaf and cover it.

688
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,280
A little higher.

689
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,280
Okay.

690
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,280
Okay.

691
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
Okay.

692
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,280
Okay.

693
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,280
Okay.

694
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,280
I'm sorry.

695
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,280
I didn't see the driver just now.

696
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,280
He suddenly disappeared.

697
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,280
He suddenly appeared.

698
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,280
He suddenly appeared.

699
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,280
I'm sorry.

700
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,280
From 1997,

701
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,280
I'll give it to the staff.

702
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,280
Sorry.

703
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,280
One more time.

704
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,280
It's been so long.

705
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,280
It can still be used.

706
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,280
One more time.

707
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,280
Don't look at the other side.

708
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,280
That...

709
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,280
I'm sorry.

710
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,280
This...

711
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,280
Come on.

712
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,280
Okay.

713
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,280
One more time.

714
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,280
One more time.

715
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,280
One more time.

716
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,280
One and a half.

717
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,280
Why didn't you pick it up?

718
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,280
The hero is a prophecy.

719
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,280
Brother, this black gold bone knife

720
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,280
is worth a lot of money.

721
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,280
It's all because of the big intestine.

722
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,280
The big intestine is making trouble.

723
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,280
One more time.

724
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,280
We'll find the money ourselves.
