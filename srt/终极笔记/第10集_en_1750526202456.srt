1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,620
berty

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It takes at least three minutes to climb up this distance.

3
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We can't make it in time.

4
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Sir, the height difference is almost the same as the fall.

5
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We can jump over it in the high altitude.

6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Let's try it.

7
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There's only one way.

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's okay. Let's go.

9
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Come down.

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No.

11
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Those necks.

12
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No wonder there's no snake in the tree.

13
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
They came here for a meeting.

14
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Looks like this stage is for snakes.

15
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Even if we don't get out of it, we'll be doomed.

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Either we'll fall down and die, or we'll be stabbed to death.

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The snake isn't going to believe us.

18
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We have to get out alive.

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let's go.

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Let's go.

21
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Come on, San.

22
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Fatty, hurry up.

23
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Fatty, are you really going to lose weight?

24
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Come on.

25
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Do you hear me?

26
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You really need to lose weight.

27
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We agreed that you'd go out and buy me roast duck, hot pot and lamb.

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What now?

29
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You want to fight?

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If you keep on gaining weight, no one can save you.

31
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You'd better eat instant noodles.

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't want to.

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't worry.

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Our height now is about the same as the one across the river.

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We should be able to jump across.

36
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why is this guy going back?

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
There is a huge sewer down there

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And it's covered with rocks

39
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It looks like it's still very long

40
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This sewer

41
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
should lead to the West King's palace

42
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
There is really a West King's palace?

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Of course

44
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Why don't we come here to travel?

45
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
If we can find an antique

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
we can make a name for ourselves

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You don't have to go there

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Little Nine, you know the situation

49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You should go ahead

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Black, you are good at it

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Black, you are good at it

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Help us to make a name for ourselves

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You were quite brave

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Why don't we go together?

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I can't

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
delay your performance

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The water flow is too deep

58
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You can't measure it

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Did you bring the diving gear?

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes, we did

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What? That snake nest?

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Go back and get it

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You think my brother died too much?

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Why are you in such a hurry?

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Are you going back?

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You and your brothers

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
are not enough to drag me down

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I will call you Black

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You won't go back if you say so

70
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
How about

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
we go together?

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
San Ye, you just escaped from the snake nest

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
There may be danger in the forest

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I will go with Black

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
to get the equipment

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
As for these people, let them rest here

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I...

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We didn't come back in three hours

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You can go wherever you want

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's go to sleep

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Maybe we will need to stew the meat

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Brother Toba, they have gone far away

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm afraid that

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
we are not afraid of death

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But the wild chicken's neck

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
is too strong

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Nonsense

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I deserve to be looked down upon

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Brother, do you think

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
they are trying to find an excuse to get rid of us?

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We are the ones who work hard

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
They have lost so much

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
They will benefit from it

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
and make us suffer

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
San Ye

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The people we are looking for

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
are not good

98
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You think everyone is as reliable as Pan Zi?

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This time, they are trying to get money

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They only accept money

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
but not people

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Then you should find something expensive

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You can choose whatever you want when you have money

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You can't have a family for the past two years

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's too reliable

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Did you hear that?

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Give San Ye a discount

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I may be expensive, but I have no money

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
In comparison, I have a high price

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Right, San Ye?

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
San Ye

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
San Ye

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
San Ye

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
San Ye

115
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You are

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
the famous Wu San Ye

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You are not the one who works

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We are brothers

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
If this gets out

120
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
we will be in trouble

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's cheap

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You are right

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
San Ye

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I will listen to you

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay, since you are so loyal

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I will not be polite to my brothers

128
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Everyone has worked hard

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
If there is any benefit

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I will give you all

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Then I will take these brothers

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
to thank San Ye

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Hu

134
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
This is a huge human

135
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
pusher

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I thought people from the West

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
were all gods

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
but they are just snakes

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's a game machine

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It took 30 seconds to move the stone to the top

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
We can use these 30 seconds to jump

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I will go first

143
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I will go first

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If there is any problem

145
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I will do better than you

146
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You have already seen who you really are

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Let's take a test

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Okay

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
H doesn't blow

153
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Dae��은

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
his

155
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
hair

156
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
are

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
long

158
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
long

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
long

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Come on, let's see how fat I am.

161
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Fatty, faster!

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yes!

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Jinzhen, come here!

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Don't be nervous. Don't look down.

165
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Listen to my command. I say jump, you jump.

166
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
One.

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Two.

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Three.

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Jump!

170
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Jinzhen!

171
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Jinzhen!

172
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Little Third Master!

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The sky is falling down.

174
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Little Third Master!

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Jinzhen!

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Are you okay?

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Where is Little Third Master?

178
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Why is he gone again?

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Little Third Master is playing hide and seek.

180
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
He's been hiding for a while.

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
He's gone again.

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
He's gone again.

183
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
He's gone again.

184
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Playing hide and seek.

185
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
He's been hiding for a while.

186
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
He's gone again.

187
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't know.

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But there must be a reason why he did that.

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's not guess here.

190
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay.

191
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's getting late.

192
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Let's hurry up.

193
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Maybe we can meet Little Third Master when we find him.

194
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Pan Zi, which direction should we go?

195
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Oh no!

196
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Hongyan is here.

197
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Zhitan Zhen.

198
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We've saved him.

199
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's time to go.

200
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Let's go.

201
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Pan Zi.

202
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We can't find Hongyan.

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Can we find Little Third Master?

204
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Although Hongyan is gone,

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
we can't find Zhitan Zhen and the map.

206
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
If we keep going and don't meet any accident,

207
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
we can reach there in 2-3 hours.

208
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Pan Zi.

209
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Look at the sky.

210
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's getting dark.

211
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The terrain is complicated.

212
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
If we meet any danger,

213
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
it's hard for us to reach there.

214
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
How about this?

215
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Let's take a rest here.

216
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We'll set off when we're full of energy.

217
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Okay.

218
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Give me some water.

219
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You're thirsty?

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm thirsty.

221
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I can't talk anymore.

222
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You're not thirsty now, right?

223
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
No.

224
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm just saying what I want to say.

225
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Thank you.

226
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I found two words in the blue hole.

227
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The clue points to here.

228
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
When I met you here,

229
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
you had nothing to say.

230
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I found the map.

231
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's useless to find these clues.

232
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I've told you that it's not easy to find the map.

233
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Since you said it's useless,

234
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
why didn't you tell me the clue?

235
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I didn't tell you

236
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
because I didn't want you to be responsible for us.

237
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
We have no choice.

238
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But you have.

239
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Didn't you notice?

240
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Every thing we did these years

241
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and every place we went to

242
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
is like being arranged.

243
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's like something is

244
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
leading us to the end.

245
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That's why I insisted on coming.

246
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I want to see if we can break this.

247
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You want to break this?

248
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
How do you know

249
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
that your arrival is not arranged?

250
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I don't know.

251
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What are you doing?

252
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What is Pan doing up there?

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Sleeping?

254
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
There was something there.

255
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
He went up to check.

256
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What's wrong?

257
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Look.

258
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
There's a person on the tree

259
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
that's a few hundred meters away.

260
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You can see that?

261
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
There's a tree.

262
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I can't see it clearly.

263
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But I'm sure there's someone.

264
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
A woman with long hair.

265
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
A woman?

266
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
See for yourself.

267
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
An Ning.

268
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
An Ning.

269
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
An Ning.

270
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
An Ning.

271
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
An Ning.

272
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
An Ning.

273
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
An Ning.

274
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
An Ning.

275
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I saw that person

276
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
with An Ning's necklace.

277
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
This is An Ning.

278
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So they moved An Ning's body here.

279
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I always thought

280
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
that this forest is unusual.

281
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Their mood is very similar to ants.

282
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
In the ant's nest,

283
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
there's a person

284
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
who's responsible for the eggs.

285
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And the other ants

286
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
are responsible for the food.

287
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
These snakes moved An Ning's body here.

288
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's very likely

289
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
that they're going to give it to the snake mother.

290
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So you mean

291
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
we're in the snake nest.

292
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
There must be a lot of snakes there.

293
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
We can't stay here anymore.

294
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Let's go.

295
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
No.

296
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Since we found the body,

297
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
we have to take it away.

298
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Wu Xie, don't be naive.

299
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's not the time.

300
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You're going to leave it to the snake mother.

301
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yes, Mr. San.

302
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I can understand your feelings.

303
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But it's too dangerous for you to do this.

304
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yes.

305
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
No.

306
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
We can't leave it to her.

307
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What's wrong?

308
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
An Ning seems to be talking to someone.

309
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What's going on?

310
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
An Ning is going to kill herself?

311
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Don't believe in superstitions.

312
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's a voice.

313
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's a voice.

314
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It seems that someone is calling my name.

315
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Calling your name?

316
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Why didn't I hear it?

317
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's not calling my real name.

318
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's calling me Mr. San.

319
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Listen carefully.

320
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's not An Ning's voice.

321
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Whose voice is that?

322
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Is it possible that it's An Ning's voice?

323
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Voice?

324
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
By the way,

325
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
An Ning's voice is similar to that of the voice.

326
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
If the voice of the voice is similar to that of the voice,

327
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
it's very similar to this.

328
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's great.

329
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm going to go to the snake mother.

330
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'll be back.

331
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'll be back.

332
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'll be back.

333
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'll be back.

334
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,720
As long as this

335
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
is useful to the general,

336
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
then we can contact others.

337
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't know, we'll find out what Jin Yuan translated.

338
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
My master fazes with the enchantment.

339
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:16,380
He say he

340
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,300
would jaw-dropped on someone else's celebrity.

341
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,000
That's the past he brought to Ji Bo Zi in Ni Ke!

342
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,700
This old woman lives across the city on the远各广场

343
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,500
She's about 20,000 meters.

344
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,000
Not a single person uses bullets.

345
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You are useless now.

346
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What else do you have?

347
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Here, take this.

348
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Listen to me.

349
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Listen to me.

350
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Hold it tight.

351
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Don't let go.

352
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Even if you get hurt, you have to hold on.

353
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Can you do it?

354
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Don't worry.

355
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Listen to my command.

356
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Let's go forward.

357
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Okay.

358
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Run.

359
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Run.

360
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
How is it?

361
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It seems that he didn't chase us.

362
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
He was afraid that we would die.

363
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I remember your trick.

364
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
How many more water defenses do we have?

365
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The key is that we have no more alcohol.

366
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
We can't use this trick anymore.

367
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
This thing seems to have come again.

368
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
We have to hurry up.

369
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
This place is too dangerous.

370
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Don't play tricks anymore.

371
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
We will definitely play it again.

372
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
This way.

373
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
There is something here.

374
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
This way.

375
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Let's go.

376
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Run.

377
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Run.

378
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Run.

379
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Look ahead.

380
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Okay.

381
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Third Master, it's a dead snake.

382
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Let's go.

383
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,020
It's unexpected..

384
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,580
She isn't around?

385
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,660
She is the most flexible of the two of them.

386
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,900
He's a gift.

387
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,100
virgo

388
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,780
She probably got delivered here too.

389
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,400
She's going to strangle the justequin by breaking into one trap.

390
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,420
They got rid of her.

391
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,000
One by one, they will make an dollar lose to 60.

392
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Your wine

393
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's okay

394
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm wearing military boots

395
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's durable

396
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You cheap man

397
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Come on, get in the tent

398
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Okay

399
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The snake is in front of us

400
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Pan Zi, how did you get the deer?

401
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
How did you get it back?

402
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I didn't get it back

403
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Why didn't you come here?

404
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
They are not chasing us

405
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
They are making a scene

406
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Making a scene?

407
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The snake is so smart

408
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
This snake is definitely a snake

409
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's all gone

410
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's all gone

411
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's all gone

412
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Stop

413
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
These snakes are extraordinary

414
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I think we can't force them

415
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,380
Since they like the

416
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Let's play hide and seek with them

417
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
and get rid of them

418
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Go

419
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Wait, I don't think it's right

420
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Actually, it's too easy for these snakes to kill us

421
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Just lock them in the grass

422
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Bite them

423
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
and they will die

424
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Why is it so complicated?

425
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You mean

426
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
they are not trying to revenge us

427
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
They are trying to make a scene with us

428
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
They are not trying to kill us

429
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Then what are they doing?

430
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I don't know

431
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But before we figure it out

432
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
we'd better not act rashly

433
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Wu Yan, don't be naive

434
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
They are snakes, we are humans

435
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
How do we know what the snake is thinking?

436
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
What are they thinking?

437
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I got it

438
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
They are like sheep and dogs

439
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
We are like sheep

440
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
They are trying to get rid of us

441
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
in a particular direction

442
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Then where do we lure these snakes

443
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
into the forest?

444
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I don't know

445
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Then what should we do?

446
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Let's go back

447
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
We can't go back

448
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
They are all poisoned

449
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
We have to kill them

450
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I think we can only get rid of them

451
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Animals are afraid of fire

452
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Let's use the fire

453
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
to get rid of them

454
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Okay

455
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Okay

456
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Let's go

457
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Okay, let's go

458
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,680
Is it the

459
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Taker again?

460
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Someone is talking

461
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Is it the person of Master San?

462
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Pan Zi

463
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It's me

464
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Pan Zi

465
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Who are you?

466
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I am not a thief

467
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I am just a thief

468
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I am a thief

469
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I am a thief

470
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I will go and check

471
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Be careful

472
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Don't move

473
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I just used the blood

474
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Stay still

475
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I will give you two pairs of shoes

476
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
after we go back

477
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Can you draw a line?

478
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Didn't you say you didn't have a signal?

479
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yes, yes, yes

480
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Then give me the cash

481
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I will give you the money

482
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I will give you the money

483
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I will give you the money

484
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I will give you the money

485
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I will give you the money

486
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
The cash?

487
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Master San

488
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
How do you feel?

489
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I am fine

490
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Let's take a rest here

491
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
We will get up when you feel better

492
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Master San

493
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
We have been in the camp

494
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
for more than three hours

495
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
The people in the camp are impatient

496
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
If we stay longer

497
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
they might come back to us

498
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
These people

499
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
always come after us

500
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
We will be in trouble if we don't get there

501
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
If we really want to break our faces

502
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
we will have to fight with them

503
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
With you two

504
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
we can't even get them up

505
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Master San

506
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I saw the west gate

507
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and I had to bury the stones in this place

508
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I have been in the camp for so long

509
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
and I have never seen such a useless thing

510
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Brother Tuoba

511
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
You had to follow me

512
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Get lost

513
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Brother Tuoba

514
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I saw you running into Mojing's tent

515
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I felt a little strange

516
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
so I went to spy on them

517
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
What did you hear?

518
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
He said he wanted to attack us

519
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I think they didn't plan to take us with them

520
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
They took our equipment and entered the West Gate

521
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Maybe they are jealous of us

522
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
You are so lazy

523
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
You dare to fool me

524
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
If this continues

525
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
we will be more passive

526
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
How about this?

527
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
We took our equipment

528
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
and entered the West Gate

529
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Brother Tuoba

530
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Let's go and take the equipment now

531
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Can you think?

532
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Can you do it?

533
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Have you ever heard of the trick of taking the fox away?

534
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Taking the fox away?

535
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Let's take a turn later

536
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I will take some people to find a way to hold them back

537
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
You take some brothers

538
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
and take the equipment

539
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
When we get the thing

540
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
we will throw them away

541
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Boss

542
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
You are so lucky

543
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
You are the modern Zhuo Ge

544
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Do you know what my name is?

545
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Zhuge Tuoba

546
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
By the way

547
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
what is the meaning of the word?

548
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Master San

549
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
What's wrong?

550
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Master San

551
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
According to your order

552
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
we have dug the pit

553
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Master San

554
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
We have been carrying the pit for so long

555
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
When will we move to West Gate?

556
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
We will leave as soon as we are healed

557
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I don't mind

558
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
But my men

559
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
are not able to hold on

560
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
They are at the West Gate

561
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It's hard to let them in

562
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Think about it

563
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Don't let them get in the way

564
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
of us

565
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Besides

566
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
we have been working hard

567
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You should take revenge

568
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I have given you the money

569
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Master San

570
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
My men are honest

571
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
We have suffered a lot

572
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
and lost many people

573
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
You gave us the money

574
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Why should we do it for you?

575
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Since you have this attitude

576
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
let's not waste time

577
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
with you

578
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Let's go our separate ways

579
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Without me

580
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
we can't enter West Gate

581
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You are the one who can't enter West Gate

582
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
While we were chatting

583
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
all your equipment

584
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
were taken by my men

585
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I advise you not to waste time

586
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Let's go back as soon as possible

587
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
You can go

588
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Go

589
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Go

590
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
If you don't raise your hand

591
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
it will be a bad scene

592
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
If you want to split into two

593
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I can't let you come here for nothing

594
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
At least

595
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I have to give you some memories

596
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You are so arrogant

597
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
after being bitten by a snake

598
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Go

599
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Brother San

600
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I told you to give me some memories

601
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Come, cooperate with me

602
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Wait

603
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Think carefully

604
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Even if you are capable

605
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
you can't stop us

606
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Moreover

607
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
all your equipment

608
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
were taken by my men

609
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Equipment?

610
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You mean these?

611
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You

612
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
You

613
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
You are too much

614
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
How can you be so arrogant?

615
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You are bullying the old man

616
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Old man?

617
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Do you know how to write these three words?

618
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Do you want me to cut your face?

619
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Ask him

620
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
We have been doing all the dirty work

621
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
on this journey

622
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
How much does he pay me?

623
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
After coming out

624
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
who is not old, young and young?

625
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Why do you bully me?

626
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You

627
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Cry

628
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
If you cry again

629
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
you will not get any benefits

630
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Let's work

631
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Let's work

632
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Brother

633
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Why is there no sound?

634
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Is Pan Zi still up there?

635
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Pan Zi

636
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Pan Zi

637
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Pan Zi

638
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I'll go and check

639
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Be careful

640
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Be careful

641
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Brother

642
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Pan Zi is not up there

643
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
What?

644
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It's a monster

645
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Run

646
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Run

647
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
There are so many of them

648
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Stupid

649
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Fight them

650
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Master

651
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
The sound is so loud

652
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Why are they all running away?

653
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Pan Zi

654
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Run

655
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Pan Zi

656
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Run

657
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Pan Zi

658
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Pan Zi's bag

659
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Pan Zi

660
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Pan Zi

661
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Pan Zi

662
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Pan Zi

663
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Why is it so dark?

664
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Is it a couple?

665
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Run

666
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Wu Xie

667
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Run

668
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Pan Zi

669
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Is the sound still loud?

670
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Come on

671
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'll fight you

672
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Pan Zi

673
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Pan Zi

674
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Master 13

675
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Knife

676
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Come on

677
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Are you okay?

678
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Come on

679
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Pan Zi

680
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Hit him

681
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Pan Zi

682
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Pan Zi

683
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Where did you go?

684
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Where did you go?

685
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Where did you go?

686
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Go

687
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Go find Master 13

688
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Pan Zi

689
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Pan Zi

690
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Where did you go?

691
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It looks like a snake bit him

692
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
But this snake

693
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Although it looks fierce

694
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It's not poisonous

695
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
As long as we can get rid of these stitches

696
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's not a big deal

697
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
We have to find your Third Uncle

698
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And save Pan Zi

699
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Hurry up

700
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Oh no

701
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I can't see the map

702
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
We can't stay here anymore

703
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Let's just go in a different direction

704
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
We can't meet the dead one

705
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Go this way

706
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Wait

707
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Tianzhen

708
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Your iron is light

709
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Your luck is not good

710
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Let's go this way

711
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Go

712
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Hold on

713
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Hold on

714
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Is the route we took right?

715
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Why do I feel like we've been walking in the wrong direction?

716
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It was a dream

717
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It's good that we got here

718
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
What should we do now?

719
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Where should we go?

720
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Give me the map

721
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I'll go find the way

722
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Pan Zi

723
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Ying Tian

724
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Tianzhen

725
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I found Ying Di

726
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Let's go

727
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Pan Zi

728
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
This is Third Uncle's camp

729
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Really?

730
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
It's safe

731
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Leave the real painting to me

732
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You stay outside

733
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Okay

734
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Why is there no brush in the toothpaste?

735
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Why is there such a wet footprint?

736
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Hold on

737
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
You have to get rid of the poison

738
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Where is Third Uncle?

739
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Don't worry

740
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Your Third Uncle is well-fed

741
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
He's waiting outside

742
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Later

743
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I'll sew your wound

744
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And give you a bandage

745
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
The bandage

746
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I'll put it in your wound

747
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And then I'll give you a bandage

748
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I'll put it in your wound

749
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Feng

750
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
There's no anesthetic in this box

751
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
You have to bear it

752
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It's okay

753
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I can bear this wound

754
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I heard that when there was no anesthetic

755
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You put this on your head

756
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And hit the stick

757
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And you fainted

758
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Or you could also...

759
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
What's the difference between hitting the stick and hitting my head?

760
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Okay, give me some alcohol

761
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Here

762
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Hold it

763
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Hold it

764
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Okay

765
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Get on

766
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
You taught me only one way

767
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I'm out of time

768
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Get on

769
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
You think everyone is as good as Pan Le?

770
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
This time

771
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Come on, come on, come on

772
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
You're here

773
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Sorry

774
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
That snake

775
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
You can take it

776
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Thank you

777
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Sorry, I'm late

778
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Give me a second

779
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
What?

780
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
That snake

781
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Go back and take it

782
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Then

783
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'll take these brothers

784
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And go to the third floor

785
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
That's so rude

786
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
That's more like it

787
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
The fall along the way

788
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Is it because of you?

789
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Is it because of you?

790
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Oh, my God

791
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I really saw it

792
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Come on

793
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Come on

794
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Okay

795
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
How's the situation in the second floor?

796
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
What's the situation?

797
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Okay, okay

798
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
How's the situation in the second floor?

799
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It's okay

800
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I'm

801
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I'm strong

802
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I'm patient

803
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Come on

804
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Sir

805
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
What's wrong?

806
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
You can't talk to me

807
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I didn't stop

808
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And you're still

809
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Can I use the card?

810
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Sorry, I'm sorry

811
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I'm sorry

812
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Can you fold the line?

813
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Start from the red line

814
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Wait

815
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I'm so nervous

816
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Okay, one more time

817
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Shh

818
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Come on

819
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
We're going back

820
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
One more time

821
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Darn

822
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
They're not chasing us

823
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
They're revenge

824
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Revenge

825
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You and I are chasing your hope

826
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Is it because of this silence?

827
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
No matter how many times I say I can't help it

828
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Please don't forget me

829
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I have to practice with you

830
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I'm sorry

831
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I'm sorry

832
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
One more time

833
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
One more time

834
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I'm sorry

835
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I'm sorry

836
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I'm sorry

837
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I'm sorry

838
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I'm sorry

839
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I'm sorry

840
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I'm sorry

841
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I'm sorry
