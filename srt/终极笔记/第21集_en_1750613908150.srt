You don't understand me?

105
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I found it.

106
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Their photos have been sent to Beijing.

107
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Although the account number of the money is not clear,

108
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
it should be Xin Yue Hotel.

109
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
They have been paying for it.

110
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Xin Yue Hotel?

111
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It is indeed Zhang Rishan.

112
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Second Master, Little Third Master, I have found out.

113
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
In the 1970s, this factory was built by an old leader named Zhang.

114
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Fo Ye?

115
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Fo Ye is the one who built this factory

116
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
to hide his secret room.

117
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
In the 1990s, the commercial industry was disbanded.

118
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
During the process of reconstruction,

119
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
you will definitely find something.

120
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I found it.

121
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
In March 1999,

122
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I did find something underground.

123
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Fo Ye has been hiding something for decades.

124
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It was easily dug up?

125
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
No.

126
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He found a better way to store it.

127
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Where did it go?

128
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Music

129
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It is really Fo Ye.

130
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Hiding the screen in the museum is the safest.

131
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
This Mr. Zhang should be Zhang Rishan.

132
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
How big was the room back then?

133
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
This screen looks old.

134
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And look, these holes were re-picked.

135
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But this is too neat.

136
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Each damaged part is about the same size.

137
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There is something wrong.

138
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
If there is something wrong, it is right.

139
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It proves that we are right.

140
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Stealing?

141
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What are you joking about?

142
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
This is a museum.

143
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's okay.

144
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Just one re-picked.

145
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Go back and study it.

146
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Re-picked?

147
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What is one re-picked?

148
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
This is one re-picked.

149
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It is guaranteed to be a mess.

150
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Don't worry.

151
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The size is the same as the museum.

152
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Even the size, position and edge are the same.

153
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
There is no error.

154
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Everyone, take your time.

155
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
This warehouse is mine.

156
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I can use it as long as I want.

157
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I can do whatever I want.

158
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I will collect it.

159
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I don't think the screen is special.

160
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Is the information in these holes?

161
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Are these holes a kind of password?

162
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Like a code of Morse code, Ergin code.

163
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Or this is a painting.

164
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The information is in the line.

165
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But there are too many dots on the screen.

166
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's so messy.

167
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
If there are hundreds of lines, how can I connect them?

168
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
But I was just thinking.

169
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I think I've seen this screen somewhere.

170
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It feels familiar.

171
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Xingyue Hotel.

172
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The picture of Xingyue Hotel has this screen.

173
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Hello.

174
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Go to Xingyue Hotel for dinner.

175
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Send me the picture on the left side of the first floor.

176
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Bosses, let's go back first.

177
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We will come back in two days.

178
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Look at the weather.

179
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It may rain.

180
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
If it rains in the mountains, there will be a mud stream.

181
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Isn't it dangerous?

182
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's just a mud stream.

183
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Nothing to worry about.

184
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
We brothers have a rich experience in the wild.

185
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
This mud stream is not a problem.

186
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's okay.

187
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Uncle Gui, how about this?

188
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You take Yun Cai back.

189
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
We will continue to stay here.

190
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
When it stops raining, you bring us some supplies.

191
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Why should the two bosses stay?

192
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I have to go back.

193
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Enough. What are you doing here?

194
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You dare to say anything.

195
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Don't you know how dangerous the mud stream is?

196
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay, take your stuff.

197
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Let's go.

198
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Look at the rain.

199
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It will rain for days.

200
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
We don't have dry food.

201
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Save it.

202
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
When it stops raining,

203
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I will bring you dry food.

204
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Why don't you go back with me?

205
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
If it rains, no one dares to enter the mountain.

206
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
If it's not raining, it's just a chance.

207
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Don't worry, Uncle Gui.

208
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
We will come back safely.

209
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You and Yun Cai go back to the village and kill the chickens and sheep.

210
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
When we come back, we will eat a lot.

211
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I will say one more thing.

212
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The mountains are not as good as the outside.

213
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Be careful.

214
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Don't worry.

215
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Okay. Yun Cai, let's go.

216
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Slow down, Yun Cai.

217
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Come on, brother.

218
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Let's start the manual.

219
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Let's put this up.

220
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Xiao Hua, the photo you just took came through.

221
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That's right. It's this screen.

222
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
This earth chair?

223
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Xiu Xiu, do you remember?

224
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Isn't this Wu San Xing's earth chair?

225
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
There is indeed an earth chair in his room.

226
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And it looks like this.

227
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
But how do you two know that his room has an earth chair?

228
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Have you been to Xie Lian Huan's room?

229
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
When?

230
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Investigate. This is all for investigation.

231
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
If that's the case, our next step...

232
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Let's go together.

233
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Let's go.

234
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Tian Zhen, didn't I tell you before?

235
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Xiao Ge and I are going to dig up a bunch of white bones.

236
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
How about this? Fatty, I'll fight a few for you.

237
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
When you come back, there will be a bunch of people...

238
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
who will pick up the bones and pick up the welcome.

239
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
How about it? Not bad, right?

240
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Let's do it.

241
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It seems Wu Xie's guess is right.

242
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Since we can find this bunch of white bones,

243
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
it means that the first batch of investigation team...

244
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
was killed by Pan Ma.

245
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Then they were replaced by the second batch of investigation team.

246
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Pan Ma is really something.

247
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Let's go.

248
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Let's rest in peace.

249
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm sorry, seniors.

250
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
We don't want to disturb you.

251
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But we do need you to come out and show your faces.

252
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Please forgive us.

253
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Xiao Ge, why don't you say something?

254
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
What did the research say?

256
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Look, there are four points here.

257
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I remember there are four holes on the screen that are different from the other points.

258
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
These four points should be corresponding to those four points.

259
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
They are the effect of the calibration.

260
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
That's right. It's the same as what we thought.

261
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Once the earth corresponds to the screen, it can break the information.

262
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Then what are we waiting for?

263
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
A little to the right.

264
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
A little more.

265
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Come back a little.

266
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Are you done?

267
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yes.

268
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Fish, fish, get on the bait.

269
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Fish 5 5 5, come on, fish, fish, get on the bait.

270
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Fish, fish, come on, fish, fish, get on the bait.

271
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Fish, fish, come on, fish, get on the bait.

272
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:04,240
to

273
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:14,660
help

274
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,900
love

275
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,700
j Kens retrouve

276
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,700
This is the West King's Mother Palace.

277
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,700
The Cloud Sky Palace and the Seven-Line Mammoth Palace.

278
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,700
We all know these places.

279
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,700
The locations that we have found on the Mammoth Tent

280
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,700
are all reflected on this map.

281
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,700
But as for other locations,

282
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,700
even we can't control them.

283
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,700
Why do you say there are locations overseas?

284
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,700
These should be the Mammoth Tent that the Buddha Zhang found.

285
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,700
After he found it, he got all the information.

286
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,700
I didn't expect him to be so good.

287
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,700
He actually found so many Mammoth Tent.

288
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,700
But what exactly are these locations?

289
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,700
What are the connections between them?

290
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,700
I will definitely find out.

291
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,700
I thought I could know where he is.

292
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,700
Wu Xie,

293
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,700
we are checking the same things as him.

294
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,700
We are checking, and he is checking.

295
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,700
If we check together, we will definitely find something.

296
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,700
This spot seems to be in Ba Nan.

297
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,700
I didn't expect that the location you found

298
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,700
when you went to find Xiao Ge

299
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,700
actually has something to do with the Mammoth King.

300
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,700
This is definitely not a coincidence.

301
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,700
No matter if it is a coincidence, I have to go back to Ba Nan.

302
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,700
Xiao Ge and Fatty are waiting for me in Ba Nan.

303
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,700
It is going to rain heavily.

304
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,700
If we don't go back, we won't be able to enter the mountain.

305
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,700
I will go with you.

306
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,700
After all, I bought the diving equipment for you.

307
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,700
Although I didn't know what you were going to do with it,

308
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,700
I have a set in there.

309
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,700
And I have a set.

310
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,700
It's too dangerous there.

311
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,700
You stay here and wait for the news.

312
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,700
What?

313
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,700
You don't take me with you every time you have fun?

314
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,700
Xiu Xiu.

315
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,700
Okay.

316
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,700
I will call them and inform them.

317
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,700
Sorry, the number you have dialed is power off.

318
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,700
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is power off.

319
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,700
Okay.

320
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,700
Hello?

321
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,700
Boss Wu.

322
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,700
Hello, Uncle Gui.

323
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,700
What is the situation in the mountain?

324
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,700
Is it raining?

325
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
Yes, it is raining in the mountain.

326
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,700
Are Xiao Ge and Fatty still in the mountain?

327
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,700
No.

328
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,700
I called them when I left.

329
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,700
They refused to stay by the lake.

330
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,700
Don't worry.

331
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,700
When the rain stops, I will go to the mountain to find them.

332
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,700
Okay.

333
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,700
Contact me anytime.

334
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,700
Xiao Ge and Fatty might be in trouble.

335
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,700
I have to go back quickly.

336
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,700
We will go tonight.

337
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,700
We have to get the question mark.

338
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,700
Okay.

339
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Hello, Pan Yujing.

340
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,700
Mr. Huang, are you in Changsha?

341
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,700
How do you know?

342
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,700
It's none of your business.

343
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,700
I will be there tomorrow.

344
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,700
I need to talk to you.

345
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,700
I will be there tomorrow.

346
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,700
But...

347
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,700
Don't but.

348
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,700
Wait for me.

349
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,700
Wu Xie, go back to the bar first.

350
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,700
Look for me at this time.

351
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,700
Maybe there is news about my third-party.

352
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,700
Okay.

353
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,700
Inform me anytime if there is any news.

354
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,700
Okay.

355
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,700
Boss.

356
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,700
Come in.

357
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,700
Boss.

358
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,700
Did you get anything for me?

359
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,700
As far as I know,

360
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,700
John and the phantoms never came out of the water.

361
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,700
We can't find anything.

362
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,700
Do you think they might have already died in the lake?

363
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,700
No.

364
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,700
You mean they found it?

365
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,700
They beat us to it again?

366
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,700
But we have not found a way down until now.

367
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,700
You can't.

368
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,700
The equipment...

369
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,700
It's already in Banai.

370
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,700
They will be arrived in this afternoon.

371
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,700
You invited me to dinner.

372
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,700
I will find a better place.

373
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,700
I'm not afraid of high-class people.

374
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,700
I'm afraid of being a bad person.

375
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,700
I'm afraid of being a bad person.

376
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,700
I'm afraid of being a bad person.

377
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,700
I need a better place.

378
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,700
I'm not afraid of high-class people.

379
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,700
I'm afraid of being a bad person.

380
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,700
Here comes the fried rice with green pepper and shredded meat.

381
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,700
I miss you so much.

382
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,700
You have gained some weight.

383
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,700
I will gain more weight and can be your substitute over time.

384
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,700
You have something to talk with my grandpa, right?

385
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,700
I will leave you alone then.

386
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,700
Stefan, you stay here.

387
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,700
It's okay.

388
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,700
Okay.

389
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,700
What do you want me to do for the day?

390
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,200
I heard that you are investigating about Zhang Da Fu and Lu Huang Bo.

391
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,200
You have news?

392
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
It's not bad.

393
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,700
Black Lord, the ingredients for your food are the best.

394
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,700
The pig is black-haired.

395
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,700
You should get a vacuum package.

396
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,700
I can pick it up later and eat it on the way.

397
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,700
Sure.

398
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,700
Black Lord, don't sell the tubes.

399
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,700
Brother Hua has returned the ticket and is waiting for you.

400
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,700
I found a place with very important clues.

401
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,700
What clues?

402
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,700
You will know when you get there.

403
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,700
You will know tomorrow.

404
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
Where?

405
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,700
Just let me go. I have prepared the food.

406
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,700
Why haven't they come back yet?

407
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,700
Boss Wu, I told them repeatedly when I left the lake.

408
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,700
I must leave the mountain before it rains.

409
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,700
But look, there is no news so far.

410
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,700
I am also anxious.

411
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,700
I wait in the mountains every day.

412
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,700
No one comes back until now.

413
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,700
No, I have to find them.

414
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,700
No, no, no.

415
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,700
Boss Wu, it's too dangerous.

416
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,700
Look, it rained for days.

417
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,700
According to my experience, there are always mud flows on the mountain.

418
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,700
Not only you, but also the most experienced hunters.

419
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,700
We have to hand our lives to the mountain.

420
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,700
We can't just wait here.

421
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,700
Boss Wu, don't worry.

422
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,700
The most dangerous thing is the way to the mountain.

423
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,700
It's safer to stay by the lake than on the mountain.

424
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,700
Nothing serious.

425
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,700
At worst, it's just a small illness.

426
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,700
But...

427
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,700
I brought you into the mountain.

428
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,700
I will be responsible for it.

429
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,700
But we can't risk our lives, right?

430
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,700
Don't persuade me.

431
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,700
No matter what you say, I will never leave them.

432
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,700
I am not here to persuade you.

433
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,700
I know someone can take you into the mountain.

434
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:41,060
The

435
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,500
These young people are too impatient.

436
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,500
They can't stand their own character.

437
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,500
I found a big clue.

438
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,100
It has something to do with the Lu Huang Bo you're looking for.

439
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,100
What is it exactly? Just tell me.

440
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,300
This clue is a place.

441
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,300
It's here.

442
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,700
I'm telling you.

443
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,100
Don't underestimate this rice field.

444
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,700
This was found by the Buddha after a thousand hardships.

445
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,500
And this is a place with a big secret.

446
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,500
Stop the car.

447
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Don't stop. We're not there yet.

448
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,300
Who are you listening to?

449
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,500
Listen to me. Stop the car.

450
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,500
I said you're almost there. Stop acting.

451
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,500
The Buddha wouldn't come here.

452
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,500
Even if he came here, he would be doomed to be left with nothing.

453
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,100
If the Buddha is left with nothing, it doesn't mean we're left with nothing either.

454
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,100
Right?

455
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,700
Drive. It's right in front of us.

456
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,900
Who are you listening to?

457
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,100
Listen to me.

458
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,100
Tell me. Who hired you?

459
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,100
No one hired me.

460
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:50,100
I just found an important clue to share with you two.

461
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,100
You're so kind.

462
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,100
Give me the phone.

463
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,100
Boss, do you want to fly?

464
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,100
I'm a kind person.

465
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,100
I have to be honest in my business.

466
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,100
I can't leak any information to my clients.

467
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,100
Second Master.

468
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,100
Second Master of the Wu Family.

469
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,100
What is Second Master doing?

470
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,100
No signal?

471
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,100
No. How is that possible?

472
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,100
No?

473
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,100
No.

474
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,100
How is that possible?

475
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,100
At this critical moment.

476
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,100
Black Master.

477
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,100
You must believe in Brother Hua's trust.

478
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,100
I'll make sure of this week's expenses.

479
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,100
He won't give you less.

480
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,100
What is Second Master of the Wu Family doing?

481
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,100
Actually, he's nothing.

482
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,100
He just wants me to take you around.

483
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,100
Take a walk.

484
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,100
Take a break.

485
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,100
Go to places that have nothing to do with me.

486
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,100
I'll just run around.

487
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,100
He doesn't want me to go anywhere.

488
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:09,100
It depends on where you want to go.

489
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,100
I'll just go.

490
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,100
Dad, can you take Wu Xie to the mountain?

491
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,100
No.

492
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
Panma, dad.

493
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,100
Last time in the bullhead ditch, I...

494
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,100
Last time we escaped from the bullhead ditch,

495
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,100
we were at the brink of death.

496
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,100
Of course I'd like to help you.

497
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:50,100
But the situation now is really bad.

498
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,100
I heard when I came back that it rained for two days.

499
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,100
But look, the rain has stopped.

500
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,100
It has stopped for us.

501
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,100
But not in the mountains.

502
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,100
The clouds are so dark.

503
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,100
It must be raining heavily in the mountains.

504
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,100
Maybe you're already lost.

505
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,100
Chief A Gui is right.

506
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,100
Whoever enters the mountain must be on the mountain road.

507
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,100
But...

508
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,100
My dad didn't go to the banquet.

509
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,100
He only went to the mountains a few times a year.

510
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,100
It's definitely okay for you to go to the mountains every day.

511
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:26,100
Yuncai, you grew up in the mountains.

512
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,100
You don't know what's going on in the mountains?

513
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,100
I believe that you're fine with it.

514
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,100
You've been in the mountains for decades.

515
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,100
What trouble have you never seen?

516
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,100
Dad, if you don't help,

517
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,100
his friend might really die in the mountains.

518
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,100
It's not that I don't want to help you.

519
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,100
It's not that I'm afraid of death.

520
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,100
It's just that I can't die in vain with you.

521
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,100
They're just by the lake,

522
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,100
not in the mountains.

523
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,100
There shouldn't be any big trouble.

524
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,100
With my experience,

525
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,100
it should stop raining in a few days.

526
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,100
I'll take you there.

527
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,320
The

528
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,100
Old playboy Panma

529
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,100
can go into the mountains.

530
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,100
It's just that it's raining and the mountain road is a little difficult to go.

531
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,100
He's afraid of trouble.

532
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,100
Every time it rains, he says that it's a mud stream, a mud stream.

533
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,100
Where is there a mud stream so easily?

534
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,100
I've only seen one mud stream

535
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,100
in my life.

536
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,100
I have another idea.

537
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,100
What idea?

538
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,100
Don't worry about it.

539
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,100
You can help me get a set of honest work.

540
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,100
If possible,

541
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,100
make a little more women's hair.

542
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,100
I didn't expect you to investigate so deeply.

543
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,100
You took us to a place that doesn't exist on the map.

544
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,100
You even said that when Fo Ye's important discovery was discovered,

545
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,100
I knew there must be a problem.

546
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,100
Blame me, blame me.

547
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,100
If I had known, I would have taken you to a place that exists on the map.

548
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,100
So you wouldn't have suspected me.

549
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,100
But

550
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,100
what's the use of just having this map?

551
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,100
Do you know what these red dots mean?

552
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,100
Aren't these dots the place where Lu Huangbo marked?

553
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,100
Yes,

554
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,100
but also wrong.

555
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:08,100
Do you know where Lu Huangbo marked?

556
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,100
I know this is the Seven Stars Lujuan Palace.

557
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,100
This is the Cloud Sky Palace on Mount Changbai.

558
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,100
This is Xisha,

559
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,100
Tamdol,

560
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,100
and this is the place Wu Xie and the others went to,

561
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,100
Ba Nan.

562
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,100
That's right.

563
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:34,100
But these places are essentially the same.

564
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,100
If I'm not wrong,

565
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:42,100
these places all have Zhangjia Ancient Building.

566
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,100
Zhangjia Ancient Building.

567
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,100
Black Lord,

568
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,100
Black Lord,

569
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,100
what exactly is the Zhangjia Ancient Building?

570
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,100
I don't know.

571
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,100
I haven't found out about it for the rest of my life.

572
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,100
How would I know?

573
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:02,100
This Second Master Wu doesn't want me to go with Wu Xie, right?

574
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,100
I think so.

575
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,100
Then why did he let Wu Xie go alone?

576
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,100
I don't know either.

577
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,100
Second Master Wu didn't tell me about Wu Xie.

578
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,100
He's protecting you?

579
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,100
At first, he just wanted me to investigate two people.

580
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,100
Wu San Xing and Xie Lian Huan.

581
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:24,100
So, you know that Third Master Wu is a fake?

582
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,100
After he came back from the bottom of the West Mountain,

583
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,100
he found something wrong.

584
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,100
He was allergic to alcohol and got red when he took a sip.

585
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,100
But after he came back from the bottom of the West Mountain,

586
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,100
he could drink now.

587
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,100
And he couldn't even drink a bottle.

588
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,100
Then why didn't you expose him directly?

589
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,100
Because the new Third Master Wu

590
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,100
is exactly the same as before

591
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,100
in terms of behavior and behavior.

592
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,100
And he can also accurately say that

593
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,100
only the two of them know about the childhood death.

594
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,100
So, Second Master Wu thinks that

595
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,100
it must be Third Master and Xie Lian Huan

596
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,100
cooperating to do something.

597
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:05,100
He didn't expose them directly.

598
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,100
He also helped them hide a lot of things.

599
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,100
We always thought that

600
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,100
Second Master Wu had been out of the world

601
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,100
and had nothing to do with the Jiumen.

602
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:21,100
But we never thought that he was involved in it.

603
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,100
There is rarely anyone in Jiumen

604
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,100
who can do something like that.

605
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,100
Second Master is using his method

606
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,100
to protect his brother.

607
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,100
And you guys.

608
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,100
Since Second Master asked you to find

609
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,100
Third Master and Uncle Lian Huan,

610
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,100
why did you come to us again?

611
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,100
Second Master added a small task to the list.

612
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,100
He asked me to stop you guys

613
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,100
from going with Wu Xie.

614
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:00,100
So, is this task of yours completed?

615
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,100
Yes.

616
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,100
Let's go to Guangxi with me.

617
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,100
Guangxi...

618
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,100
I don't think I can explain it to Second Master.

619
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,100
Come on.

620
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,100
You can call me to come to Guangxi.

621
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,100
I'm not here to protect you.

622
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,100
I'm here to keep this secret.

623
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,100
Okay.

624
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,100
I don't have money.

625
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,100
What are you laughing at?

626
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,100
You don't understand me.

627
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,100
Okay.

628
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,100
You can go back to your seat.

629
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,100
It's exactly the same as the museum.

630
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,100
Even the positions are different.

631
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,100
I'm sorry.

632
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,100
Look.

633
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,100
This is a painting.

634
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,100
It's connected by steps.

635
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,100
The stars are out.

636
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,100
There is a planet in his room.

637
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,100
And it's big.

638
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,100
I think we should go home.

639
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,100
Enough.

640
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,100
We have a lot to talk about.

641
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,100
Come on, bro.

642
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,100
Hand-made...

643
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,100
Hand-made class.

644
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,100
Second Master.

645
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,100
Let's start with the hand-made class.

646
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,100
Hua.

647
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,100
The photo you sent has been taken.

648
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,100
Sorry.

649
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,100
Let me do it.

650
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,100
Okay.

651
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,100
Give it to me.

652
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,100
Give it to me.

653
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,100
Give it to me.

654
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,100
On this map...

655
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,100
I'm sorry.

656
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,100
I'm sorry.

657
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,100
I'm sorry.

658
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,100
Again.

659
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,100
Again.

660
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,100
Again.

661
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,100
Again.

662
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,100
I'm sorry.

663
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,100
I'm sorry.

664
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,100
I'm sorry.

665
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,100
Again.

666
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,100
I'm sorry.

667
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,100
I have something to talk to you.

668
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,100
Come on.

669
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,100
Let's eat.

670
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,100
Hua, help her.

671
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,100
Ready.

672
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,100
I was wrong.

673
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,100
Again.

674
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,100
Look at this.

675
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,100
Don't persuade me.

676
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,100
I don't care what you say.

677
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,100
I don't care what you say.

678
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,100
I'm going to kill...

679
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,100
We're not there yet.

680
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,100
Stop acting.

681
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,100
Okay.

682
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,100
I found a big secret.

683
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,100
I'm here to share it with you.

684
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,100
Listen to me.

685
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,100
Listen to me.

686
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,100
Listen to me.

687
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,100
I found this guy.

688
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,100
I should have taken you to...

689
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,100
I should have...

690
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,100
I should have taken you to the place on the map.

691
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,100
The sacrifice.

692
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,100
The sacrifice.

693
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,100
I can drink now.

694
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,100
And I don't look red after drinking a bottle.

695
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,100
And I don't look red after drinking a bottle.

696
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,100
I can't.

697
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,100
I'm just kidding.
