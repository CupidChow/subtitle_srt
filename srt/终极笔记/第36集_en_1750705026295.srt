Listen.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
There should be a large number of Ape King

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
rushing over here.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hurry up.

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You go ahead.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll play with them.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
No Saw-Cat leads to Sang stress.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Wanna me again?

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Get me another target.

40
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,000
Mach advocated chain.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
One, two, three, two, five.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Newustering chain.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Average mentally.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Three, seven, nine, ten, twelve.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Twenty.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll change order.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,960
One, two, three, five, four.

49
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
One, two, three, five, four.

50
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,760
Is it right?

51
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,520
No.

52
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,240
Wu Xie.

53
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,640
Try the opposite order.

54
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,960
The opposite order?

55
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
It's four.

56
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,800
First off,

57
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,720
we don't have time to waste.

58
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
I think just like this,

59
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,280
we can't attack with isok

60
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,040
at this time of night.

61
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,240
Next week.

62
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,960
Year of football.

63
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,220
There's a championship,

64
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,060
it's okay from now on.

65
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,400
I watched our team

66
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,360
behave like this every day.

67
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,160
About a week ago,

68
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,600
I watched the first pre-season game

69
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,600
at that time.

70
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Hurry up!

71
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,600
Don't come over.

72
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,720
They're fast.

73
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
Be careful.

74
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Hurry up!

75
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,840
You guys go!

76
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,600
Seal the tunnel!

77
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,360
Don't let them get out!

78
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
What about you?

79
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
This is a long one.

80
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,600
You owe me a thousand taels of silver.

81
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,960
You can come back alive.

82
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,840
With your attitude,

83
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,160
I won't take you in.

84
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,400
Kind people like me

85
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,720
will definitely come back alive.

86
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Okay.

87
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Mr. Xia!

88
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Mr. Xia!

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Xiao Hua.

90
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Hurry up!

91
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Hurry up!

92
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,000
Are you sure you want to seal it?

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,400
If you seal it,

94
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,800
Mr. Xia won't be able to get out.

95
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,200
If he can get out,

96
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,600
he will definitely be able to get out.

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Take photos.

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll teach them.

99
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,560
The

100
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
The

101
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,560
The

102
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
The

103
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,560
The

104
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
The

105
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
Pack up.

106
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,760
We'll leave in half an hour.

107
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
Yes.

108
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,560
Did you send the third photo?

109
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,560
Grandma.

110
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,520
Just let me take a look at the photos.

111
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
Just one look.

112
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,520
You're leaving.

113
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,320
I'm not asking for too much.

114
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,920
When did you untie it?

115
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,280
Don't mention it.

116
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,200
This rope

117
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,000
is made of special materials.

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,800
It's been tied for two days.

119
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
But

120
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,800
I untied it an hour ago.

121
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
Hand it over.

122
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,080
I want to go with you.

123
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
Impossible.

124
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,200
I heard from the waiter.

125
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,680
You have to go down yourself.

126
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,680
If you don't let me follow you

127
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,480
I can only destroy it.

128
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
Okay.

129
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,680
You're a child of the Huo family.

130
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,680
I can't defeat you.

131
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,680
Bring another set of equipment.

132
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,680
Let him try it.

133
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
Send him out.

134
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
We're leaving right away.

135
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,480
Don't think too much.

136
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,680
Just go down.

137
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,480
Trust me, I can beat him.

138
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
I'll take care of it.

139
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Of course.

140
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,880
How come you don't want me to go down?

141
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,080
Why are you...

142
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
Go accident your grandma,

143
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
so tired of her?

144
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,280
I mean my connection has to be undone for you.

145
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,480
Go.

146
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
It was just a dream.

147
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,680
She's in a commotion.

148
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
Who's going to replace Grandma be then?

149
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,160
Here.

150
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,560
Where's my phone?

151
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,480
I heard you'll be in a coma for six hours.

152
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,640
When you woke up,

153
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,640
we should have entered Zhang's drum house.

154
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,640
Although we imitated Zhang's drum house

155
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,400
and trained many times,

156
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,320
I know that

157
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,480
we've been through a lot.

158
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,840
I have only one word.

159
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,360
You're the heir of the Huo family.

160
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,720
Take care of the Huo family.

161
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,840
Hurry.

162
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
Tianzhen, stay calm.

163
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,840
He's getting ready to freeze us into ice cubes.

164
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,300
Get him.

165
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,580
point

166
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,460
Not so fast!

167
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
It's all thanks to you.

168
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,800
Don't be so marching금

169
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,080
We certainly will attack

170
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,640
Nature's just destaunch

171
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,640
selling tofu in a sports car.

172
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,160
It's a good start.

173
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,480
A photo.

174
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,840
You came back to take photos

175
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,320
to bring them back for research?

176
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,120
The design is good.

177
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,360
It's worth researching.

178
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,480
Something's wrong.

179
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,320
What's wrong?

180
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,600
I had no idea about it.

181
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,640
Look more harder.

182
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,240
My kid has another fry.

183
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,240
My gift was sent to them somewhere.

184
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,960
It depends on physical condition.

185
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,560
This piece hasn't been pushed out.

186
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,040
Make it quick.

187
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,120
Tape it to her transport 그러니까 것들이 다 blueprint이다

188
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,540
Hurry!

189
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,320
Let's send the sketchbook to Ba Na.

190
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,040
These three photos are wrong!

191
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,520
Chief

192
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:28,840
No news from

193
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,400
Wu Xie

194
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,640
Then again take responsibility yourself

195
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,820
ni

196
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,400
suck

197
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,700
Bad guys

198
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,080
and the rest couldn't.

199
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,900
Did I hurt them?

200
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,420
Everyone has our own way

201
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,440
To protect each other

202
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,820
might as well have crosswords

203
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,380
Even if we have to bother each other

204
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,700
Believing in each other

205
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,780
I am a person who has no past and future.

206
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,180
If I disappear in this world,

207
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,700
no one will notice.

208
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,580
I don't care about myself

209
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,300
and all the traces

210
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,220
No matter how deep your secret is,

211
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,740
we will find the truth with you.

212
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,980
Who will prove the meaning of meeting?

213
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:13,420
I just want to say how lucky I am because of you.

214
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,420
You said my friend was dead.

215
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,300
I have experienced a lot of things with my friends.

216
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,700
I have also been to many places.

217
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,900
I know what kind of person he is.

218
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,020
Go!

219
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,140
Xiao Ge, you can't keep rushing forward.

220
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,940
Xiao Ge!

221
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,260
Hold on a little longer.

222
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,140
It will be here soon.

223
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,140
If you disappear, at least I will find you.

224
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,140
Fortunately, I didn't kill you.

225
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,140
I want to take you home.

226
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,820
No trace.

227
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,500
You show me hope

228
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,780
ticket 텃.

229
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,980
I will wipe out the real you.

230
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,420
dating hair properly

231
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,180
Street light

232
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,620
You also have me.

233
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,220
Flying food

234
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,020
I have a face,

235
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,540
always want to snuggle at night.

236
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,980
Have you seen your house before?

237
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,100
Whiyor have here?

238
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,700
If you don't bring it with you,

239
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,700
of course.

240
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,500
Be careful!

241
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,900
The key is to be careful!

242
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,700
It seems that

243
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,900
I'll call you Black Eye or Black blind in the future.

244
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,900
What's in there?

245
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,100
Maybe it's a trap.

246
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,300
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

247
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,100
You're sleeping too well.

248
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,100
I couldn't bear to disturb you.

249
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,700
How is it?

250
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,500
Did you hear it?

251
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,100
No.

252
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,900
Then come over here.

253
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,500
Come on.

254
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,900
I said, are you really blind or not?

255
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,900
If we can get out safely this time,

256
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,300
I'll make you a meal

257
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,300
without green pepper,

258
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,900
green pepper shredded pork.

259
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,100
Little Ninth Lord,

260
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,700
I sent someone to look for it for a long time.

261
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,100
The person who went to look for it didn't come back.

262
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,700
Little Ninth Lord,

263
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,500
let's continue to search the mountain to find Black Eye.

264
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,900
Search.

265
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,900
Yes.

266
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,700
It's already seven o'clock.

267
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,500
There's still no news.

268
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,900
I have to go and have a look.

269
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,500
Wu Xie,

270
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,700
how can you enter the secret room

271
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,900
where even Xiao Ge can't be fixed?

272
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,900
You can't go in.

273
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,900
You can't go in.

274
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,900
I'm going to check it.

275
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,900
I'm going to check it.

276
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,900
I'm going to check it.

277
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,900
I'm going to check it.

278
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,900
I'm going to check it.

279
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,100
How can you enter Zhang's Valley to find someone?

280
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,500
Old Madam Huo is still alive.

281
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,300
Is Xiu Xiu not going to look for it?

282
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,900
Xiu Xiu can't be managed.

283
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,300
Now we can only wait for things to change.

284
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,100
If the news of the accident of Chief Huo

285
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,100
is spread out,

286
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,300
let alone saving people,

287
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,500
maybe people will be blocked secretly.

288
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,700
You are the same, Wu Xie.

289
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,900
We are all ordinary people.

290
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,300
In most cases,

291
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,700
we are just a beautiful wish.

292
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,500
I know.

293
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,900
I'm just an ordinary person.

294
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,100
No matter it's Zhang's Valley's secret,

295
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,300
the secret of the mansion,

296
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,700
or the power to protect it secretly,

297
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,300
I can't control it.

298
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,100
But I still want to go.

299
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,500
I said you can't go alone.

300
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,500
Then I'll go find someone.

301
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,700
I'll find Zhuang Mei to rest.

302
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,300
I understand that you are doing things carefully.

303
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,900
But this time,

304
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,700
no one can stop me.

305
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,900
Wu Xie.

306
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,500
Okay.

307
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,700
Then wait until you're ready.

308
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,100
Come to me.

309
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,900
Okay.

310
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,700
I'll arrive in Changsha the day after tomorrow.

311
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,300
I need a few brothers to go to Guangxi.

312
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,300
Okay.

313
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,500
I'll pick you up at the airport.

314
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,700
Little Third Master.

315
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,900
Take care.

316
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,100
Long time no see.

317
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Long time no see.

318
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,700
Your hair...

319
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,300
I'm old.

320
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,100
It's inevitable.

321
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,700
Come.

322
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,300
Why did you change the car?

323
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,500
Sold it.

324
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,900
The local bandits came to take the debt.

325
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,900
I can't let them

326
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,300
say bad things about Third Master.

327
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,500
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

328
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,500
It's okay.

329
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,300
I can hold on.

330
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,300
Let's go.

331
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,300
Let's go to the car.

332
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,500
How are the brothers preparing?

333
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,900
Third Master is not here.

334
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,100
The good guys are not working in the Wu family.

335
00:19:53,300 --> 00:20:04,080
What about the guys from the

336
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,100
Three-Dragon Gate?

337
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,900
Those birds.

338
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,900
In front of Third Master,

339
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,100
they're like a dog.

340
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,300
Once Third Master leaves,

341
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,900
they have almost no contact.

342
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,700
I think

343
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,100
a human heart

344
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,300
is more disgusting

345
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,700
than a fly if it stinks.

346
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,300
Third Master is protecting you

347
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,900
and didn't let you see those.

348
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,700
Help me.

349
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,500
Come.

350
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
Pan Zi, you...

351
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,700
I've discussed with Third Master.

352
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,700
When we get old,

353
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,900
we'll live in the nursing home together.

354
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,900
I don't plan to buy a house.

355
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,900
Why don't you live in Third Uncle's place?

356
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,700
I want to live in Third Master's place.

357
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,900
I don't want to be the one

358
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,900
who tells the people on the street

359
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,300
that he won't be back soon.

360
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:15,900
Come.

361
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,100
Sit anywhere.

362
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,300
I'll call them now.

363
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,300
Mao Man Qiu,

364
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,300
I, Pan Zi,

365
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,900
have something to say.

366
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,700
Third Master is back.

367
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,300
He wants to invite us to dinner

368
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,700
to talk about the future.

369
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,500
When do you have time?

370
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,700
Okay.

371
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,300
Maybe it's not good.

372
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,100
Mao Man Qiu, wait.

373
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,900
Don't hang up.

374
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,700
I'll tell you what happened.

375
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,900
Third Master is back.

376
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,900
He wants to invite us to dinner

377
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100
to talk about the future.

378
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,300
Okay, no problem.

379
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,500
We'll be there.

380
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,900
Third Master.

381
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,700
Qiu Ren is busy.

382
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,100
If he doesn't like what you say,

383
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,300
you have to be more careful.

384
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,700
Uncle Qiu, it's been a long time.

385
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,700
How's your nephew?

386
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,700
How's your nephew?

387
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,500
Third Master, sit here.

388
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,100
What's the matter?

389
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,300
Uncle Zi Wei,

390
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,700
I'm busy with the cooking in Guangxi.

391
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,500
I wonder if you're interested.

392
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,700
Third Master,

393
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,700
you're

394
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,700
keeping a low profile.

395
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,100
Yes.

396
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,320
You were almost

397
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,460
wanted by you

398
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,300
just now.

399
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,220
It'sucking.

400
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,100
It's trash.

401
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,480
Remember,

402
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,900
I told you

403
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,900
not to take it too seriously.

404
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,300
No, I didn't say that.

405
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,100
Every member of my family

406
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,300
has some points going against them.

407
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,700
You saw that.

408
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,100
After most,

409
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,500
No one can tell the difference.

410
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,060
Besides,

411
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,260
this is the first time that Young Master San has been here.

412
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,780
Even if I'm the one who's being nice to you,

413
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,860
I'm the one who's being nice to you,

414
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,060
but the men under him

415
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,620
might not listen to me.

416
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,300
That's right, Young Master San.

417
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,900
It's not easy for everyone to get married.

418
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,540
It's been a while since we last met.

419
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,380
It's been a while.

420
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,420
Jincheng is the one who got into trouble in the defeat game.

421
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,940
You were there.

422
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,540
But I really looked up to you.

423
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,620
Okay.

424
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,420
Okay!

425
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:38,620
When you helped Young Master San take the first place with these Bashirun Oil Naples Nuts,

426
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,260
all the Eastern and West Real Estate Agency members

427
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,020
would booth

428
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,620
is just a word.

429
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:57,980
Pan Zi,

430
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,140
what are you doing?

431
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,820
All right, all right.

432
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,420
Qiu,

433
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,860
you don't know

434
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,220
Pan Zi's temper.

435
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,380
Don't say that.

436
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:14,980
All right, all right.

437
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,180
Let's talk to Young Master.

438
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,060
Young Master,

439
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,940
we're sitting here

440
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,300
to give you a promotion.

441
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,700
Even if it's for the sake of Young Master,

442
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,180
if you really want to do this,

443
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:37,780
it's easy.

444
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,780
Your uncle's house

445
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,540
and the shop in Wushanju, Hangzhou

446
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,700
will give us the property.

447
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,820
We'll help you.

448
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,620
If you succeed,

449
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,820
we'll be happy.

450
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,780
But if you don't succeed,

451
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,620
you'll be in trouble.

452
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,620
Wang Moqiu,

453
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,660
you're thinking about

454
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,940
the real estate of Young Master, right?

455
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,460
I'm telling you,

456
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,140
I, Pan Zi, have no money.

457
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,940
But even if I have to risk my life,

458
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,620
don't even think about the business of Young Master.

459
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,820
Really?

460
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,460
You're pretending to be a master here, right?

461
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,100
Wang Moqiu!

462
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,740
Let's talk.

463
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,140
At least give me a face.

464
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
You're still the youngest.

465
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,300
I'm better than you.

466
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,300
You don't know what's the situation now.

467
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,660
I'm going to kill you.

468
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,380
You old dog.

469
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,060
You can die with the property of Wu Sanxing.

470
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,020
Wang Moqiu!

471
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,780
Moqiu!

472
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,860
Don't be so bold.

473
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,580
Young Master San,

474
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,260
you dog!

475
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,860
I'll pay you tomorrow.

476
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,620
You can't find anyone even if you have money.

477
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,140
I'm sorry, Young Master San.

478
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,620
Sorry.

479
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,280
Your money

480
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,460
has gone包包.

481
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,540
Thanks a lot.

482
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,580
Here,

483
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,860
take this.

484
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,180
Take this?

485
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,260
Take it.

486
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,380
You're not going to look.

487
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,020
She's in such a mess.

488
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,820
Third Aunt said she did it for your good.

489
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,020
What about her now?

490
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,020
I'll make a call.

491
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:34,420
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

492
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,620
The subscriber you dialed...

493
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,020
How about this?

494
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,420
I think we'll wait another day.

495
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,220
I'll go to the port tomorrow.

496
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,620
I'll go with you.

497
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,820
You can't.

498
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,020
If you go,

499
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,020
it means you've lost your family.

500
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,020
The subscriber you dialed...

501
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,820
Third Master.

502
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,620
It's all your favorite.

503
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,020
Braised pork with red sauce and fried eggs.

504
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,020
Here.

505
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,420
What's going on?

506
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,420
Nothing.

507
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,020
I ran into Wang Maqiu at the port.

508
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,020
I hit him.

509
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,220
It's really nothing.

510
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,020
Third Master, I've thought it over.

511
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,020
If it's not going to work, let's go.

512
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,620
It's not too crowded.

513
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,420
No.

514
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,420
If you go,

515
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,420
Third Uncle's port will be completely destroyed.

516
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,220
Should we ask Second Master for help?

517
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,620
Okay.

518
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,620
I'll ask Second Uncle.

519
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,820
Pan Zi,

520
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,620
I've finished drinking.

521
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,220
Can you buy me a few more bottles?

522
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,220
Sure.

523
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,020
Wait here. I'll go right away.

524
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,620
Yanxi Port

525
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,420
Pan Zi,

526
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,420
I've contacted Second Uncle.

527
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,820
He's agreed to help.

528
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,620
I have to go back to the port immediately.

529
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,620
Pan Zi,

530
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,020
You've been with my Third Uncle for many years.

531
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,020
I also let you call me Little Third Master for nothing.

532
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,420
All this time,

533
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,820
what we did was too dangerous.

534
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,420
Little Third Master!

535
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,620
Your injuries have been so severe that

536
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,020
you haven't been able to rest well for a day.

537
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,820
Little Third Master, don't worry.

538
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,220
I'm very brave.

539
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,620
With me by your side, I will definitely help you.

540
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,220
I will definitely investigate these mysteries.

541
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,620
Even if it's just to protect the people around me.

542
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:42,620
Pan Zi, your mission should be over.

543
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,620
If I drag you in again,

544
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,220
I won't be able to face Third Uncle.

545
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,020
Take care of yourself.

546
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,020
Take care.

547
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,020
Wu Xie.

548
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,020
Wu Xie.

549
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,620
I've been waiting for you for a few days.

550
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,620
Why are you still here?

551
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,620
Why are you here?

552
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,620
Let's talk inside.

553
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,620
The thing fell.

554
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,620
Qian Youqing and Wei Young.

555
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,620
Listen to my song, it's like a drum.

556
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,620
It's about Su Shi.

557
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,620
And it's written wrong.

558
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,620
It's Bai Wei Young, right?

559
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,620
Thank you.

560
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,620
Thank you.

561
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,620
I heard you've encountered some problems in Changsha.

562
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,620
It's not human anymore.

563
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,620
I'm sorry.

564
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,620
Wu San Xing is really cruel.

565
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,620
He tried to lure you into the trap,

566
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,620
but you were gone.

567
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,620
Wu San Xing probably wants to play a trick again.

568
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,620
He wants to get rid of his control.

569
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,620
As long as Wu San Xing or Xie Liang Huan

570
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,620
is still alive,

571
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,620
Uncle San Xing won't die.

572
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,620
He's still in this situation.

573
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,620
You're also Wu San Xing's backer.

574
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,620
You have to remember.

575
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,620
Your choice determines the fate of the Wu family

576
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,620
and even the entire Jiu Men.

577
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,620
Xiao Hua,

578
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,620
didn't you say

579
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,620
I'm just an ordinary person?

580
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,620
I just need to check it out.

581
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,620
They can come up with my actions.

582
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,620
I'm in the dark.

583
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,620
He's in the dark.

584
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,620
I can't do anything.

585
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,620
If you're willing,

586
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,620
you can be Wu Xie.

587
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,620
What do you mean?

588
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,620
I prepared this for you.

589
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,620
A human mask?

590
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,620
When did you make it?

591
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,620
After Wu San Xing died.

592
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,620
He didn't die.

593
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,620
But he didn't show up again.

594
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,620
What does this have to do with death?

595
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,620
Wu San Xing, this old fox,

596
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,620
maybe one day

597
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,620
he'll suddenly come back.

598
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,620
Wu Xie,

599
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,620
you want to go to Ba Nai, right?

600
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,620
I can give you

601
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,620
whatever you want,

602
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,620
human power, physical power, and financial power.

603
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,620
Third Uncle is missing.

604
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,620
Old Huo's life and death are not yet determined.

605
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,620
The first generation and second generation of Jiu Men

606
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,620
are all in his hands.

607
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,620
But I

608
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,620
can't escape him.

609
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,620
That's why I came up with this method.

610
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,620
A method that can avoid him after he dies.

611
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,620
Could it be

612
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,620
that's what Third Uncle thinks?

613
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,620
Actually, I've been guessing

614
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,620
what Wu San Xing's plan is.

615
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,620
So far,

616
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,620
I've only thought of three things.

617
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,620
The first thing

618
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,620
is that Wu San Xing wants to get rid of Wu Xie.

619
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,620
He wants to use this journey

620
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,620
and his hints

621
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,620
to transfer the plan

622
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,620
to make you the next successor.

623
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,620
And the second thing

624
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,620
is that he wants to slowly

625
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,620
infiltrate his own way of thinking

626
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,620
to you.

627
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,620
He wants you to understand him

628
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,620
and to fight against him.

629
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,620
And the third thing

630
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,620
is to make you the Wu San Xing

631
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,620
and the Wu San Xing

632
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,620
and become the executor of the plan.

633
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,620
And to interfere with his vision again.

634
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,620
He...

635
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,620
He...

636
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,620
Chen Wen Jin was the one who said that.

637
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,620
The team has been being watched by others.

638
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,620
My Second Uncle was the one who said that.

639
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,620
In the process,

640
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,620
they must have found some clues.

641
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,620
They will form an idea

642
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,620
about the clues.

643
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,620
Even Xie Lian Huan is saying that now.

644
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,620
It's all because of him

645
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,620
that we have become like this.

646
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,620
He has been controlling the people of the Nine Gates

647
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,620
and has been searching for the immortality.

648
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,620
I think the people of the Nine Gates

649
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,620
must not be like this.

650
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,620
Some people

651
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,620
are trying to fight against him.

652
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,620
And Wu San Xing is one of them.

653
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,620
I understand what you mean.

654
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,620
Chen Wen Jin and the others are all wrong.

655
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,620
He is not a person

656
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,620
and he is not an organization.

657
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,620
He is the combination of all the people

658
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,620
who want to get the immortality since ancient times.

659
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,620
Whether it's the archaeological team from many years ago

660
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,620
or our western investigation team.

661
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,620
He is very likely to be the one

662
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,620
who was in the team

663
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,620
and will be affected by the desire.

664
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,620
This is the mental confusion you are talking about.

665
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,620
That's why he will be ignorant

666
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,620
and not be there.

667
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,620
And the so-called loyalty

668
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,620
is not a real loyalty.

669
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,620
Maybe it's just a legend.

670
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,620
Because of this legend,

671
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,620
many people have started

672
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,620
this exploration journey.

673
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,620
Chen Wen Jin, Xiao Ge, you, me

674
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,620
may all be the witnesses of the legend.

675
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,620
It's a pity

676
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,620
that I lost Xiao Ge.

677
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,620
You can go now.

678
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,620
Now it seems

679
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,620
my Third Uncle

680
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,620
never really existed.

681
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,620
He can only hide

682
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,620
behind the world

683
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,620
and maybe

684
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,620
he is just an identity.

685
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,620
A guide.

686
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,620
A person who took me into the game.

687
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,620
You all say I am a man of the heaven.

688
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,620
But I never thought so.

689
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,620
The exchange needs long-term training.

690
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,620
I was raised like this.

691
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,620
I learned to write poetry since I was a child.

692
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,620
I accompanied my grandfather

693
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,620
to listen to all kinds of mystery stories.

694
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,620
I accompanied my Third Uncle

695
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,620
to explore various places.

696
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,620
My growth experience

697
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,620
is the most suspicious.

698
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,620
I was chosen,

699
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,620
I was trained,

700
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,620
and I was chosen by the heaven.

701
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,620
Maybe it's just to replace someone.

702
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,620
Even

703
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,620
if it's just one of the many substitutes.

704
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,620
After all, there is only one person in the video.

705
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,620
It's exactly the same as me.

706
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,620
If I am older,

707
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,620
I will be more immortal and heavy.

708
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,620
So

709
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,620
this replacement is also a kind of immortality.

710
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,620
The immortality of identity.

711
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,620
Wu Xie,

712
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,620
you have no choice.

713
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,620
Because you are a man of the heaven.

714
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,620
Maybe

715
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,620
as long as there is a plan that is enough to be loyal

716
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,620
and enough rich details,

717
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,620
the fake can also become real.

718
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,620
I can also become that person.

719
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,620
Do you still want to continue investigating?

720
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,620
Investigate.

721
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,620
If this is the mission I have been given all my life,

722
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,620
I want to see

723
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:41,620
what is behind this mission.

724
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,620
Don't worry.

725
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,620
I am the third master of the Wu family.

726
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,620
Okay.

727
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,620
Third master.

728
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,620
Third master.

729
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,620
How long can this last?

730
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,620
At most four weeks.

731
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,620
The mask has been on for too long.

732
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,620
I can't take it off.

733
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,620
Because the path to find the truth is still continuing.

734
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,620
The path is still continuing.

735
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,620
Xiao Hua is right.

736
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,620
The secrets of the immortality,

737
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,620
the secrets of Zhang Qilin,

738
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,620
and the secrets of the Nine Gates

739
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,620
are all in the Zhang family's ancient building.

740
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,620
Because of my mistake,

741
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,620
Xiao Ge, Fatty,

742
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,620
or the old lady's whereabouts are unknown,

743
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,620
Third Uncle and the blind man are still alive.

744
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,620
I never felt so lonely and weightless.

745
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,620
But I can't stop.

746
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,620
For these living and dead people,

747
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,620
the people who were trapped,

748
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,620
the people who were trapped,

749
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,620
the people who were trapped,

750
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,620
the people who were trapped,

751
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,620
the people who were trapped,

752
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,620
I want to step on the path I chose again.

753
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,620
This time,

754
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,620
I want to take them home.

755
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:11,620
No fear of the most evil place

756
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:16,620
