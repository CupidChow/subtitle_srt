1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this in the future, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this in the future, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this in the future, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this in the future, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this in the future, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this in the future, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this in the future, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this in the future, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this in the future, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this in the future, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
...

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
...

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
...

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
...

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
...

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
...

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
...

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I've watched a lot of videos of you.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
My eyes are blind.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You're like a snowflake to me.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But there's only half a minute of content in one plate.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What content?

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
A woman crawling on the ground.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Stop eating.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Have you seen the Five-leafed Bear? It's a bit like that.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Do you know who that woman is?

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
My aunt Huo Ling.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Don't you think it's scary?

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What's so scary about it?

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The place where the video was taken was in a nursing home in the Gormu.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Those people from the Xisha Investigation Team...

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
They've been there since they came out.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Do you know that there was another person who climbed the floor your aunt Huo Ling climbed?

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Who?

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Wu Xie.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Wu Xie?

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But it's just like Wu Xie.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So what you see is probably just someone who looks like your aunt.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What about my aunt? Where did she go?

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't know.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But I know your aunt will be fine.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
By the way, did you open the tape?

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I know.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Wu Xie found the key and the note in the tape.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But I opened all these tapes.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I even used magnifying glass to look at them.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I even used a pen and a marker.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I doubt that these people sent these tapes to stimulate my grandmother.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I spent a lot of effort to get these tapes from Yin Nan Feng.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's a waste of effort.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't you think that without your grandmother's help,

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yin Nan Feng wouldn't give you the tapes?

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You mean that my grandmother let me see the tapes?

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Even if there's a clue in the tape,

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
your grandmother would have erased it.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But why would my grandmother do that?

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
To make you give up.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
She underestimated my curiosity.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Brother Hua, since this clue is broken,

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
where should we look for it?

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Changsha.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Changsha.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Brother, I finally know your identity.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're a farmer.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You're a very poor farmer.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Chu Gongtong didn't lie to me.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I have a photo.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Don't move.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Brother, did you remember something?

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Is there a secret door here?

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Brother, did you put a trap in your house?

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
No.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What's wrong?

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
A letter.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Brother, you don't have to open the house.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What is it?

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Why is it so heavy?

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Someone is stealing.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Let's go.

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Chase them.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's too heavy.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Brother, you're too fast.

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Stop talking nonsense.

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Chase them.

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Wait.

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Brother.

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Brother.

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Are you okay?

92
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Brother.

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Brother.

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Brother, his tattoo looks like yours.

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This guy is from Ningxiu.

96
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He runs so fast.

97
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Stop talking nonsense.

98
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Chase them.

99
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Wu Xie.

100
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Let's go.

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't look at me.

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Where are they?

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
They ran away.

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
They ran away?

105
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Why didn't you chase them?

106
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We lost them.

107
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
There's someone who can't be chased.

108
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What's the matter with him?

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We lost them too.

110
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Why don't we take a break here?

111
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We can't go back.

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let's go.

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Let's go.

114
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let's go.

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Why don't we take a break here?

116
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Watch your iron box.

117
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's cool.

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's cool.

119
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Stop.

120
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Don't touch me.

121
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Don't touch me.

122
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Don't touch me.

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't touch me.

124
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay.

125
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's better to get poisoned than to get hit.

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Let's take a bath.

127
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Let's help Brother recover his memory.

128
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Let's help you recover your memory.

129
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Brother.

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Your underwear.

131
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I chose it.

132
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's unique.

133
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's still my pair of eyes.

134
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I found that you were crying.

135
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It represents a shining heart.

136
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Let's take a bath.

137
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This is Third Master's house?

138
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's Xielan Huan's house.

139
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
He's missing in Xiwangmugong.

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
He's still alive.

141
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But I believe he didn't die so easily.

142
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He has a deep connection with the whole thing.

143
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So I think he must have some clues.

144
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Let's go.

145
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'll leave the door to you.

146
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Why me again?

147
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I told you I didn't see anything wrong last night.

148
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's that man with the shoulder.

149
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You said I was drunk.

150
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
If I didn't see it with my own eyes,

151
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I wouldn't believe that someone with the shoulder

152
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
could be so weak.

153
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
No.

154
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I saw the photo

155
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
earlier than Chen Wenjin in the Gormu.

156
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
How old is he?

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Half a year.

158
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He's not that old.

159
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's said that

160
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
he's an old man.

161
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
At least he's over 60 years old.

162
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That's strange.

163
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He's already this old.

164
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
How can he still be so good?

165
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Even Xiaoge can't catch up with him.

166
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I know.

167
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He's the same as Chen Wenjin.

168
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You mean he's also a mutation?

169
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Think about it.

170
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
If Huoling is not old,

171
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
he'll become a virgin.

172
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If he's not old,

173
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
he'll become a man with the shoulder.

174
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And when I fought with him,

175
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I hit him on the body.

176
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's like hitting a rotten mud.

177
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's right.

178
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
He must also be a mutation.

179
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's not that mysterious.

180
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But we've met a mutation every time.

181
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Xiaoge,

182
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
what's the point of

183
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
stealing this?

184
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What's the point?

185
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
There must be something

186
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
inside.

187
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Don't move!

188
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What's inside?

189
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What's inside?

190
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't feel good.

191
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What Xiaoge doesn't feel good about

192
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
is to stay away from him.

193
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Wenjin!

194
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Wenjin!

195
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Wenjin!

196
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
What's this?

197
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Wenjin!

198
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Wenjin!

199
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Xiaoge,

200
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
it doesn't look that dangerous.

201
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What's going on?

202
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It looks like

203
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
a bomb.

204
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's not a grenade, is it?

205
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Are you crazy?

206
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You put a grenade under the bed.

207
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
If you dream and hit it,

208
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
you'll always be in your dream.

209
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You'll always be in your dream.

210
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What if...

211
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Right?

212
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's not a bad thing.

213
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Do you have any sense?

214
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Xiaoge,

215
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
can you see anything?

216
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Only the skin is made of iron.

217
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
How do you know?

218
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's too light.

219
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There's nothing wrong with it.

220
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
How did you know?

221
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You don't know?

222
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
We're both smart.

223
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
How can we compare to Xiaoge?

224
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You're smart, I'm smart.

225
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Besides, why should I compare to Xiaoge?

226
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
We should learn to live long and live short.

227
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Right?

228
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Buying a bicycle is not enough.

229
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Do you think

230
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
there's something that needs to be preserved in the iron?

231
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I forgot.

232
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
This iron...

233
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Is it the thing

234
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
that the first batch of inspection team

235
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
is looking for?

236
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Xiaoge hid it

237
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
to be careful.

238
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And this thing...

239
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm afraid it wasn't that simple at the time.

240
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Look!

241
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
This is a thief.

242
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
This is a thief.

243
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
We want to talk to him.

244
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
He ran away.

245
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Not us.

246
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
This is it.

247
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You mean he's looking for this iron?

248
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
He's looking for the person who came to find the iron.

249
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
He must know

250
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
that the iron is in the corner.

251
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
If he wanted to find the iron,

252
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
he could have taken it away.

253
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Why did he come to steal it today?

254
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Then, according to you,

255
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
we should meet him.

256
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
We should take our time.

257
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Let's go back and get the photo.

258
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's on fire.

259
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Drop the lantern.

260
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Zhou Ping.

261
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Hurry up!

262
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Hurry up!

263
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Hurry up!

264
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Hurry up!

265
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Xiaoge!

266
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Hurry up!

267
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Hurry up!

268
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Over there!

269
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Hurry up!

270
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Over there!

271
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
We can't wait.

272
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
They didn't protect the stone.

273
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
They're burning the incense.

274
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
We can't go.

275
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Come on!

276
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Xiaoge!

277
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Xiaoge!

278
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Hurry up!

279
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Hurry up!

280
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Xiaoge!

281
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Xiao Hua.

282
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
There's nothing here.

283
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The cabinet is empty.

284
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
The screen is empty.

285
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Even the Buddha statue is empty.

286
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I think no one has ever come here

287
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
since you went to the Buddha statue.

288
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But someone gave this basin two days ago.

289
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Aunt Dasao gave it to you.

290
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Look.

291
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Look.

292
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
If Aunt Dasao came here,

293
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
this room should be clean.

294
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You mean,

295
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Third Master...

296
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Xie...

297
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
He came here?

298
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
This basin is mine.

299
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Because of this poem?

300
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Mu Song Gu Hong

301
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Chu Yun Wan

302
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Black and white are the same.

303
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
The poem is gone.

304
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
The other poem's basin is at my house.

305
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Actually, Xie Lian Huan

306
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
still misses you.

307
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
My grandfather left this basin.

308
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
He misses Ninth Master.

309
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Not me.

310
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Let's go to the study.

311
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Let's go.

312
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Xiao Hua, come and see.

313
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
This kind of useless computer

314
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
can't even be seen in the waste collection station.

315
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Xie Lian Huan is really old.

316
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'll go.

317
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Why does Xie Lian Huan

318
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
have an empty computer at home?

319
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Is it for display?

320
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's not empty.

321
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's deleted.

322
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Look, sir.

323
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
After a word is formalized,

324
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
it will automatically generate hidden files.

325
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And the date of creation of this hidden file

326
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
is the formalization time.

327
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Three hours ago?

328
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So someone came here three hours ago

329
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and even destroyed the data.

330
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It seems that we are still late.

331
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Could it be Xie Lian Huan himself?

332
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's possible.

333
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
After all,

334
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
he just disappeared in the West Palace.

335
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
No one knows where he will go.

336
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It may also be someone else.

337
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
But this person

338
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
must know the secret of Xie Lian Huan pretending to be Wu San Xing.

339
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So the clue is broken again.

340
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That may not be so.

341
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Maybe they don't think it's that important.

342
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
We will think it's very important.

343
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What are you doing?

344
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Well,

345
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'll leave the thing to you.

346
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'll find a place to rest.

347
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Isn't there a chair there?

348
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'll recognize the bed.

349
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Xiu Xiu, come here.

350
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Look, someone touched this.

351
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
How do you know?

352
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Look at this line.

353
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The outside is so old.

354
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
But the inside is a new wood color.

355
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
This place used to be full of books.

356
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Maybe

357
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
this layer can find some clues.

358
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'll go to the room.

359
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'll go to the room.

360
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Come on, come on.

361
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's so heavy.

362
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
How can you stand it?

363
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Thank you, Mr. Fatty.

364
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Don't call me Mr. Fatty.

365
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm not a few years older than you.

366
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Just call me Fatty.

367
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
How is the boss who doesn't talk?

368
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You mean Xiao Ge?

369
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
He's fine. Don't look at his thin.

370
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
He's hit.

371
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It's not a scratch.

372
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You give him medicine.

373
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It doesn't hurt.

374
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
That's our ancestral recipe.

375
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
We often have insect bites in summer.

376
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Every family has it.

377
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Yuncai,

378
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
have you seen anyone

379
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
with his shoulders in the village?

380
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Someone like this?

381
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
No.

382
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Is there anyone living in the corner building

383
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
that was burned today?

384
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It's all in a mess.

385
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
No one went there.

386
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It's getting late.

387
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Go to bed early.

388
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Good night.

389
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm leaving.

390
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Go to bed early.

391
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm leaving.

392
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It's so

393
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
comfortable.

394
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Today, it's not a coincidence.

395
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
We just found the corner building.

396
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
The back building caught fire.

397
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Right.

398
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I smelled it when I arrived.

399
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It must be

400
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
his shoulders.

401
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
At least it's not him.

402
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It's a long way from the river.

403
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
He can't run there so fast.

404
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
He might burn the building.

405
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You mean

406
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
he has friends?

407
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Brother,

408
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
the water is ready. Come and soak your feet.

409
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Don't bother him.

410
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Okay?

411
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Okay, I'll pour more.

412
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
If I knew it earlier, I would have taken the picture.

413
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Now,

414
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
everything is gone.

415
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Brother, you took it out of the fire?

416
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Brother,

417
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
it's okay.

418
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It's half way done.

419
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It's not that strong.

420
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
This woman is Chen Wenqin.

421
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Who is this man?

422
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
This is Panma's father, right?

423
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
This picture

424
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
is old.

425
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Panma's father is the most powerful hunter in our village.

426
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Right, he is

427
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
the one I told you about.

428
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
This picture looks like he is 30 years old.

429
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I was young.

430
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I was young.

431
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Panma's father

432
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
won't die, right?

433
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
His body is still strong.

434
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Come on.

435
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Come on.

436
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
This is Panma's father's house.

437
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
His house

438
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
is for tourists to eat and live.

439
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
No problem.

440
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Where is your father?

441
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
He went into the mountain early in the morning.

442
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
He went into the mountain?

443
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Mr. Pang,

444
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
he has to go into the mountain for a long time before he can come out.

445
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I told you.

446
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
We can't find someone to do such a good thing.

447
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
It won't be a good time.

448
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Mr. A Gui,

449
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
these people are...

450
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
These people are the big bosses in the city.

451
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
They are here to invest in the development of tourism projects.

452
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Right, right, right.

453
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Look, boss.

454
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
This is Panma's father

455
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
who came back from the mountain in person.

456
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
These meat

457
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
will be cooked in the fire

458
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and then sealed

459
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
with salt from the old salt well.

460
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It will be eaten in three years.

461
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Is Panma's father here?

462
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You are here.

463
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Let's go inside.

464
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
That...

465
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
You may not be here in time.

466
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
My father hasn't come back yet.

467
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It's quite lively today.

468
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Everyone is here to find Panma's father.

469
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Do you think this person

470
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
is quite familiar with dressing up?

471
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Judging from his style,

472
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
do you think of Ning?

473
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
You drink some water first.

474
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Here.

475
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You went into the mountain again?

476
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
What's wrong with your father?

477
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
He only went into the mountain when I came in.

478
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You know that my father has been

479
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
going into the mountain for three days.

480
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Why don't you sit down and wait?

481
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
He may be back soon.

482
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Let me remind you.

483
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
You have already received the deposit.

484
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Don't worry.

485
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
If you agree, the thing will be yours.

486
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Your father doesn't need that thing.

487
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
You should sell it earlier.

488
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You can enjoy your life with the money.

489
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
That's right. I told him that too.

490
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Enough.

491
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
If you succeed, it will be good for you.

492
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
My father will be back soon.

493
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I will send you the message.

494
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
They are here as well.

495
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You mean tourists?

496
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Tourists?

497
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I don't think so.

498
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Keep an eye on them.

499
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Yes.

500
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I just want to remind you

501
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
that if you have a baby

502
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
don't rush to ask for the price.

503
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Look.

504
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
If we meet today, it's fate.

505
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Right? How about this?

506
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
You take it out and your brother will give you a massage.

507
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Yes. It doesn't matter if he sees it.

508
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
He knows the business. At least he will know the price.

509
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Don't let him know, right?

510
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
That's right.

511
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
What kind of baby

512
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
does my father have?

513
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Cicada?

514
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Cicada?

515
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
That's a good one.

516
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You are good people.

517
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I'll tell you the truth.

518
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
My father has something

519
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
that he hides

520
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
like a baby.

521
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
He said that he picked it up from the mountains.

522
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
But I asked someone to look at it.

523
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
They said it was a worthless piece of iron.

524
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Iron?

525
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Look.

526
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
There are many kinds of iron.

527
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Some are not valuable.

528
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
But some are valuable.

529
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Maybe the person you are looking for

530
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
is not a good one.

531
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Right?

532
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I heard that you have already paid the person.

533
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Are you in a hurry?

534
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
How about this? You take it out and my brother will give you a massage.

535
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
My son is waiting for money to go to school.

536
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
How can I not pay him?

537
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But I told my father that I wanted to sell it.

538
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I can't find it.

539
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I don't know what the old man thinks.

540
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
You read it all night?

541
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Yes.

542
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You are really good.

543
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Did you find anything?

544
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
All are worthless materials.

545
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
But I found this one.

546
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
The middle page was torn off.

547
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Can you see what it is?

548
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Can you see what it is?

549
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
This is a mark.

550
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Normally, you can't see it.

551
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You need professional equipment.

552
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You mean, there is no way out?

553
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I mean, I have a wide range of connections.

554
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
If you have a professional friend in Changsha,

555
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
you can help us.

556
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I think this piece of iron

557
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
should be thrown by Pan Ma's father into the mountain.

558
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
The old man is worried.

559
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
He went into the mountain every three or five.

560
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Don't worry about hiding it.

561
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
In the end,

562
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
you have to get it into the mouth of Mr. Fatty.

563
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Tianzhen, I'm not bragging to you.

564
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You go to Pan Jun'er to ask questions.

565
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
No one can compare me to Fatty Wang.

566
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
No, I don't understand.

567
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You are not a good person.

568
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
You are not a good person.

569
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
You are not a good person.

570
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I don't understand.

571
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
What is wrapped in this piece of iron?

572
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Why is it so difficult to do?

573
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
This piece of iron is not good.

574
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Here.

575
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Here.

576
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
There is no way to do it.

577
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
The whole village's piece of iron

578
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
is broken by you.

579
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
How about this?

580
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I go to the county town

581
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
to get some sulfuric acid.

582
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
This sulfuric acid can melt iron.

583
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
You wait.

584
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I don't believe it.

585
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Yesterday is just a moment.

586
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Brother,

587
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
can you remember the tattoo on his shoulder?

588
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Yes.

589
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
You paint it

590
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
like you do.

591
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
It's different.

592
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Fatty has been gone for so long.

593
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Why hasn't he come back?

594
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Did something happen?

595
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Sister Yun Sai,

596
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
you walk slowly.

597
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
You are fat like my eyes.

598
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I can't keep up with your pace.

599
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
People in the mountains hide when they see horse stables.

600
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
You are good.

601
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I want to

602
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
pick a piece of fresh honey for you.

603
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
We are poor in the mountains.

604
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
But we can't buy fresh honey.

605
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Can we buy it like picking?

606
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
There is a missing key flavor.

607
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
What flavor?

608
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Heart flavor.

609
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I want to buy it.

610
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I want to buy it.

611
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Sister Yun Sai,

612
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
wait for me.

613
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I can't.

614
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I can't see it.

615
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You paint it

616
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
like you do.

617
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
You are poor in the mountains.

618
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,260
I want to buy it.

619
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,260
I got it.

620
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,260
I got it.

621
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
If you are right,

622
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
the brush and the style,

623
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
this Qiong Qi and Xiao Ge's

624
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Qilin tattoo

625
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
should be the same series.

626
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's like it's from an artist.

627
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Do you think Xiao Ge is related to the horse stables?

628
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You are too obvious.

629
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I have a reasonable

630
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
and reasonable conclusion.

631
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Think about it.

632
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Xiao Ge's tattoo is so special.

633
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
If it's not related to Xiao Ge,

634
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
how can there be similar tattoos in the same place?

635
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Xiao Ge,

636
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
do you really have no impression?

637
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Maybe,

638
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
this is the family's ancestral ashes.

639
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Look, like Qilin, Qiong Qi,

640
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Taotie, Taowu,

641
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
these are all the series of gods.

642
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
One is pink, one is...

643
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
This is a good idea.

644
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Their families see each other,

645
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
don't have to talk much,

646
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
take off their clothes and show their faces,

647
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
and they don't know who is the grandfather and grandson.

648
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Xiao Ge,

649
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
you are too obvious. Who is the grandfather and grandson?

650
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You are the grandson.

651
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I have no problem with that.

652
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I want to be related to Xiao Ge.

653
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I have a lot of skills,

654
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
plus I have a good family.

655
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I can be the grandson.

656
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Right, grandfather?

657
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
No.

658
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Fine.

659
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Xiao Ge is still an honest person.

660
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I will never cheat him.

661
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
But,

662
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I think my inference is reasonable.

663
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Tianzhen,

664
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
you are also from the Jiumen.

665
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
You never heard about Qiong Qi's tattoo?

666
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I know more about the Jiumen than Xiao Ge.

667
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
If only he was still here.

668
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I can ask him.

669
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Who?

670
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Your third uncle.

671
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
He is a scheming guy.

672
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
How can he tell you the truth?

673
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Someone might know.

674
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
What is this?

675
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Let me see.

676
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Qiong Qi?

677
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Qiong Qi?

678
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Hello, Wu Xie.

679
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Xiao Hua, I sent you a photo.

680
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I saw it. It's Qiong Qi.

681
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
This is a tattoo.

682
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Do you know who has this tattoo?

683
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
No. Let me check it for you.

684
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Okay.

685
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
This is the letter E.

686
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
The letter E is...

687
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It looks more like Xiang Xi.

688
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Xiang Xi?

689
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Xiang Xi is a big place.

690
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Look at these two bars.

691
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
They are different.

692
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Can you tell what this is?

693
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Are you a reliable friend?

694
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
It's hard to find the trace of the tattoo.

695
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It's good that we can get this clue.

696
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
But this is too vague.

697
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Except for the line ring,

698
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
who can tell what this is?

699
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Let's ask him.

700
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Are you kidding me?

701
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
We can't find the line ring.

702
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
We don't need to go around the circle.

703
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
If we can't find it,

704
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
we can contact him.

705
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Someone will know about it.

706
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Do you know who is in contact with him?

707
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Tuoba.

708
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Tuoba?

709
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Tuoba?

710
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Hua Yi, we are friends.

711
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
No, no.

712
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Let's not talk about this.

713
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Let's drink.

714
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
You are a big deal.

715
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Why do you have to go to Tamtou

716
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
with Wu Sanxi?

717
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I am a rich man.

718
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I don't make much money.

719
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Although I am a small business,

720
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
it tastes good.

721
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You can try it.

722
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Hua Yi, from now on,

723
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
this is your kitchen.

724
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Don't eat outside.

725
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Eat at home.

726
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Tuoba, I am not here to eat or drink.

727
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Hua Yi,

728
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
you can talk.

729
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
How did you find Tamtou

730
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
when Wu Sanxi was a horseman?

731
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I introduced him to a brother.

732
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Do you want to find him?

733
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I will go to find him now.

734
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Something is wrong.

735
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I don't think he heard it.

736
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Okay.

737
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
There is a small box.

738
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Brother, hurry.

739
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Hurry.

740
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Hurry.

741
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Hurry.

742
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I am here for you.

743
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Let me understand

744
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
some of the reasons.

745
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I am not sure

746
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
but the reason

747
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
is that I need you to listen.

748
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Where is it?

749
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
This is your house.

750
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Don't touch it.

751
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Wu Xie.

752
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Wu Xie.

753
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It seems okay.

754
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
More.

755
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I hit him.

756
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It's like hitting a mud.

757
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Let's do it again.

758
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Photos.

759
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I am afraid of the red hair.

760
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I hit him with a handbrake.

761
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
If I hit him with a hat,

762
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I will never be in the air.

763
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I have to see it.

764
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
The clue is on the right.

765
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
One more.

766
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I am here.

767
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
What is the name of Fat Boss?

768
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I am Fat Boss.

769
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
He is not fat.

770
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
He is strong.

771
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Come on.

772
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Come to our place to develop a travel project.

773
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Two or three years.

774
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
You can eat it.

775
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
It tastes good.

776
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
The words are messy.

777
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Excuse me.

778
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
The old restaurant I just went to

779
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
is not right. Should I say the restaurant?

780
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I want to have a family with Brother.

781
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I want to have a family with Brother.

782
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Let me do it.

783
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
From your grandson's house to your house.

784
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Like this.

785
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Okay.

786
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Today.

787
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Okay.

788
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Okay.

789
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Okay.
