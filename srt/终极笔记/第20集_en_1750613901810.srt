1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,860
Chief Internal Officer

2
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,100
Episode 23

3
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,360
Did you work for the company?

4
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,280
You told me you saved Naruang's life.

5
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,040
According to my words,

6
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,240
the thing killed Yuiniang is between Li Chang and Yuwen Malin.

7
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,320
And fortunately,

8
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:25,280
General Ma has those

9
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,640
nasal antibiotics as well.

10
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,640
A big family can't even get a pound of rice a month.

11
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,520
The food brought by the inspection team

12
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,240
is too tempting for us.

13
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
Found it.

14
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,640
So much.

15
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,960
It's been a year for our family.

16
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,640
Let's go. Hurry.

17
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,040
Hurry.

18
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,640
Hurry.

19
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
Listen.

20
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,640
Every bag can only hold 20,000 meters.

21
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,240
If you get too much, they'll find out.

22
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,240
Do you hear me?

23
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
Cai Wang.

24
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,040
Did you see that pot?

25
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,640
It's full of oil.

26
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,640
Go get some.

27
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
Hurry.

28
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
Hurry.

29
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,640
Too much.

30
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
Below.

31
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Below.

32
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
Below.

33
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,040
Don't move.

34
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,040
Hurry.

35
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
What are you doing?

36
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
Pan Ma.

37
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,640
As the head of the team,

38
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,640
you stole the money from the inspection team.

39
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,640
We're so hungry.

40
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,640
Let us go.

41
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,440
We won't do it again.

42
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,240
Stop making excuses.

43
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,840
Let's go.

44
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,440
Go with me to the captain.

45
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,040
I won't go.

46
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,440
I won't go.

47
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:50,840
Go.

48
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,440
I won't go.

49
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,040
Go.

50
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
Go.

51
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
Go.

52
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,840
Pan Ma.

53
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
He...

54
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,840
He's not dead, is he?

55
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,440
What?

56
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,440
I killed someone.

57
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,440
What should I do?

58
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,440
I killed someone.

59
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
What should I do?

60
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,640
Calm down.

61
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,640
If you keep shouting,

62
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,440
they'll come for the others.

63
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,640
They can't escape.

64
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,640
They'll be shot.

65
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,640
Do you know that?

66
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,440
Okay.

67
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,040
Pan Ma, what should we do now?

68
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
Take him up.

69
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
Follow me.

70
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Okay.

71
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,440
Hurry.

72
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,440
Hurry.

73
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
Hurry.

74
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,440
Hurry.

75
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,440
Hurry.

76
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,440
You...

77
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
You...

78
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
You...

79
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
What should we do?

80
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440
It's over.

81
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,440
Pan Ma, let's run.

82
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
There are two of them.

83
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,440
Where can we escape?

84
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
We can't hide anymore.

85
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,440
We'll be in the mountains forever.

86
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
What should we do?

87
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
Two people are dead.

88
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
The killer is dead.

89
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,840
Let's kill them all

90
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,440
while they're sleeping.

91
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,440
Pan Ma will bite to death.

92
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,040
The others will think

93
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,440
that the people outside did it.

94
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Pan Ma, say something.

95
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,040
We'll listen to you.

96
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,440
Yes.

97
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,440
Say something.

98
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,440
No.

99
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,440
Pan Ma, calm down.

100
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
Don't make a mistake.

101
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
Calm down.

102
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
Pan Ma.

103
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,440
We almost killed the entire investigation team.

104
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,440
We were blinded.

105
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,440
like a beast.

106
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,440
I couldn't control myself.

107
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,440
We threw the corpse into the lake.

108
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
But...

109
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
But...

110
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
What happened in my life

111
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,440
was the most horrible thing I've ever seen.

112
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,440
Move that here.

113
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
Come on.

114
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
Be careful.

115
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
Be careful.

116
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
Wait.

117
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Move the equipment carefully.

118
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
Okay.

119
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
Who's there?

120
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
Peng Peng, calm down.

121
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
Don't do anything wrong.

122
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Why are you looking at us like that?

123
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
What's wrong?

124
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Are you okay?

125
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Today is not the day to send Bu Ji, right?

126
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
Why are you here?

127
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
I...

128
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Hunting.

129
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
Hunting?

130
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
Hunting here?

131
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Didn't I tell you?

132
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
Don't come here except for sending Bu Ji.

133
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Let's go.

134
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
Okay.

135
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,440
People can't come back to life.

136
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
They must be monsters.

137
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
The monsters in the lake.

138
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Are you sure they are the same as before?

139
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
The same.

140
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
What?

141
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
You don't believe it?

142
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
I believe it.

143
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
But they are a little different from before.

144
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,440
They have a strange smell.

145
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,440
It's the smell of the dead.

146
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,440
So you always think that Xiao Ge is dangerous.

147
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,440
Xiao Ge has this smell.

148
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,440
So you think he is a person who comes back to life after death.

149
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
But after death, he is not dangerous.

150
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
People who come back to life may not harm people.

151
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
Why are you so scared?

152
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Did something happen after that?

153
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,440
The people who went together that year.

154
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
Then they went to the lake.

155
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
They met the monsters in the lake.

156
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
After they arrived at the lake,

157
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
they all died.

158
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
Died?

159
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Er Fu and Cai Wang were hanged at the gate of the house.

160
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,440
Ding Fu was killed by drinking pesticide.

161
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,440
You mean they killed themselves?

162
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
Everyone in the village says so.

163
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,440
But I know they can't kill themselves.

164
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,440
They were killed by the monsters in the lake.

165
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
I'm scared.

166
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,440
I sneaked into the mountain and hid for three years before I came back.

167
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Xiao Ge, no wonder he doesn't know you.

168
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,440
He hid in the mountain for a few years.

169
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
It happened to be you who lived here for a while.

170
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
Iron ore, what is it?

171
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
I don't know either.

172
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
I don't know.

173
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,440
I sneaked back for three years and I'm still scared.

174
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
I went to the lake again.

175
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,440
I picked up some clothes there.

176
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,440
The iron ore is in the clothes.

177
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,440
This iron ore also has that strange smell.

178
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,440
It was very strong.

179
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,440
It was gone after a long time.

180
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,440
Who is that man on the other shoulder?

181
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
Why did you kill us?

182
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
I don't know who he is.

183
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,440
But he knew everything I did.

184
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,440
He especially told me that if someone came to investigate the survey team that year,

185
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,440
they would be led to the water bull head ditch.

186
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,440
It seems that this man on the other shoulder is the one who protects the secret.

187
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,440
There's something strange about him.

188
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
You first.

189
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
し Mak cav up

190
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,440
Si Paoz ,what are you doing?

191
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,440
Let me check Xiao Ge whether it's a living person or a monster.

192
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
Monster

193
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
What he said

194
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,360
is mostly

195
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,840
what he imagined

196
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,920
I believe that the dead person will never come back to life

197
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,360
And there is no demon in the lake

198
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,240
Then how do you explain

199
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
the re-birth of the dead person?

200
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,480
The one who went into the mountain and went out of the mountain

201
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,200
is not the same team

202
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,280
You mean

203
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,480
no one is reborn after death

204
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,760
The ones who came out later are another group of people

205
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,800
Yes

206
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,400
Another group of people, Ye Le Rong

207
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,840
They lied to the horse

208
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,520
I think

209
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,880
this is a conspiracy that has been planned for a long time

210
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,680
In the original plan

211
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
The first batch of inspection team

212
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,240
was originally bought and replaced

213
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,800
But the horse accidentally intervened and killed someone

214
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,200
So the second batch of people took the opportunity

215
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,720
to take it directly

216
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,880
And the demon in the lake

217
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,440
should be Chen Wenjing, Huo Ling and others

218
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,720
They happened to go to the lake that night

219
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,720
and hid together

220
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,120
Later, the three people who were with the horse were found

221
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,440
and mistakenly thought they were demons

222
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,960
But the second batch of people didn't know about this

223
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,520
They were just worried that

224
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,720
the people who helped them

225
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
would tell the truth

226
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,480
So

227
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,840
in order to hide the truth

228
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
they took the three people who took the horse

229
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,840
and sealed them

230
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
No

231
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,520
Yes

232
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,920
Then why didn't it happen

233
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,560
when the horse was going the next day?

234
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,520
If the horse was killed on the spot

235
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,920
wouldn't it be suspected?

236
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,520
This team

237
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,400
went to West Desert shortly after

238
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,120
The second team planned this operation

239
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,000
was to get into the West Desert inspection team

240
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,120
Or

241
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,520
to stop the first team

242
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
from entering West Desert

243
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,960
But a few decades ago

244
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,160
is there such a developed art of art?

245
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,400
In the tape

246
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,240
there was a person who looked exactly like me

247
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,040
And when I was in West Desert

248
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,960
I also saw a person

249
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,080
who looked exactly like me

250
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,880
You keep saying that

251
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,040
It's all your guess

252
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,920
There's no evidence

253
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,320
The evidence is at the bottom of the lake

254
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,120
The horse said

255
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,160
he threw the corpse into the lake

256
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,160
Let's go to the lake to have a look

257
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,600
If there really is a corpse

258
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,520
it can prove

259
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,560
that the horse did kill the first team

260
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,840
At the same time, it can prove

261
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,480
that there were two different team

262
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,880
here

263
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,680
That also proves

264
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,200
we have to call the police

265
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,440
But it's been so many years

266
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,760
The corpse has been rotten for a long time

267
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,040
The corpse is gone

268
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,280
But the bones are still there

269
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,520
Mr. Wang

270
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,440
We can go to the water reserve this afternoon

271
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,520
Hello, Wu Xie

272
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,040
Have you heard about the tattoo of Qiong Qi?

273
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,560
I asked two people

274
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,720
They all said they didn't know

275
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,360
How about you ask Xiu Xiu

276
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,400
to ask her grandma?

277
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,680
The old woman doesn't know how to use her phone

278
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,000
The picture can't be sent

279
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,520
Don't worry

280
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,800
Xiu Xiu has already asked someone

281
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,120
to go to Xingyue Hotel to ask about it

282
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,400
She's waiting for the news

283
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,480
Okay

284
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,240
Tell me if you have any news

285
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,280
I got it

286
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,460
Remember to come to the reception

287
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,920
Is my grandma so old-fashioned?

288
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,320
Can't even use a phone

289
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,680
Isn't she looking for excuses?

290
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,440
This Qiong Qi tattoo

291
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,160
must be the top secret of my grandma

292
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,800
Why don't you ask my grandmother

293
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,720
why do you ask me

294
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,160
to ask theshin yuang

295
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,200
I don't want the older generation of9 reminder

296
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,760
to know that we are investigating the N8's old incident

297
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,200
Yin Nanfeng is not from the 9th lair

298
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,400
is much more than us.

299
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,560
It's time to eat!

300
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,600
It's time to eat!

301
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
The food is here!

302
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,680
Come on.

303
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,840
Be careful.

304
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,760
It's so fat.

305
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,400
One bowl for you, please.

306
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,640
One bowl for the naive.

307
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,640
This is mine.

308
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,880
Here are your chopsticks.

309
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,760
Thank you.

310
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,680
Uncle A Gui.

311
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,960
Can we change the dishes tomorrow?

312
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,280
If we eat the snail noodles,

313
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,480
we'll be stinky.

314
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,400
Don't change it.

315
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,800
I like snail noodles.

316
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,920
It's called smelly but not bitter.

317
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,080
It's good for your taste.

318
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,680
Yes, Yun Cai.

319
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,560
Let's not be so polite

320
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,560
to the poor people.

321
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,800
Uncle A Gui.

322
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,840
There's a lake in the northwest of Yangjiashan.

323
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,640
Do you know it?

324
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,280
I heard from the old man.

325
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,760
I've never been there.

326
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,120
We're going there tomorrow.

327
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
It's dangerous.

328
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,080
We can't go there.

329
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,880
It's okay.

330
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,960
We have a little brother.

331
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,600
He's a great guy.

332
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,280
He can even

333
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,520
catch the water bulls.

334
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,160
Yes.

335
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,840
Don't worry.

336
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,720
It's not a problem.

337
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,680
But we need you

338
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,480
to find us two

339
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,760
cutting knives that can cut the mountain.

340
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,480
It's better to use the one that's polished.

341
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,560
And then

342
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,920
we need some rope.

343
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,920
Do you have a tent?

344
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,200
I have two old tents.

345
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,920
If you don't mind...

346
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,760
It's okay.

347
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,520
I can use it.

348
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:32,840
Okay.

349
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,160
And the most important thing.

350
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,640
You need to help us

351
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,240
find two islands that are familiar to the mountain.

352
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,200
No problem.

353
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,000
I can do it.

354
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,680
Great.

355
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,280
Thank you.

356
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,200
The snail noodles are so delicious.

357
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,600
Eat it while it's hot.

358
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,200
Okay.

359
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,560
The real snail noodles.

360
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,240
Try it.

361
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,920
Master Hua, wipe your hands.

362
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,400
Master Hua, you're so...

363
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
You do such dirty work yourself.

364
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,240
Next time, just let me do it.

365
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,040
Any new findings in the waterway?

366
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,840
The staff who went down with me said

367
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,120
someone has been in here.

368
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,040
And it should be many years ago.

369
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,000
Many years ago?

370
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,360
According to the traces,

371
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,360
it's been at least several decades.

372
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,960
Did we come here for nothing?

373
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,520
Not really.

374
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,720
I found a very strange phenomenon in there.

375
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,680
The coffin is open.

376
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,400
There's a coffin in the waterway?

377
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,480
Then we have to go to the Public Security Bureau.

378
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,720
But there are no signs of

379
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,000
any damage or explosion.

380
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,920
The person who opened the coffin

381
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,240
broke the mechanism of the three-story coffin.

382
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,960
Could it be done by our Jiumen?

383
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,720
Look, I took this picture.

384
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
Iron and water seal coffin?

385
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,800
This is the three-story coffin?

386
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,840
As far as I know,

387
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,440
it can not only damage the coffin,

388
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,160
but also directly break the three-story coffin.

389
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,080
Only the two fingers of the Zhang family

390
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,080
are moving.

391
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,560
Uncle A'guan.

392
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,960
The bosses are ready.

393
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,080
Okay, I'll go get Yun Cai.

394
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,520
Aren't you looking for the Hong Kong island?

395
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,880
Why did you and Yun Cai take us there?

396
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,440
You don't know.

397
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,880
The whole village has run away.

398
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,120
Only those hunters

399
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,600
have entered the mountain early in the morning.

400
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,200
They can't come back for a long time.

401
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,320
Don't worry.

402
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,640
I know the mountain road.

403
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,360
I'll take you there.

404
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,680
Uncle A'guan.

405
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,560
Are you afraid that someone else

406
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,880
will make money from the Hong Kong island?

407
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,080
You're so good at it.

408
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,920
Right?

409
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,040
Look, I'm so familiar with the bosses.

410
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,320
Why don't you take care of yourself?

411
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,400
Besides,

412
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,080
I must take you there

413
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,960
safely.

414
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,280
No.

415
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,880
Yun Cai is here.

416
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
You also said that

417
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
it's not easy to go all the way.

418
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,160
He's a girl.

419
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,760
What if he's in danger?

420
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,240
Yun Cai, don't worry.

421
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,080
He's five years older than his grandfather.

422
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
He's a good boy.

423
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,080
He's a good boy.

424
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,080
He's a good boy.

425
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,080
He's a good boy.

426
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,080
He's a good boy.

427
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,080
He's a good boy.

428
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,160
He's five years older than his grandfather.

429
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,160
He's more familiar with the mountain road than me.

430
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,720
You're not familiar with it.

431
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,160
What if you're in danger?

432
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,600
You don't even care about being a father.

433
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
I care about it.

434
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Bosses.

435
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,960
You look down on me, don't you?

436
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,640
No.

437
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
Absolutely not.

438
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,280
Yun Cai, don't misunderstand.

439
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,720
I'm just worried about you.

440
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
In my heart,

441
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,880
you're the best choice.

442
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,080
You changed so fast.

443
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,080
It seems that someone wants to eat tender grass.

444
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
What tender grass?

445
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,080
I'm a man of my word.

446
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,080
Even if I'm a cow,

447
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,080
I'm still a man of my word.

448
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,080
Enough, bosses.

449
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,080
Let's talk on the way.

450
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
While the weather is not hot,

451
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
let's go.

452
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,080
Okay.

453
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
Let's go.

454
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,080
Let's go.

455
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,080
Sister Bin San,

456
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,080
try the chips.

457
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,080
They're delicious.

458
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,080
Even if she wants to eat,

459
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,080
I can't bear to give it to her.

460
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,080
Really?

461
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,080
Then I have to eat more.

462
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,080
If it's delicious, eat more.

463
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,080
I'll send it to you then.

464
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,080
You want to feed Yun Cai like you do, right?

465
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,080
What's the matter with you?

466
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,080
We're just talking.

467
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
Don't talk like a local.

468
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
Come on.

469
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,080
Mr. Pang.

470
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,080
What do you do?

471
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,080
I've seen it in the past few days.

472
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
You're certainly not here to travel.

473
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,080
There's no place like this

474
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,080
for people to travel.

475
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,080
Now I know.

476
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,080
I have to tell you something.

477
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,080
In fact,

478
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,840
We are secretive adults

479
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,280
But

480
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,000
As long as you kiss me

481
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,000
I will tell you all of it

482
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,400
Then close your eyes

483
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,440
This is really light

484
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,440
Hurry up

485
00:23:49,560 --> 00:24:14,340
Wait'

486
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,880
Umbrella

487
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,140
It's em ov usually

488
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,680
What he did

489
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:32,940
Actually

490
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,680
Xia's elder brother

491
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,140
discussed whether Xie wall and marriage

492
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,180
should wedding

493
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,480
or the possibility that

494
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,180
he could choose the marriage

495
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,620
I take is left to this

496
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,460
give it back

497
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,760
But what I want you to do is

498
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,720
I said I didn't know.

499
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,120
Xiaohua,

500
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,920
is this a photo or a painting?

501
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,960
This is actually a black and white photo.

502
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,160
It's colored later.

503
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,440
Hello, are you Wenxian?

504
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,680
I think it is Master So下面 will be your new client.

505
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,400
Here are Aunt Mo and Miss Yin.

506
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,160
Please be patient.

507
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,480
Don't know?

508
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,760
You've been telling us for two days

509
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,880
That poor beggar

510
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,600
doesn't know what's going on

511
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,360
Forget it

512
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,160
He doesn't know about the Buddha's incident

513
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,800
If they don't know, who knows?

514
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,160
If they don't know

515
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,120
why is Grandpa Yushan

516
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,640
here in the New Moon Hotel?

517
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,400
Enough, don't be angry

518
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,880
They just don't want to tell us

519
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,920
They don't say it

520
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,320
Anyway, the thing about the Jiumen

521
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,480
is not only known by him and Zhang Rishan

522
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,640
he doesn't know much

523
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,780
후 puzzle

524
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,840
How to tell her out of our gang?

525
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,320
How to tell them out of our gang?

526
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,160
If they don't know

527
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,680
then why is he here?

528
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,600
What does he do?

529
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,360
The thing you know

530
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,320
Bye

531
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,320
Master He, please

532
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,320
Please sit down

533
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,400
My lord

534
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,120
I feel like I'm back to the old days

535
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,160
when I was acting with you

536
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,200
There's a gap in the middle

537
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,120
I feel like I'm acting with my second master

538
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,640
Master He, you flatter me

539
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,560
Only when I'm acting with you

540
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,200
can I remember

541
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,360
the way you taught me to act

542
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,040
Master He, have some tea

543
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,280
Miss Huo

544
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,320
You're more and more like your grandma

545
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,800
when she was young

546
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,800
Master He, look at what you said

547
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,560
I'm my grandma's granddaughter

548
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,040
I'm not like her

549
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,240
My lord

550
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,280
You asked me here

551
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,000
not all for acting, right?

552
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,120
You know me well

553
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,680
I asked you here

554
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,680
not only to act with you

555
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,200
but also to ask you something

556
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,640
Do you know the A-Chen Shui Dao in Xiangxi Valley?

557
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,840
I know

558
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,360
What do you want to ask?

559
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,400
Have the second master and the Buddha

560
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,880
been there?

561
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,120
Yes

562
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,720
Did they bring something

563
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,560
with them?

564
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,920
I don't know

565
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,440
what they brought

566
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,720
Generally speaking

567
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,240
where did the Buddha's things

568
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,920
go?

569
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,480
The Buddha's valuable items

570
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,880
are usually handed over to the country

571
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,120
As for those unimportant

572
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,720
or private items

573
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,040
most of them

574
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,640
are put in Xin Yue Hotel

575
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,720
Xin Yue Hotel again?

576
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,360
The Buddha is so nice to his wife

577
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,480
The Buddha felt that

578
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,920
some things were in bad condition

579
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,080
so he wouldn't put them in Miss Yin's place

580
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
I heard that the Buddha has a secret room

581
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,360
Some things

582
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,280
were probably put there

583
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,400
I sent someone to investigate

584
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,520
the list of cultural relics

585
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,800
that the Buddha donated to the country

586
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,040
But on the list of cultural relics

587
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,480
there is no record

588
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,200
of the cultural relics of the A-Chen Shui Dao

589
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,760
If the Buddha really brought something

590
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,960
from the inside

591
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,560
maybe it was put in Master He's room

592
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,160
the place you mentioned

593
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,960
Maybe it was put there

594
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,320
But Master He

595
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,440
the house in the past

596
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,640
has been demolished

597
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,080
The house is gone

598
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,600
So the secret room

599
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,720
is gone too?

600
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,480
The house in the past

601
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,640
may be gone

602
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,320
But with the Buddha's

603
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,120
cautious and careful character

604
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,080
if he built a secret room

605
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,880
and wanted to put some private items

606
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,000
it wouldn't be so easy

607
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,320
to get rid of it

608
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,000
I didn't leave anything

609
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,880
It's okay

610
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,800
It's been so many years

611
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,400
If there is any clue

612
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,760
the rain has already been

613
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,240
in the lake

614
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,000
Don't worry

615
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,640
We'll go to other places

616
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
by the lake tomorrow

617
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,000
Maybe we'll find it

618
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,880
We've come this far

619
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,480
No matter how deep your secret is

620
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,400
we will find the truth with you

621
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,880
One day, someone

622
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,040
went to the hotpot restaurant to eat

623
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,440
and ordered a clear soup pot

624
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,680
But his tongue was numb

625
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
It was strange

626
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,880
so he called the boss

627
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,280
and said

628
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,320
Boss, why did I order a clear soup pot?

629
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,480
My tongue is numb

630
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,880
The boss looked at it and told him

631
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,280
The hotpot is leaking

632
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Is it not delicious?

633
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,480
Boss, you're naive

634
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
Brother Fatty is calling you

635
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,120
Fatty

636
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,680
You're making trouble again

637
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,840
Fatty, are you looking for me?

638
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,160
No

639
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,840
I was having a good talk with Yun Cai

640
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,680
Why should I look for you?

641
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,480
Yun Cai

642
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,800
What's wrong with Yun Cai?

643
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,280
The little girl doesn't like you

644
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,040
She just wants to talk to Brother

645
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,440
It seems that my dear Fatty

646
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,640
is going to lose his temper again

647
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,040
Please excuse me

648
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,640
Damn you

649
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,040
What's that sound?

650
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,640
Brother, what's that sound?

651
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,640
Chaosheng

652
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,440
Chaosheng?

653
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,240
Such a small lake

654
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,240
is there a tide?

655
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,240
The mud is still wet

656
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,440
It means that the water level is still falling

657
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,840
It should be the effect of the red tide

658
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,840
What the hell is the red tide?

659
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,640
Red tide is like a mud

660
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,440
Similar to the principle of the water hose

661
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,240
It seems that this lake is not a dead water lake

662
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,240
There must be a underground river under the lake

663
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,440
It is connected with another bigger lake

664
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,640
It is connected with another bigger lake

665
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,440
When the moon's gravity changes

666
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,840
The lake water here will be drawn over

667
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
That's over

668
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,240
That's up to you

669
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,440
The thing we are looking for

670
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,640
has been sucked into the bottom of the lake by the tide

671
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
That's really over

672
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,640
We don't know how deep this lake is

673
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,040
If the thing we are looking for

674
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,440
is in the middle of the lake

675
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,040
We have to prepare diving equipment

676
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,840
Diving equipment?

677
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,640
Sister Yun Cai

678
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,040
I think your village's tourism page

679
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,240
doesn't have diving

680
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,240
We don't have diving equipment in the mountains

681
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,640
If we catch fish, we can go to the river to touch them

682
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,440
Little Third Master

683
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,440
Then please go for a run tomorrow

684
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,040
Go back and get some equipment back

685
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,640
What about you, Fat Master?

686
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,440
Of course I am the Fat Master

687
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,840
I am good at it

688
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,040
This is the tattoo of the Buddha

689
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,240
How can there be Qiong Qi on the Buddha?

690
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,240
Isn't Qiong Qi a murderer?

691
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,240
You young people don't know

692
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,840
The tattoo of the chief of the Nine Gates

693
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,640
of the family of the great Buddha

694
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,040
is Qiong Qi

695
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,840
The Buddha is from the Zhang family

696
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,640
The Zhang family is divided into two branches

697
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,840
One branch is the Dongbei Zhang family

698
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,840
That is the real Zhang family

699
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,840
It is said that the family's tattoo

700
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,040
is Qilin

701
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,240
Our Buddha

702
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,840
is the will of the Pang family

703
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,640
Pang Zhi is Qiong Qi's tattoo

704
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,840
Rishan Grandpa was the personal soldier of the Buddha

705
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,040
He must have known this tattoo

706
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,040
He was so embarrassed to tell us that he didn't know

707
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,440
What is the original words of President Zhang?

708
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
Yin Nanfeng said

709
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,240
Rishan Grandpa is not willing to tell us

710
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,840
He said he didn't know

711
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,240
Wait, how to say it?

712
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,640
Just say you don't know

713
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,240
This is a message

714
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,040
President Zhang's message

715
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,240
is to tell you

716
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,240
you don't know

717
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,240
If not knowing is a message

718
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,440
Then what does Rishan Grandpa

719
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,440
say he doesn't know?

720
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,040
What he said he didn't know

721
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,640
should be the address of the secret room

722
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,840
The address of the secret room

723
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,240
But this secret room

724
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,840
must have an exact location

725
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,240
But it has been several decades

726
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
This location

727
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,840
should not be found

728
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,840
Then?

729
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,040
So we have to

730
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,640
find the boss's map

731
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,240
Those places that used to appear

732
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,640
on the boss's map

733
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,440
Plus, on the current map

734
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
that didn't appear

735
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,440
Then in these places

736
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,440
There will be a secret room of the Buddha

737
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,440
If you ever find it

738
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,440
if you ever think about it

739
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,240
Please tell them

740
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,240
Did we get it right this time?

741
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,240
Next time

742
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,840
Next time

743
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,960
When we do this

744
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,840
I just want you to get the answer

745
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,640
Brother, you're in the water again

746
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,320
Any new findings?

747
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,680
Forget it

748
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,800
I'll ask the two bosses

749
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,360
Yun Cai, just guess again

750
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,400
Just guess again

751
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,680
I'll tell you, Yun Cai

752
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Boss Wu, look at this

753
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,360
Come on, fatty

754
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,120
Don't tease her

755
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,520
This is what Brother just picked up

756
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,240
So boring

757
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,280
Here

758
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,480
Look at the materials and knowledge

759
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,320
It should be the old-fashioned diving mirror

760
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,280
that was moved to the city decades ago

761
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,480
That's right

762
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,680
The quality is good

763
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,640
I just tried it

764
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,680
It's not bad at all

765
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,320
This is what the inspection team used to use

766
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,000
Boss Wu, let's go

767
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,280
Uncle Gui

768
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,840
Help us find it when you go back to the village

769
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
See if there's any way to get the air

770
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,640
to bring it back to us

771
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,800
With this diving mirror

772
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,000
we can find a way

773
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,760
to go to the deep water of Yangjiahu

774
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,800
and take a walk

775
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,160
Okay

776
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,120
Then we'll go back

777
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,080
I'll ask around

778
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,640
Okay

779
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,720
Be careful

780
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,920
Don't worry

781
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,920
I'm a good swimmer

782
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,120
I can swim in the river

783
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,320
and swim in the waves

784
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,640
Come on, fatty

785
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,920
You can't swim in the waves

786
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,120
You're just a bear

787
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,640
You know the goldfish

788
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,480
It can't even turn over

789
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,440
when it's on land

790
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,480
But when it's in the water

791
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,840
it's a storm

792
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,640
and there are fish and people

793
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,520
Wait a minute

794
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,280
I'll show you something

795
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,680
Stop laughing

796
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,120
Go get your stuff

797
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,960
We'll go with Boss Wu

798
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,360
I'm not going back

799
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,320
I can stay and be their guide

800
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,280
Didn't we agree

801
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,280
to take Boss Wu to the lake?

802
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,960
He's starting to get busy

803
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,520
Let's go back

804
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,480
You stay here

805
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,920
It'll be a mess if you stay here

806
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,000
I know them better than them

807
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,600
I can help them if I stay here

808
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,360
Yeah

809
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,240
We can't

810
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,600
miss Yun Cai's help

811
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,320
Uncle Gui

812
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,000
You can rest assured

813
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,520
With me and Brother here

814
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,360
Yun Cai is absolutely safe

815
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,160
You can go down the mountain

816
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,120
We'll stay here

817
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,800
and stay safe

818
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,760
I promise you

819
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,880
when you come back

820
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,600
Yun Cai

821
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,400
will have a hair

822
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,280
and a hair

823
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,720
Yeah, Uncle Gui

824
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,800
Since Brother Langli said so

825
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,320
he can take care of Yun Cai

826
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,320
Okay

827
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
Be safe

828
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,880
Boss Wu

829
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,600
Let's go

830
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,640
Let's go

831
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,280
Bye

832
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,400
Bye, Boss Pang

833
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,320
Watch your chest at night

834
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,960
What are you looking at?

835
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,240
What are you talking about?

836
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,560
Yun Cai

837
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,520
Where are you going?

838
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,640
My father is gone

839
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,600
I'm going back to change

840
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,560
and play in the lake

841
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,360
with my clothes

842
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,240
No way

843
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,440
Don't worry

844
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,640
I'm very good at swimming

845
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,320
I just promised your father

846
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,440
to take good care of you

847
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,560
You said you were going to go down the water

848
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,840
It's dangerous in the water

849
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:32,960
Well

850
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,560
Just wait here

851
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,880
Brother Pang of Brother Langli

852
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,920
will go down the water himself

853
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,040
If you want anything good

854
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,400
I'll get it for you

855
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,160
Just be good

856
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,360
This is the mansion of Buddha

857
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,560
This is the private property of Buddha

858
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,960
It seems that Zhang Rishan

859
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,080
is right

860
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,640
I really don't know

861
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,040
And on the map now

862
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,640
there is no way to show

863
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,840
Buddha's property

864
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:08,960
These places

865
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,160
are all hidden

866
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,320
Xiu Xiu

867
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,040
Look

868
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,720
Does it look like

869
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,160
a dragon vein?

870
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,040
It's a dragon vein

871
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,240
It's a dragon vein

872
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,040
Dragon vein

873
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,400
It's really a bit like

874
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,400
I heard that Buddha

875
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,440
also studied

876
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,400
feng shui and kanyu

877
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,080
His house is built here

878
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,280
It's the place of Long Yan

879
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,280
Is this dragon vein a clue?

880
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:34,960
No

881
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,720
It looks like a dragon vein

882
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,040
But it's not a dragon vein

883
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,280
I heard of a very rare

884
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,960
feng shui pattern

885
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,400
called Fu Xi vein

886
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,240
It's similar to the dragon vein

887
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,680
but it's not the same

888
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,600
And Fu Xi

889
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,120
is the eighth son of Zhen Long

890
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,800
In the legend

891
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,400
he is not good at hiding his tail

892
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,240
The tail is his most important part

893
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,120
The dragon head is the bottom of the mansion

894
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,760
The dragon tail

895
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,280
may be where the secret room is

896
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,720
You're right

897
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,600
The secret room is very likely

898
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,560
to be in this dragon tail

899
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,480
But in such a large area

900
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,240
where can we find it?

901
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,720
It's not easy to find the secret room

902
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,200
What?

903
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,760
No, diving equipment

904
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,160
What do you think?

905
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,680
What diving equipment

906
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,280
are you looking for in our mountain?

907
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,760
Hello, Fatty

908
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,240
But we can't find diving equipment in the county

909
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,280
You're really interesting

910
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,200
What diving equipment

911
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,640
are you looking for in a small county?

912
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,800
You have to go to a big city

913
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,320
Yes

914
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,000
I tell you

915
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,720
A Gui has found a way to cook

916
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,240
But it's not easy to get it on the mountain

917
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,440
I'll pick him up later

918
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,320
I've been busy all day

919
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,280
I haven't eaten anything

920
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:01,920
Enough

921
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,360
Don't complain

922
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,960
Pack up and set off

923
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,080
No

924
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,040
Sister Yun

925
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,400
The dishes are ready

926
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,600
Get ready to eat

927
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,880
I don't want to talk to you

928
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,520
Bye

929
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,440
I haven't finished, Fatty

930
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,160
Fatty

931
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,760
Fatty

932
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,520
The next day

933
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,360
Pack up and set off

934
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,000
Hurry up

935
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,800
Hurry up

936
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,040
The curtain in front of you

937
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,240
I'm afraid I won't go

938
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,200
Can't you see it?

939
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,200
We're so hungry

940
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,080
Come on

941
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,280
Turn off the light

942
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,480
Don't say it again

943
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,280
Calm down

944
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,800
Calm down

945
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,600
What's wrong?

946
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,400
What's wrong?

947
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,600
I'm sorry

948
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,560
Sorry, I'm sorry

949
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,440
I'm sorry

950
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,120
Sorry

951
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,000
Don't be shy

952
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,800
I'm sorry

953
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,520
Sorry

954
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,000
Come on

955
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,880
I'm sorry

956
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,280
Sorry

957
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,240
Okay

958
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,440
I'll get it back for you

959
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,280
That's right

960
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,440
Sorry

961
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,800
Sorry

962
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,680
Hanma said

963
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,800
The corpse threw into the lake

964
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,080
If the fox really lost its body

965
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,080
Come on

966
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:30,800
Be careful

967
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,720
Okay

968
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,640
Okay

969
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,120
Okay

970
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,000
But we have to trouble you

971
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,680
You have to help us find some

972
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,640
Can open the passage

973
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,480
Okay

974
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,160
That's right, Uncle A Gui

975
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,240
Yangjiahuxi is in the north

976
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,840
Yangjiashan, sorry

977
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,840
Hello, uncle

978
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,240
I'm here

979
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,360
I'm here, uncle

980
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,120
Someone has already entered here

981
00:43:59,120 --> 00:43:59,840
I'm here, uncle

982
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,800
Wait a minute, don't go

983
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,400
We're in the main room

984
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,240
Come on

985
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,120
Sorry

986
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:05,600
We

987
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,320
I'm fine

988
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,760
Stop

989
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,480
Stop

990
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,320
How can a tourist come to such a place?

991
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,080
Yes

992
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:14,880
Now

993
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,840
There are some things

994
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,400
Stop

995
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:16,800
Stop

996
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,440
Stop

997
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,960
If it's delicious

998
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,240
I'll send it to you

999
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,440
Okay, I'll send it to you

1000
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,400
I'll send it to you

1001
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,280
Go

1002
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,400
What's the matter with you?

1003
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,840
I'm here to talk

1004
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,400
Okay

1005
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,880
I'm here to talk

1006
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,520
Okay

1007
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,640
Okay

1008
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,600
Come on, I'll do it too

1009
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,000
I'm here to talk

1010
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,720
Come on, I'll do it too

1011
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,440
Come on, I'll do it too

1012
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:37,920
Come on, I'll do it too

1013
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,480
I'm here to talk

1014
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,520
Stop

1015
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,640
I'm here to talk

1016
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,760
I don't know which table it is

1017
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,040
It's all broken

1018
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,480
I don't know about the night

1019
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,600
I'm here to talk

1020
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,560
Wait

1021
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,520
What did he say?

1022
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,720
Most of the items

1023
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,440
Come on

1024
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,520
I'm here to talk

1025
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,120
It's the address of this secret room

1026
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,600
And this secret room

1027
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,600
I'm here to talk

1028
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:14,320
I just want to say how lucky I am because of you

1029
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,680
Brother

1030
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,280
You're going down the mountain again

1031
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,200
Is there any new discovery?

1032
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,160
There are some theories

1033
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:22,960
I'm sorry

1034
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,400
Boss, there's a problem

1035
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,040
Let's go

1036
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,840
I'm sorry

1037
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,960
The sun

1038
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,400
Just put 100

1039
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,640
You can go down the mountain

1040
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,760
Arbex 15

1041
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,440
Yes

1042
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,200
But now the location of disappearance

1043
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,440
There must be a secret room in here

1044
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,800
OK, OK, OK

1045
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,360
Come on, come on

1046
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,320
Don't turn off the light
