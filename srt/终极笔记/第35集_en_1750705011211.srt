00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Wu Xie, are you really okay?

4
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Don't be a fool!

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Leave me alone!

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Get over there!

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Wu Xie

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Wu Xie

9
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

10
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Climb up, girls

11
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Three

12
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Four

13
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Five

14
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Six

15
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Seven

16
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Eight

17
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Nine

18
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Ten

19
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Ten

20
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Xiao Hua

21
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You're awake

22
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You're really lucky

23
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Luckily, the poison paper

24
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
rubbed through your fingers

25
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The poison is not too strong

26
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
so you got a new life

27
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
How long have I been unconscious?

28
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Two hours

29
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You're quite good at fighting

30
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I thought you were dead

31
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Didn't I say

32
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
we're lucky

33
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Enough, stop bragging

34
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You've already written the will

35
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What did I write?

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Think about it

37
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
When you're about to die

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
what will you write?

39
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Tell you that I'm in danger?

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No

41
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Tell Xiao Ge and Fatty

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
to come and take revenge

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That's not right either

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The bank card password?

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Almost, it's close

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Stop bragging

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What did I write?

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Look

49
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
1896528

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
1896528

51
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
1896528

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
1896528

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
1896528

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
1896528

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
0220059

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I've seen this number

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I have a piece of

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Lu Huang Bo that I've never broken

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The only thing that can be broken is him

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But I don't know what it is

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's exactly the same as what I wrote

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Exactly the same

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So weird

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Not only that

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This number

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
is also the registration number of the Qiu De Kao company

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It seems that you're a smart guy

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You have more things than I thought

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm in my head now

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't even know what it is

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's like I'm living with another person

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Write it down

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Maybe I can solve it later

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Can you still walk now?

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Zuo Gang Si or Liu Gang Suo

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Choose one

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Liu Gang Suo

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Liu Gang Suo

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Liu Gang Suo

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Liu Gang Suo

81
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Hurry up

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Be careful

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It seems that this should be

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The control room of the previous level of the mechanism

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The bronze code module

86
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's true that only the bronze device

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Can keep the complete and stable for so long

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
When I was in Qing Ling

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I've seen the bronze ancient tree thousands of years ago

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Until today

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It can complete the ritual

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I said why I think

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
This thing is so unique

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The sample thunder has been in my head for a long time

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But this thing

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's not designed by the sample thunder at all

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This is designed by Zhang's family

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's right

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That's why Zhang's family

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The ancient building moved so many times

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The reason for the safety

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
No matter what dynasty

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Who built the sword

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Where to build it

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
As long as the module is in the hands of Zhang's family

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It must be safe

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's right

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's like we moved several times

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But it's not locked

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
As long as the key is in your hand

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You can go home

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So now the Zhang's family's ancient building

113
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It should be their last time

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Move the sword to the place

115
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I can't see you being bitten by a snake

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The brain is getting faster

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Are you praising me

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You use your brain

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
To make up for your lack of physical strength

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Hurry up and break the code

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This thing can't be tried

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You have to know what's going on

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
To do it

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Wu Xie

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
There are many thin iron chains here

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Is it complicated

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Not complicated

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's simpler

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Like this mechanism

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
There are only two choices

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
One is step-proof

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Mechanism implementation reward mechanism

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The other is step-wrong

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Mechanism implementation punishment mechanism

135
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Isn't this an automatic payment machine

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's a machine

137
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's a machine

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's a machine

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Isn't this an automatic payment machine

140
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Insert the card

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Enter the correct password

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If you lose, you'll throw money

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
If you lose, you'll swallow the card

144
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Is that what you mean

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Then these five chains

146
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Are the five numbers

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
One to five rows

148
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
There are 120 types of passwords in total

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
119 types are wrong passwords

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Will all swallow

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The only correct one

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Will throw money

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We first put the thin iron chain

154
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
One number

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Then put the thin iron chain

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And the bonus mechanism behind the wall

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Make a mark on both ends of the chain

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Keep sleeping

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Remember all the thin iron chains

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The order of the movement

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You can always find the right password

162
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The thin iron chain is broken

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Are you ready

164
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The code is ready too

165
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Are you ready

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The code is ready too

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What are you waiting for

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Hurry up and start

169
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
it is good

170
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Then I'll take the thick iron chain first

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
12345

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So heavy

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
One two

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Three

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Four

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Five

177
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Seven thin iron chains

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
4582221

179
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Wu Xie, you change the order

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Thin iron chain

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
One two three five

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Four

183
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Wu Xie

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The thin iron chain is still 4582221

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Are you sure this is the order

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It seems that only the thin iron chain

187
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Do not follow this order

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
This automatic drive

189
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Will throw money

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Is our correct password

191
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
it is good

192
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Three five

193
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
One two four

194
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Continue

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Three five

196
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
One four two

197
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Come again

198
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Three five two one

199
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Three five four

200
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Again

201
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's time for three five four two one

202
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's done

203
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The thin iron chain is different

204
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The thin iron chain is

205
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
238911

206
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Three five four two one

207
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This is the correct password

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Wu Xie

209
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I use the light button

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Connect the thin iron chain

211
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You follow the order just now

212
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
OK

213
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Let's start

214
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
One two three five

215
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Four

216
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Two

217
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
One

218
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes

219
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Great

220
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It should be successful

221
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The sub-diamonds above

222
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There must be some changes

223
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Search

224
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The new sub-diamonds have come out

225
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Different from before

226
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Just like the ones in the photo

227
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
All printed

228
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Sub-diamonds here

229
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
There are several new bumps

230
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
They follow our photos

231
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Press the bump place

232
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Can open the mechanism

233
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The ground is connected

234
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You said that era

235
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
No camera

236
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
No network

237
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Can only be used to model and print

238
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Then pass people to transport

239
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
At least one year

240
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This Zhang family is really

241
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Make such a simple thing

242
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So complicated

243
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It should be an act of necessity

244
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Sometimes to prevent thieves

245
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
To prevent outsiders

246
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Sometimes even to prevent their own family

247
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's the old saying of my grandfather

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What's more terrible is the human heart

249
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Great

250
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Really right

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And it's the same

252
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Little brother

253
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Your family is a little interesting

254
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
A thousand miles of marriage is a thousand miles

255
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Do we follow the photo

256
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Just press it

257
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But to put it back

258
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Your ancestors

259
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Make it so complicated

260
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's really hard to ask your grandson

261
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Are you sure

262
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What do you mean

263
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Outsiders

264
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Can't get into the Zhang family

265
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Little brother

266
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You don't make a joke

267
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You can't joke like this

268
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I pressed it all

269
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Press it

270
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm here

271
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You won't die

272
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Little brother

273
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Like you, a serious person

274
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's worse than a bad person

275
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm sorry

276
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yan Minxiu

277
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Send this to Tianzhen

278
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
By the way

279
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Say a few more words

280
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I want to complain to Wu Xie

281
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Go

282
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Go

283
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Go

284
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Why is it so quiet here

285
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Is it an ordinary corridor

286
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What else do you want

287
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You see

288
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You see

289
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Go

290
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Isn't this the monkey on the talisman

291
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Is it a monkey on the talisman

292
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
How did your family

293
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Make it a guard dog

294
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
stop

295
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Little brother

296
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Go together

297
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You look to the left

298
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I look to the right

299
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You wait here

300
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Don't move

301
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm sorry

302
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm sorry

303
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm sorry

304
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm sorry

305
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm sorry

306
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm sorry

307
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm sorry

308
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm sorry

309
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm sorry

310
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm sorry

311
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm sorry

312
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Brother

313
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Why are you biting me

314
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Little brother

315
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Be careful

316
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
Are you okay?

317
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,880
There is only one way to get out of the law

318
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,020
But we are one step at a time

319
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,440
You will be familiar with it sooner or later

320
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,320
The first one is correct

321
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,400
Brother, this is the place where your father lived

322
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,400
Did your elders tell you about the formation or the password?

323
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,120
But if for the challenge

324
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,260
Brother bully

325
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,120
Is quite hard

326
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,620
Brother used to work as a worker

327
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,600
I think I know how to play

328
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,200
Yeah!

329
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,520
Yes!

330
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,680
If you don't have a prize worth mountains

331
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,920
Go play jewellery

332
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,400
att решил

333
00:19:59,400 --> 00:19:59,920
Alright

334
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,940
You can taking advantage of the result

335
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,200
You can be brave

336
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,860
Can you use it however you want to?

337
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,820
I don't want him to take advantage

338
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,560
Why am I JO42?

339
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,080
Don't worry,

340
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,880
now I'm Li Se aplen benci.

341
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,560
Wait here.

342
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,440
Fine.

343
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,880
You're so lecturesome.

344
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,320
I think it is necessary to let them

345
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,520
take the responsibility of later decisions.

346
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,040
I think they're the best option.

347
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,760
We'd better make some adjustments now.

348
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,240
Okay.

349
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,280
Tell Wang Qi to go first.

350
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,480
I'll do the work.

351
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,360
I think Mohammad

352
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,400
I'm the real Zheng Qi Ling.

353
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,560
Handsome.

354
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,680
Wu Xie.

355
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,480
Wu Xie.

356
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,200
Wu Xie.

357
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Get up.

358
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,640
Look, there's work.

359
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,400
Another gate?

360
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,120
Why are you taking off your clothes?

361
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,760
It seems that the way to the second mechanism

362
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,240
is exactly the same as before.

363
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,440
I'll go first.

364
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,160
The first mechanism is designed exactly the same.

365
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,200
Then let's use the method of the first fire.

366
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,560
The blame of the day is here.

367
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:14,980
The abstract new code

368
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:37,640
I'm going to do a

369
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
Carry fire

370
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
This is too cold.

371
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Yes.

372
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,640
What is that?

373
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,640
I say, we are still waiting.

374
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,640
We are still waiting.

375
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,640
Why don't we just explore the last passage?

376
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,640
Don't mess around. Wait for the photos.

377
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,640
No. There are three passwords here.

378
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,640
We have to get them anyway.

379
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,640
Let's solve the password first and send it to them.

380
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,640
Then we can save time.

381
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,640
Wu Xie, we are taking risks, not playing games.

382
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,640
We have to make sure that every action is accurate.

383
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,640
Then we just sit here.

384
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,640
How about this? Let's go find the black-eyed man.

385
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,640
Didn't he say that he won't let us find him?

386
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,640
He has his own plans.

387
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,640
You said that we are from the Jiu Men.

388
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,640
It's fine to get involved.

389
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,640
I don't know who this black-eyed man is.

390
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
He has been following us all the way.

391
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,640
He may have had something to do with all this.

392
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,640
Or he knows more than we do.

393
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,640
No matter how much he knows,

394
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,640
it's just a clue and a step.

395
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,640
The ultimate answer is...

396
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,640
Wu Xie, I know some clues

397
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,640
that you don't know.

398
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
Do you want to hear them?

399
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,640
Of course I do.

400
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,640
I found a piece of the Luhuang Bo.

401
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,640
It's totally different from the previous one.

402
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,640
There is no map on it.

403
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,640
Instead,

404
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,640
it's a story.

405
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,640
That's weird.

406
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,640
Why isn't there a talisman here?

407
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,640
Xiao Ge, there is no way to go back and forth.

408
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
It's cold here.

409
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
It's like a military base.

410
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
We have to hurry up and think of a way.

411
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,640
Otherwise, we will all become food.

412
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
It's a cold jade.

413
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
It can cause a fire.

414
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
What?

415
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,640
This is the pavilion.

416
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,640
Stop standing around.

417
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
Go look for it.

418
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,640
Did you see any mechanism or exit?

419
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,640
Brother, we dare not touch it.

420
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,640
What if we touch something?

421
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,640
Zhu Sha Fen.

422
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,640
Isn't this the Ghost of Qilin?

423
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,640
I studied with Tian Zhen before.

424
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,640
So this is the map of Ghost Valley.

425
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
There's a gizmo here.

426
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
Right.

427
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
There are three little ghosts with no heads.

428
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
Don't tell them

429
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
it's so so that the person holding a machine

430
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,640
can get a ring.

431
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,640
There's nothing here.

432
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
This is the main entrance.

433
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,640
Where-

434
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,640
Ning Xiao Li,

435
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,640
I don't idealize human turnovers anymore.

436
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,640
duty everyone

437
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,640
independently of their grindstone,

438
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Let Go flavour

439
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,640
and depending on you.

440
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
I understand.

441
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
Come here.

442
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,640
There are three little ghosts

443
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,640
with no heads on the ghost family.

444
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,040
But the map on the ground

445
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,040
has them all.

446
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,840
Find them all.

447
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
The mother of the West King,

448
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840
the mother of Zhou,

449
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,840
the mother of Lushan,

450
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
the mother of the West King,

451
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
and the mother of Lushan.

452
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,440
They are all looking for the way to immortality.

453
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,040
It is said that only the mother of the West King has succeeded.

454
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,040
So the King of Zhou went to visit her.

455
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,440
And he and the mother of the West King fell in love.

456
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,640
They agreed to go to immortality together.

457
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,440
The way to immortality of the mother of the West King

458
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,240
is to swallow the elixir.

459
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,840
Then live in the jade jade for three thousand years.

460
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,640
According to what you said,

461
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,640
then the mother of the West King and the King of Zhou

462
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,840
are already in the jade jade and loving each other.

463
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,040
No.

464
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
The King of Zhou deceived the mother of the West King.

465
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,440
But

466
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,840
the mother of the West King is already in the jade jade.

467
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,240
She did go in.

468
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,840
But the King of Zhou didn't go in.

469
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,040
She upgraded the way of the mother of the West King

470
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,240
to immortality.

471
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,040
She used other methods to enter the jade jade.

472
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,240
She made two jades with jade jade.

473
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,840
One is for herself.

474
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,840
The other is for a baby.

475
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,040
After she was going to swallow the elixir,

476
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,440
under certain conditions,

477
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,440
she opened the jade jade.

478
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,640
She revived the baby's posture and reached immortality.

479
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,640
This is too bloody.

480
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,240
The temptation of the West King.

481
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
Too bad.

482
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,240
She is not only bad, but also shameless.

483
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,640
In order to ensure that within the specified time,

484
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,440
her own jade jade can be opened,

485
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,640
spread the rumors of immortality everywhere.

486
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
Let all kinds of people

487
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,640
find where her jade jade is.

488
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
No wonder.

489
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Because the people of the Nine Gates

490
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,440
are very skillful in this area,

491
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,040
they have been forced by those people

492
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,240
and used by them.

493
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,440
It becomes a tool to find immortality.

494
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,440
That's right.

495
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,840
Even if the people of the Nine Gates refuse,

496
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,240
they will also set traps

497
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,240
or lure or threaten.

498
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,640
Let the Nine Gates carry it deep into the heart.

499
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,440
If that's the case,

500
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,440
then these people are too funny.

501
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,640
That King of Zhou has already failed.

502
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,640
I went to the West King's Palace.

503
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,440
King of Lushan wanted to steal King of Zhou's jade.

504
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,840
He wanted to be his best friend.

505
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,440
Unexpectedly, he was caught by Iron Face.

506
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,240
Who is Iron Face?

507
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,040
The king of Tang, who is in charge of the imperial court,

508
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
is the emperor.

509
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,840
How is this emperor?

510
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
It didn't work either.

511
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,440
So to sum up,

512
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,840
this book of immortality

513
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,240
is just a legend of their wishful thinking.

514
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,440
Qi Hu'er.

515
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,040
Find all three gaps.

516
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,240
This is the gap between the thumb and the index finger.

517
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,640
This is the gap between the index finger and the index finger.

518
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,240
This is the gap between the middle finger and the index finger.

519
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,640
Back off.

520
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,040
Good guy.

521
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,640
Amazing.

522
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,640
It's so surprising.

523
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,040
Amazing.

524
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,640
These two fingers are just a little bit out of place.

525
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,640
Your family has two brushes.

526
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
Amazing.

527
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,240
Do you only know how to say this?

528
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,840
Inside are fake该

529
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,640
I said that

530
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,240
Isn't this for the teaching and teaching?

531
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,340
From this kitchen to the restaurant,

532
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,240
you can't give it just for 10 seconds.

533
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,640
Why did Zhang family take it away?

534
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Contentment.

535
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,240
What's going on?

536
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,560
My lunch is amazing.

537
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,380
There is only one way for a living person to get there.

538
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,540
I must get off alone.

539
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,700
You guys are all ANYPOWER.

540
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,140
TAKE A LOOK, and see if ye Clickkists are afraid of death.

541
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,080
Then about you Mr. Beingج ...

542
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,140
I rhyme and flow nicely but I'm not afraid of death

543
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,940
This bed isn't my height

544
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,500
Why is the crayon gone?

545
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
Someone has to go down there to check it out.

546
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
Oh, no!

547
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
I don't know what's going on down there.

548
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
It's too dangerous to go down there.

549
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
I'll give you a knife. Xiao Ge!

550
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
Don't go!

551
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Xiao Ge!

552
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
Xiao Ge!

553
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
This is my weapon.

554
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
Hallelujah!

555
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
Xiao Ge, you can't...

556
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
Robbery?

557
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,500
emoticon?

558
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,500
I don't understand.

559
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,500
Come on, just be quiet!

560
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,500
Let me close it!

561
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,500
What would you want?

562
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,500
Still a little light?

563
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,500
Oh dear...

564
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,500
To close this thing locked up,

565
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,500
and never force you to leave!

566
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Take it!

567
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,860
How can I save him from Wu Xie?

568
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,540
Xiao Ge! Xiao Ge!

569
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,100
Hurry and save him!

570
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,380
Why are you all standing there?

571
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,460
Hurry!

572
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,980
Xiao Ge.

573
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,500
Xiao Ge!

574
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,580
Xiao Ge!

575
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,140
Why are you all standing there?

576
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,300
Come and help!

577
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,380
Shoot!

578
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,620
Don't shoot!

579
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,620
It's too hard.

580
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,900
How can you shoot it open?

581
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,100
There must be a way.

582
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,180
There must be a way.

583
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,260
There must be a way.

584
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,340
There must be a way.

585
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,420
There must be a way.

586
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,420
There must be a way.

587
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,020
Did you bring the electric saw?

588
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,100
The electric saw!

589
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,540
Master, this really doesn't have one.

590
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,380
I knew it.

591
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,580
You must have left a backup.

592
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,420
No!

593
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,420
You're back to life.

594
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,500
You're back to life.

595
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,380
You're back to life.

596
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,260
You scared me to death.

597
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,340
You scared me to death.

598
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,900
Hurry!

599
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,340
Take a picture of the Four Fire Flames Mountain!

600
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,060
And tell Wu Xie...

601
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,140
to hurry!

602
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,740
We're about to become sick.

603
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,700
You're back to life.

604
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,780
You're back to life.

605
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,860
You're back to life.

606
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,940
You're back to life.

607
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,380
You're back to life.

608
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,940
You're back to life.

609
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,900
You're back to life.

610
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,300
Look, it's Fudiao.

611
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,380
Mm.

612
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,540
The floor Ng is a little loose.

613
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,460
A de-yeong Görorm is a little unreasonable.

614
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,900
I agree with you.

615
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,940
You know the ancient structure.

616
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,900
What do you think?

617
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,780
The students know about the ancient history,

618
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,380
The buildings in ancient China are of very high quality.

619
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,180
After thousands of years, the wind and rain are very hard.

620
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,380
Because there is a system in ancient Chinese architecture

621
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,980
called Wule Palace.

622
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,780
It's where the craftsmen will engrave their names on the works.

623
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,980
Once there is a problem, the officers will catch them by their names.

624
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,580
And the punishment is very severe.

625
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:13,980
So, a loose movement like this is not normal.

626
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,580
It's very likely to be a trap.

627
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,580
But in the previous tunnel,

628
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,980
we didn't encounter any danger.

629
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,780
Wu Yacui, be careful.

630
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,380
Let's break the password first.

631
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,780
Wait!

632
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,580
No, it's a trap! Run!

633
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,580
No!

634
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,780
If we get to him, we won't be able to get the password.

635
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,380
I have to go back and look for it.

636
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,180
Wu Xie, come back!

637
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,780
Xiao Hua, you go up first.

638
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,980
I have to get the third password.

639
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,580
Xiao Ge is still waiting for me.

640
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,780
The Lion King, come here!

641
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,980
Xiao Hua, we have to get the password.

642
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,380
The Lion King just came out.

643
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,780
His reaction is not that fast.

644
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,580
Hurry up.

645
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,580
Let's go.

646
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,580
Let's go.

647
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,580
Wu Xie, there is a gap.

648
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,780
Yes, it's not right.

649
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,380
The escape pipe is not broken.

650
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,780
The bar is not dropped.

651
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,980
The rope is gone.

652
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,780
Did we get into trouble for the wrong tunnel?

653
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,580
No, there are only three tunnels.

654
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,180
We just left from here.

655
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,380
Hurry up and get in.

656
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,380
Be careful.

657
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,580
This is not right.

658
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,780
It seems like we have never been here before.

659
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,380
The chain is restored.

660
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,580
But we didn't restore it.

661
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,980
Yes, we are indeed not capable.

662
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,980
We can only connect it with the mountain.

663
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,580
But how did the chain restore it?

664
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,180
It's possible that it's a trap again.

665
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,380
Let's go down and take a look.

666
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,980
It's also possible that this is a new tunnel.

667
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,180
There is something.

668
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,580
How can you say I'm a thing

669
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,180
when you are so kind to me?

670
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,180
Black Shadow.

671
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,180
Are you okay? Where did you go?

672
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,780
Don't mention it.

673
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,180
I almost died just now.

674
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,380
That means there are more than three tunnels here.

675
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,580
Of course not.

676
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,980
There are three at the entrance.

677
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,380
And each of them has three tunnels.

678
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,780
Only one of them is correct.

679
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,980
The rest are all fake.

680
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,780
The gap between the tunnel and the passage is separated?

681
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,180
That's right.

682
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,980
It's like a handgun.

683
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,380
Then how did we get to the wrong passage?

684
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,180
It should have something to do with time.

685
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,580
If it's normal,

686
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,180
it will turn three iron plates and break three passwords.

687
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,780
It shouldn't take too long.

688
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,980
We are the ones who are out of time.

689
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,580
What should we do now?

690
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,180
Who knows if this is real or not?

691
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:34,980
But we can try.

692
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,580
There is at least one chance.

693
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,780
Are we going to bet?

694
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,980
Of course.

695
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,780
At most, we can find out more.

696
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,980
It seems that you have also experienced a bad battle.

697
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,580
It's nothing.

698
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,580
I have already been very gentle to those little animals.

699
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,180
Then let's not waste time.

700
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,380
Let's get started.

701
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,780
Give me a hand.

702
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,780
You are so annoying.

703
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,980
You are crazy.

704
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,980
Stop.

705
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,980
Can you write on the back of the photo?

706
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,580
Don't worry.

707
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,380
Don't worry.

708
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,580
I want to complain to Tianzhen.

709
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,380
Come on.

710
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,580
I want to complain to Wu Xie.

711
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,180
Isn't this the monkey from the ice-cream shop?

712
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,580
Why are you all looking at the door?

713
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:35,980
Higher.

714
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,380
I'm a fish

715
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,380
I don't need you

716
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,380
I have some wisdom

717
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,380
Please help me

718
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,380
Honey, why don't you try it?

719
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,380
See if you can be hit by a fan

720
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,380
The first few words

721
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,380
Change a face

722
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,380
Break through the thorns

723
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,380
Use this tasteless

724
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,380
A piece of hope

725
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,380
I am the real

726
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,380
Zheng Qi

727
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,380
Handsome

728
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,380
What are you doing?

729
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,380
Stop

730
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,380
Wait a minute

731
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,380
Wait a minute

732
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,380
Wait a minute

733
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,380
Look at

734
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,380
Look at your greedy

735
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,380
Come on

736
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,380
Look at

737
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,380
Look at your greedy and afraid of death

738
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,380
Brother

739
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,380
Brother, come help

740
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,380
Love is crazy
