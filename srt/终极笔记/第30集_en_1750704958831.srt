1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The King Of Blaze

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The King Of Blaze

3
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You are drawing more in the gossip

4
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is still a stroke

5
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Continue

6
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This stroke seems to have no water

7
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Not easy to use

8
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I said Professor Wu

9
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Do you have any life common sense

10
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This pen, you have to shake it

11
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
There is no water

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
you

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,280
Secondly.

14
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,440
Later.

15
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,760
Follow that same sound?

16
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,760
Is it ok?

17
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,040
Just move.

18
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,320
Fast.

19
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,620
Look carefully

20
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,340
it says

21
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,520
Good stone pcamera

22
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,580
The catching of peace

23
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,700
marks a bigger stroke

24
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,760
becauseegan

25
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,220
are divine creatures

26
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,680
Why do you keep staring at me?

27
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,760
And how can I be wise?

28
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,720
Keep you too

29
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,240
No.

30
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,140
It's Qun into Khan.

31
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,140
Qun represents earth, and Khan represents river.

32
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,200
I'm guessing,

33
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,620
even though it's di body,

34
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,600
Sui He,

35
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,300
did you do it by chance?

36
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,480
Sui He,

37
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,980
you looked like you have a misunderstanding.

38
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,400
As for seeing somebody Оl habeominoteá,

39
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,060
it must be some kind of illusion.

40
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,340
What illusion?

41
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,720
I...

42
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,440
I sai when Er göra a verização de Kim Jong Un

43
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,320
with the Double A-Claude,

44
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,800
they call him a person of card.

45
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,000
That card comes from Zheng rendered by Hu greater than three,

46
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,380
mah earlier.

47
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,540
There are three kinds of card.

48
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,840
There are two.

49
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,440
One is called the guy of A.

50
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,880
It must be a combination.

51
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,280
It must be combined with the whole picture.

52
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,280
And then...

53
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,560
And then...

54
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,680
Okay, okay.

55
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,080
No need to say it. I understand.

56
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,520
Not only do you have your own knowledge.

57
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,120
Actually, I've also seen the sun rising.

58
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,320
I can see that now.

59
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,240
The human face is a зв straw.

60
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
The right one is the thunder.

61
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,560
It can be called thunder-like power.

62
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,160
The left one is the sky.

63
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,240
It means that the human face can communicate with the god of sky.

64
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,080
Am I right?

65
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,640
Yes.

66
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,720
The mountain, the earth, the water, the earth, thunder, and the sky.

67
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,520
Besides the characteristics of human face,

68
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,440
this statue

69
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,040
must have passed on something.

70
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,520
Professor Wu, what do you think?

71
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,720
I guess

72
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,920
there are so many legends about the Chinese civilization.

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,520
Why did the owner of this statue

74
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,920
choose the human face?

75
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,520
Fatty,

76
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,720
let me ask you. Why?

77
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
Why?

78
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Why?

79
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,320
Why?

80
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,120
Maybe

81
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,520
the living environment of human face

82
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,120
is similar to the environment of this building.

83
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,720
In a deep mountain forest with a lot of water,

84
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,720
it sometimes even rains.

85
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,120
Am I right?

86
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,120
You're right.

87
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,920
You're smart.

88
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,320
Boss, do you need to check the Pacific Ocean?

89
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,520
No need. Let them do their job.

90
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,320
I just need to get what I want.

91
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,120
That's all.

92
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,720
I say, Professor Wu,

93
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,920
this mountain is full of water and the deep mountain is old.

94
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:12,120
It can be the Great Xing'an Ridge or the West Shuangba Na.

95
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,320
Do you want to check other information

96
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,320
and study the human face?

97
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,120
Let's just withdraw now.

98
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,320
I can check any information.

99
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,520
But there aren't many opportunities for the Huo family to train.

100
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,520
That's right. Professor Wu is right.

101
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,920
Opportunities are hard to get.

102
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,920
Go check the table.

103
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,520
Boss, it's all recorded.

104
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,120
Let's go.

105
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,320
Let's go.

106
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,920
This is a collection of goods.

107
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,920
The Huo family is really hardworking.

108
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,320
So many goods are used as props.

109
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,720
That's right. This building is one-to-one.

110
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,120
The Huo family is so serious.

111
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,520
It means they value this place very much.

112
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,520
The purpose of this is to get familiar with the environment.

113
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,720
They want to close their eyes and walk around.

114
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,320
They are prepared to lower the risk to the lowest.

115
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,320
The purpose is to be able to go there in person.

116
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,920
You're saying that the Huo family is really too strict.

117
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
I think so too.

118
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,720
So I'll just hand over the Yangshi Thunder.

119
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,120
Don't hide it.

120
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,120
You made such a big noise in the Xingyue Hotel.

121
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,520
Do you think I'm some kind of cheater?

122
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,920
I just wanted to ask you this.

123
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,920
What are we going to do?

124
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,520
Do you think the two of us will go out together?

125
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,520
Let's go.

126
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,400
Offer the order I made.

127
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,120
Where are the other messages?

128
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,920
What else can we do?

129
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,920
There are no oil cloths on the first three floors.

130
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,600
These are all collection items.

131
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,480
Could it be used to prevent water?

132
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,400
It's possible.

133
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,560
There's something underneath. Let's take a look.

134
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,480
I'll beat you!

135
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
It's really a big hand.

136
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,920
Even a pillar is designed so beautifully.

137
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,920
This pillar is wrapped in cloth.

138
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,920
No matter how delicate the carving is, who will see it?

139
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,920
Take all the cloth down and take a look.

140
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,920
It's a dragon bone.

141
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,920
The reinforcement measures are well-placed.

142
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
This is the fourth floor.

143
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
There are three floors above.

144
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,440
The middle position and the reinforcement measures.

145
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
Kang Zhen.

146
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
You're right.

147
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,040
The information is too big.

148
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,040
I'm a little confused.

149
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,040
It seems we should not leave yet.

150
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,040
Let's take out the things and sort them out.

151
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Let's do it in a formal manner.

152
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,040
So formal?

153
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,040
It's clear that way.

154
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,040
Let's fight.

155
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
Pen.

156
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Pen.

157
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
I...

158
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
Yeah!

159
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,040
Come on, Professor.

160
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,040
Let's analyze it.

161
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,040
When we first came in,

162
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,040
we encountered a simulation of a bull shark.

163
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,040
It has a waterproof structure.

164
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,040
This floor is used to collect valuable items.

165
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,040
And it has a more waterproof structure.

166
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,040
It means that the location of the building is very wet.

167
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,040
It makes sense.

168
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,040
But Chang Tian and Yin Nan are all very wet.

169
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
This area is too big.

170
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,040
I haven't finished yet.

171
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
Wait for me to finish. Don't be anxious.

172
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,040
Okay, okay. Then you continue.

173
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
I don't know if you have found anything.

174
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,040
The most we've seen since we came in is this Kylin sculpture.

175
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
And that room just now.

176
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
There's a human-face turtle.

177
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,040
I'll draw a turtle shell as a representative.

178
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,040
Okay.

179
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,040
Your turtle is so ugly.

180
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
I just want to see it.

181
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
Okay.

182
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
The human-face turtle and Kylin are both gods.

183
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
It means...

184
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,040
It means...

185
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,040
The family with the posthumous seal

186
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
must be very cruel.

187
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
Yes, they are.

188
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,040
Some people even have Kylin tattoos.

189
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,040
But there are many families in the south

190
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,040
that have been very old for 5000 years.

191
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Why don't you come?

192
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,040
You should come. I'll give you a look.

193
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,040
Let's look at this way of building.

194
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,040
It needs such a big structure to support it.

195
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,040
It means that the location of this building is very stable.

196
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,040
It should be in the earthquake zone

197
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,040
or the Mishilou area.

198
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,040
It means that Mishilou is often located in this area.

199
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,040
You're so fooled.

200
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,040
Come on.

201
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,040
This is the mountain.

202
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,040
This is the building.

203
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,040
Then we're in the southwest mountain area.

204
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,040
But this area is very large.

205
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:32,040
I don't know this place very well but I know very well what's on the sign.

206
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,040
It means that when they hit it,

207
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,040
it means that the Test is automatically stopped.

208
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Khosnian идеi

209
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,040
is a place where a сдел institution was set up.

210
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,040
Do you remember Qiu De Kao said

211
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,040
that Lu Huang Bo and his people

212
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,040
have a secret connection with this old lady?

213
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:05,040
Lu Huang Bo can connect the old lady with Qiu De Kao.

214
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,040
Guess why.

215
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:16,040
I guess they have the same thing they want.

216
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,040
That's right.

217
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,040
If we can get Qiu De Kao to come to Ba Nai,

218
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,040
and represent him personally, it will be worth it.

219
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,040
Then let this old lady study him,

220
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,040
and make a special project. What can it be?

221
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,040
The first level of the mechanism is the reverse.

222
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,040
If it's really for preventing theft,

223
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,040
or preventing some animals from entering,

224
00:18:48,040 --> 00:19:05,280
there are still too many things that are better than the

225
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,280
I said our Xiao Ge is the smartest.

226
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,280
That's right.

227
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,280
Correct answer.

228
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,280
Actually, this place is not unfamiliar to us.

229
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,280
It's Zhang

230
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,280
Jia

231
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
Lu

232
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
Lou

233
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Lu

234
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,280
Old lady, thank you for telling me

235
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,280
that my key is also a part of Zhang Jia Lu.

236
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,280
And it's a very critical part.

237
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,280
Boss Huo, originally, we can sit down

238
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,280
and drink some wine and talk about this business.

239
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,280
Look, now you didn't get the picture,

240
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,280
and we stole the information.

241
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,280
It's so embarrassing.

242
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,280
Little Third Master, you have a good taste.

243
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
I'm crazy.

244
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,280
Actually, the mechanism that this old lady

245
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,280
arranged on the pillar is fake.

246
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,280
These pillars and nails are empty.

247
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
It's her who controls the mechanism behind it.

248
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,280
The purpose is to steal the picture in our hands.

249
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,280
Little smarty.

250
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
I said you always think that

251
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,280
it's useless to watch us with a few small machines.

252
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,280
Why are you lying to me?

253
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
Sit down.

254
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,280
Listen to Xiao Ge.

255
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Leave.

256
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
The picture is in our hands.

257
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,280
He has to beg us.

258
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,280
Okay, leave.

259
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,280
Wait a minute.

260
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,280
I seem to have forgotten something.

261
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,280
What's wrong?

262
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
We seem to be unable to get out of here.

263
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,280
The mechanism remote control is still in the hands of the old lady.

264
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,280
The people of the Wu family

265
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,280
are really more and more naive.

266
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,280
We just think about the wind and rain.

267
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,280
We have no way out.

268
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,280
Someone is hitting the wall.

269
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,280
The mechanism is broken.

270
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280
Don't make a mess.

271
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,280
A new character?

272
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,280
Come with me.

273
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
I'm not going with you.

274
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
Isn't it enough to be a pawn?

275
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
I really want to help you.

276
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,280
This time my grandmother even lied to me.

277
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,280
Don't do this.

278
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,280
The emperor has been giving you a bad name for hundreds of years.

279
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,280
You...

280
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,280
Brother Wu Xie, you don't believe me either?

281
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,280
If she plays with her grandmother,

282
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,280
she won't tear down the house, right?

283
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
That's right.

284
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
Leave here first.

285
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,280
I have something else to tell you.

286
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,280
Take us away.

287
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,280
Place.

288
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,280
We choose.

289
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,280
I said, do we have to come here?

290
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,280
This place is the safest.

291
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,280
This place is the most comfortable.

292
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Brother Wu Xie,

293
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,280
I didn't expect my grandmother to trick you.

294
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,280
And Brother Xiao Hua,

295
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,280
he asked me to take you to that old shop.

296
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,280
I didn't expect that he would become my grandmother's partner so quickly.

297
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,280
Next time I see him, I have to ask him clearly.

298
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,280
Anyway, I was too careless.

299
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,280
I made you guys suffer for so long.

300
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,280
Xiao Xiao, you are also helping us.

301
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,280
And this suffering

302
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,280
let us know a lot of things.

303
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,280
By the way,

304
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,280
didn't you say that you have something to tell us?

305
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
Brother Wu Xie,

306
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,280
do you remember the two tapes you received?

307
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
They are not the same.

308
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
They are different.

309
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,280
They are different.

310
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,280
They are different.

311
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,280
They are different.

312
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
They are different.

313
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,280
They are different.

314
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,280
Actually, you are not the first person

315
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,280
who received the tape.

316
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,280
Ten years ago,

317
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,280
someone sent my grandmother a tape.

318
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,280
Ten years ago.

319
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,280
This situation has lasted for a long time.

320
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,280
Grandma has been hiding the tape well.

321
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,280
But recently,

322
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
I have found a way.

323
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,280
I finally found those tapes.

324
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,280
Although I didn't find anything in the tapes,

325
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
I saw the contents.

326
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,280
It was my aunt Huo Ling who climbed on the ground.

327
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
Xiao Xiao,

328
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,280
about the tape,

329
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
you...

330
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,280
I know.

331
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Brother Xiao Hua told me

332
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,280
that there was also someone who climbed there.

333
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,280
It was you.

334
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,280
That wasn't me.

335
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
He told me the same thing.

336
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,280
He thought what you saw

337
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,280
was someone who looked like you.

338
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,280
So what I saw

339
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,280
might be someone

340
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,280
who looked like my aunt.

341
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
To verify,

342
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,280
I looked at some old photos.

343
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
Look at this.

344
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
This photo

345
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,280
was taken by my aunt when she was 18

346
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,280
in Wang Fu Jin University.

347
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,280
I checked the photo.

348
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,280
I checked the size of the tube.

349
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,280
It's 1.43 meters high.

350
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,280
The tube in the photo is 5 cm.

351
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,280
The ratio is 1 to 28.6.

352
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,280
I calculated based on this ratio.

353
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,280
My aunt's height should be

354
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
between 1.67 to 1.69 meters.

355
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Look at that one.

356
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
Xisha Archaeological Team.

357
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,280
The camera on this person's neck

358
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
is the single model of the Changcheng PF1

359
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,280
produced by Beijing's photo factory.

360
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,280
The length of the food is

361
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,280
14.5 cm.

362
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
I compared it.

363
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,280
My aunt's height is

364
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
about 11 cameras.

365
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,280
So this person

366
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,280
is at most 1.6 meters.

367
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,280
This is 8 cm.

368
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,280
8 cm?

369
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,280
Look carefully.

370
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,280
There's still a difference, right?

371
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,280
Xie Xiao, actually,

372
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
we...

373
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,280
So the person in the photo

374
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
is not my aunt at all.

375
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,280
I looked at the old photos in the house.

376
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
I found that

377
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,280
my aunt liked to take pictures since she was a child.

378
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
Her photos

379
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,280
are organized according to the year.

380
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,280
But since 1976,

381
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,280
there has never been a photo of her at home.

382
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,280
Then I found that

383
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,280
in 1976,

384
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,280
she went to attend a survey.

385
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,280
I guess

386
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,280
after that job,

387
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
the person who came back to our house

388
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
was the person in the photo.

389
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,280
Yes.

390
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,280
Xie Xiao, listen to me.

391
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
It's okay.

392
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,280
You don't have to comfort me.

393
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,280
After so long,

394
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,280
I just feel sorry for my grandma.

395
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,280
I think

396
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,280
the real aunt Huo Ling

397
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,280
is dead.

398
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,280
But who did it

399
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,280
to make my aunt look like that?

400
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,280
What is the purpose of this person?

401
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,280
Xie Xiao, don't be excited.

402
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,280
If you get excited, you'll get ahead.

403
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,280
I always think you have to stop me.

404
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,280
Okay.

405
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,280
Since

406
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,280
the person in the photo is not my aunt,

407
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,280
what do the people in the photo

408
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,280
want to do?

409
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,280
They want to trick my grandma.

410
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,280
Her daughter is still alive.

411
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,280
They want to threaten her.

412
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,280
Or is it just a warning?

413
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
Is the survey team

414
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,280
in your aunt's area

415
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
in the bar?

416
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
How do you know?

417
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
I don't know.

418
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,280
In 1976,

419
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
there was an accident

420
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
in the bar's survey team.

421
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,280
The guide told us

422
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,280
that the whole team was replaced.

423
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
Then,

424
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,280
the people who were transferred

425
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,280
were still working

426
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,280
as the former members of the survey team.

427
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,280
According to what you just said,

428
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,280
I think your aunt

429
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,280
is in this situation.

430
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,280
So...

431
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,280
Xiu Xiu,

432
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,280
we already know

433
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,280
what you said.

434
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,280
No, you...

435
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,280
You two...

436
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,280
Xiu Xiu,

437
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,280
we didn't mean to hide it from you.

438
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,280
Besides,

439
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,280
you're a girl.

440
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,280
You can get so much information.

441
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,280
You're amazing.

442
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,280
That's right.

443
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,280
I understand, brother Wu Xie.

444
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,280
Actually, you, me,

445
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,280
and brother Xiao Hua,

446
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
we're all the same.

447
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
Our elders have been hiding

448
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,280
a lot from us since we were young.

449
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,280
I just don't want

450
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
our generation

451
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
to hide it from each other.

452
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
I admit that

453
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,280
I'm a friend of brother Xiao Hua.

454
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,280
But I can feel it.

455
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,280
He doesn't tell me a lot of things.

456
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,280
Don't be like him.

457
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,280
Actually, we're all for your good.

458
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,280
For your good.

459
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,280
Wu Che.

460
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,280
Yes, Wu Che.

461
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,280
Actually, when we were young,

462
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,280
we only knew to play outside.

463
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,280
No one thought

464
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,280
the elders in the house

465
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
were in such a complicated

466
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
whirlpool.

467
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,280
Even we found out

468
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,280
that my aunt was transferred.

469
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,280
My grandma must have known it long ago.

470
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,280
That's her daughter.

471
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,280
But she still has to pretend

472
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,280
that nothing happened.

473
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,280
How sad she must be.

474
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,280
Xiu Xiu.

475
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,280
Maybe when your grandma

476
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,280
received this tape,

477
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,280
she was so excited.

478
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,280
She was so confused

479
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
that she didn't find anything.

480
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,280
No matter if she found anything,

481
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,280
it was a big blow

482
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,280
to my grandma.

483
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,280
Brother Xiao Hua also told me

484
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,280
that he was the one who organized

485
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,280
grandma's investigation.

486
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,280
The power of the transfer team

487
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,280
is to fight against him.

488
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,280
You know a lot.

489
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,280
I know more than that.

490
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,280
From my grandma's generation,

491
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
the Jiu Men

492
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,280
has been under her influence.

493
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,280
And Brother Xiao Hua suspected

494
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,280
that she was not a kind of power,

495
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,280
but a kind of confusion.

496
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,280
It's a mental influence.

497
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,280
So she was always

498
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
everywhere.

499
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,280
Otherwise, it would be hard to explain.

500
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,280
What do you mean?

501
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,280
This is another thing

502
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,280
I want to tell you.

503
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,280
Back then,

504
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,280
she and my grandma

505
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,280
were still young.

506
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,280
Who?

507
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,280
My grandma and Jin Wan Tang.

508
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,280
Don't interrupt.

509
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,280
You...

510
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
The fairy clouds are so clever

511
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,280
that they can't be trusted.

512
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,280
There are so many shops in the glazed factory.

513
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,280
But my grandma

514
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,280
is the fairy aunt.

515
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,280
She walked into

516
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,280
the Jin Wan Tang shop.

517
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
I don't know about

518
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,280
Jin Wan Tang being driven away.

519
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,280
But after that action,

520
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,280
she didn't make any big moves.

521
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,280
Until 1976,

522
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,280
I didn't expect

523
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,280
she could affect

524
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,280
the actions of the three generations of Jiu Men.

525
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,280
Maybe not just the three generations.

526
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,280
No one can tell the history of the past.

527
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,280
So it seems that

528
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,280
Xiao Hua's guess is unreasonable.

529
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,280
Chen Wen Jin's investigation team,

530
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,280
Master Hua's Lu Huang Bo,

531
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,280
and this old lady,

532
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280
they are all related to

533
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,280
Zhang's Valley.

534
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,280
Since it's Zhang's Valley,

535
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,280
does it mean

536
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,280
that Zhang's Valley is a ghost village?

537
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
It's the place where Zhang's family

538
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,280
store corpses.

539
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,280
No wonder Xiao Ge said

540
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,280
that place was his destination.

541
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,280
Although Xiao Ge lost his memory,

542
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,280
she is quite intuitive.

543
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
Zhang's Valley.

544
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,280
It's Zhang's Valley.

545
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,280
You dare to come to me again?

546
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,280
All right, you can have a rest.

547
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

548
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,280
Xiu Xiu.

549
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,280
You've come.

550
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,280
Take a bath before you leave.

551
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,280
Enjoy yourself.

552
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,280
Naive.

553
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,280
Still thinking?

554
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
Don't think too much.

555
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
I didn't think anything.

556
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,280
I just feel that

557
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,280
I haven't listened to my mom.

558
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,280
My mom is right.

559
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,280
Men should soak their feet more.

560
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,280
In the future, I will soak my feet

561
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
at all times.

562
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,280
That's right.

563
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
Time is good.

564
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
Soak your feet in time.

565
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,280
Where is Xiao Ge?

566
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,280
How does Xiao Ge feel?

567
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,280
Soaked so comfortably.

568
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,280
He fell asleep.

569
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,280
Why are you back?

570
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,280
You regret it, don't you?

571
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,280
Come on.

572
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
Take a bucket and soak your feet together.

573
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,280
Hurry up and come with me.

574
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,280
No one wants me to leave this bath.

575
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,280
What are you doing?

576
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,280
I said no soak.

577
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,280
Why do you have to burn my basin?

578
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,280
You're almost

579
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,280
with that basin.

580
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,280
If I don't kick it,

581
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,280
can you come with me?

582
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,280
Wu Xie.

583
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,280
The sample in your hand is a mine.

584
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,280
But you must keep an eye on it.

585
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,280
What my grandma wants

586
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
is definitely in your hand.

587
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,280
Don't worry.

588
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,280
Brother Kang.

589
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
What are you looking at?

590
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,280
I said, Xiu Xiao.

591
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,280
It's been a long way around.

592
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,280
Where are you taking us?

593
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,280
Of course, I'm taking you

594
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,280
to a place

595
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
that is absolutely safe.

596
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,280
I gave you a mask.

597
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,280
Hurry up and put it on.

598
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,280
The three of us

599
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,280
are bright and beautiful.

600
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,280
We always show our true faces.

601
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,280
Moreover,

602
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,280
the mask is so ugly.

603
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,280
I don't want to wear it.

604
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,280
Miss Xiu Xiu.

605
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,280
These are...

606
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,280
My friends.

607
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,280
Tonight,

608
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
we're having a blind-face party.

609
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,280
You go and get ready.

610
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,280
Okay.

611
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,280
Xiu Xiu.

612
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,280
You brought us here.

613
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,280
You're trying to trick us, aren't you?

614
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,280
What do you know?

615
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,280
This is called being blind.

616
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
It's called being blind.

617
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,280
I said, Xiu Xiu.

618
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
Is this method okay?

619
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,280
Of course.

620
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
Xiao Hua said

621
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,280
you were found out.

622
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,280
What did I say?

623
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,280
It's still being blind?

624
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,280
It's completely black now.

625
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
But now

626
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
he's coming to save us.

627
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,280
But I think

628
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,280
he can't believe everything he says now.

629
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,280
How about this?

630
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
Brother Wu Xie.

631
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
You give me the sample in your hand first.

632
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,280
Later, we'll see

633
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,280
what Xiao Hua is going to do.

634
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
Pretend.

635
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,280
Continue pretending.

636
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,280
Although I may not remember the face,

637
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,280
but this is too old

638
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
for a woman.

639
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,280
You're not Huo Xiu Xiu at all.

640
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,280
Xie Yu Chen.

641
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,280
Xiao Hua?

642
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
It's boring.

643
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,280
You recognized me so quickly.

644
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,280
You're really so disgusting.

645
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,280
It's really a loss

646
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,280
to fight with you in this outfit.

647
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,280
You betrayed your friend.

648
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,280
This time

649
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,280
you have to talk to me.

650
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,280
Okay, Fatty.

651
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,280
Stop talking.

652
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,280
Hua Ye.

653
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,280
What do you mean?

654
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,280
Wu Xie.

655
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,280
I'm the same as you.

656
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
I'm not a man.

657
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,280
I'm a man.

658
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,280
I'm a man.

659
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,280
I'm a man.

660
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,280
I'm the same as you.

661
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,280
I want to know the truth.

662
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,280
No one can get away from the boss.

663
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
Besides,

664
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,280
the boss wants the sample, not the man.

665
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,280
If I don't give him the sample,

666
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,280
he won't believe that

667
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,280
I want to cooperate with him.

668
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,280
So you betrayed us.

669
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,280
If I really want to betray you,

670
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
how could I show my feet

671
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
and let you find out?

672
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,280
Wu Xie.

673
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,280
I really hope

674
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,280
you can meet the boss.

675
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,280
Believe me.

676
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,280
Cooperation is not bad.

677
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,280
I'm really sorry.

678
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,280
Sorry for your loss.

679
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,280
I'm sorry for your loss.

680
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,280
I'm sorry.

681
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
Madam.

682
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
Someone is here.

683
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,280
This is for the boss.

684
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,880
Now everyone's helped Master Yuegyou back.

685
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,680
Mister Gu,

686
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,980
you can.

687
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,980
Do yourStop huffing on us.

688
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,180
Come at me with that face of hours eye.

689
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,720
Where's that?

690
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,740
It's all the old live people's atrociously.

691
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,140
The nine gates have their own rules.

692
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,540
This is the Xie family's position.

693
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:50,540
The people of your Wu family should sit there.

694
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:08,540
Then, Old Madam, where should I sit?

695
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,140
Not you.

696
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,540
Okay.

697
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:21,340
The model I have in my shop, I never lied to you.

698
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:25,740
Xiao Xie disguised as Xiu Xiu, and you also found out.

699
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:29,340
It seems that this old Wu dog is on you.

700
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,540
He's not a waste of time.

701
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,340
You're exaggerating.

702
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,940
He started talking nonsense at Ren Mian Gui's place.

703
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,140
The password he gave was wrong.

704
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,940
Yes.

705
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,740
This is a mountain of water, deep in the mountains, old and young.

706
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,740
Since it's...

707
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,340
Da Qing An Li.

708
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,740
You can also...

709
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,540
You say it.

710
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,740
This...

711
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,340
Okay, wait a moment.

712
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:03,340
I'm not afraid of the mountains and the sea, I'm not afraid of the fog.

713
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:07,140
I'm brave and fearless, I've crossed the mountains and the sea.

714
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,340
Okay.

715
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:19,380
This old Wu's work is really very

716
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:23,140
You can call the risk to the snow field, so you can see it with your own eyes.

717
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,140
Okay, I see.

718
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,140
Is it here to guard against the water?

719
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,140
It's possible.

720
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,140
I don't want to see it.

721
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,140
Okay.

722
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,140
Okay.

723
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,740
Come.

724
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,540
Come, come.

725
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:50,740
This means that he has this tribe's...

726
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,940
He has this tribe's...

727
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,340
This Gui is too abstract.

728
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,540
Just understand it.

729
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,940
Okay, I understand.

730
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,540
Little Third Master.

731
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,540
Too abstract.

732
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,540
I know the little third master in the back.

733
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,540
Okay, I understand.

734
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,540
Okay.

735
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,540
Okay, I understand.

736
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,540
Okay, I understand.

737
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,540
Come.

738
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,540
Okay.

739
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,540
Don't you regret it?

740
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,540
Come, come, take a basin.

741
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,540
Let's put it together.

742
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,540
Come, take a bucket.

743
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,540
Take a basin.

744
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,540
Let's take a look.

745
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,540
Okay, okay.

746
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,540
I think I'm a friend of Brother Xiao Hua.

747
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,540
But...

748
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,540
Okay, okay.

749
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,540
Let's go.

750
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,540
You rest first. I'll come to you tomorrow.

751
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,540
Come, come.

752
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,540
Come, come.

753
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,540
Take a bath and go.

754
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:56,540
I'm sorry to have to take a bath at such a big time.

755
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,540
I forgot that word.

756
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:03,540
Although I can't remember the face,

757
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:07,540
I still look at the figure of a woman.

758
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,540
I'm sorry to have to take a bath at such a big time.

759
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,540
I'm sorry to have to take a bath at such a big time.

760
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,540
You are the language.

761
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,540
Hurry up and open it.

762
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,540
Your face is all wet.

763
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,540
Get up.

764
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,540
This is not your taste.

765
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,540
You are the language.

766
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,540
Okay, I'll take a look.

767
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,540
Okay, thank you.
