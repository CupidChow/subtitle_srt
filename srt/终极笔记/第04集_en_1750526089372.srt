1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,120
L moving nowhere

2
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
L moving nowhere

3
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,620
W walking

4
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,760
Stick a sticky cigarette in your mouth

5
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,880
I can't trust you

6
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,300
You left only one mark

7
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,300
You found the others.

8
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,300
That's trust.

9
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,300
And there must be a reason.

10
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,300
Think about it. Is the mark on the camp very hidden?

11
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,300
It must be preventing someone.

12
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,300
You mean Wu Sanxing can't keep the mark?

13
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,300
That's right. It seems that

14
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,300
Third Master doesn't trust the people he brought.

15
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,300
We have to find them quickly.

16
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,300
I'm going to sleep soon.

17
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,300
I don't have much water left.

18
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,300
You're so heavy.

19
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,300
You can't be a foodie, right?

20
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,300
To be honest,

21
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,300
I don't have much food left.

22
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,300
No.

23
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,300
Don't move.

24
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,300
There's a dead line here.

25
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,300
I almost got hooked.

26
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,300
I don't know what's going on here.

27
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,300
How many years has it been?

28
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,300
It's no use even if there's a trap.

29
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,300
It's better to be careful.

30
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,300
It's okay.

31
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,300
Who is the person in the coffin?

32
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,300
It should be the mother of the West King.

33
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,300
She was seriously ill when she was 18.

34
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,300
The mother of the West King gave her the medicine.

35
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,300
But she couldn't return it.

36
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,300
Wu Xin, have you heard the story of the mother of the West King asking for the medicine?

37
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,300
You mean the tomb owner ate the medicine?

38
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,300
But there's no medicine like this in the world.

39
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,300
According to the information we collected,

40
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,300
the mother of the West King tried all kinds of methods to make the medicine for the long life.

41
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,300
The mother of the West King wanted to give her a life.

42
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,300
It's very likely that she has lived a long life.

43
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,300
Look at this body.

44
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,300
She was 18 years old.

45
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,300
Her body couldn't be this small.

46
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,300
As a king, it's impossible to hide in an inappropriate clothes.

47
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,300
So there's only one possibility.

48
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,300
Her body has grown back.

49
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,300
The medicine not only didn't give her a life,

50
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,300
but also made her body mutate after death.

51
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,300
It seems that she ate the failure of the mother of the West King.

52
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,300
Do you really believe that there's a long life?

53
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,300
I allowed you to follow me.

54
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,300
But I didn't allow you to inquire about my business secrets.

55
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,300
What?

56
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,300
Mother of the West King went to save people?

57
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,300
She really doesn't let people feel at ease.

58
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,300
There's no news from the third master for so long.

59
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,300
Something must have happened.

60
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,300
Let's go, Pan Zi.

61
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,300
Let's go to Devil City.

62
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,300
Sit tight.

63
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,300
What do you mean?

64
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,300
There's no more.

65
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,300
It's awkward.

66
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,300
I mean, Fatty.

67
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,300
You chose this car.

68
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,300
You ordered the car.

69
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,300
Our Fatty's luck is good.

70
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,300
Luck is really good.

71
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,300
Brother Xiang, wait for me.

72
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,300
Wait for me.

73
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,300
We've been walking for so long.

74
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,300
There's still desert in this car.

75
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,300
It seems that we're going to die here.

76
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,300
Don't worry.

77
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,300
I won't let you die.

78
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,300
This is a camel's thorn.

79
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,300
It's the most common plant in the arm.

80
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,300
Its leaves are not very surprising.

81
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,300
This root is a treasure.

82
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,300
You don't want me to eat this grass root, do you?

83
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,300
Cattle are pointing at it.

84
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,300
If you don't want to eat it, I won't stop you.

85
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,300
I'll go to the other side.

86
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,300
I'll go to the other side.

87
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,300
I'll go to the other side.

88
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,300
I'll go to the other side.

89
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,300
I don't need you. I'll do it myself.

90
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,300
Watch out!

91
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,300
Watch out!

92
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,300
It seems that Wu Xie and the others left this stone pile.

93
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,300
It's easy to get lost in here.

94
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,300
It's a good sign to leave a stone pile.

95
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,300
There should be a lot of gaps here.

96
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,300
We just follow this stone pile.

97
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,300
It's like following Wu Xie.

98
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,300
That's right.

99
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,300
It's getting late.

100
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,300
Fatty, let's go.

101
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,300
Wait a minute.

102
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,300
Devil City.

103
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,300
Fatty is here.

104
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,300
Let's go.

105
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,300
Let's go.

106
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,300
It seems that it's impossible to return to the original state.

107
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,300
Let's go forward.

108
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,300
It's deep enough.

109
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,300
Let's go.

110
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,300
There's nothing here.

111
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,300
We won't misunderstand who's basement it is.

112
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,300
I smell a waste of oil pipes.

113
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,300
It doesn't smell.

114
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,300
It's too strong. You can't smell it.

115
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,300
It really doesn't smell.

116
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,300
I think it's from the Republic of China.

117
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,300
You look like you have bad eyes.

118
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,300
Your nose is pretty sharp.

119
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,300
Actually, your dark eyes and ears are sharper.

120
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,300
That means we're in the oil pipes of the Republic of China.

121
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,300
I heard that there was a team in the Republic of China.

122
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,300
They came to dig up the oil.

123
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,300
But it's said that the whole team came.

124
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,300
None of them went back.

125
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,300
And then it became one of the dark spots of the Republic of China.

126
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,300
But it's so well built here.

127
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,300
It should be successful.

128
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,300
Why is it so old?

129
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,300
Be careful.

130
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,300
What the hell is this?

131
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,300
It's not very dark.

132
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,300
It's not oil.

133
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,300
It's sticky.

134
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,300
It's like something alive.

135
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,300
Experience.

136
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,300
You understand again?

137
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,300
It's disgusting.

138
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,300
Do you want to share it with me?

139
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,300
Let's open our hands.

140
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,300
Disgusting.

141
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,300
You're very particular.

142
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,300
Do you want such disgusting handkerchief?

143
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,300
No.

144
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,300
Are you sure?

145
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,300
Throw it away.

146
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,300
You Tong.

147
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,300
You Tong is here.

148
00:10:47,300 --> 00:11:07,960
I want to see what you've done in the

149
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:36,300
This is a human skin.

150
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,300
It's a little weird.

151
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,300
The skin is sealed with a secret.

152
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,300
The back of the secret should be white.

153
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,300
White forest is natural and flexible.

154
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,300
Through these human skins, it becomes a shadow.

155
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,300
Is this the head?

156
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,300
The head must be the head's death.

157
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,300
Shut up.

158
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:10,920
It's a

159
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,260
It's a

160
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:24,260
It's a

161
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,260
It's a

162
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,260
It's a

163
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,260
It's a

164
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,220
It's a

165
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:46,220
It's a

166
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,220
It's a

167
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,220
It's a

168
00:12:52,220 --> 00:13:02,220
It's a

169
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,340
I will find the cause.

170
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,460
I can't believe it.

171
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:13,360
You are not alone anymore.

172
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:23,740
Braun went downstairs and killed Gang goodbye and escorted them out and sent them back.

173
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:29,240
It's because of you that we were puòng in.

174
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
I'm so tired, Fatty!

175
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,480
It's already dark.

176
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,160
The footpath is all covered in mud.

177
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,000
Why haven't we reached the next stone pile?

178
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,240
The road is too long.

179
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,680
Why are you yelling?

180
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,840
Just take a rest if you're tired.

181
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,000
We're all walking together.

182
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,480
It's not just you who's tired.

183
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,880
Stop talking nonsense.

184
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,680
Fatty, I'm so annoyed.

185
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,680
Don't play with me.

186
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,880
Look.

187
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
Why is it like this here?

188
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
The road here is so thick.

189
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
It should be very hard.

190
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,880
And there's a lot of sand around.

191
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,880
How can it not be damaged like this?

192
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,880
I'm afraid it's because of the external impact.

193
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,880
If this kind of impact is real,

194
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,880
it must be a huge accident.

195
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,880
If it's dead,

196
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,880
it must be a very distant impact.

197
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,880
Do you think the sticky liquid that just fell on your hand

198
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,880
is the saliva of the person who took it?

199
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,880
Don't say such disgusting things.

200
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
I'm hungry.

201
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
Don't move.

202
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,880
Old Jia, we're at the boat.

203
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,880
Come here.

204
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,880
We're arranging people to report to the local police station.

205
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
We have brothers who are in danger.

206
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Come.

207
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
It's so dark.

208
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Where are the stones?

209
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
Did someone try to make us

210
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
take the stones away?

211
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,880
This is the Devil City.

212
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,880
Do you think this is a tourist spot?

213
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,880
There are so many people coming here.

214
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,880
Don't talk nonsense.

215
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,880
What do you think is going on?

216
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,880
We're wrong.

217
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,880
Brother, I'm not talking about you.

218
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,880
Everyone knows how to drive a horse or a cannon.

219
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,880
Now everyone knows that we're wrong.

220
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Pan Zi, you're a dog.

221
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,880
How can you see and bite?

222
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,880
You're smart.

223
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,880
Where do you want to go?

224
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
To the left or to the right?

225
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,880
I'm calm now.

226
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,880
What do you mean by fat?

227
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,880
You dare to push me?

228
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
Come on, hit me.

229
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
What do you mean, Xiao Ge?

230
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,880
I help you, you help him, right?

231
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,880
I'm a reasonable person.

232
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,880
Don't come here.

233
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,880
I'm a reasonable person, you're a good person.

234
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
I'm a bad person, right?

235
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,880
I'll go by myself.

236
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,880
Goodbye.

237
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,880
Fatty.

238
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Don't bother about him.

239
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,880
Who cares about his bad temper?

240
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,880
I understand.

241
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880
I'm affected by the devil.

242
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
What's that?

243
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,880
No, there's too much sand.

244
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,880
I have no choice.

245
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,880
Think about it.

246
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
It's okay.

247
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,880
We can't go out.

248
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,880
We can be partners.

249
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,880
We can be a happy couple.

250
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,880
A lonely ghost.

251
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,880
If you want to die,

252
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,880
don't drag me to be your bed.

253
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,880
I really didn't follow you.

254
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,880
What brotherhood?

255
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Bullshit.

256
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,880
Xiao Ge.

257
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,880
Fatty.

258
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,880
Fatty, from today on,

259
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,880
I'll cut off my clothes with you.

260
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,880
Cut off my clothes.

261
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,880
Fatty.

262
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,880
Fatty.

263
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
He seems to have gone far.

264
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,880
Let's go after him.

265
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
Fatty.

266
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
Fatty.

267
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,880
Fatty.

268
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,880
Fatty.

269
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,880
Fatty.

270
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Fatty.

271
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:42,300
It took me nearly 70 seconds to see them

272
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:49,300
I said you, fat guy, why didn't you say anything?

273
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,300
I always keep my word.

274
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,300
The roads are open, we walk on our own.

275
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,300
Enough.

276
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,300
You can see the smoke even at 10 miles away.

277
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,300
I'm afraid we can't find you, right?

278
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,300
You're doing fine,

279
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,300
you even know how to run the stall.

280
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,300
Nonsense.

281
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,300
I'm just cold at night.

282
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,300
Besides, since the fire is already lit,

283
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,300
this is a local product, high protein.

284
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,300
Do you want some?

285
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,300
Why did you really eat it?

286
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
What is this?

287
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
I've never eaten anything when I was a soldier.

288
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,300
But to be honest,

289
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,300
I'd rather eat raw.

290
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,300
Fine.

291
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
I'm convinced, Pan.

292
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
I'll listen to you from now on.

293
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,300
I'm not.

294
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,300
To be honest,

295
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,300
I don't blame you for what happened today.

296
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,300
Brother said,

297
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,300
we were affected by the Devil City.

298
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,300
He also said,

299
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,300
this is the same stone that never changes in the highway.

300
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,300
The stone that never changes?

301
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,300
It's true.

302
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,300
That is to say,

303
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,300
we've been walking in the same environment,

304
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,300
just like on the highway.

305
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,300
In this kind of environment,

306
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,300
people are easily anxious.

307
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,300
I didn't expect that I would be so considerate to Cheng Hai.

308
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,300
Yes.

309
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,300
I don't know there are so many people here.

310
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,300
We'd better be careful.

311
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,300
What should we do now?

312
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,300
Where should we go?

313
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,300
We found no stone pile at the fourth intersection.

314
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,300
It means we're wrong.

315
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,300
How about this?

316
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,300
Let's rest here tonight.

317
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,300
Tomorrow morning,

318
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,300
we'll walk back to the intersection with stone piles.

319
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,300
Let's see what's going on.

320
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,300
It's almost as I expected.

321
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,300
What do you think?

322
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,300
Okay, it's settled.

323
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,300
Fatty, I'm going to find a scorpion.

324
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,300
How are they?

325
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,300
They're not in danger for now.

326
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,300
Zha Xin, you know the way.

327
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,300
Go back and bring everyone here.

328
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
Don't be afraid.

329
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,300
There's a coffin in the ancient ship.

330
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,300
The evil bronze you mentioned is a kind of secret mechanism

331
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,300
used to scare the tomb raiders.

332
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,300
Really?

333
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,300
They're just unconscious.

334
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,300
You can ask them when they wake up.

335
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,300
Let's go.

336
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,300
Oh, my God.

337
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,300
We're finally out of here.

338
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
Look.

339
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
The stone pile is right here.

340
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,300
How did we get it wrong?

341
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,300
Did we put it in the wrong place?

342
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,300
I don't think so.

343
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,300
We've wasted too much time.

344
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,300
It's either left or right.

345
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,300
We can just change the route.

346
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,300
How can we do that?

347
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,300
The devil city is so big.

348
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,300
We've been looking for it for so long.

349
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,300
We can only find the scorpion after a long time.

350
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,300
What do you think we should do?

351
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,300
The stone pile is probably

352
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,300
the guidepost of Ning's team.

353
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
Since he's so good at it,

354
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,300
there must be a reason for it.

355
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,300
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

356
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,300
The Manidui.

357
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,300
It makes sense.

358
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,300
I'm glad I kept my eyes on it.

359
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,300
The first one, the second one,

360
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,300
the third one.

361
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
I understand.

362
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,300
The Manidui is used for praying and exorcism.

363
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,300
The different stone piles

364
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,300
represent different meanings.

365
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,300
The first and second stone piles

366
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,300
we walked on were on the sixth floor.

367
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,300
The third one was on the seventh floor.

368
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,300
It's really different.

369
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,300
According to the first two stone piles,

370
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,300
we were right.

371
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,300
But according to the third stone pile,

372
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,300
we were wrong.

373
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,300
It means that the first two stone piles

374
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,300
are on the sixth floor.

375
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,300
The third stone pile is on the seventh floor.

376
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,300
It's wrong.

377
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,300
Brother, am I right?

378
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,300
Fatty, thank goodness you took the photo.

379
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,300
Otherwise, we would be in trouble.

380
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,300
People who are against the stone pile

381
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,300
are too greedy.

382
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,300
They are not good at it.

383
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,300
Let's just go.

384
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,300
What do you do for a living?

385
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,300
Do you make money?

386
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,300
No.

387
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,300
If you don't do it,

388
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,300
what will you do?

389
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,300
I'll die.

390
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,300
Have you ever thought about your life?

391
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,300
This is my life.

392
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,300
There is only one way in life.

393
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,300
Now that you have chosen,

394
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,300
don't think about other possibilities.

395
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,300
It's meaningless.

396
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,300
Just like how you are willing to sacrifice

397
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,300
for Brother.

398
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,300
I can also make any sacrifice

399
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,300
for my choice.

400
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,300
Guys, Li is not bad.

401
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,300
But he's not efficient.

402
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,300
Master Hua, hurry up.

403
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,300
Hurry up.

404
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,300
I only have the last box of rice left.

405
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,300
I'll be out of food after we finish it.

406
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,300
There is a door.

407
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,300
A stool?

408
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,300
Wine...

409
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,300
It should have been made in the Republic of China.

410
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,300
This may be a product from September.

411
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,300
Or something happened to the wine.

412
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,300
This should be the place where he blocked the road.

413
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,300
If we continue digging, we can get there.

414
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,300
You have a shovel?

415
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,300
Yes.

416
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,300
I have to carry it when I go out.

417
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,300
Why didn't you take it out just now?

418
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,300
I forgot.

419
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,300
What are you doing?

420
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,300
I'm sorry.

421
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,300
Look at my eyes.

422
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,300
It's better than yours.

423
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,300
If we don't have the rice,

424
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,300
half of me will be gone.

425
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,300
If you still want to go out,

426
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,300
go and dig.

427
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,300
Okay.

428
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,300
Another dead end.

429
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,300
I finally understood.

430
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,300
My feet are gone.

431
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,300
Brother, didn't we find the rules?

432
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,300
Why are you still shooting him?

433
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,300
Who knows what bad things will happen?

434
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,300
I'm just planning.

435
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,300
Brother.

436
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,300
Brother!

437
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,300
Don't be anxious, brother!

438
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,300
No wonder this innocent guy is afraid of being lost every day.

439
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,300
Hurry up.

440
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,300
Brother!

441
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,300
Wait for us!

442
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,300
Hurry up!

443
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,300
Hurry up!

444
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,300
Hurry up!

445
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,300
Boss, I'm really sorry.

446
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,300
We tried our best.

447
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,300
It's not your fault.

448
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,300
You can't stop them from leaving.

449
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,300
You're right.

450
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,300
They're too good.

451
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,300
They almost burned us to death.

452
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,300
Where did they go?

453
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,300
I'm talking about this.

454
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,300
Fatty Wang is here.

455
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,300
Fatty is here too?

456
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,300
Brother left with them.

457
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,300
We don't know where he went.

458
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,300
Why did he come here?

459
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,300
No.

460
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,300
You know this.

461
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,300
Let's take a look.

462
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,300
These are all from Chen Chuan.

463
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,300
Three-Birds.

464
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,300
That's right.

465
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,300
Take a look at the broken one.

466
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,300
The head and the tail are bigger than the mouth.

467
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,300
What do you mean?

468
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,300
This is a cruel punishment.

469
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,300
In ancient battles,

470
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,300
the winners and losers were very cruel.

471
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,300
They killed the losers.

472
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:59,300
They sealed the heads of the children in the casket.

473
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:04,300
They put food and drink in the casket.

474
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,300
When they can't put food in the casket,

475
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,300
they can't get out of their heads.

476
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,300
Then they cut off the head and sealed the casket.

477
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,300
They used it to shoot other tribes.

478
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,300
In that era,

479
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,300
the rulers used these mysterious cruel rituals

480
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,300
to show off their supernatural powers

481
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,300
to complete the rule.

482
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,300
This is too evil.

483
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,300
If we do this, we will only be punished by the gods.

484
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,300
Something is wrong with the head.

485
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,300
There's something in it.

486
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,300
What?

487
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,300
It's the King of Ice.

488
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,300
Don't go there. Don't go.

489
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,300
Don't go.

490
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,300
A'Kei.

491
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,300
Find a way to kill the bug.

492
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,300
Captain.

493
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,300
My sister.

494
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,300
Tell everyone to check the equipment.

495
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,300
Run!

496
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,300
Hurry up!

497
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,300
Brother.

498
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,300
Run!

499
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,300
Hurry up!

500
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,300
Don't move.

501
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,300
Don't move.

502
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,300
Go!

503
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,300
Oh no!

504
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,300
Oh no!

505
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,300
Oh no!

506
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,300
It's done.

507
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,300
It's done?

508
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,300
It's this big?

509
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,300
Then do you know I can only shoot through it?

510
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,300
I know.

511
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,300
Then I have the chest, the hip, the thigh, and other important parts to pass.

512
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,300
You know?

513
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,300
I know.

514
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,300
Then what should I do?

515
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,300
I'll go over there and wait for you.

516
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,300
You're too inconspicuous.

517
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,300
If I have to dig alone, I have to dig to the Red Moon.

518
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,300
Okay, okay, okay.

519
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,300
Stay here and accompany Brother.

520
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,300
Take your hands off.

521
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,300
Here's a good thing for you.

522
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,300
Thank you.

523
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,300
I'm used to iron pot.

524
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,300
Okay, Second Master.

525
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,300
You rest.

526
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,300
I'll do it.

527
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,300
Use some strength.

528
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,300
This way.

529
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,300
This way.

530
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,300
Which way should I go with this machine?

531
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,300
Only Zha Xi can see this.

532
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,300
Look at the footprints.

533
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,300
There are too many footprints.

534
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,300
I don't care. Let's go iron pot.

535
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,300
Hurry.

536
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,300
Don't chase us.

537
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,300
Let's split up.

538
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,300
Don't be afraid.

539
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,300
Find a place to hide.

540
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,300
This way.

541
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,300
Wu Xie.

542
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,300
Hurry up.

543
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,300
Run.

544
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,300
What does this mean?

545
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,300
Why is there a ship here?

546
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,300
The one next to it should be A Ning's camp.

547
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,300
We spent a lot of effort.

548
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,300
Still, A Ning's team is the first to land.

549
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,300
No wonder Third Master and A Ning's team are following behind.

550
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,300
They have a way to get there.

551
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,300
Then let's go to the rear first.

552
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,300
Let's find Wu Xie first.

553
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,300
Let's go.

554
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,300
What's going on?

555
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,300
It's the King of Ice.

556
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,300
The one from the Seven Stars Palace.

557
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,300
Why is he here?

558
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,300
Let's find Third Master first.

559
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,300
This is the coat of arms of the Tienzhen ship.

560
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,300
This is the coat of arms of the Tienzhen ship.

561
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,300
This is the coat of arms of the Tienzhen ship.

562
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,300
It's been a long time.

563
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,300
I'll fight you!

564
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,300
Luckily, it's not Tienzhen.

565
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,300
I didn't leave with him for a while.

566
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,300
Otherwise, I would have been in the temple all my life.

567
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,300
Search the whole camp.

568
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,300
It's a sudden thing to see the town leader.

569
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,300
I'll contact the rescue team first.

570
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,300
Too many people are in trouble.

571
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,300
Brother, you were scared just now, too, right?

572
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,300
Do you think Tienzhen is dead?

573
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,300
No.

574
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,300
Don't talk about the strongest duck.

575
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,300
The King of Ice will make you laugh.

576
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,300
How ugly it is!

577
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,300
It's dead.

578
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,300
I can't escape.

579
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,300
It's not moving.

580
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,300
Someone must have been here before.

581
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,300
Let's go in first.

582
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,300
Go.

583
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,300
Play a song.

584
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,300
Go.

585
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,300
There's nothing outside.

586
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,300
I'll go out and have a look.

587
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,300
Even if there's only one left now,

588
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,300
we're out and we're dead.

589
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,300
I'll take a look first.

590
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,300
Come.

591
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,300
It seems that the King of Ice is not chasing us.

592
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,300
He's just following us.

593
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,300
Come on, give me your hand.

594
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,300
You saved my life in the camp just now.

595
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,300
It's not that exaggerated.

596
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,300
It's what it should be.

597
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,300
But I won't thank you.

598
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,300
In such a critical situation,

599
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,300
saving lives is the first priority.

600
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,300
If you don't have confidence,

601
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,300
saving your partner

602
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,300
will only make the situation worse.

603
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,300
Then I won't leave my partner alone.

604
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,300
That's your business.

605
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,300
Let's go.

606
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,300
Wait.

607
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,300
Something's wrong with the smell.

608
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,300
West.

609
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,300
Slaughter.

610
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,300
Snake.

611
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,300
Look.

612
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,300
There are people there.

613
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,300
How did they die?

614
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,300
They died of suffocation.

615
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,300
Suffocation?

616
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,300
They were all wrapped in these things.

617
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,300
Military silk.

618
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,300
Military silk?

619
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,300
Military silk.

620
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,300
Brother.

621
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,300
Look, look.

622
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,300
It's a big one.

623
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,300
Where is it?

624
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,300
Why are there so many stones?

625
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,300
It's getting late.

626
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,300
Pan Yi.

627
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,300
Let's go.

628
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,300
It's too wild.

629
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,300
It's too wild.

630
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,300
Too fast.

631
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,300
I said it wrong.

632
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,300
And there's a whole team.

633
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,300
One of them will die.

634
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,300
I'll take the risk.

635
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,300
Let's go.

636
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,300
Let's go.

637
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,300
Stand there.

638
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,300
You won't be scared.

639
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,300
No.

640
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,300
Give it to him.

641
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,300
You're so brave.

642
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,300
You're so brave.

643
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,300
You're on the toilet.

644
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,300
I told you.

645
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,300
Let's do it again.

646
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,300
Little yellow flower is so cool.

647
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,300
Look.

648
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,300
This is a soul.

649
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,300
Sorry.

650
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,300
Why is this so...

651
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,300
Okay.

652
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,300
Sorry.

653
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,300
Why is this so...

654
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,300
It's starting.

655
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,300
It's starting.

656
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,300
Let's start.

657
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,300
Let's start.

658
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,300
Let's start.

659
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,300
Let's start.

660
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,300
One more time.

661
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,300
Let's start.

662
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,300
Come on.

663
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,300
Okay.

664
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,300
One more time.

665
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,300
You two, wait a minute.

666
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,300
Yeah.

667
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,300
Ghost town.

668
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,300
One more time.

669
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,300
One more time.

670
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,300
One more time.

671
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,300
Come on.

672
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,300
I remember that leg.

673
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,300
Let's go.

674
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,300
Come on.

675
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,300
This is broken.

676
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,300
One more time.

677
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,300
I think it's the leader of An Ning's team.

678
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,300
It's on the top.

679
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,300
It's on the top.

680
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,300
Let's go.

681
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,300
I'll go.

682
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,300
Okay.

683
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,300
It's broken.

684
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,300
It's broken.

685
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,300
Are you sure?

686
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,300
It's broken.

687
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,300
Let's go.

688
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,300
Okay.

689
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,300
Stop.

690
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,300
Go back.

691
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,300
Go back.

692
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,300
One...

693
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,300
Okay.

694
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,300
Good.

695
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,300
Sorry.
