1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,940
The

2
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,540
a

3
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:37,580
ball

4
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,020
in

5
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,520
the

6
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,280
tower

7
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,220
im

8
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:59,100
and

9
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,600
gone

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:12,960
心云弄巧飞星传恨。

11
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,960
I've been with the fairy for three years.

12
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,960
Guji's recovery and transformation are boring.

13
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,960
It takes up a lot of time.

14
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,960
And everyone is under a huge pressure.

15
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,960
It's rare to communicate.

16
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,960
If it weren't for the fairy,

17
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,960
I would have been destroyed.

18
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,960
At the end of the third year,

19
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Guji suddenly disappeared.

20
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,960
I thought it was strange.

21
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,960
So I went out to have a look.

22
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,960
I followed a friend of the fairy

23
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
to the back of the mountain.

24
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,960
I saw that the walls were all covered with shandong.

25
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,960
They had many ropes and chainsaws.

26
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,960
I was afraid that I would be lost.

27
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,960
I was afraid that I would be lost.

28
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:47,320
These were not Face different

29
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,000
Deep into the woods,

30
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,960
I saw something just before I looked

31
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,960
I saw something just before I looked

32
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,960
and I instinctively .

33
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,960
Someone help!

34
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,960
On the third day after the war,

35
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,960
dozens of single-carriages were carried out by people from the mountains.

36
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,960
The people on the mountain were covered in blood.

37
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,960
Then, a large group of people, almost all of them were killed by the blood of the bloodthirsty Bo Shu,

38
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,960
and they were sent to my tent.

39
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,960
I could tell right away that it was the Luhuang Bo.

40
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
For these Bo Shu,

41
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,960
I don't know how many people died.

42
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,960
The whole process of my analysis,

43
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,960
the ancient mushrooms have always been very important.

44
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,960
It seems that this is what they are looking for.

45
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,960
The Luhuang Bo

46
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,960
There are many kinds of Luhuang Bo.

47
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,960
There is a very rare one,

48
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,960
and it is very hard to decipher.

49
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
This is the one that was sent this time.

50
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,960
But you still solved it.

51
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,960
I can only translate it into words,

52
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,960
and then translate it into modern Chinese characters.

53
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,960
These characters are the top layer of the code.

54
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,960
I can't even decipher the meaning of the deep layer.

55
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,960
I have been restoring this batch of Luhuang Bo for ten days.

56
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
The Luhuang Bo is worth a lot.

57
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,960
Even if it is a step, if it is clear, it is still a lot of money.

58
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,960
But they are so nervous.

59
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,960
Maybe they will bring a big trouble to themselves.

60
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,960
If they don't take it, I'm afraid they won't have this chance again.

61
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,960
At this time, I started to be greedy.

62
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,960
You go tell the fairy aunt that Uncle Bo has restored everything.

63
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Okay, wait.

64
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,960
Enough, you have the guts.

65
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,960
You dare to steal Luhuang Bo.

66
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,960
Aren't you afraid of getting into this business?

67
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,960
I was greedy at that time.

68
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,960
How did I know you were here for three years?

69
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Didn't you say that you were feeding my grandmother?

70
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
I had to feed your grandmother.

71
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
If not, I would have left.

72
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,960
But you see the benefits, who can not hurt?

73
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,960
I thought about it and thought it was impossible to have a problem.

74
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Luhuang Bo was missing and no one counted it.

75
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,960
Even if one was missing, it wouldn't be discovered.

76
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,960
I thought I could hide it from the sky.

77
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,960
I didn't expect that something would happen the next day.

78
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,960
Comrade, we have to check everyone and cooperate.

79
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,960
Cooperate, cooperate.

80
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,960
Be careful.

81
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,960
Okay.

82
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
Okay, that's enough.

83
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,960
Please come with us.

84
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,960
Come.

85
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
Comrade.

86
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
My dear.

87
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,960
I was taken to a tent.

88
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
There were about ten people inside.

89
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,960
I haven't seen the one with the head.

90
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
It looks very dangerous.

91
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,960
Where is the book?

92
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
I gave you the book.

93
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
Where is the book you hid?

94
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
Where is the book you hid?

95
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,960
It's...

96
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,960
What are you talking about?

97
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
You can't talk nonsense.

98
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
That was the most horrible time in my life.

99
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,960
It was just a light blow.

100
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,960
I felt like my head was going to crack.

101
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
My heart!

102
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,960
So they let you go?

103
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
I was going to die.

104
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,960
But who would have thought that

105
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,960
the fairy would protect me?

106
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,960
That's what I call the feeling of love for the past three years.

107
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Plus, I could have done a good job in translating Lu Wangbo.

108
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,960
After that, I left.

109
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Who would have thought that

110
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,960
as soon as I left,

111
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,960
the fairy would never come into my shop again.

112
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,960
After I came back from Sichuan,

113
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,960
I was so hungry.

114
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,960
I almost went to pick up the medicine.

115
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Until one day,

116
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,960
an outsider asked me about Lu Wangbo.

117
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,960
I couldn't tell him.

118
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,960
I was so angry with the fairy.

119
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,960
That bastard gave me a beating.

120
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,960
You couldn't refuse him.

121
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Maybe I was too short-handed.

122
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
If I didn't have that money,

123
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
I wouldn't have been able to see you.

124
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,960
Enough. Keep talking.

125
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,960
This is the second time I've been able to walk on the wire.

126
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,960
I've used my life's memory to draw that Lu Wangbo

127
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
and sold it to him.

128
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,960
But I swear,

129
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
I never mentioned the mountain.

130
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
What happened at the end of that operation?

131
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
I don't know.

132
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
I didn't follow him to the end.

133
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,960
He just opened me up.

134
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,960
And that operation was so secretive.

135
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,960
I've never heard any rumors about that operation.

136
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,960
So if you want to know more,

137
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,960
you can only ask the fairy.

138
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
By the way,

139
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,960
please tell the fairy that

140
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,960
I still have the money.

141
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,960
You've been learning architecture for so many years.

142
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,960
Didn't you notice anything wrong?

143
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,960
The structure should be from the Ming Dynasty.

144
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Look at the light in this house.

145
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Something's wrong with the window design.

146
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
It's so close to the roof.

147
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,960
It's not even lighting up.

148
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,960
The light should be intentionally avoided

149
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
by the designer.

150
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,960
But the house where the living people live

151
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,960
is the most important.

152
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,960
This house can't be used for living.

153
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
Mr. Zheng,

154
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,960
have you ever seen a house like this?

155
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,960
I know that

156
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,960
there was a place that looked like this.

157
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,960
But it wasn't that strict.

158
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,960
A house?

159
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,960
That's right.

160
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,960
It was the place where the dead were put in.

161
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,960
I checked Grandma's heart.

162
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
After 1965,

163
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
she never took any action.

164
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,960
Either the Nine Gates

165
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
found what they wanted,

166
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,960
or something happened

167
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,960
that made the Nine Gates stop cooperating.

168
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,960
It should be the latter.

169
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Your aunt Huo Ling and Chen Wen Jin,

170
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960
the second generation of the Nine Gates,

171
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,960
have been to Xisha Valley.

172
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,960
That means

173
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,960
the Nine Gates are still operating.

174
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,960
The leader is quite impressive.

175
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,960
He managed to gather so many equipment

176
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,960
and didn't miss anything.

177
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,960
Why didn't I hear my grandmother say it?

178
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,960
It was him.

179
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
It was him?

180
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,960
What was he?

181
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,960
Chen Wen Jin repeatedly mentioned it in his diary.

182
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,960
But he never knew

183
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
what he was.

184
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,960
Can you tell us

185
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,960
what he was?

186
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
He was always

187
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
in the Nine Gates.

188
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,960
He started earlier than Xisha

189
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
and even earlier than Ba Nai.

190
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,960
From your grandmother to Wu San Xi,

191
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,960
Chen Wen Jin, and Wu Xie,

192
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
he was always there.

193
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,960
Maybe from the moment the Nine Gates were born,

194
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,960
no matter which path you chose,

195
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,960
the fate of the Nine Gates

196
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,960
will be affected by it.

197
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
The Nine Gates have been

198
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,960
snuck in by the lowly.

199
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Everyone died in a strange way.

200
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,960
The leaders of the Xie family,

201
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
your old masters,

202
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
my master, Er Yue He,

203
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,960
and the devil you talk about,

204
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,960
what did the old generation

205
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,960
do?

206
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,960
Then,

207
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,960
should it be our turn?

208
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
Wu San Xing told me before

209
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,960
that you were going to break this trap.

210
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,960
How did you know

211
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,960
that I was arranged

212
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,960
to come here?

213
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
Who knows

214
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,960
if our investigation

215
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,960
is arranged?

216
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,960
But no matter if it is,

217
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,960
we are all inside.

218
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,960
From the moment I saw it,

219
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
I began to suspect that

220
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,960
it was not a kind of power,

221
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
but a kind of bewilderment.

222
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,960
It was a spiritual influence.

223
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,960
That's why it's always around,

224
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
everywhere.

225
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Otherwise,

226
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
it's hard to explain.

227
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,960
By the way, Xuxiu,

228
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,960
I want to see your grandmother.

229
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,960
You know my grandmother's temper.

230
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
But she is going to

231
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
Xinyue Hotel recently.

232
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Okay, I'll wait for her there.

233
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,960
Okay.

234
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Where did you get this?

235
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
I found it when I was cleaning up the house.

236
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,960
It's rare.

237
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,960
In the market,

238
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
most of the things

239
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,960
are related to royal palaces,

240
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,960
gardens, and large forest.

241
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,960
It's hard to see

242
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,960
such private clothes like this.

243
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,960
How about this?

244
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Give it to me.

245
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
I want to study it.

246
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,960
Actually, I don't care about this drawing.

247
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,960
I just really want to know

248
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,960
what's behind this drawing.

249
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
How about this?

250
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,960
Ask around in the industry.

251
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,960
If you find something,

252
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
I'll give you this drawing.

253
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,960
Okay, I'm glad to hear that.

254
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Fatty,

255
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,960
this young man,

256
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
I'm impressed with your skills.

257
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
But our boss's

258
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
sweeping machine is here.

259
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
Don't dig it.

260
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
The machine is not here yet.

261
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,960
I'll hit it again.

262
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Look, I told you it's here.

263
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
This thing

264
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
can sweep a mountain.

265
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
This is a drone that can sweep

266
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
the whole mountain.

267
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
It also has a variety of equipment.

268
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
You can see where the mountain is solid

269
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,960
and where it is hollow.

270
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
Where is the metal and where is the mine?

271
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,960
It's brought here from abroad.

272
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
It's much better than your manual work.

273
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Besides, our boss

274
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
is more urgent than you.

275
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
Okay, I'll do something else.

276
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Mr. Chen,

277
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
although this place is ordinary,

278
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
my friend opened it.

279
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
It's safe.

280
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,960
It's a little safer.

281
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
This is

282
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Ruan, who wants to buy your stuff.

283
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
Buy?

284
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
I didn't want to sell it.

285
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
He said

286
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,960
if you could find out about the thing behind the sample,

287
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,960
I would give it to you for free.

288
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,960
It's a real thing.

289
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
I'll give it to you.

290
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
It's a big deal.

291
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
Mr. Chen, don't refuse.

292
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,960
It's not a small sum of money.

293
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
Your shop

294
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
hasn't opened for three years.

295
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
It's enough.

296
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,960
How about

297
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
we start with a hand?

298
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
This is called a hand.

299
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
It's not convenient for us to talk about the price.

300
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
We hold our hands and

301
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
our fingers move.

302
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
It's the foot.

303
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
Have some tea.

304
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
Have some tea.

305
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,960
Mr. Chen, you're holding a cup.

306
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
It's called a broken cup.

307
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
It's not for sale.

308
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
You know it.

309
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
I'm a stock marketer.

310
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,960
Mr. Chen is running around.

311
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,960
I'm the only one in Wushan.

312
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
I'm surprised.

313
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
I didn't make much money.

314
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
How much money do you have?

315
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,960
I can ask you.

316
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
How much do you earn?

317
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Is the shop still open?

318
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
You don't have to pay this month.

319
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
I'll pay you in two days.

320
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,960
Remember.

321
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,960
Mr. Chen,

322
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
what's the use of this picture?

323
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
The owner likes it.

324
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
We have to help him find it.

325
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,960
We can't ask more.

326
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
Can you send a message

327
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
to let me meet your owner?

328
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Compared to the price,

329
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
I want to know

330
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
what's the use of this thing.

331
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
Our owner is a great man.

332
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
He's a great man.

333
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
He's a great man.

334
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
He's a great man.

335
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Our owner is a great man.

336
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,960
He's a great man.

337
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,960
He's a great man.

338
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
Mr. Chen,

339
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,960
the best thing in this industry

340
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,960
is the wine business.

341
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Of course.

342
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
In the Republic,

343
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,960
the wine business in Changsha

344
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
is well known.

345
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
If you want to do business

346
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
in Changsha,

347
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
you have to choose one of these.

348
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
There's no other way.

349
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Our Wu family

350
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,960
is also one of the nine families.

351
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
I wonder if your owner

352
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
will give you a chance.

353
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
I can try, but I can't guarantee it.

354
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
This is my name card.

355
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
Xishan Zheng Fuzhong.

356
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
I'm a man of my word.

357
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
I'm a man of my word.

358
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,960
I'm a man of my word.

359
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,960
Tomorrow, before noon,

360
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
wait for my news.

361
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
Then...

362
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
I'll be going.

363
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
Take care.

364
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,960
I didn't think there's still a chance to say no.

365
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
The other party

366
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,960
is so expensive.

367
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
I really want

368
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
what you have.

369
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,960
If I agree to meet you,

370
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,960
bring more people.

371
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,960
Money

372
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
can't be short.

373
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
Thank you, sir.

374
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
Mr. Pang.

375
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
Mr. Pang.

376
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,960
Where are you going?

377
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
I'm going to chop firewood.

378
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
The trees in the back mountain

379
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,960
are almost chopped by you.

380
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,960
Please wake up.

381
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
We don't lack firewood at home.

382
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,960
I'll go to feed the pigs.

383
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
You've fed them four times this morning.

384
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,960
I'll go pick the mushrooms.

385
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
I'll go to feed the pigs.

386
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
I'll go pick the mushrooms.

387
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
You still feed the pigs.

388
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,960
You haven't picked the peanuts, have you?

389
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,960
The peanuts haven't been cooked through.

390
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,960
Mr. Pang.

391
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
I know you're upset.

392
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
But we don't have to work anymore.

393
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,960
Mr. Pang.

394
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,960
I'm sorry.

395
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
I'm sorry.

396
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,960
You're not a good person.

397
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
I'm sorry.

398
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,960
I'm sorry.

399
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,960
I'm sorry.

400
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,960
I'm sorry.

401
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,960
You didn't do anything wrong.

402
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,960
You didn't do anything wrong.

403
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
Why are you so sorry?

404
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
Why are you so sorry?

405
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,960
Hello, Fatty.

406
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,960
Hello, Tianzhen.

407
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,960
How are you?

408
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,960
We're all fine.

409
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Have you found any clues?

410
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,960
I think so.

411
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,960
Fatty, let me tell you.

412
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,960
I'm going to the Xingyue Hotel in three days.

413
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,960
There might be some clues.

414
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,960
Xingyue Hotel?

415
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,960
The water there is deep.

416
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,960
You wait for us.

417
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
Xiao Ge and I

418
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,960
will go back to Beijing tomorrow.

419
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,960
Okay.

420
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,960
I'm going back to Beijing tomorrow.

421
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,960
But...

422
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,960
But before I leave,

423
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,960
I have to do something.

424
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,960
It hurts.

425
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,960
It hurts so much.

426
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,960
Fatty.

427
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
Fatty.

428
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
The boys here

429
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,960
will come here

430
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,960
to kiss

431
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
when they get older.

432
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,960
They will

433
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,960
put the girl's picture

434
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,960
on their own.

435
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
It means that they will never

436
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960
be separated.

437
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
Hey.

438
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Uncle Gui.

439
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,960
Is there any other way

440
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,960
to express your love?

441
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,960
No.

442
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,960
Only love?

443
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
Yes.

444
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
Come on.

445
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,960
Come on.

446
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
San Ye.

447
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
You are so rude.

448
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,960
You came to me after checking everything.

449
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,960
How is Uncle San's plate?

450
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,960
It's okay. I can hold it.

451
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,960
Do you want me to go to the Xingyue Hotel

452
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,960
with you?

453
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,960
I called Fatty and Xiao Ge.

454
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,960
Fatty is a man of his word.

455
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,960
But he is reliable.

456
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,960
He and Xiao Ge are like

457
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,960
your brothers.

458
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
They should go back to Beijing today.

459
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,960
Wang Meng.

460
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,960
You should go to Hangzhou today.

461
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,960
Boss.

462
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
You are so good at dancing.

463
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
When you finish your work,

464
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,960
I will give you a salary.

465
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,960
Great.

466
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,960
Boss, eat.

467
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
Cheers.

468
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,960
I will go back to the Yixiu.

469
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,960
I won't take away a cloud.

470
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
Do you want me to drink with you?

471
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,960
No.

472
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,960
I have a cold after I get my tattoo.

473
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,960
You have a cold?

474
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,960
I have a cold.

475
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,960
I have a cold.

476
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,960
I have a cold.

477
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
I have a cold.

478
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,960
Uncle A Gui said there is a custom in their village.

479
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,960
He wants to marry a girl

480
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
he loves.

481
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,960
He wants to tattoo her tattoo.

482
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,960
Where is it? Let me see.

483
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,960
Where is it?

484
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
Your tattoo is like Xiao Ge's.

485
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,960
It should be on the temperature.

486
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,960
No.

487
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
It should be here.

488
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,960
Here.

489
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,960
Where?

490
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,960
Here.

491
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,960
Just a little bit?

492
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,960
You call it tattoo?

493
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,960
Do you know how painful it is?

494
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,960
Can a person who dares to tattoo be called a human?

495
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
When you were not here,

496
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
I took good care of Xiao Ge.

497
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,960
Is it Xiao Ge?

498
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,960
I heard on the phone

499
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,960
you are going to Xing Yue Hotel.

500
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
After we finish eating,

501
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,960
we will go to the two-way street.

502
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
Otherwise, we can't even

503
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,960
touch the door of Xing Yue Hotel.

504
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,960
Is it that exaggerated?

505
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,960
Xing Yue Hotel is not like a glass factory.

506
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
They have a license to auction.

507
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,960
They have a large hotel.

508
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,960
Members are all fighting.

509
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,960
The collectors will give them

510
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
the top-class private collection.

511
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,960
They will first do

512
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
an internal and extreme screening.

513
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Then, they will apply for a review

514
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,960
from the relevant departments.

515
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,960
After getting the review,

516
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,960
they will auction.

517
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,960
I'm sorry, everyone.

518
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
We are having a auction today.

519
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
We are here to participate in the auction.

520
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,960
Please show me your invitation.

521
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,960
If you don't have an invitation,

522
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
you can have the bank's authorization

523
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,960
to prove your assets.

524
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,960
Why are you looking at me?

525
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,960
My bank card has long been out of credit.

526
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
I am the famous

527
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,960
Spanish shop, Xiao Jin Ke.

528
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,960
Let's go.

529
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,960
Forget it.

530
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,960
How about we just put it here?

531
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,960
An old man who lost his memory?

532
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,960
No password?

533
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,960
Whatever.

534
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Okay, thank you.

535
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,960
A black card?

536
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,960
Where did you get it?

537
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,960
I'll show you.

538
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,960
Xiao Ge,

539
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,960
the silk is out of stock.

540
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
This is Xiao Hua's, right?

541
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
I'll keep it for her.

542
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
I'll help her.

543
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,960
I'll call her later.

544
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,960
I'll return it to her when she comes back to Beijing.

545
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
I don't believe it.

546
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
I don't believe it.

547
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,960
Sir, your card.

548
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,960
You're welcome.

549
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,960
Please.

550
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,960
Mr. Hua.

551
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,960
Hello, Mr. Hua.

552
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,960
Fatty,

553
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,960
what did you say about my card?

554
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,960
You're a loser.

555
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,960
I didn't spend your money.

556
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,960
You're at Xing Yue Hotel?

557
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
We're here to have some tea.

558
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
What are you doing there?

559
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
Hello?

560
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,960
Hello?

561
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
The signal is bad, Mr. Hua.

562
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
Hello?

563
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,960
Hello?

564
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
Xing Yue Hotel is going to be a big hit today.

565
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
Oh my god.

566
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,960
7,000 yuan for a box of tea.

567
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
Why didn't I think of that?

568
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,960
It's a good place.

569
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,960
You promised Xiao Hua

570
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,960
you wouldn't spend her money.

571
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,960
I have to be humble.

572
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
Hello, sirs.

573
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,960
Let me introduce you.

574
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,960
We have not only these,

575
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
but also these economic ones.

576
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,960
You can choose this one.

577
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,960
This tea costs 1,800 yuan.

578
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,960
And we also have tea and melon seeds.

579
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
Is melon seeds free?

580
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,960
Yes.

581
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,960
Give me two.

582
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
Okay.

583
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,960
Look at that.

584
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
He's the same kind of person as you.

585
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,960
Looks like your buyer is rich.

586
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,960
He came here to attend the auction.

587
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,960
I can't tell.

588
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
I don't know what the auction is about.

589
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
Warning.

590
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
The buyer is less than one meter away from you.

591
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
Mr. Hua.

592
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,960
Mr. Hua.

593
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,960
Please.

594
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,960
You guys are saving money for me.

595
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,960
You're the owner of the property.

596
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
Thank you.

597
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,960
Mr. Hua, your room is ready.

598
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,960
What are you doing here?

599
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,960
I found a sample.

600
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,960
A buyer wanted to buy it.

601
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
So I came here.

602
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,960
A sample?

603
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,960
I know who this buyer is.

604
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
How do you know?

605
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,960
I heard something about him in Xingyue Hotel.

606
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,960
Mr. Hua.

607
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,960
Liuli Sun.

608
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Who's your boss?

609
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
Our boss is the famous Liuli Sun.

610
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
He's the sample in Beijing.

611
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
He must be involved in the auction.

612
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,960
He's just a guy who's always in the way.

613
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,960
You know him?

614
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,960
I heard about him.

615
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
There's no news about Wu Sanxing on the street.

616
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,960
Where did he go?

617
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,960
That's what he's like.

618
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,960
He's been gone for three days.

619
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,960
I heard he's dead.

620
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,960
Is that true?

621
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,960
He's a man of his word.

622
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
He's a man of his word.

623
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
If Wu Sanxing hears that

624
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,960
someone's trying to kill him

625
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,960
he'll be dead.

626
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,960
Liuli, don't take it seriously.

627
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,960
Who's your Liuli?

628
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
My uncle is very well.

629
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,960
Thank you for your concern.

630
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
Please go upstairs.

631
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,960
You're so rude.

632
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,960
I wish you a long life.

633
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,960
The ring is made of red silk.

634
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,960
It's made of silk.

635
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
It's made of silk.

636
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,980
This is the beautiful

637
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,980
three of you.

638
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,980
Please.

639
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,980
What culture is Xingyue Hotel

640
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,980
doing here?

641
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,980
It's probably their rule.

642
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,980
Brother, let's set up a formation.

643
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,980
Let's show off

644
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,980
to our young master today.

645
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,980
Don't look at me.

646
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,980
We're your friends.

647
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,980
Let's go.

648
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,980
Young Master San, please.

649
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,980
Okay, Fatty.

650
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,980
Which one is the buyer of the ring?

651
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,980
This way.

652
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,980
It's him.

653
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,980
Brother Wu Xie.

654
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,980
Why are you here?

655
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,980
Come with me.

656
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,980
Grandma, here they are.

657
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,980
This is my grandma.

658
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,580
They call her the Fairy of the

659
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,580
World.

660
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,580
You can call her Madam Huo.

661
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,580
Hello, Madam Huo.

662
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,580
I'm Wu Xie.

663
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,580
You're really like Old Wu.

664
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,580
I can't believe you told me.

665
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,580
That dog

666
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,580
is really not bad.

667
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,580
Do you know my grandpa?

668
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,580
Not only that.

669
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,580
Since you know him so well,

670
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,580
that's great.

671
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,580
I'm not your grandpa.

672
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,580
I'm your grandma.

673
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
You look more like him when you smile.

674
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
It doesn't look like a good thing.

675
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
Did my grandpa owe the Huo family

676
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
any debt?

677
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Just tell me.

678
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Did he sell the ring or not?

679
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Actually, it doesn't matter to me.

680
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
I just want to know

681
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,200
why you bought it at a high price.

682
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
And what's on it?

683
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,200
You want to know?

684
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,200
Fine.

685
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,200
But you can't ask me.

686
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,200
Your grandma has to ask me.

687
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
I'm sure it's a debt.

688
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
Please be prepared.

689
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,200
The auction is about to begin.

690
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,200
Here.

691
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,200
I'll get it.

692
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Mr. Xiang.

693
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
Hello.

694
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
One more.

695
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
Mr. Xiang.

696
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
Luoluo.

697
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
Open the door.

698
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,200
There are many kinds of red wine.

699
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,200
There's a very rare one.

700
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,200
And it's very hard to decipher.

701
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,200
This is the one I brought.

702
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
It looks good.

703
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
How many words?

704
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,200
Come forward.

705
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,200
A little faster.

706
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
Come on.

707
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,200
Come on.

708
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
Hello.

709
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,200
Hello.

710
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,200
It looks good.

711
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,200
Can you help me with the painting?

712
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,200
I still have the paper.

713
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,200
It looks good.

714
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,200
This is my name tag.

715
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,520
Point over there.

716
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,500
The Dance of Phoenix

717
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,500
is too short to see.

718
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,040
Oh, no.

719
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,360
You were engaged with the roll,

720
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,700
It seems you need more luck in it.

721
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,040
Plug in your electric cable.

722
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:42,440
Say again

723
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,320
Where?

724
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:55,280
Heal the ㅎㅎ

725
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,100
Q

726
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,100
I'm sorry.

727
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,100
I'm coming.

728
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,100
Cut. One more time.

729
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,100
Check.

730
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,100
Okay. One more time.

731
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,100
Cut. Okay. That's enough.

732
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,100
A little further.

733
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,100
Where is it?

734
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,100
Your tattoo is like a small brother.

735
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,100
One more time. I'm sorry.

736
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,100
I'll talk to you later.

737
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,100
Just a little bit.

738
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,100
You call it a tattoo?

739
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,100
After the tattoo.

740
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,100
One more time.

741
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,100
Those are all made by members.

742
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,100
Not what you can buy.

743
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,100
You have to take a close-up shot.

744
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,100
Come on. One last time.

745
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,100
Come on.

746
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,100
I'm sorry.

747
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,100
One more time.

748
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,100
Is it okay?

749
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,100
Why are you here?

750
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,100
Is it okay?

751
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,100
One more time.

752
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,100
Okay. One more time.

753
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,100
This is my grandma.

754
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,100
Others call her Aunt Huo.

755
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,100
You can call her Mrs. Huo.

756
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,100
Okay. Cut. Cut.
