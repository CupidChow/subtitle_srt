1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah!

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're really good at this.

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Xiao He, the moon, chases Han Xin.

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He's Xiao He in the city, and also Xiao He in the outside.

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Xiao He?

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He's good too.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Grandma, the news about you and Uncle Lu Huang

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
was given by him to Brother Wu Xie.

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
How do you know?

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Brother Wu Xie still cooperated with us in the end.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He's just a man of two.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He can only apologize.

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Qiu Degao has a map of the whole Yangjiashan.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
He's really helped us a lot.

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But it's not that he's the only one.

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's go back.

18
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This is the end of the Huo Tang House.

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So many holes.

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
There are more holes in the place where the tree is blocked.

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The locals call it the Divine House.

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This is the appearance map I drew in advance.

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
There are numbers in every hole.

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Someone has been to the yellow sign.

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The rest is the same.

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Someone has been to the yellow sign.

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The rest is up to us.

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
How do we find such a high cliff?

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's so steep that you can only use your men to climb up and down.

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The rock climbing equipment you mentioned is too traditional.

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Someone has a better way, right?

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What way?

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I said, Xiao Hua.

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Xiao Hua.

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Are you going to climb up with bare hands?

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Second Master, how about I do it?

37
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Climb up and climb up to 50 heads.

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Can you?

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
50 heads.

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You?

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's too slow.

42
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's not worth the price.

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Although I'm a man of two,

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
you can't look down on the skilled people, okay?

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Wait for me to put the rope down and you can go up.

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Be careful.

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Don't worry.

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'll go up.

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Does the old lady like flowers?

50
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's good to have no one to rely on.

51
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It takes 500 days to bloom.

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Tell Qiu Degao,

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
don't waste your effort.

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Our boss said that this thing has nothing to do with cooperation.

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's just a little bit of a gift from an old friend.

56
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll go.

57
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Tell Qiu Degao,

58
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll leave a mark along the way,

59
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and let your people in.

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Thank you.

61
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm asking for a reason.

62
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Qiu Degao,

63
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
he's trying to kill himself.

64
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm asking for a reason.

65
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Wang Xiang's mother,

66
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
wanted to eat fish in winter and summer.

67
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Wang Xiang put her clothes on the ice,

68
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
and melted the ice,

69
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
so she could get a carp.

70
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's a story of 24-year-old school.

71
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Grandma, Qiu Degao is really a villain.

72
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He knows you're worried about your aunt,

73
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and he used this to make you sad.

74
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Why are you asking him for a reason?

75
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
To cooperate.

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Think about it.

77
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What he sent these days.

78
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I told you,

79
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
he sent such a difficult thing,

80
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
two or three times in a row.

81
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
He was prepared,

82
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
waiting for you to come and help him.

83
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Tell Wu Xie,

84
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
when Uncle Lu Huang and I started to have a relationship,

85
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
he knew I would come.

86
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Maybe even earlier.

87
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's a long story.

88
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I underestimated him before.

89
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He has bought the map now.

90
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We have no reason not to go.

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Inform him to go.

92
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We'll set off right away.

93
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'll go.

94
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Qiu Degao sent a lot of things to this old lady.

95
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't know what they talked about.

96
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We have to be careful.

97
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Grandma, everything is ready.

98
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Let's go.

99
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Good, good, good.

100
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I say,

101
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
you want to shoot the second time?

102
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You just have to put the rope down.

103
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Isn't it over?

104
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Come on.

105
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Take it.

106
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Find the marking position above.

107
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Don't get it wrong.

108
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The equipment is almost ready.

109
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
When the fire department is ready,

110
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
we go up from the side.

111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's easier to climb there.

112
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Grass?

113
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You'll know in a while.

114
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'll go.

115
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This is the entrance.

116
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The reference objects around are right.

117
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The gap marked on the map is the entrance.

118
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's here.

119
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Now there is no road.

120
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Where is the entrance?

121
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Brother,

122
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
why don't we find it ourselves?

123
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Can we spend more time?

124
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I don't believe it.

125
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We can't find the entrance.

126
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Qiu Dakao said

127
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
he found another entrance.

128
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Here.

129
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Grandma,

130
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Qiu Dakao said

131
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
we have to do everything we can.

132
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
We can't go down from here.

133
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What do you mean?

134
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
He has never gone back from here.

135
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This place

136
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
has other things

137
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
besides the secret camel.

138
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Anyway,

139
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
let's take my wall to check

140
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and go down first.

141
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Right, brother?

142
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
There are so many holes.

143
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's hard to find the cave

144
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
where Uncle Lu Huang was found.

145
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Let's dig one by one.

146
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
As long as we have enough time,

147
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
we can dig all the way.

148
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We have to dig until the end of the year.

149
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Did that old woman

150
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
leave any other clues?

151
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The owner of the goods

152
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
was not a man.

153
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
He was a man.

154
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He was a man.

155
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
He was a man.

156
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He was a man.

157
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
He was a man.

158
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He was a man.

159
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
He was a man.

160
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
He was a man.

161
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
He was a man.

162
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
He was a man.

163
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He was a man.

164
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He was a man.

165
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The owner of the goods

166
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
was not a man.

167
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Besides,

168
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
after so many years,

169
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
even if the wind blows,

170
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
the sun has already gone.

171
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But now we only know

172
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
the cave is in the middle.

173
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It seems that we have to look for it.

174
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Are you afraid?

175
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Be careful.

176
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Be careful.

177
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's here.

178
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You go down to me now.

179
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'll be here waiting

180
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
for the news from Miss Si.

181
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Wait a minute.

182
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Old lady,

183
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
your arrangement

184
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
is not very good.

185
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Do you have any deal

186
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
with Qiu Dakao?

187
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
We can't accept

188
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
this deal.

189
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I don't want you

190
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
to be the one in trouble.

191
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
If you don't go down,

192
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
we can understand.

193
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
After all,

194
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
your age is here.

195
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But Xiu Xiu has to be with us.

196
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
This team

197
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
has to have a member of the Huo family

198
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
to enter the cave.

199
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Okay.

200
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Cool.

201
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Cool.

202
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Everyone, prepare your equipment.

203
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Those who are responsible for the robbery

204
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
should wear your protective suits

205
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and start the road first.

206
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Others, put on light makeup and cut their hair.

207
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Let's go down one by one.

208
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Come on.

209
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm Hua.

210
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You're talking about this?

211
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Is it safe?

212
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Of course it's safe.

213
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Of course it's safe.

214
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It was invented by the Finns.

215
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
There is a bird-like photographer

216
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
who designed it specially

217
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
to shoot the eagle on the cliff.

218
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
With this equipment,

219
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
you can live on the cliff

220
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
for several months without falling.

221
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I can't get up.

222
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
They are watching down there.

223
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
We'll stay here for a few days.

224
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm old.

225
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I can't climb up

226
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
if I climb again.

227
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
There are so many holes here.

228
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Why don't you go to the cave to rest?

229
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Because

230
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
we don't know what's inside.

231
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Be careful not to get into your mouth

232
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
while you sleep in the middle of the night.

233
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
All right, let's go to bed.

234
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
We have to work later.

235
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's comfortable here.

236
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Let's go.

237
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
We just received the message.

238
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Boss, Mrs. Kuo is gone scouting.

239
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Wu Xie has started to climb as well.

240
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But we don't have any action from now.

241
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So what should we do next?

242
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Should we take action?

243
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
No, we keep steady now.

244
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Giving them the map is quite a big help.

245
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And the next is Miss Horstair.

246
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
We don't take action

247
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
unless we find something.

248
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Follow closely.

249
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Look under the bridge.

250
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Brother Xia, this place is quite big.

251
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Keep walking.

252
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The monster in the capital.

253
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Please help me.

254
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
This body is in a row.

255
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I can't see anything.

256
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I can't see anything.

257
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I can't see anything.

258
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I can't see anything.

259
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I can't see anything.

260
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The body is in a row.

261
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's like a human.

262
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's a bit evil.

263
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You two, go ahead and scout.

264
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
There's no way forward.

265
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
This is it.

266
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's similar to the firecracker.

267
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It can be burnt with a scissor.

268
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The back is made of a knife.

269
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Scissor it. Hurry.

270
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yes.

271
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Let's move back.

272
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Go.

273
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's dead.

274
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It smells like sulfur.

275
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Someone touched it.

276
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Sulfur?

277
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
There's sulfur on it?

278
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Without a scissor, it can't open the door.

279
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
If you use a scissor, it will react with sulfur.

280
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It will generate a lot of heat.

281
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You're too much.

282
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You set up this trap.

283
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You're too much.

284
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Brother Qin, there's no way forward.

285
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Let's fight.

286
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What are you waiting for? Go.

287
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Go.

288
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Go.

289
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Brother Qin, if you go on like this, we'll be in trouble.

290
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You cover me. I'll go get the scissor.

291
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Brother Qin.

292
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Go.

293
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Watch out.

294
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Fatty.

295
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Brother Fatty.

296
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Brother Fatty.

297
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Fatty.

298
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It hurts.

299
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm tired.

300
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
How long have I slept?

301
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You slept for two hours.

302
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Eat an egg.

303
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Thanks.

304
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I said this tide is really stable.

305
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I just rolled over and rolled in there.

306
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I didn't even move.

307
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Okay, little third master.

308
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's not three days, but it's worth it.

309
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Smell it.

310
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Xiao Hua said this tide is stable.

311
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I have to believe it.

312
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You'd better not believe me.

313
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Believe in technology.

314
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The diameter of this tide's steel material is 40 millimeters.

315
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The pressure to bear is ten times the weight of the human body.

316
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
As long as this tide is trapped in the interface of the mountain body,

317
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
let alone crazy,

318
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
it's not even afraid of earthquakes.

319
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Then how do you choose this interface?

320
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It's not difficult.

321
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's the same as the choice of rock climbing.

322
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's not difficult.

323
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's the same as the choice of rock climbing.

324
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
As long as this mountain body structure is stable enough.

325
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
What's wrong?

326
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Xiao Hua.

327
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Who lives in the city?

328
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
The interface is so big.

329
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Is this safe?

330
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Wu Xie, don't move.

331
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Wu Xie.

332
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I don't want to move either.

333
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
But I can't get up in this position.

334
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Wu Xie, don't move.

335
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Don't move.

336
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Listen to my command.

337
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Wu Xie, move slowly.

338
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Tie the rope.

339
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Hua Rui, you too.

340
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Hold on.

341
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Now...

342
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Now, as long as there is nothing in the way,

343
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
we will be safe.

344
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Oh my god.

345
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Is it that dangerous?

346
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Wu Xie.

347
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Hold on.

348
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Hua Rui.

349
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Can you fight against Wu Xie's life?

350
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Are you trying to persuade me to rob?

351
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You don't have to save me.

352
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I can only ask for this money from you.

354
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
500.

355
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Wu Xie, hold on.

356
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Hold on.

357
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Hold on.

358
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Don't move.

359
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
No.

360
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Come up.

361
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
My glasses are about to fall off.

362
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Don't move.

363
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It's weird.

364
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Now it's urgent.

365
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Come up.

366
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
No.

367
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Come down.

368
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I can't hold on.

369
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Little Third Master, do you want to kill us?

370
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Brother Pan.

371
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Where is this place?

372
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
We burned a gap from that place just now.

373
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Turn around and we'll be here.

374
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Where is Little Third Master?

375
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
He's guarding the passage.

376
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Brother Pan, that Milos is afraid of robbing.

377
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
We just sprayed a lot of water.

378
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Now we can't see anything.

379
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Are you okay?

380
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm just a little injured.

381
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I was just too tired.

382
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I need to rest.

383
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
You're awake.

384
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Brother Pan, how is it going over there?

385
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm relieved to be healed.

386
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
This place is really well designed.

387
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
If you want to open the way,

388
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
the strong and the weak will produce heat.

389
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Once you open the way, you'll be healed.

390
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
The people who planned this are still good at chemistry.

391
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Don't let me get him out.

392
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Otherwise, we have to use him to fill the gap.

393
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
We've already lost two of our men.

394
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Now we're only half way through the robbery.

395
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
What should we do?

396
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Then we have to leave this place quickly.

397
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
There are so many people here.

398
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
The temperature will rise very quickly.

399
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
If we keep attracting the Mi Luo Tuo,

400
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
it'll be a problem.

401
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Then let's go.

402
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Let's go.

403
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Tell the people in the inspection office to disappear.

404
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Tell the new ones to stop if anything happens.

405
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Chop them up!

406
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It's so scary.

407
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You want to chop them up?

408
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Do you want to know how the Xie family

409
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
deals with people who owe money?

410
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Don't move.

411
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Be careful of the lock.

412
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
This should be a battle suit.

413
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And someone wore it before.

414
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
This isn't for us, is it?

415
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It's unreasonable to send equipment before paying.

416
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
This is a reinforced one.

417
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It looks like it's supposed to be safe.

418
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It looks like it's supposed to be safe.

419
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Or we have to seal the things in the cave with mud.

420
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
This is probably the place we're looking for.

421
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Look over there.

422
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
The traces look a little strange.

423
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
This is made of rock and cement.

424
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It can be dug up.

425
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Didn't you say you could dig it up?

426
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
No way.

427
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
How could you be so kind to let me dig it up alone?

428
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Three of them.

429
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
30.

430
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Two.

431
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Done.

432
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Sir, do you want me to make you a chair

433
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
so you can rest?

434
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
One.

435
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
One!

436
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
One.

437
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Fine.

438
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
One for each.

439
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
The people of Laodong are the most glorious.

440
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
There's no way out.

441
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
This is a maze.

442
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm so tired.

443
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I'm so tired.

444
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Here.

445
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Here.

446
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Wait.

447
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Let's dig a little bit deeper.

448
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
We'll be in trouble if we don't.

449
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Understood.

450
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Here.

451
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
No problem.

452
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Just spray it.

453
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Here.

454
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Which way is this?

455
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
You and your partner wait here.

456
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
It looks safe at the moment.

457
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'll go with Brother Xiao.

458
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I'll go with you.

459
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Look, you're still injured.

460
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
If something happens, I can take care of you.

461
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
You have a conscience.

462
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Come on.

463
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
How dare you!

464
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
You're a man of your word.

465
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Get up.

466
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
They're all my brothers.

467
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You're all from the Qiule School.

468
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Isn't this the little brother of the tombstone?

469
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Why are you here?

470
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I said you guys are crazy.

471
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Who's biting who?

472
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Misunderstood.

473
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It's a misunderstanding.

474
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It's like this.

475
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Our boss arranged us to come in and do physical scanning.

476
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
But we were attacked by someone.

477
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Not only did we destroy our scanning devices,

478
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
but also hit our team members.

479
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So we had to run back and forth.

480
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
We just got here.

481
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
We heard someone coming.

482
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
So we took you as our security.

483
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Sorry.

484
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
One person?

485
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Yes.

486
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
One person.

487
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Uncle Xuan is very powerful.

488
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Not under this little brother.

489
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
His skills are not under this little brother.

490
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
He's alive.

491
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
In the Eight Seas.

492
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I've only seen one person.

493
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
His shoulder.

494
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
His shoulder?

495
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
What do you mean?

496
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You came from that way?

497
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Yes.

498
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
That's the gap we came through.

499
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
But now it's blocked.

500
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Looks like there's no way here.

501
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Let's go back.

502
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Then we'll go together?

503
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Wait.

504
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Come here.

505
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Come here.

506
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Come here.

507
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I think the sunset is beautiful.

508
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
But we should go down the mountain soon.

509
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
He's not going to dig until night, is he?

510
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
That's too weak.

511
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Master Hua.

512
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Are you done?

513
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
No.

514
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Go dig.

515
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Master Hua.

516
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
What's wrong?

517
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That cement is red.

518
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's blood.

519
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
This mud is made of blood.

520
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
If someone is injured or dead,

521
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
they wouldn't have to bleed so much.

522
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Could it be the dog blood used for bloodshed?

523
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And look at this blood.

524
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It's all coming from the inside to the outside.

525
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
It's not blood.

526
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It's blood.

527
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
It's blood.

528
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
It's blood.

529
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
There's no oxygen in it.

530
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
The iron element in the blood has not been oxidized.

531
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So the color hasn't faded.

532
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Master Hua, let's dig again.

533
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Dig again?

534
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Yeah, I can't dig anymore.

535
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
No.

536
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I don't want your 500 yuan.

537
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You dig.

538
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Dig by yourself.

539
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
All right.

540
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Let's call it a day.

541
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
The nest is fixed.

542
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Go to bed early.

543
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I told you.

544
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
How could there be someone as kind as Master Hua?

545
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
How could it be?

546
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Let's go.

547
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Master Pang.

548
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
What's up?

549
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Why are you so secretive?

550
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Master Pang, let's go together.

551
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Let's cooperate.

552
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Brother, I'm not cruel.

553
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
You can only be a hindrance.

554
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
We have equipment.

555
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Our boss's equipment is the best.

556
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
What do you want, Pang Yuan?

557
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Just say it.

558
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
You said you've been sweeping the mountains for so long.

559
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
There's no hard work.

560
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
There is.

561
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Look.

562
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
This is the latest map we got from the mountain sweep.

563
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
It's reliable.

564
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
It seems that the high-tech of Qiu Dekou is still useful.

565
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
How about it?

566
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Let's go together.

567
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
All right.

568
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Wait.

569
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'll take this map myself.

570
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
After all, there's a saying, don't kill the mule.

571
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
You're good at Chinese.

572
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You can even speak Chinese.

573
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It's much easier.

574
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I can even put up a sign.

575
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Who do you think is the sign?

576
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I...

577
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Give it to me.

578
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Brother, we're in the same boat.

579
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
You won't abandon me, will you?

580
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
This way.

581
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Brother, let's rest today.

582
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Tomorrow, we'll try to follow this map.

583
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
The water is too sticky.

584
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
The water is too sticky.

585
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It's very dangerous.

586
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Be careful.

587
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
What's this?

588
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Is it a monster?

589
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It's a monster.

590
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
The reason why the Jiu Men lost their lives was probably because of this.

591
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Are these corpses dripping with sweat?

592
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
They might want to climb out.

593
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And the blood smell is so strong.

594
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
There should be a lot more inside.

595
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It looks like there are still a lot of people alive.

596
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
They were directly sealed by the water that was poured in.

597
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It's like my recipe.

598
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I mean, I only do this when I have no other choice.

599
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
This wasn't done by Chief Huo's team.

600
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Otherwise, he wouldn't have told us.

601
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I think this method of water is only available after the 1970s.

602
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,000
So after the Jiu Men, someone else came here.

603
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
If both sides came here,

604
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
then it means that the mechanism here is definitely not one-time.

605
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And it's very dangerous.

606
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
We have to be careful.

607
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Let's do it.

608
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Okay, stop.

609
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Ready?

610
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Wait a minute.

611
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Wait a minute.

612
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Ready.

613
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Cut.

614
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Lie down.

615
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Keep this.

616
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Faster.

617
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Listen.

618
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Turn around.

619
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
One, two, three.

620
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Is it okay?

621
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Is it okay?

622
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It's okay.

623
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Here.

624
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Stop.

625
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
One more time.

626
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Wait.

627
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It's okay.

628
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Go.

629
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Cut.

630
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Cut.

631
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Okay.

632
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
It's okay.

633
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Let's do it again.

634
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
What's going on?

635
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
They're coming down.

636
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
You two, look ahead.

637
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Okay.

638
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I'm sorry.

639
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Come on.

640
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Cut.

641
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Okay.

642
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Cut.

643
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Cut.

644
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Okay.

645
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Cut.

646
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Okay.

647
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Cut.

648
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Okay.

649
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Cut.

650
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
One more time.

651
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Faster.

652
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Faster.

653
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
It's okay.

654
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Wu Xie.

655
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Cut.

656
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Okay.

657
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Now,

658
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
as long as there's no mess,

659
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
we can find Wu Xie.

660
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
There's no problem.

661
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
We just...

662
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Oh my god.

663
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I'm sorry.

664
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I have to...

665
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Cut.

666
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Wait.

667
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
The bullet in his waist is all cut.

668
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Okay.

669
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Wu Xie, hold on.

670
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Cut.

671
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Okay.

672
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm sorry.

673
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I have to ask you for this money.

674
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Cut.

675
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Okay.

676
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
It's too hard for me and Xiao Ge.

677
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Okay.

678
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
It's your fault.

679
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Cut.

680
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Okay.

681
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I'm sorry.

682
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
What are you doing?

683
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I'm sorry.

684
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Okay.

685
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
You're all from the police.

686
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Yes.

687
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
You're wrong.

688
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
We're from the police.

689
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Let's look around again.

690
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
You're still digging?

691
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I'm not digging.

692
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I was wrong.

693
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Lei Yu.
