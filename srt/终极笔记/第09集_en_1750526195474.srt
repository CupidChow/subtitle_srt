1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I am not a thief.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I am a thief.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I am a thief.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I am a thief.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I am a thief.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I am a thief.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I am a thief.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I am a thief.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I am a thief.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I am a thief.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I am a thief.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I am a thief.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I am a thief.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I am a thief.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I am a thief.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I am a thief.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am a thief.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I am a thief.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I am a thief.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I am a thief.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I am a thief.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I am a thief.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am a thief.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I am a thief.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I am a thief.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I am a thief.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I am a thief.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I am a thief.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I am a thief.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I am a thief.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Thank you forWhy I am A thief.

32
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,300
why?

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Dear My Lady!

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It is not a moment that we don't get away with this.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,400
The rest should be enough.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,720
And...

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,120
Brother lost his knife.

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,480
It's a loss.

39
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,280
I'll think of a way to get the black army's share.

40
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,720
Tianzhen, before you think of a way,

41
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,160
can you think of a way to comfort me?

42
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,320
You're so stubborn.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,640
I can beat you.

44
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,720
Let's get it fixed.

45
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,240
We'll go back and find the equipment.

46
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,920
An Ning,

47
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,240
let's save the rest.

48
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,360
It's too risky to go back.

49
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,600
We lost not only the equipment,

50
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,480
but also the supply.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,280
Before we find Wu Sanxing,

52
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,840
we have to make sure that he's alive.

53
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,400
I...

54
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,800
It's easy for you to say.

55
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,080
When we were chased by Da Mang,

56
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,160
we ran around.

57
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,360
Where did we lose the equipment?

58
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,280
We can't find it.

59
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,280
Da Mang chased us.

60
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,760
He destroyed many trees along the way.

61
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,600
According to those traces,

62
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,880
we should be able to find it.

63
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,760
Let's go in five minutes.

64
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,480
Yes, sir, madam.

65
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,600
An Ning, come here.

66
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,480
What's wrong?

67
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,840
An Ning.

68
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,760
An Ning.

69
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,240
An Ning.

70
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,200
I...

71
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,000
Everyone has their own way

72
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,120
of protecting each other

73
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,400
and keeping their faith in each other.

74
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,320
No matter how much trouble we have to face,

75
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,520
we have to trust each other

76
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,400
and live in the darkness.

77
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,520
How lucky we are because of you.

78
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,080
Yes.

79
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,200
Leave everything to him.

80
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,760
All the traces

81
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,160
have me and you together.

82
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,520
We share the evidence

83
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,640
of the reason for our existence.

84
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,840
How lucky we are because of you.

85
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,840
Let me gradually understand

86
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,840
some of the reasons.

87
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,840
I'm not sure

88
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,840
but I need you to listen to me.

89
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
I'll go with you.

90
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
He cares about your life.

91
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
I won't go with you.

92
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,840
You go first.

93
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,840
I'll wait for the Pinocchio.

94
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
Nezha.

95
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
Go!

96
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
Yes.

97
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
Go and buy..

98
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,840
I'll buy second-grade buyers.

99
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Pminu.

100
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,840
What's wrong with you?

101
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
You want to kill me, right?

102
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,840
If I had known before,

103
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
I wouldn't have been soft-hearted

104
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,840
in order to survive.

105
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,840
Because of you,

106
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,840
I slowly understand

107
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
some of the principles.

108
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,840
I'm confused.

109
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,840
I just want you to come back.

110
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Miss Anjian,

111
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
life and death are predestined.

112
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,840
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
Xiao Sen Ye,

114
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
let's go.

115
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
Qian Zhen,

116
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
don't you want to carry An Ning

117
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
to the West Palace?

118
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,840
Sun Wei,

119
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
she came for this.

120
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,840
I'll carry you even if you die.

121
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,840
I slowly understand

122
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,840
some of the principles.

123
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
I'm confused.

124
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,840
I just want you to come back.

125
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
From the time I arrived in Jin Yu,

126
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,840
I didn't find any sign.

127
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
And I've eaten everything.

128
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
If I don't meet Wu San Xing again,

129
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,840
I'll have to eat the snake's food.

130
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,840
It's not bad to have a barbecue.

131
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Did you smell anything?

132
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
It's the steam.

133
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
Leave here.

134
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
An Ning,

135
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
I promised you

136
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
that I would take you to the West Palace.

137
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
Qian Zhen,

138
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
be careful.

139
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Xiao Sen Ye, look.

140
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
That's...

141
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Let's go.

142
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Come on.

143
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,840
Come on.

144
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
Come on.

145
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
It's easy to get lost in the forest.

146
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,840
Second Master, don't fall into the water.

147
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Don't worry.

148
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
I won't fall back.

149
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Oh my God!

150
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,840
Is this the ruins of the West Palace?

151
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
Let's not waste time.

152
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
Let's not waste time.

153
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
The stone we're standing on

154
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
is a part of the water statue.

155
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
There's a mark of the tiger on it.

156
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
It's the stone statue of the West Palace.

157
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
The stone statue of the water

158
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
is a statue of the city's architecture.

159
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
It's the effect of

160
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
the spiritual power of the past.

161
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
Of course.

162
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
In the past,

163
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,840
the West Palace was the spiritual leader of the Western Regions.

164
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,840
Its palace was never cold and sour.

165
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
That's so spectacular.

166
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
But why did the West Palace

167
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
fall into the water?

168
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,840
I think the West Palace was destroyed

169
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,840
after the destruction of the Western Regions.

170
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,840
The water system was not working.

171
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
The underground water was flooded.

172
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
The water was flooded.

173
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,840
The palace was submerged.

174
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
The West Palace should be huge.

175
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,840
What we see now is just a small part.

176
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
But it's all in the mud under the water.

177
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
How do we get in?

178
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,840
Sir, you've walked all the way with Anning.

179
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
You won't let us help you.

180
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,840
I think we should rest here for a night.

181
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
We'll think of something tomorrow.

182
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,840
I'm tired already.

183
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Let's go.

184
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
Sir, we're here.

185
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
We're here.

186
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
You're poisoned.

187
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
What are you doing?

188
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
It hurts.

189
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
It hurts.

190
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
Sir,

191
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
Sir,

192
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
Don't talk.

193
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
Let's go.

194
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,840
What's wrong?

195
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
I've found a way.

196
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
Sir,

197
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
This is not a trap.

198
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
It's a snake's hole.

199
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,840
Sir,

200
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
Why are you standing there?

201
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,840
Do you want to die?

202
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Don't move.

203
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
Come on.

204
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
Hold this.

205
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
If we go down like this,

206
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,840
the deeper the deeper.

207
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
Look.

208
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
It's a tent.

209
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,840
Tent is the most poisonous tent.

210
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
We're going to die this time.

211
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,840
Come on.

212
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
Leave me alone.

213
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
Cut the rope.

214
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,840
I'm really leaving.

215
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
Tie me up before you leave.

216
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,840
Come on.

217
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
Why are you still here?

218
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
You hurt me.

219
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,840
I'll pull you out.

220
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,840
Pull me?

221
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
Are you a hooligan?

222
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,840
Stop talking nonsense.

223
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,840
I'm a little...

224
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,840
Shut up.

225
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,840
Come on.

226
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
Come on.

227
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
Hands up.

228
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
What's wrong, sir?

229
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
Why did you open the sleeping bag?

230
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,840
When we were sleeping,

231
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,840
something was crawling.

232
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
There's a footprint.

233
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,840
Fatty.

234
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Fatty.

235
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
Fatty.

236
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,840
What's this?

237
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,840
What's this?

238
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,840
What's this?

239
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,840
It's a nightingale.

240
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,840
Thank God, Fatty is my best friend.

241
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,840
Otherwise, I would have been dead.

242
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
This is too dangerous.

243
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,840
Could it be that the sleeping bag was opened by a snake?

244
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,840
No.

245
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,840
It's not.

246
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,840
It's not.

247
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
It's not.

248
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,840
It's not.

249
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
It's not.

250
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,840
No.

251
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,840
This is a human footprint.

252
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,840
Go.

253
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
We can't catch it.

254
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
This guy is not a big deal.

255
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,840
He ran up in the water like a rabbit.

256
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,840
We scared him.

257
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,840
He looks like a human.

258
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,840
Fatty, let's go back and get the equipment.

259
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,840
Sir, Brother has a sense.

260
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,840
We can't help him.

261
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
Yes, Tianzhen.

262
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
Let's go back and wait for him.

263
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
Oh, no.

264
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
Tianzhen.

265
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
Tianzhen.

266
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
Where is Anning?

267
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,840
Could it be that the snake has moved the body?

268
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,840
It's possible.

269
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,840
Judging from the posture, it's not just one.

270
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,840
We haven't been there for a while.

271
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,840
Anning must be around.

272
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
I'll go find her.

273
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,840
Brother San, there are hundreds of snakes here.

274
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,840
It's too dangerous.

275
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
She can't be in the snake den.

276
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
A person lives.

277
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,840
A dead person is a dead body.

278
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,840
We can't take her back now.

279
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
Even if it's her own destiny.

280
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,840
If you don't do this job, what will you do?

281
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
Kill.

282
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
Yes, Tianzhen.

283
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,840
If one day, I'll be dead too.

284
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,840
Burn me.

285
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,840
Don't leave me to those snakes.

286
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
Who knows what they're doing with my body?

287
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,840
Anyway, let's leave this place now.

288
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,840
What if the snake comes back?

289
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
We can't stand for a few minutes.

290
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
If we really meet Anning underground.

291
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
She will also laugh at us.

292
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,840
Yes, Sir.

293
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,840
Let's find a safe place.

294
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,840
Let's wait for the snake to come back.

295
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
Come out.

296
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,840
Everything is fine.

297
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,840
Remember.

298
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,840
Make sure Wu Xie enters the West Palace.

299
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840
If there's a wild chicken and rabbit.

300
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,840
With some chili and some natural ingredients.

301
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,840
It will be perfect.

302
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
It's not a big deal.

303
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
Tianzhen.

304
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
The mud man yesterday.

305
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
There must be something wrong.

306
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,840
Do you think something will happen to Xiaoge?

307
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,840
Xiaoge will be fine.

308
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
Enough.

309
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,840
Stop pretending.

310
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,840
If you're worried about Xiaoge.

311
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,840
Tell Fatty.

312
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
Fatty will go with you.

313
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,840
Pan Zi.

314
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
We'll wait for Xiaoge here.

315
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,840
Why don't you send a signal to Third Uncle?

316
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,840
Okay.

317
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
If Third Uncle can see.

318
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,840
He will definitely respond.

319
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
As long as Third Uncle can respond.

320
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,840
It will be easier.

321
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,840
Tianzhen.

322
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,840
There's no reaction at all.

323
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
Tianzhen.

324
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
Third Uncle won't abandon you, will he?

325
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,840
There's a response.

326
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
Great.

327
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,840
This smoke is red.

328
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
What do you mean?

329
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
Third Uncle and the others are in trouble.

330
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
We have to hurry.

331
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,840
Xiaoge will go there when she sees the smoke.

332
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
Look.

333
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
The signal smoke.

334
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
It must be Third Uncle.

335
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
They're in danger.

336
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
No.

337
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
Look there.

338
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,840
There's another one.

339
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,840
Can you tell which one is Third Uncle?

340
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
I can't tell.

341
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
But the red one must be in danger.

342
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,840
Red is closer to us.

343
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,840
Let's go and check.

344
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,840
Let's go.

345
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,840
Let's go.

346
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,840
This smoke won't last long.

347
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,840
It's raining heavily.

348
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
There's no signal smoke.

349
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,840
Can we find Third Uncle and the others?

350
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,840
Yes.

351
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,840
I have some reference points.

352
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
If we follow this path,

353
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,840
we can find Third Uncle and the others.

354
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,840
Then let's hurry.

355
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,840
If Third Uncle is in danger,

356
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,840
you two can still wait here.

357
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
Maybe now...

358
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,840
I...

359
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,840
I can't shut my mouth.

360
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,840
I can't.

361
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,840
The signal smoke.

362
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,840
But it's not from your camp.

363
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
It's from Wu Sanxing.

364
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,840
I have to go.

365
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
Wait.

366
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,840
We're still not sure who he is.

367
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,840
Where he is.

368
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,840
But he must be in the camp.

369
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,840
At least it's not Wu Xie.

370
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,840
What about the others?

371
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
You know that.

372
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,840
We can't risk our lives.

373
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,840
Then I can't let Wu Xie take the risk alone.

374
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,840
The snake attacked the person who set the fire.

375
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,840
I'll go and check.

376
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
You wait here.

377
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
Prepare the signal smoke.

378
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,840
Okay.

379
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,840
Go.

380
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,840
Third Uncle, the knife is ready.

381
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,840
If you don't come, the snake will be here.

382
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
Don't be angry.

383
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,840
I came earlier than I thought.

384
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,840
Save him first.

385
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
Come on.

386
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
Third Uncle.

387
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,840
Run.

388
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,840
What are you doing?

389
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,840
I'm hungry.

390
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,840
You can't be hungry.

391
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,840
Being hungry is the instinct of a saint.

392
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,840
I'm so hungry.

393
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840
I can only eat this.

394
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,840
I'm about to have a bird in my mouth.

395
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
Pan.

396
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,840
Let's fight for the bird.

397
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,840
Let's get married.

398
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,840
This is the old tradition of the wild chicken.

399
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
It's not a good thing.

400
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840
I'm not a good person.

401
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,840
I'm not a good person.

402
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
I'm not a good person.

403
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
I'm not a good person.

404
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,840
I'm not a good person.

405
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
The old tradition of the wild chicken.

406
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
It can still leave the bird...

407
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,840
I always feel something wrong.

408
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840
It's the wild chicken that disappeared.

409
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,840
Isn't it a good thing?

410
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,840
What?

411
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,840
Are you going to say hello to them?

412
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,840
Are you crazy?

413
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,840
I'm afraid there's something more fierce than the wild chicken.

414
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,840
The power of the wild chicken has been blown up.

415
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840
There's something more powerful than it.

416
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,840
No matter what, this is not a place to stay.

417
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,840
Let's go quickly.

418
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,840
Let's meet with Third Uncle.

419
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,840
Thank you for your fat stomach.

420
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,840
Eat more yasuo biscuits.

421
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,840
When we go back,

422
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,840
I'll treat you to hot pot, roast duck and roast lamb.

423
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Stop bragging.

424
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,840
I'll get two boxes of instant noodles and clean up.

425
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,840
Are you okay?

426
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,840
I'm fine.

427
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
I'm not waiting for you.

428
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,840
I told you to take care of your family.

429
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,840
Why did you follow me?

430
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,840
Third Uncle, I have a few things to ask you.

431
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
You young people

432
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,840
never care about your curiosity.

433
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,840
Before coming here, I said that the work was easy.

434
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
Everyone was injured on the way.

435
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,840
It's been a few days.

436
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,840
I haven't seen my brother yet.

437
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840
You're not even familiar with the forest.

438
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
What do you know about it?

439
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,840
You're a snake.

440
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,840
How can you do this?

441
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
What are you doing?

442
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,840
You're washing my place.

443
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,840
If you get the ground wet, I'll feed the snakes.

444
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,840
Boss, there's no water here.

445
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
Please touch it.

446
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,840
You think I'm stupid?

447
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,840
If I knew it was such a bad place

448
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,840
I wouldn't have come here for three times the money.

449
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,840
Drink some water.

450
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,840
The water is slippery.

451
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,840
It's slippery again.

452
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
It's slippery.

453
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,840
I'm tired.

454
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,840
My hand is shaking.

455
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,840
I think you're looking for trouble.

456
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,840
Calm down, young man.

457
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,840
You're out of town.

458
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,840
Why are you so angry?

459
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,840
Am I right?

460
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,840
Enough.

461
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,840
There's no water here.

462
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,840
Come and dig.

463
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,840
Dig.

464
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,840
Okay.

465
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,840
Let's go back.

466
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,840
Come on.

467
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,840
No.

468
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
It's too dangerous. Let's go.

469
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,840
Let's go down and have a look.

470
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
I'll do it.

471
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,840
Be careful when you go down.

472
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,840
Pull the rope if you're in danger.

473
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,840
Okay.

474
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,840
This statue wasn't going this way, right?

475
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,840
I told you that this statue is evil.

476
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,840
It was going that way.

477
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,840
Why did it turn around?

478
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,840
What a hell!

479
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,840
Run!

480
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,840
Oh no! We can't run anymore.

481
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,840
Whatever it is, we must fight it out.

482
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Get up.

483
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,840
When we came, we didn't take anything, right?

484
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,840
Fatty, it seems that we have to fight it out because of you.

485
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,840
This statue is poisonous. Run!

486
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,840
Run!

487
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,840
There's no way. This way.

488
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,840
Let's go.

489
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,840
Oh no!

490
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
Oh no!

491
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,840
I'm sorry.

492
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,840
It's not that I don't trust your friend.

493
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,840
I just have to be careful.

494
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,840
It seems that they have already left.

495
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,840
Let's go.

496
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Let's go.

497
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,840
Let's go.

498
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Let's go.

499
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
Let's go.

500
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,840
Let's go.

501
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,840
Let's go.

502
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,840
Let's go.

503
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,840
Let's go.

504
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
Let's go.

505
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,840
Let's go.

506
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,840
They have already left.

507
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,840
I remember when we were in the house,

508
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,840
we only had one can.

509
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,840
One was a rice cooker.

510
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,840
Wu Xin left this for me.

511
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,840
Brother, let's go find Third Uncle.

512
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,840
It's dangerous in the forest.

513
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Be careful.

514
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,840
They are not bad today.

515
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,840
But they are hiding in the forest.

516
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,840
We can't take the risk.

517
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
Follow them.

518
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,840
You mean to follow them secretly and protect them?

519
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,840
Yes.

520
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,840
Wait.

521
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
This way.

522
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,840
That way is the closest way.

523
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,840
But if we want to go there,

524
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,840
we have to go through the most dangerous area.

525
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,840
If we want to reach Wu Sanxing's camp,

526
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,840
we have to go through this area.

527
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,840
But they don't know?

528
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,840
They will be very close.

529
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,840
How far is it?

530
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,840
It's about an hour.

531
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Why didn't they follow us?

532
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
I don't think so.

533
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,840
I almost got a skewer.

534
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
I'm innocent.

535
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,840
What did you touch?

536
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,840
It looks like a gravity sensor.

537
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,840
When a fire object falls,

538
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,840
it touches the mechanism.

539
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,840
It's covered with a skewer.

540
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,840
Is this a magic tool?

541
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,840
Why is there such a dangerous mechanism?

542
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,840
It's blood.

543
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,840
Sanxing, it's blood on the ground.

544
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,840
This is not a underground palace.

545
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,840
It's a altar.

546
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
An altar?

547
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,840
Who is it?

548
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
Queen Mother Xi.

549
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,840
Look.

550
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,840
She drew it.

551
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,840
She left the living and the living.

552
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,840
She gave it to Queen Mother Xi.

553
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,840
She is very self-willed.

554
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,840
She wants to make a place for herself.

555
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,840
Men will remember themselves.

556
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
This must be the people of Queen Mother Xi.

557
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,840
They pray for the victory and see it for themselves.

558
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,840
Look.

559
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,840
They have planned our escape route.

560
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,840
The people of Queen Mother Xi are very righteous.

561
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,840
This is the exit.

562
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,840
It's so high.

563
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,840
It's hard for us to go up.

564
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,840
I don't think it's that easy.

565
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,840
Think about it.

566
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,840
If this is really a ritual place,

567
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,840
there should be a lot of bones left on the ground.

568
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,840
But now, there are only blood stains.

569
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,840
There are no bones left.

570
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,840
Clean it up.

571
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,840
Can it be that the people of Queen Mother Xi

572
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,840
have been carved to deceive us?

573
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,840
I just don't think it's right.

574
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,840
Watch out!

575
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,840
Come on.

576
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,840
Come on.

577
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,840
Master Hua!

578
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,840
Master Xiao Jiong!

579
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,840
Qi Yuchen!

580
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,840
What?

581
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,840
What happened?

582
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,840
Nothing.

583
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,840
Nothing? Why are you dragging the rope?

584
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,840
I slipped.

585
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,840
Master, you said that you would give me a magnet

586
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,840
so that I can move the earth.

587
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,840
Master, I also said that

588
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,840
you would give me a magnet

589
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,840
so that I can move the Queen Mother's

590
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,840
broken stage.

591
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,840
That's what Jin Mi De said.

592
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,840
Hit him!

593
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,840
That's the 20 times harder one.

594
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,840
It's too dangerous.

595
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,840
Master!

596
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,840
I forgot.

597
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,840
Sorry.

598
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,840
The night is passing by,

599
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,840
and the distance is getting closer.

600
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,840
Because of the strength of my friends by my side,

601
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,840
I am crossing the road of fall.

602
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:34,840
I have your heart in my heart.

603
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
Come on.

604
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,840
Come on.

605
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
What happened?

606
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,840
I told you to come back.

607
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,840
Come on.

608
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,840
Where are you?

609
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,840
I am at home.

610
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,840
That's good.

611
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,840
Come on.

612
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,840
I just found something.

613
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,840
It's in the grass.

614
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,840
What is it?

615
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,840
I don't want to be taken away by the snake.

616
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,840
Who knows where my body is taken?

617
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
Where are you going?

618
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,840
Anyway...

619
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,840
Okay.

620
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Just go to the starry sky

621
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,840
and eat more duck meat.

622
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,840
Come on.

623
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,840
Come on.

624
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,840
Okay.

625
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,840
Run!

626
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,840
Run!

627
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,840
Come on.

628
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,840
Why are you coming alone?

629
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,840
I heard it wrong.

630
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,840
I heard the director say stop.
