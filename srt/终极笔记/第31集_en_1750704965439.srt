1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah!

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The King of Blaze

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 05

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You're talking nonsense in the face of the world.

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The password you gave is wrong.

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes.

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It seems that my model is not strong enough.

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
No.

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Your model is better than the sky.

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Actually, I didn't see your design.

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But I made a small mistake.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So I found the truth by accident.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Didn't you press the wrong button?

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The buttons on the drawing are not the right ones, but the right ones.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This means that from my perspective,

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
it should be on the side of the pillar.

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But I forgot this.

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I pressed the right button.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You didn't find the right button.

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The channel opened automatically.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So I suspect that I didn't open the channels.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Someone was secretly controlling them.

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
To verify this...

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Hmm.

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I pressed the wrong button on purpose.

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let's go.

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
As expected, the channel is still open.

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What are you talking about?

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Peace and jade basket.

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What five-star gossip.

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What trick are you playing?

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Mrs. Ho.

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's just a trick.

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll rewrite it.

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You'll understand.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Hmm.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The root is the mountain.

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The Kun is the earth.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
In the peace and jade basket,

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
the first is Geng.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Behind is Kun and Khan.

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Kun and Khan mean the earth.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Khan and Khan mean water.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I guess it means

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
that the human face is the god of the earth.

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But he can't be separated from the water.

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The human face is an immortal.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
正卦代表着雷,可以召唤雷公电母。

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
前卦代表着天,说明着人面龟可以跟天神交流。

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
试试看。

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
试试看。

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
这样一写,胖子就明白了。

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
我想说的其实是,有监控。

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
霍家的人想套我手里的土。

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
表面上是乱话八卦,其实暗示摩斯密码。

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
在我老太婆眼皮子底下玩这套。

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
你们吴家人确实是多爱耍小聪明。

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
但是有时候,耍小聪明是有效的。

59
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
也是因为您的安排,让我知道央视雷的秘密。

60
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
就是张家古楼。

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
没错。

62
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
既然你有央视雷,你也查到了这么多东西。

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
你也想进张家古楼。

64
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
我们合作。

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
从星月饭店开始,您就没打算跟我合作。

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
这时候谈合作,怕是有点晚了吧。

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
你不答应,就别怪我不讲情意。

68
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
等一下。

69
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
您想要的是这张纸吗?

70
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
没错。

71
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
吴夕,你干嘛呢?

72
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
慢慢吃。

73
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
这张纸呢?

74
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
别动。

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
别动。

76
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
别动。

77
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
别动。

78
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
别动。

79
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
别动。

80
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
别动。

81
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
别动。

82
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
别动。

83
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
别动。

84
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
别动。

85
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
别动。

86
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
别动。

87
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
别动。

88
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
别动。

89
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
让我看看你的手。

90
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
让我看看你的手。

91
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
让我看看你的手。

92
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
让我看看你的手。

93
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
你怎么在这?

94
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
太太。

95
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I didn't know.

96
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Mrs. He, what happened?

97
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Do you still remember me?

98
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes, if you remember me, you won't come to the Huo family.

99
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
If you go, we will succeed.

100
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Come.

101
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This is your seat.

102
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Is this old lady old?

103
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm confused.

104
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Come.

105
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Come.

106
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't need to hide anything from you.

107
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Give it to me.

108
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
This is a drawing of Daoguang for 25 years.

109
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The designer is Lei Siqi.

110
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I have 7 of them.

111
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
These years, I have been building the model based on these 7 drawings.

112
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But I found that the drawings in my hand were missing one.

113
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That's why I can't solve the secrets of the hidden passage.

114
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Because this drawing is a secret,

115
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
the secret of the hidden passage.

116
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What's the use of this drawing?

117
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If the owner likes it, we have to help him find it.

118
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Everyone, they are using the code.

119
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The model in Wu Xie's hand is still not clear.

120
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's okay.

121
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He walked down step by step like this.

122
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's no different from handing it to me in person.

123
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I think I know everything you said.

124
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Do you know how I got these 7 models?

125
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I found them in Xiu Xiu's drawer.

126
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
As for the contents of the video tape,

127
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
you should know it by now.

128
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You don't have to look at me like that.

129
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Maybe everyone thinks that I am a old woman.

130
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I will be crazy if I see the contents of the tape.

131
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I will be crazy.

132
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Although I am old, I am not confused.

133
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Someone is threatening me with my daughter's life.

134
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
They forced me to enter Zhangjia Gu Lou.

135
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Since Zhangjia Gu Lou has what they want,

136
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I have to get it before they do.

137
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Then I can avoid all the people behind me.

138
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't know who they are.

139
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't know where they are.

140
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I only know that they are not good people.

141
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
One group of people caused my daughter to die.

142
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Another group of people played tricks on me.

143
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
For my daughter, the whole Huo family, the Jiu Men,

144
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I will not give up.

145
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So I have to enter Zhangjia Gu Lou.

146
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Because the Huo family has revenge.

147
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Grandma.

148
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I have shown you the seven copies of the tape.

149
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You know how I got the sample.

150
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The ghost blood that Xin Yue took from the hotel is still on you.

151
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's a return to the original owner.

152
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yang Shi Lin, ghost blood, seven years.

153
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Wu Xie, you were already in the office.

154
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Mrs. Huo, what do you mean?

155
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You have no choice. You can only cooperate with me.

156
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Since that's the case, I have one more thing to ask you.

157
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
There is a photo of the Huo family on the old iron shelf.

158
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
There is a person in the photo who looks exactly like me.

159
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
He appeared in the living room. What's the matter with the photo?

160
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
There are all the secret answers in Zhangjia Gu Lou.

161
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Why don't you go and see it yourself?

162
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You are only one step away from the truth.

163
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I don't trust you.

164
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Go.

165
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Take me home.

166
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Go.

167
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
No need to chase.

168
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Announce the result.

169
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Leave in three days.

170
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yes.

171
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But Zhang Qi Lin just refused.

172
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Don't worry.

173
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
They will come.

174
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
But you claim to want to cooperate with me.

175
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Actually, you want to help Wu Xie.

176
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Let me take him to the action.

177
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's not like I helped him.

178
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You just said it.

179
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Wu Xie was already in the office.

180
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,960
The

181
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
123456

182
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
216

183
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
How can there be zero and one?

184
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
All

185
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
How come this is a dream?

186
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What did you say?

187
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,900
bal Du Tuesday

188
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You lied to me last time.

189
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Let's settle this.

190
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I told you already.

191
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm pretending to be the head of the household.

192
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Just to share the information of their household.

193
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This is also helping you.

194
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Master Hua.

195
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Then you just be a good person.

196
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Send Buddha to the West.

197
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The account of the Xingyue Hotel.

198
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Just help us pay it back.

199
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Stop. I'm just giving you a guarantee.

200
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
This money.

201
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You have to pay it back yourself.

202
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Unless

203
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Wu Xie is willing to work with the Huo family.

204
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Then I can consider

205
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
helping you.

206
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Pay the bill?

207
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Help you to guarantee more days.

208
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Otherwise, even if the hotel

209
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
finds you again.

210
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I don't care.

211
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That's still nonsense.

212
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
This little brother doesn't trust

213
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Madam Huo.

214
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
His sense of inferiority is very accurate.

215
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Little brother said this person is not trustworthy.

216
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
We won't go.

217
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Not trustworthy.

218
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But I want to go.

219
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What?

220
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You two agreed this time?

221
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Where is the destination?

222
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I told everyone.

223
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
This time the action will be divided into two teams.

224
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
One is to Ba Nai.

225
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
The other is to Sichuan's

226
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Four Valley Bird Mountain.

227
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Four Valley Bird Mountain?

228
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Isn't Zhang's Valley in Ba Nai?

229
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
This time the action is not

230
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
separate.

231
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
There are connections on both sides.

232
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What kind of arrangement is waiting for Madam Huo to say?

233
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That's it.

234
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
By the way.

235
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The equipment and expenses of this action

236
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
and the relevant permits

237
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
are all managed by the Huo family and the Xie family.

238
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'll go prepare.

239
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
If you have anything, please contact me.

240
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
By the way.

241
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Since you've decided to go.

242
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Go.

243
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Look.

244
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The equipment you can find in the market is all here.

245
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
A serious Qing Long sword and a moon blade.

246
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I took it

247
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and passed the six generals.

248
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm loyal to you.

249
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You're not satisfied?

250
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Look at this.

251
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
This is the dagger that Jin Ke used to stab Qin.

252
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's a little small.

253
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
But don't look at it too short.

254
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's a knife.

255
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
This one.

256
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's still small.

257
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Look at mine.

258
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
How is it?

259
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's not as practical as mine.

260
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's not as practical as mine.

261
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You two are so hard to serve.

262
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You didn't like so many things.

263
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
No, I mean, Jin Ke.

264
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I've already drawn the knife for you.

265
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You have to find it according to the picture.

266
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You're talking about your picture.

267
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Have you ever seen it yourself?

268
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's not reasonable.

269
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Look at the position of the dagger.

270
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The hand is here and the dagger is on the blade.

271
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You haven't cut the finger and you've learned it.

272
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
This is useless.

273
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It doesn't matter if you can use it.

274
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Just find it.

275
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm looking for a knife.

276
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Knife?

277
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's not an old thing.

278
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's not a broken toy.

279
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Do you know?

280
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Control tools?

281
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I can't help you with this.

282
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm not doing anything illegal tonight.

283
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm telling you.

284
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Fatty.

285
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Do you remember what Xiao Hua said?

286
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The cost of this operation and equipment

287
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
are all under the charge of the Huo family and Xie family.

288
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That's right.

289
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Then you say this knife.

290
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's a device.

291
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

292
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
This is reliable.

293
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
This is a good knife.

294
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Such a good knife.

295
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'll give it to you.

296
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
What are you doing?

297
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
This is a mark.

298
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
When I first met Xiao Ge,

299
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
my uncle sent me a message.

300
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Said,

301
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Longji Bei, come quickly.

302
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Longji Bei?

303
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Said Xiao Ge?

304
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's a black gold ancient knife.

305
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
We call good things Longji Bei.

306
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
The knife is really good.

307
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The words are rough.

308
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Over comes a sharp knife.

309
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Wu Xie

310
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You and Xiao Xie all the way

311
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
This is to separate us three

312
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
We have to separate this time

313
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,720
I can't have a pair of you three

314
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,560
I have my own reason for arranging it like this

315
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,560
Two people need to act at the same time in the four girls mountain and the eight milk

316
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
specific action method

317
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,440
I'll tell you more about it when I get there

318
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,080
Between two people

319
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,080
Must be in harmony

320
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
No interruption

321
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,080
So ask the people on both sides

322
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,080
To have that kind of mutual distance

323
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,080
Also able to perfectly cooperate

324
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,080
It sounds like you're drinking medicine

325
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Want to live in Zhang's drum house

326
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,680
Must do this

327
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,680
it is good

328
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,960
Talk clearly

329
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,960
Your talent must have been resilient

330
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,280
Of course, just a little

331
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,280
Reliable

332
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:42,920
lets go

333
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:31,720
Me.

334
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:44,860
Have I?

335
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:52,140
No.

336
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,420
I'm good at writing.

337
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,220
But writing is not my strength.

338
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,860
Never mind.

339
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,500
Good name.

340
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,260
Little black gold.

341
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,580
Brother.

342
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,060
How is it?

343
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,620
Not bad.

344
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,100
This knife is perfect for him.

345
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,660
It's not worse than black gold.

346
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,700
Tianzhen.

347
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,340
You should think about it.

348
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,260
Think about what?

349
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,820
Think about what you can give me.

350
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,820
You two have been helping each other all day.

351
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,660
You're in danger.

352
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,860
Brother will save you.

353
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,100
If Brother loses his memory,

354
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,340
you can help him to find his memory.

355
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,860
Now you can give him a knife.

356
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,020
What about me?

357
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,420
I have to give him something.

358
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,140
What's wrong?

359
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,540
You don't want to give it to me?

360
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,460
Don't be so stingy.

361
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,180
No.

362
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,740
I remember what Pan Ma said.

363
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,940
You won't have a good result

364
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,100
if you're with him.

365
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,260
One day,

366
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,780
another will kill you.

367
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,980
He said one of us

368
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,740
will kill another.

369
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,140
Thank you, I won't fight again.

370
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,820
Don't worry.

371
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,180
We're leaving.

372
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:26,580
Starting off that last night, push your own decision

373
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:38,080
We will be one at every end different

374
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,900
to be regarded as being an outsider

375
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:45,720
Helen, now you, become more and more human

376
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,700
Let us live a normal life together,

377
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,820
never be happy we should be forever.

378
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,580
Let's open the door!!

379
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,420
Open the door!!!!

380
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,460
We're almost there.

381
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,080
Look!

382
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,740
This is the Zuoji.

383
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,040
This is Erji.

384
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,740
3J.

385
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,920
It seems to be a sharing gate.

386
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,040
The share gate is the highest and most beautiful one.

387
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,240
It's over 6,000 meters high.

388
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,260
No wonder it's called 4 Girls Mountain.

389
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,420
it's twice of East.

390
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,820
By the way, Amazing Wrap director

391
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,500
Please give us some dust steps.

392
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,000
Let's go.

393
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,300
You need to bright our screen.

394
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,420
You are a man of Sichuan, you really like your hometown.

395
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,420
Wu Xie, you are not here to travel.

396
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,420
Hurry up and rest.

397
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,420
We have to go to the village later.

398
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,420
We have to find the person that Boss Huo arranged.

399
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,420
Do you know who you are looking for?

400
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,420
I don't know.

401
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,420
Is anyone there?

402
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,420
Is anyone there?

403
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,420
Is anyone there?

404
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,420
No one?

405
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,420
Is it here?

406
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,420
Yes, it's here.

407
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,420
The fire has been burning.

408
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,420
They should be back soon.

409
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,420
Stay away from the fire.

410
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,420
You are too cautious.

411
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,420
The person that Boss Huo arranged,

412
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,420
is he still here to set up a trap and wait for us?

413
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,420
This is not an ordinary fire team.

414
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,420
The people here call him Ximi.

415
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,420
It is said that the fire god left it to them tens of thousands of years ago.

416
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,420
You have to stay away from him.

417
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,420
If you do something bad, it will be very miserable.

418
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,420
So evil.

419
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,420
Then this fire god is indeed quite sacred.

420
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,420
If someone accidentally touches it,

421
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,420
then they will be burned by the fire.

422
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,420
Burn it! Where do you want to go?

423
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,420
I don't want to run.

424
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,420
I don't want to run. Where do you want to go?

425
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,420
I just want to go to the toilet.

426
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,420
This way is not the way.

427
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,420
Go back.

428
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,420
I am such a kind person.

429
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,420
How can I run like this?

430
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,420
Go back.

431
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,420
Okay, come.

432
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,420
Come, sit.

433
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,420
I have to teach you a good lesson.

434
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,420
This is called the heavenly snow.

435
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,420
If you work like this,

436
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,420
your back will be hurt.

437
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,420
If you press it, it will be very painful.

438
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,420
Use more strength.

439
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,420
No.

440
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,420
You are too strong.

441
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,420
Change your clothes.

442
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,420
I will do it.

443
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,420
Come, sit.

444
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,420
This is called the heavenly snow.

445
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,420
I see that your back is very painful.

446
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,420
You need to be careful.

447
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,420
So I have to give you...

448
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,420
How is it? Does it hurt?

449
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,420
No.

450
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,420
Then how about this? Does it hurt?

451
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,420
It still hurts.

452
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,420
It's not painful.

453
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,420
I am sorry.

454
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,420
Boss, as you know,

455
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,420
a convoy on the way.

456
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,420
I think it must be Mrs. Huo.

457
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,420
They are coming.

458
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,420
Right on time.

459
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,420
Get my gift ready.

460
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,420
And deliver it to an old acquaintance.

461
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,420
To an old acquaintance.

462
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,420
You are going to the mountain?

463
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,420
Look at the rain.

464
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,420
It's easy to get mud.

465
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,420
You are not safe.

466
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,420
I don't have time to wait.

467
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,420
It's only half a month.

468
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,420
Wait until the rain is less.

469
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,420
Then you can go to the mountain.

470
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,420
You don't have to risk your life.

471
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,420
Besides,

472
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,420
Look at these.

473
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,420
They are all

474
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,420
so young.

475
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,420
Some accounts,

476
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,420
even if you risk your life,

477
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,420
you have to pay.

478
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,420
I am sorry.

479
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,420
You sold my information

480
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,420
and dare to come here?

481
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,420
I won't see you.

482
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,420
I will transfer you.

483
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,420
I know.

484
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,420
This is just a thousand taels of silver.

485
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,420
It's not a big deal.

486
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,420
Thank you.

487
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,420
Thank you for your care.

488
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,420
Thank you.

489
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,420
Then we will meet again.

490
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,420
The owner.

491
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,420
The person who asked for the card came again.

492
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,420
This time I sent something.

493
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,420
Use this to get the money.

494
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,420
I will pay you.

495
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,420
Thank you.

496
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,420
Thank you.

497
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,420
Thank you.

498
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,420
Thank you.

499
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,420
Thank you.

500
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,420
Use the post from Zhao Meng's mansion.

501
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,420
The ghost is thin.

502
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,420
He can find this.

503
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,420
He is so thoughtful.

504
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,420
He is so thoughtful.

505
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,420
He is so thoughtful.

506
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,420
He is so thoughtful.

507
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,420
The ghost is thin.

508
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,420
He has a good appetite.

509
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,420
The ghost has a good appetite.

510
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,420
He thinks he is a thousand years old.

511
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,420
But he is not long enough.

512
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,420
Grandma.

513
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,420
You have a relationship with Qiu Dakao?

514
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,420
When I was the third madam's wife.

515
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,420
I had some contacts with him.

516
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,420
I was still a child.

517
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,420
I have seen him.

518
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,420
Brother Wu Xie said

519
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,420
Qiu Dakao cooperated with him.

520
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,420
He stayed here to search for the mountain.

521
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,420
I didn't expect he would come to you so soon.

522
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,420
I didn't believe him.

523
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,420
I didn't believe him.

524
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,420
Send the things back.

525
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,420
Send the things back.

526
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,420
OK.

527
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,420
Boss.

528
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,420
She's rejected it and sent it back to us.

529
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,420
OK.

530
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,420
Send my second gift.

531
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,420
And don't worry about that.

532
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,420
She will take care of it.

533
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,420
But I don't understand.

534
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,420
Why would you do that?

535
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,420
I am telling you.

536
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:39,420
We've spent a lot of money and resources looking for what we want.

537
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,420
And lost a lot of men.

538
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:52,420
We were just about to reach the palace, but our name was killed by the Tiger Snake.

539
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,420
But until now, we still get nothing.

540
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:01,420
After our arriving in Banai, I sought to gain the cooperation with Wu Xie.

541
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:07,420
Little did I expect that he did not find the out of the violence location, but nearly died in the water.

542
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:11,420
So I know I can only work with Miss Huo.

543
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:17,420
So I passed all the information to Wu Xie and paid him to lure her here.

544
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,420
Then what we should do next?

545
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,420
Giving her the gift.

546
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,420
Okay.

547
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,420
Master Hua, you are really a righteous scholar.

548
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,420
You are always welcome to come to me.

549
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,420
I'll give you a discount.

550
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,420
No need.

551
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,420
A thousand taels of silver, remember to pay me back.

552
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,420
If I can afford it, I don't have to pay the debt.

553
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:50,420
Master Hei, what did you do to get a thousand taels of silver?

554
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,420
Don't mention it.

555
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,420
It's all because of the Tiger Snake.

556
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,420
I'm not a thief.

557
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,420
I'm a man of my word.

558
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,420
Don't mention it.

559
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,420
It's all because of that damn Tiger Snake.

560
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,420
I was thinking...

561
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,420
Forget it.

562
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,420
Don't mention it.

563
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,420
You are the one that Miss Huo asked us to find, right?

564
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,420
Yes.

565
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,420
But we made a lot of money.

566
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,420
You have to pay me back for this.

567
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,420
No, Master Hua.

568
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,420
You are so kind.

569
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,420
You can't be so heartless.

570
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,420
You should continue to pay the debt.

571
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,420
Let's go.

572
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,420
Let me.

573
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,420
If I were your driver,

574
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,420
would I be able to pay the debt?

575
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,420
Half of it.

576
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,420
CCTV.

577
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,420
7AU.

578
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,420
T.U.

579
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,420
I'll go with you.

580
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,420
Okay.

581
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,420
Give me the phone.

582
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,420
Let's drink.

583
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,420
Okay.

584
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,420
I'll call you later.

585
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,420
I'll call you later.

586
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,420
Wait.

587
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,420
Okay.

588
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,420
I'll call you later.

589
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,420
Miss Huo, what are you doing?

590
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,420
Get up.

591
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,420
Miss Huo.

592
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,420
What's going on?

593
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,420
I'm sorry.

594
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,420
It's not right.

595
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,420
I think we should get up.

596
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,420
Okay.

597
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,420
The other side is okay.

598
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,420
Okay.

599
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,420
I'll call you later.

600
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,420
I'll call you later.

601
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,420
I'll call you later.

602
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,420
Okay.

603
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,420
The other side is okay.

604
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,420
Since their stuff is in Zhang's house,

605
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,420
I have to feel that they got it before they got it.

606
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,420
I'm sorry.

607
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,420
I'll go to sleep.

608
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,420
Get up.

609
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,420
Get up.

610
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,420
Here.

611
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,420
Stop.

612
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,420
Stop.

613
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,420
Don't disturb her.

614
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,420
Give her five days.

615
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,420
Okay.

616
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,420
No.

617
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,420
Go.

618
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,420
Go.

619
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,420
One, two, three.

620
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,420
Go.

621
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,420
Okay.

622
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,420
Tianzhen,

623
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,420
you should think about it.

624
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,420
Don't feel wronged.

625
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,420
I thought you were going to leave.

626
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,420
You're in danger.

627
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,420
I'll save you.

628
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,420
If I lose my memory,

629
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,420
you'll help me find my memory.

630
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,420
Here.

631
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,420
I'll go to sleep.

632
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,420
Am I blocking the way?

633
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,420
Okay.

634
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,420
What's going on?

635
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,420
We just passed the bridge.

636
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,420
No.

637
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,420
I didn't want to run away from the police station.

638
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,420
I'm a kind person.

639
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,420
How could I say I'll go?

640
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,420
I mean, I'll run away.

641
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,420
Tianzhen.

642
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,420
Tianzhen.

643
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,420
Tianzhen.

644
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,420
I'll go to sleep.

645
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,420
One more time.

646
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,420
Thank you for your care.

647
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,420
Thank you.

648
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,420
Then we'll meet again.

649
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,420
Bye.
