00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The King Of Blaze

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Fatty, is his mom and dad still not back?

4
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No, let's go and have a look.

5
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Not yet. I just went to the Panma House to pass by.

6
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No, I specifically asked the two bosses about it.

7
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Fine, I'll tell you.

8
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If we want to find someone, there's no time to be successful.

9
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Boss Fatty, this is not a failure.

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You are the city people, you probably don't know.

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Our hunters, as soon as they enter the mountain,

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
it's normal to wait for three or two days.

13
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You guys just wait patiently for two days.

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Take a rest.

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Boss Fatty, you also take care of your injuries.

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll give you some wild flavor to make up for it.

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay.

18
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Uncle A Gui, then you people in the mountains don't know.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
People who are crazy about horses don't need to make up for their body.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You have to make up for your brain.

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Tianzhen, you've learned badly.

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You've learned to squeeze me.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, okay.

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Two bosses, I've also told the Panma son.

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
As soon as dad comes back, he'll come to you.

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay.

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'll go to work first.

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay, keep waiting.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's just right that Liu San came back.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's let Xiao Ge try it.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This is my good brother, Ma Bu.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Sit down.

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let me introduce.

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
These two are the famous Mr. Hua and Miss Huo.

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I called you here today to ask

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
how you usually contact Mr. San.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
How can I contact Mr. San?

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Usually, people contact me.

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I have something to do today, so I'll go first.

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Wait a minute, I haven't finished yet.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's talk another day.

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Tianzhen, you should do it.

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm really not sure about this poisonous earlobe.

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If it comes out, it's all gone.

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Really?

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Of course.

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Here.

48
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's gone.

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The earlobe is melted.

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Why hasn't the iron block changed at all?

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This iron block is really unusual.

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Brother Fatty, it's time to change the medicine.

53
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Does it hurt?

54
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No.

55
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You hit me.

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I also went through a lot of difficulties.

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I've been through a lot of things on my way.

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This little injury,

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm really sorry.

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This little injury,

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
what does it count?

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's like a cat and a dog.

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I was also covered by bees when I was a kid.

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It hurts so much when I was on the medicine.

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Brother Fatty,

67
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
you're really brave.

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It hurts to look at it.

69
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yun Cai, don't blame Fatty.

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We're here.

71
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You go ahead with your work.

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Thank you, Sister Yun Cai.

73
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Thank you.

74
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
They shouted out loud.

75
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's so hot.

76
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Brother, I'm sorry.

77
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
These two are my saviors.

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They are good people.

79
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
They won't hurt you.

80
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What were you feeling guilty about just now?

81
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Who's guilty?

82
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
If you're not guilty, why are you running so fast?

83
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You didn't love me. How can I not run?

84
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're talking nonsense.

85
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Why are you tying me up?

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't worry.

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'll ask you a few questions.

88
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll let you go after I finish asking.

89
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I won't make things difficult for you.

90
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
How did you contact Third Master before?

91
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I contacted him alone.

92
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
If Third Master wants to kill me,

93
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
he'll ask me to go to the Chuyun Tea House

94
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
to meet him in the Spring Pond.

95
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Xiu Xiu,

96
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
look at him first.

97
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll go and take a look.

98
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Hua Yan,

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I know the Chuyun Tea House.

100
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'll lead the way for you.

101
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Let's go.

102
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Please.

103
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Brother Fatty.

104
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You're the boss.

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
How can you let the boss cook?

106
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll do it.

107
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What boss?

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Didn't I tell you?

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm your Fatty.

110
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Shouldn't I cook for my sister?

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Besides,

112
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
my cooking skills are very good.

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to grow up.

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Let me help you.

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay.

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Go and get the chicken for me.

117
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Brother Fatty,

118
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
you recovered so fast.

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's all thanks to you taking care of me.

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You even changed my medicine every day.

121
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
By the way,

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
that old man still hasn't come back.

123
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It takes so long for people in your village to enter the mountain.

124
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Normally, people enter the mountain

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
in about two or three days.

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
There are also people who enter the mountain in a long time,

127
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
even in a week or two.

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It takes so long.

129
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
They have to find prey first.

130
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Then, sometimes they have to set traps.

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It doesn't take that long.

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Smell it.

133
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It smells good.

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Brother Fatty's cooking skills are absolutely great.

135
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Chief Fatty,

136
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
something happened.

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Something happened to Fatty's family.

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The documents.

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What are you doing?

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm going to the mountain to find my father.

141
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Don't worry.

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I've asked the villagers to split up and find him.

143
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Besides,

144
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
if your father comes back,

145
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
someone has to take care of him.

146
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You two,

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
hurry up and help him up.

148
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Hurry up.

149
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Go.

150
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Uncle Erguan,

151
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
why didn't you let him go find him?

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You don't know.

153
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The blood he took just now

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
was found by the villagers by the water cow's ditch.

155
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's dangerous.

156
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You say,

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
with his current emotions,

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
how can I let him go?

159
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Brother Fatty.

160
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Brother Fatty.

161
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Brother Fatty.

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Brother Fatty.

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Brother Fatty.

164
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Brother Fatty.

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Brother Fatty.

166
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Father.

167
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Father.

168
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Brother,

169
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
what's wrong?

170
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Blood.

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
There's blood.

172
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
There's blood here.

173
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
There's blood here.

174
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
If we go any further,

175
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
it should be the water cow ditch.

176
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes.

177
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Let's go.

178
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Go.

179
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No.

180
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Boss.

181
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You're not allowed to go in.

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You must listen to me.

183
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You really can't go in.

184
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Panma's father is likely to be in front.

185
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Aren't you going to save him?

186
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If he's really in there,

187
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
he's already dead.

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The water cow ditch

189
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
is the entrance to our village.

190
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
There's a monster in the village.

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
If we go in,

192
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
we can't get out.

193
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Uncle Gui.

194
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You may not know us well.

195
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We've been to

196
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
many places that are interesting.

197
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Boss.

198
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You can't make this joke.

199
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Uncle Gui.

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Don't worry.

201
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We'll find Panma.

202
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Bosses.

203
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Be careful.

204
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Is Chun Teng Pavilion empty?

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You want to have tea in Chun Teng Pavilion?

206
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes.

207
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
This way, please.

208
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Master Hua.

209
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Please.

210
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Boss.

211
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Someone wants to use Chun Teng Pavilion.

212
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Get rid of him.

213
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Sirs.

214
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
This is the tea list.

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Please have a look.

216
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'll get some snacks.

217
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'll be right back.

218
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Okay. Go.

219
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Master Hua.

220
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Tea list.

221
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Tea list.

222
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Ziwei Pavilion.

223
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Shouldn't it be Chun Teng Pavilion?

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Master Hua.

225
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What's wrong?

226
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Come here.

227
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Hurry.

228
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
No.

229
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Miss Hua.

230
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
My blood sugar has gone up.

231
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I have some grape candy in my pocket.

232
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Can you get it for me?

233
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'll go get it.

234
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Okay.

235
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'll go get it.

236
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Okay.

237
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'll go get it.

238
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Okay.

239
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'll go get it.

240
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Okay.

241
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Thank you.

242
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Thank you.

243
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm so sorry.

244
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I made you do this.

245
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Which pocket?

246
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The one on the left.

247
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Let's go.

248
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Okay.

249
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Master Hua, you go first.

250
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'll go get the tea.

251
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
They left first.

252
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Brother Anbao.

253
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Brother Anbao.

254
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So much blood.

255
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
That's too much.

256
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's probably painted on it.

257
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It should be specially hung here.

258
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
This should be what Panma left for us.

259
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Hope it's out.

260
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's clothes and blood.

261
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm afraid we can't find it.

262
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
He left us a road sign.

263
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It seems that A'gui is right.

264
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
This Panma really has two brushes.

265
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Let's go.

266
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Let's see what trap this hunter has set for us.

267
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Master Hua.

268
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
We almost got killed by a kid.

269
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
With his little trick,

270
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
you want to cause me and my brother Hua to die?

271
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You're not that far away.

272
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's still the same.

273
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You answer my question.

274
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I won't make it hard for you.

275
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Master Nine.

276
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You guys.

277
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'll say anything.

278
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Why us?

279
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I don't know.

280
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Master Nine.

281
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I really don't know.

282
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't know.

283
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I don't know.

284
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I don't know.

285
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Master Nine.

286
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I really don't dare to lie to you.

287
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I really don't know.

288
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Our boss ordered us

289
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
to tell someone to ask about Master Three.

290
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Then they'll go to Chu Yun and set up Chun Teng Pavilion.

291
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
If people there hear the word Chun Teng Pavilion,

292
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
they will...

293
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
They will kill them.

294
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Who is your boss?

295
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Who is he?

296
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Our boss is Ding Ling's famous

297
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Liuli Sun.

298
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Liuli Sun?

299
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I remember.

300
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Cousin.

301
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Is the direction we're going right?

302
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
This is a spider web.

303
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
This plate is going to lead us to the cave.

304
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Then we're in luck.

305
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
There are seven

306
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
beautiful spider webs in the cave.

307
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The spider webs are seduced by Tang Monk.

308
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Let's look in the mirror.

309
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You don't have a shadow of Tang Monk.

310
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Who wants to be Tang Monk?

311
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
If you want to be, be a pig.

312
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
This...

313
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
This is not right.

314
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
This spider web

315
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
is seduced by Wu Ling'er.

316
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's so sticky.

317
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Brother, can you see anything?

318
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I can't see anything.

319
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I can't see anything.

320
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I can't see anything.

321
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I can't see anything.

322
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I can't see anything.

323
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I can't see anything.

324
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I can't see anything.

325
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
The spider here has a problem.

326
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's so sticky.

327
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Let alone catching bugs.

328
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's sticky even if it's stuck.

329
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I also think

330
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
it's at least

331
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
a spider web

332
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
like a spider web.

333
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
There are people.

334
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Don't forget.

335
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Uncle Gui said

336
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
the place where the water bulls are in,

337
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
there's no going back.

338
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
We have to be careful.

339
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
After we came in,

340
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
they must be hiding in the dark.

341
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
When we're stuck,

342
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
we can't move,

343
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
we'll come to eat.

344
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Okay.

345
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The corpse, the snake, the goose.

346
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Now, it's a spider again.

347
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Where are we going?

348
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
We've come across these evil things.

349
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Who told us to not go the usual way?

350
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Let's go.

351
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Be careful.

352
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Curry tofu soup.

353
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's hot and hot.

354
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Master Hua,

355
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm so sorry about this.

356
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I didn't help you.

357
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You're still so angry.

358
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's okay.

359
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
We'll just

360
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
practice our skills.

361
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Master Hua,

362
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
say it.

363
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Don't be so hasty.

364
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Is Master San really...

365
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
He won't.

366
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I also think he won't.

367
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Master San is so powerful.

368
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's impossible.

369
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm waiting for him

370
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
to come back and help me.

371
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Help you?

372
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yes.

373
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Master San said that

374
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
if Tan Butuo doesn't get anything,

375
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
he'll take me to...

376
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
He'll take me to

377
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
the incense, the drums, the water.

378
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
He said that place must have something.

379
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
The waterway in the west of the incense valley.

380
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yes.

381
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's this place.

382
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Can we still go through this?

383
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
We can't go any further.

384
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
If we go any further,

385
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
we'll really end up in the martial arts world.

386
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
How did Pan Man's father get through this?

387
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Be careful.

388
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This is a good fire.

389
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The fire is very strong.

390
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It seems that this is

391
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
the trap that Pan Man's father

392
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
left for us.

393
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I told you that the old man

394
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
is not a good thing.

395
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
There must be a secret in him.

396
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Do you think that

397
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
he also lost

398
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
a little bit of the building?

399
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That's possible.

400
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I think so.

401
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
He must have

402
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
a secret.

403
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
He must have a secret.

404
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
He must have a secret.

405
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
He must have a secret.

406
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He must have a secret.

407
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
He must have a secret.

408
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
He must have a secret.

409
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
He must have a secret.

410
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
What's the noise?

411
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You're so careless.

412
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
There are so many.

413
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,240
Take the

414
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:35,380
chance to distress by

415
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:39,320
Sichuan,

416
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,400
go toإ잖아요

417
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,160
and

418
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,760
Fatty, are you okay?

419
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,360
I'm fine. Let's go.

420
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,760
Let's go.

421
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,360
No!

422
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,560
We just came here.

423
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,760
Fatty, is this the net you're holding?

424
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,960
Yes, that's right.

425
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,160
Why did you come back?

426
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,360
I'm out of energy.

427
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,560
This way.

428
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,160
It seems that Ah Gui is right.

429
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,360
We can't get out of this place.

430
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,160
Come on, fight them!

431
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,560
Don't run.

432
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,360
No matter how much you use, you can't withstand this much.

433
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,760
With this little piece of crap, we'll be fine.

434
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,360
Come on, baby!

435
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,760
Are you okay?

436
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,360
I'm fine.

437
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,960
Naive.

438
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,760
I'm fine.

439
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,960
Fatty, are you okay?

440
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,560
I'm fine.

441
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,760
You're not dead?

442
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,360
How is the poison?

443
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,360
It's not that bad.

444
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,760
If you get bitten by a spider like this, you'll die.

445
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,760
I'm fine.

446
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,560
I'm fine.

447
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
I'm fine.

448
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,560
That female creature is singing again.

449
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,760
You Great Superger,

450
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,760
you aren't strong.

451
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,660
I can't do it.

452
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,660
Any animal can't escape once it touches it.

453
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,060
What if it doesn't touch the pig's hair?

454
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,260
It can't escape either.

455
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,460
This pig's hair will release a kind of poison.

456
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,260
It's colorless and tasteless.

457
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,260
It will make people unable to distinguish the direction.

458
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,060
If you walk around,

459
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,060
if you get bitten by it,

460
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,260
it will be even more deadly.

461
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,660
I've heard that people with special blood

462
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,660
got bitten by it, but I've never seen it.

463
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,460
No wonder we're in a mess.

464
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,060
This kind of poison is also good.

465
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:02,260
The pig's hair is burnt into ashes and broad bean roots.

466
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,060
Mix the gold powder with the cinnamon powder.

467
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,260
Just take it.

468
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,060
You're the head of the investigation team.

469
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,660
Pan Ma.

470
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,660
You brought us here

471
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,460
to let us die, right?

472
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,660
I was just trying to scare you guys.

473
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,060
I wanted you to leave.

474
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:36,860
Who knew you guys would come after us?

475
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,660
I know what you want to ask.

476
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,260
But are you sure

477
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,060
that you really want to know?

478
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,060
Even if this thing

479
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,060
drags us into hell.

480
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,860
Yes.

481
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,060
Yes.

482
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,860
He'll be fine after a nap.

483
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,660
You can tell us now

484
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,060
what happened back then.

485
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,660
Come with me.

486
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,460
I can tell you about what happened back then.

487
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,460
I can also tell him.

488
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,460
But he can't.

489
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,460
Why can't you tell him?

490
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,660
For your own good.

491
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,860
If you two are together,

492
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:51,660
one of you will be killed by another one sooner or later.

493
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,460
Old man Pan Ma.

494
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,860
You're the one who wants to kill us, right?

495
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,860
You know me.

496
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,460
If you want to know, then come with me.

497
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,460
If you don't want to know, then forget it.

498
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,660
Dad, are you okay?

499
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,660
Are you okay?

500
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,860
Go out for a while.

501
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,660
I have a guest coming to see me.

502
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,260
My God.

503
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,660
What do you mean by that sentence?

504
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,660
You know him?

505
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,820
I don't know his face,

506
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,180
but I know the smell of his body.

507
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,140
What smell?

508
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,780
The smell of a dead man.

509
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,580
You mean

510
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,940
my friend killed someone?

511
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,900
It's the smell of a dead man

512
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,740
on his body.

513
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,700
You said my friend was a dead man?

514
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,020
I've been through a lot of things

515
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,020
with my friend.

516
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,220
I've been to many places.

517
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,700
I know

518
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,100
what kind of person he is.

519
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,700
I've said everything I can.

520
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,780
It's up to you whether you believe it or not.

521
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,860
Okay.

522
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,940
I won't force you then.

523
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,100
Thank you for your advice.

524
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,620
Can you tell me

525
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,660
what happened back then?

526
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,340
You're asking about the inspection team, right?

527
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,660
I knew

528
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,100
someone would come to me

529
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,500
and ask me about it sooner or later.

530
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,020
I can't remember

531
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,740
how many years ago it was.

532
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,780
I was still young back then.

533
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,460
There was an inspection team in the village

534
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,380
looking for a fox in the Yangjiao Mountains.

535
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,060
I know the situation in the mountains.

536
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,180
The village sent me to be their guide.

537
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,300
Pe Robert,

538
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,060
Pe Robert,

539
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,420
this is peer- regardless.

540
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,340
Pe Rotation Man.

541
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,060
Wel...

542
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,780
Go to Find Checkpoint No.7,

543
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,300
you'll find Pe Rotation Man.

544
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,980
Ball Supervisor.

545
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,980
Captain

546
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,780
What's wrong with the inspection team?

547
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,980
It's okay

548
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,780
Comrade Panma

549
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,580
We are going to Yangjiashan

550
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,380
A color lake in the northwest of the northern part

551
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,380
Do an inspection

552
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,980
But the village head said

553
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,580
That direction is too dangerous

554
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,580
Except you

555
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,980
No one dares to go there

556
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,780
So we want to invite you to be a guide

557
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,380
Take us to find that lake

558
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,780
I will be there

559
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,780
I will be there

560
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,780
Don't worry

561
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,380
We will pay you back

562
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,580
In addition

563
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,780
We will also give you

564
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,380
Five jin of rice as compensation

565
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,980
Five jin rice Panma

566
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,580
Hurry up and thank Comrade Chen

567
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,980
We walked in the mountains for two days

568
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,980
I just found the lake they said

569
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,980
Here

570
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,780
That is a dead lake

571
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,780
It seems to be ahead

572
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,780
Yes, it's over there

573
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,780
Let's go

574
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,780
Here

575
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,780
That is a dead lake

576
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,580
It seems to be ahead

577
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,580
Yes, it's over there

578
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,580
Let's go

579
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,580
It's here

580
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,580
There is no river around

581
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,980
I don't know how I got a lake

582
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,180
It's here

583
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,380
Look

584
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,580
Later found

585
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,180
They are at the lake

586
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,380
Stuck down

587
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,780
What are they doing by the lake

588
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,980
I only take the road

589
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,180
Don't know anything else

590
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,780
Panma dad

591
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,980
Since you said

592
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,180
Don't say half

593
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,180
We can find you

594
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,980
It's not that I don't understand the situation

595
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,180
For example, things brought out of the mountains

596
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,180
I also have something to ask

597
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,580
Since you all know

598
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,180
There is nothing to hide

599
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,780
They stayed by the lake for more than two months

600
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,780
I don't know what they are doing

601
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,580
Dare not ask

602
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,380
At that time

603
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,180
What others don't tell you

604
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,980
Can't ask around

605
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,780
What are you looking at

606
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,980
Nothing

607
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,380
There is nothing to see here

608
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,580
Come and give me the stuff

609
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,580
You go back

610
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,580
Then one day I went to deliver food

611
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,580
See them there

612
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,780
A lot of boxes

613
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,780
I think

614
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,580
Should be finding someone

615
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,780
Just curious

616
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,580
Want to find a chance

617
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,580
It's good to see

618
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,180
The things here are very dangerous

619
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,380
You'd better not touch it

620
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,580
You said

621
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,380
There is a strange smell in the box

622
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,180
Very strong

623
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,380
And very hard to smell

624
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,580
Hard to smell

625
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,580
Is it stinky

626
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:26,980
Not

627
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,180
Is it stinky

628
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,580
Not

629
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,180
Is a kind of

630
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,380
What is a kind of you haven't finished

631
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,180
I'm done

632
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:43,580
You

633
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,780
I know these

634
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,580
You are not finished

635
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,580
Finished

636
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,180
You are not finished

637
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:47,980
I know so much

638
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,580
Tang Miao

639
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,380
You should go

640
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,780
I'm going to rest

641
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,140
In the beginning

642
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,140
I can possibly

643
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,380
There are so many things

644
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,580
That I don't need to see

645
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,080
III

646
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,380
I don't need to see

647
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,980
You give me the first page

648
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,540
before

649
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,980
you may know

650
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:10,580
Then

651
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,380
I just don't know

652
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,540
I will be transparent

653
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,780
obviously

654
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,780
Which i know

655
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,500
whether

656
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,680
This smells of

657
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,780
Then immediately

658
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,380
Follow me

659
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,860
I was so nervous that I left

660
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,180
No wonder Pan Ma

661
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,220
suddenly drove me away

662
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,740
In this case

663
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,580
the one who asked Pan Ma to take us to Shui Niuniu to steal the hook

664
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,980
should be her

665
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:39,860
It's her

666
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,420
What?

667
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:48,940
When did you wake up?

668
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,140
I woke up on the way back

669
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,060
You two are comfortable with me

670
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,380
Do you know how heavy you are?

671
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,820
You broke my back, do you know?

672
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,540
The time next door to her is much longer than yours

673
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,740
She didn't say anything

674
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,020
You just lack exercise

675
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,700
Brother

676
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,900
Did you hear what Pan Ma said?

677
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,220
In this way

678
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,340
what Chen Wenjin brought down from the mountain

679
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,780
should be the iron block

680
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,940
that he found from your house

681
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,380
And Pan Ma said

682
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,180
that you smell like a dead person

683
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,380
In this way

684
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,740
it's probably the smell of the iron block

685
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,100
What?

686
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,900
The iron block doesn't smell like a dead person

687
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,860
Brother doesn't smell like a dead person either

688
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,660
The iron block has been put down for so many years

689
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,860
If it were, it would have been scattered long ago

690
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,820
Enough

691
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,820
You

692
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,380
This plate

693
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,860
can put the iron block

694
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,420
the smell of a dead person

695
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,500
in danger

696
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,460
These messages are connected

697
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,780
It means that she must have experienced something else

698
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,540
But this iron block suddenly appeared

699
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,780
She didn't say anything

700
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,980
Good boy

701
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,700
You have a strong logical thinking ability

702
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:36,820
P

703
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,140
I told you to kill her

704
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,620
You failed

705
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,420
I didn't expect you would protect them

706
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,660
from the bad Specialty

707
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,620
I

708
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,620
I had a nightmare for over 30 years.

709
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,620
I don't want to continue.

710
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,620
A nightmare?

711
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:06,620
Didn't you do all those nightmares yourself?

712
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,620
If I hadn't interrupted you at that time,

713
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:18,620
I'm afraid you would have told them everything about that year.

714
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,620
Yes.

715
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:27,620
I really want to talk to someone.

716
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,620
For so many years,

717
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,620
I really don't want to be forced like this anymore.

718
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:39,620
Since you don't want to live anymore, then don't live anymore!

719
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,620
You brought them here too?

720
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,620
Sun Wei, let's see where you run this time!

721
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,620
This one again?

722
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,620
Come here!

723
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,620
I've sprayed the medicine here. The spider won't come over!

724
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,620
Hurry!

725
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,620
Let's go!

726
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:25,620
I'm afraid I'm not afraid of the holy beads like you.

727
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,620
You brought us here this time

728
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,620
to help you get rid of them?

729
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:35,620
It's a pity that you can't get rid of them.

730
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,620
You can't stay here forever.

731
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,620
You can't leave this place forever.

732
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,620
I'm afraid you can't.

733
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,620
I'm afraid you can't.

734
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,620
I'm afraid you can't.

735
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,620
You can't stay here forever.

736
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,620
I'm old.

737
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,620
I can die.

738
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,620
But can you promise my son and grandson

739
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,620
that you won't be involved in this?

740
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,620
Then can you tell us about that year

741
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,620
and turn yourself in?

742
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,620
No problem.

743
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,620
I promise you.

744
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,620
I knew it. Who are we going to find?

745
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,620
Qi Xiaoci.

746
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,620
Let's wait here.

747
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,620
Come on. We're here.

748
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,620
I'll protect you. I'll go with you.

749
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,620
It hurts!

750
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,620
I'm sorry. I can't open it.

751
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,620
It doesn't hurt.

752
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,620
One more time. I'm sorry.

753
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,620
What's the word?

754
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,620
OK.

755
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,620
They're good people.

756
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,620
They're my saviors.

757
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,620
What did you say just now?

758
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,620
Help me.

759
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,620
Give me the machine.

760
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,620
OK.

761
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,620
Why don't you let me find it?

762
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,620
Stop.

763
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,620
Open it.

764
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,620
Open it.

765
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,620
Open it.

766
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,620
One, two, three.

767
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,620
Open it.

768
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,620
OK.

769
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,620
I'm sorry. I'll hug you.

770
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,620
I'm sorry.

771
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,620
I'm sorry.

772
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,620
Open it.

773
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,620
OK.

774
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,620
OK. I'll be back.

775
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,620
He said he forgot the words.

776
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,620
Yes.

777
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,620
It seems that here

778
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,620
is a good place.

779
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,620
I knew it.

780
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,620
This old man is not a thing.

781
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,620
I'll help you.

782
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,620
Cut.

783
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,620
One more.

784
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,620
I'm sorry.

785
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,620
I'll help you.

786
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,620
Cut.

787
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,620
I'm sorry.

788
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,620
Open it.

789
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,620
Cut.

790
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,620
Don't scratch it.

791
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,620
It's a broken spider.

792
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,620
Open it.

793
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,620
Open it.

794
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,620
One, two, three.

795
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,620
Open it.

796
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,620
Cut.

797
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,620
One more.

798
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,620
OK.

799
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,620
He won.

800
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,620
This kind of...

801
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,620
No one is better than him.

802
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,620
I'm sorry.

803
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,620
I'll help you.

804
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,620
Cut.

805
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,620
You're so weak.

806
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,620
The smell of the dead.

807
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,620
There's someone else. I'm sorry.
