1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this, but I'm going to try.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

7
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,440
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

8
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,440
I'm going to try to get the best out of this.

9
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,960
Tuna.

10
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,520
Eat some of this.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Snake! Snake! Snake!

12
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This wild boar's neck is imitating people's voices.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We were fooled by it before.

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This... this is...

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Isn't that a trap?

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What trap?

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
A parrot can learn to speak.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This wild boar's neck is imitating people's voices using the snake's vibration.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This is a trick to lure the prey.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This place is indeed not safe.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Everyone, bring your equipment and set out immediately!

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What should we do?

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Little... Little Third Master.

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Little... Little Third Master.

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Why didn't you tell us to do it instead of the others?

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Did we get fooled by the snake?

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You're overthinking.

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Little Third Master! Little Third Master!

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Can you do it? Can you?

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The ground and the bridge are all in a state of apathy.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I will definitely cover it with my eyes.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is a little slippery.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You should be careful when you walk with the fat man.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, Little Third Master.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Be careful at the back.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Let's go.

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Let's go.

38
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The light.

39
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We're now at the ground.

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We should be able to get out of the well soon.

41
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
No wonder it's soft. What is this? A big, soft bed?

42
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This is a snake retreat.

43
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Snake retreat? How could there be such a big snake?

44
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Anything is possible here.

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This thing should be the snake I guessed before.

46
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So this snake really exists.

47
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I saw a snake's talisman in the temple before.

48
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I originally thought it was just a legendary snake.

49
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Now I think it should be this one.

50
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Today, I...

51
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
will open my eyes.

52
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Such a big snake should be a monster.

53
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I wonder if it's still in the well.

54
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Then if we are targeted by it,

55
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
will we die?

56
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's not sure if we will die.

57
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But you and Little Third Master,

58
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
after you go,

59
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
because after all, you two are both targeted by snakes.

60
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't be so nervous.

61
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This snake retreat is not so fresh.

62
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It looks old.

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's quite clean here.

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It should be that other snakes are afraid and dare not come close.

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yes, this is good for us.

66
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Today, we have been waiting for a day.

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let's rest here.

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What? Here? In the snake retreat?

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yes, it's the safest here.

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Third Master, I still want to go to the cave before to rest.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm scared.

72
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Everyone, be alert.

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay.

74
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I will tell Black Eye to take you to the cave.

75
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You go with him.

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I will go with you.

77
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Go to the temple and find Little Third Master.

78
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Leave here.

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Be more natural when you leave.

80
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Don't let them suspect you.

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm not leaving.

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You must leave.

83
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This has nothing to do with you.

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This has nothing to do with me.

85
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I have a video tape that shows everyone coming here.

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm still in Ani's video tape.

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I saw someone who looks exactly like me.

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
In the Hermes nursing home,

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
there is a diary of Aunt Wen Jin.

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I have been to all the places in the diary.

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Do you think this has nothing to do with me?

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Where is Wen Jin's diary?

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Give it to me.

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Answer my question first.

95
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Okay, you ask.

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
In the diary, you mentioned three tapes.

97
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
One for me, one for Ani.

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And the other one is in your hands.

99
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yes.

100
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Then I will give you the code.

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes.

102
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's the one you and Ani

103
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
set up outside the Demon's Castle.

104
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay.

105
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
19 years ago,

106
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Wen Jin handed the three tapes to your grandmother?

107
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes.

108
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Then in these 10 years,

109
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
has your grandmother seen her?

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I don't know.

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I don't know.

112
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
No.

113
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Then when did you start to send out the video tapes?

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's like this.

115
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Three months ago,

116
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Wen Jin contacted my grandmother.

117
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
She asked my grandmother to send out the tapes.

118
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Did you see her?

119
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Did she see you?

120
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No.

121
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
No.

122
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Then how do you know

123
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
that it was Wen Jin who sent the messages?

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I didn't see Wen Jin before.

125
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't know who sent them.

126
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I don't know if he sent them.

127
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
There is a code.

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Uncle Bai,

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Qiao Man can answer Qiao Man's call.

130
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You can tell that she is Wen Jin's aunt

131
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
by a code?

132
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Of course not.

133
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I told Zhuo Ma and Chen Wen Jin

134
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
to meet up.

135
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I exposed her on the spot.

136
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But,

137
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Wen Jin must have arranged all this.

138
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Only she would come to me.

139
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Wen Jin used this method

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
to lure everyone in step by step.

141
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Later,

142
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
my grandmother said that Wen Jin was waiting for me in front of her.

143
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
She gave me another way

144
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
to enter the rain forest faster.

145
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I realized that

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
this could be the last chance to see Wen Jin.

147
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So you believe that Wen Jin's aunt is still alive?

148
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
If Wen Jin really is not here,

149
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Lu Xiang Dai would have sent her away.

150
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
She must be alive.

151
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But why did Lu Xiang Dai

152
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
send us three people?

153
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You, me, and Ning.

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Is there any connection between us?

155
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's you, me, and Xiao Ge.

156
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I know that Ning

157
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
must be interested in this.

158
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I also need her material and human resources

159
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
to open the way for us.

160
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So I asked Xiao Ge to take Lu Xiang Dai

161
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and find Ning to be the transparent light.

162
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You were the one who got Ning in here?

163
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I just provided the information.

164
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It was her who decided to do it.

165
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Ning is dead.

166
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Have you ever heard of

167
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
no protection against rock climbing?

168
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What do you mean?

169
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
There is no protection.

170
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There are many rock climbing

171
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
that are very dangerous.

172
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The whole process is very dangerous

173
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and there is no way out.

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But there are still people who keep challenging.

175
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Some people say that

176
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
no protection against rock climbing

177
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
is more dangerous than living.

178
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What we do is very similar to them.

179
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Death can be predicted.

180
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I just don't know if it's today

181
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
or tomorrow.

182
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I think Ning

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
understands this.

184
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Since you have made your choice,

185
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
don't think about other possibilities.

186
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's meaningless.

187
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Just like you are willing to sacrifice

188
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
for Xiao Ge.

189
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I can also sacrifice

190
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
for my choice.

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You and Xiao Ge

192
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
were both in the archaeological team.

193
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What about me?

194
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Why did you choose me?

195
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I can only ask you.

196
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Do you know her?

197
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Her?

198
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The one who stole the cover.

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The source of the tape

200
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
means that the person who kept the tape

201
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
couldn't contact me.

202
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Or I was dead.

203
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Or she had found me

204
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and I had left this city.

205
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's also a concept

206
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
that Aunt Wen Jian mentioned in the diary.

207
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
She also gave us another way.

208
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
She wanted you and Ning to separate.

209
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
She was also worried about her.

210
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Let me see.

211
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Uncle,

212
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
you can see it.

213
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You have to get some hard material.

214
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I can show you the tape.

215
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The point of the tape is not the content.

216
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
This is not hard material.

217
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm different.

218
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What to see?

219
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
See, of course.

220
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Where are we?

221
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Are we out?

222
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Is there salt?

223
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Be careful.

224
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Where are we going?

225
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
There's no sound.

226
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Those things are coming again.

227
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Uncle Li.

228
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The sound of the horn.

229
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I heard the same sound

230
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
in front of the bronze door.

231
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Uncle,

232
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
is the video taken in Yun Ding Tian Palace?

233
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Did they also enter the bronze door?

234
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What's going on?

235
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't know.

236
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You don't know?

237
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You always say you don't know.

238
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
How could I know?

239
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Wu Xie,

240
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I told you everything I know.

241
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You really don't know anything else.

242
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Where's Wen Jian's diary?

243
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You should show me.

244
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I can see it.

245
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But not now.

246
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I left it in the camp.

247
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'll show it to you when I go out.

248
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You're lying.

249
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Uncle, I did it for your own good.

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
OK.

251
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You and I have learned a lot.

252
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Go out and solve it.

256
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Kill!

257
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I thought you were a big shot.

258
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You're such a little kid.

259
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You scared you like this.

260
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Master Hua, Master Hei,

261
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm a worker.

262
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I don't want to die.

263
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm really scared.

264
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Please help me go.

265
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I want to go home.

266
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
We really want to let you go.

267
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But you can't, Tuoba.

268
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You're like this.

269
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Once you go out and meet a wild chicken,

270
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
you'll die.

271
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Kill!

272
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Kill!

273
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I bet he can't live a kilometer.

274
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Twenty thousand five hundred meters.

275
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That's right.

276
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
After all,

277
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
it's a wild chicken's neck.

278
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Where is it staring?

279
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You're angry.

280
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Let's go out for a kilometer.

281
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Let's go out and win.

282
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm not going.

283
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'll burn your teeth tomorrow.

284
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I can't see.

285
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I don't want to die.

286
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You're really not going?

287
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm really not going.

288
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You're so annoying.

289
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Stop playing.

290
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm still being burned by Fatty.

291
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm going.

292
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It seems like we're going down again.

293
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
This should be the tail of the snake.

294
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
We're finally at the end.

295
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm going out first.

296
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You guys follow me.

297
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
There's no way.

298
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's probably because of the earthquake

299
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
that the lava collapsed.

300
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Burn the soil.

301
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Empty.

302
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Let's use water glue.

303
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Don't.

304
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Water is precious.

305
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'll go.

306
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Take the rope.

307
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll go down with the dark eye.

308
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What are you doing?

309
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,440
You're not going to dig the way?

310
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,400
Just stay up there and wait.

311
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,920
Fine. You won't let me go down, right?

312
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,920
Then don't go down.

313
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,360
Fan Yan, your nephew doesn't trust you.

314
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,360
He's afraid you'll run away.

315
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,920
You can't be the first one to go down.

316
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,240
If you want to go down, you have to follow us.

317
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,400
Fine.

318
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,200
But the three of us have to be on the same side.

319
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Don't be afraid.

320
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
There are dead people inside.

321
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
These mud puddles are all dead people?

322
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
In ancient times, when building the Daxing Palace,

323
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
there were many casualties.

324
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
These craftsmen died here.

325
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The mud on the body was buried.

326
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
In history, there are such places

327
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
near the Daxing Palace.

328
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Come here.

329
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Look here.

330
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This is Brother's mark.

331
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I saw it when I was in the Cloud Sky Palace.

332
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Are you sure?

333
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Yes.

334
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But Brother...

335
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
He's not the only one who saw it.

336
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But isn't Brother taking care of Pan Zi?

337
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Why is he here?

338
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
This mark has been here for a long time.

339
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's not from the present.

340
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's been here for years?

341
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Brother came here?

342
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
He didn't tell you?

343
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Maybe it's something he did before he lost his memory.

344
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But he might have told you.

345
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
He hid it from me.

346
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
This mute is mysterious.

347
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Brother has his reasons for everything he does.

348
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's also related to his past.

349
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Fortunately, there's a mark that shows we're on the right track.

350
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I think...

351
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
this path should be below that path.

352
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The earthquake has loosened the sand and soil layers.

353
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
We're going over a path.

354
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Tell the people above to come down.

355
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Slowly.

356
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Fatty, you're finally awake.

357
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Tian Tian.

358
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Water.

359
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You know you have to drink water?

360
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Here, slowly.

361
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Fatty, how are you? Can you still walk?

362
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Third Master.

363
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Why is he here?

364
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
What happened?

365
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm looking at you now.

366
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Why do you look a little bit like a ghost?

367
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You were bitten by a snake.

368
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Then you were dragged into the snake den by a snake.

369
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
We were rushed to the ground by the water.

370
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Fortunately, Third Uncle and the others were nearby and saved us.

371
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Friends are still blessed.

372
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
How dare you say that?

373
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You're so smart.

374
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I almost died while I was running after you.

375
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Do you know that?

376
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Just wait.

377
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
If you don't lose weight when you go back, I won't save you next time.

378
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
What do you know?

379
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm Chu Bei Liang.

380
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Thank you, Third Master.

381
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Be careful.

382
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
This... this is a dead end.

383
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It should be blocked by the branches and branches here.

384
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Go.

385
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Clean up all these mess.

386
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Yes.

387
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Everyone, be careful.

388
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Don't destroy the cultural relics and get into the trap.

389
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Shoot!

390
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Shoot!

391
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Shoot!

392
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Shoot!

393
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Everyone, be careful!

394
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Wu Xie, take Tao Zi and run!

395
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Third Uncle!

396
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Third Uncle!

397
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Come on.

398
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm sorry.

399
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm so sorry.

400
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I just ran into the water and got into trouble.

401
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I didn't mean to offend you.

402
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I'm sorry.

403
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I'm sorry.

404
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm sorry.

405
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm sorry.

406
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm sorry.

407
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm sorry.

408
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm sorry.

409
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Come out.

410
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Xiao Ge?

411
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Come with me.

412
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Are you Chen Wen Jin?

413
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yes.

414
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Wu Xie, wipe your face.

415
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Don't worry. I won't run away.

416
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Are you feeling better?

417
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Hey, hey.

418
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Si San,

419
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
you should rest.

420
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I'll go find him.

421
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You can rest for 100 days.

422
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'll find Wu Xie for you.

423
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So we were right.

424
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It's really you.

425
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
But Aunt Wen Jian,

426
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
why do you look

427
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
not old at all?

428
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And you look exactly like the photo.

429
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Shouldn't you be the same age as my third uncle?

430
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Youth is not a good thing

431
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
for me.

432
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I didn't expect you to be this old.

433
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I even washed your urine

434
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
20 years ago.

435
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Time flies.

436
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Aunt Wen Jian,

437
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
to be honest,

438
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
you suddenly appeared.

439
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I really don't know

440
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
how to react.

441
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Who said we haven't seen each other for a long time?

442
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Are you the daughter-in-law

443
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
of my third uncle?

444
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
The person who was with us

445
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
before that...

446
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Aunt Wen Jian!

447
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Is it you?

448
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
So you've been following us.

449
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Wait.

450
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
How did you and Xiao Ge

451
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
get together?

452
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
We were in the same group.

453
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
No.

454
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I just separated from my third uncle.

455
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
They met another hunter.

456
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
How about we go find them first?

457
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It's too dangerous to go out now.

458
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
The gap here is too wide.

459
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
It's easy to miss

460
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
when you find him and he finds you.

461
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Let's take a break here

462
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and go out later.

463
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But...

464
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Don't worry.

465
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
As long as we follow these paths,

466
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
we can reach the lake.

467
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
That's the end of all waterways.

468
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Wu San Xin and our destination are the same.

469
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
As long as he doesn't have an accident,

470
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
we can meet him.

471
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
The same destination.

472
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So you stole our stuff

473
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
and let us follow you

474
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
at the temple

475
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
just to lead us to the lake.

476
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
That's right.

477
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I know you have a lot of questions.

478
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You can ask me now.

479
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
All right.

480
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Why did you pretend to be

481
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
the daughter-in-law of the main horse?

482
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
For the sake of the god.

483
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
You're hiding it from me too.

484
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I've hinted at you.

485
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Nonsense.

486
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
When did you hint at me?

487
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I...

488
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I was just pretending.

489
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
What did you mean by that?

490
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
My grandma said

491
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
that Sister Cheng Wen asked me to give you a message.

492
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Damn it.

493
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
What kind of face is that?

494
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Who would understand you?

495
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Zhang Qi Ling can't be blamed for this.

496
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
There are people in the team that are her.

497
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And we don't know who they are.

498
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
If we get caught,

499
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
we'll be in trouble.

500
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
All right.

501
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Can you tell me about

502
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
the tape?

503
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
This is a plan.

504
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It's too long to tell.

505
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
If that's the case,

506
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I'll ask in order.

507
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Why aren't you old?

508
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Look at this first.

509
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
This is the scene from 19 years ago

510
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
when you went to West Desert with the team.

511
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
But I only know a few people

512
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
who are involved in this

513
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
in the photos.

514
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It's all right.

515
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Just tell me you know them.

516
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
This is Xiao Ge.

517
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Yes.

518
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
This is you.

519
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
This is my third uncle.

520
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Why do you think

521
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
this is your third uncle?

522
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
This is my third uncle.

523
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I've seen my third uncle

524
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
when he was young.

525
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
He looks the same as this.

526
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
In this world,

527
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
not only photos are similar.

528
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
People with blood relations

529
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
may also be similar.

530
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
What...

531
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
What do you mean?

532
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
You mean

533
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
he's not my third uncle?

534
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
He's not.

535
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
He's Xie Lian Huan.

536
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
No.

537
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
How is that possible?

538
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I've seen Xie Lian Huan before.

539
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
How could this person be Xie Lian Huan?

540
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Your third uncle was with us.

541
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
But he wasn't in this photo.

542
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
This is the photo.

543
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
This is the photo.

544
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
This is the photo.

545
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
He wasn't in this photo.

546
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Because he was the photographer of this photo.

547
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Your so-called third uncle

548
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
is not Wu San Xing.

549
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
This is also the reason

550
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
why he would never tell you the truth.

551
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Because from the beginning,

552
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
everything was wrong.

553
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
He was in the West Mountain Sea

554
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
and had already switched with Xie Lian Huan.

555
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
No.

556
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You must be lying.

557
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Aunt Wen Ji.

558
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
You are lying to me, right?

559
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Tell me.

560
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
You must be lying to me, right?

561
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Wu Xie.

562
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You've lived with him for so many years.

563
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I know you wouldn't believe this.

564
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So I thought I wouldn't tell you this.

565
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
But you are too obsessed with this mystery.

566
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Even if I don't tell you now,

567
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I don't think he can hide it for too long.

568
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Things have become like this.

569
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
There are too many leaks.

570
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
He kept lying to you.

571
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
There is no way to get through this.

572
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It's too late for you to choose not to believe it now.

573
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
The blood on the bottom of the West Mountain Sea

574
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
is clearly written.

575
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Wu San Xing caused me to die.

576
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
The path is Xie Lian Huan.

577
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You have misunderstood those blood lines.

578
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
The blood is clearly written.

579
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
How did you misunderstand it?

580
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Write it down as you see it.

581
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I will not let you go.

582
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I will not let you go.

583
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Write down as you see it.

584
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I turned the blood into ink.

585
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
That's right.

586
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Normally, everything on the tablet is written down as ink.

587
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:12,380
All the

588
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,000
lines are written from the left from the right.

589
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
If you turn this sentence over,

590
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
everything will be completely opposite.

591
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
How is that possible?

592
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
How is that possible?

593
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
How is this possible?

594
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
How is this possible?

595
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
How is this possible?

596
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
How is this possible?

597
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
How could this be?

598
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
We were then dazed by you.

599
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
When we woke up,

600
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
we encountered some things that I still can't understand.

601
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Wuling.

602
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
We were missing a few people.

603
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Zhang Qilin is gone.

604
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And the time on the watch

605
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
is already more than a week after we were unconscious.

606
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And we found that the team has been being watched.

607
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Who?

608
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Him.

609
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Him?

610
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I can't describe it.

611
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
He's been watching us.

612
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I can't describe it.

613
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
This is what we found when we were researching the whole thing.

614
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
It could be said to be a kind of power.

615
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Power?

616
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
After we were born,

617
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
in the nursing home,

618
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
we did everything from start to finish.

619
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
We found that

620
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
there were some key points missing in many things.

621
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
That is to say, if this thing were to happen,

622
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
it would be more than enough for the people we have now.

623
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It's like there's a person who's invisible

624
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
filling this void.

625
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
But until now,

626
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
this person has never appeared.

627
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
He only exists on the logic.

628
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So we called him.

629
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
This is a power other than the Qiu Dekang, Xie Lianhuan,

630
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
and us.

631
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
This power has never appeared.

632
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So many years have passed.

633
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
None of us have changed.

634
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It must be when we were in a coma.

635
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Someone touched our bodies

636
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
and when did they disappear?

637
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So you were born?

638
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Do you remember

639
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
the thing we met in the underground of the Gormu?

640
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Is that really a fire spirit?

641
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
After 1990,

642
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
it seems that it has stopped watching us.

643
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
We continued our investigation.

644
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
But after Tamdua came back,

645
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
the fire spirit started to change.

646
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Smell it.

647
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
This smell is so familiar.

648
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It's the same smell as the fire spirit.

649
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
This smell means that after a while,

650
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I will also start to change.

651
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
My body will avoid the death step.

652
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I will become a monster

653
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
from a living person.

654
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I wanted to continue to be a person

655
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
who is invisible

656
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
and who is invisible.

657
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
But I was too afraid to do so.

658
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But a few months ago,

659
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I smelled the smell of my own body.

660
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
The fire spirit is our most important thing.

661
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I am its last life.

662
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I have no time.

663
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Tianzhen.

664
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Fatty, this way.

665
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Tianzhen.

666
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I finally found you.

667
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
You are hurt.

668
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Hurry up.

669
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Tianzhen.

670
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Don't worry.

671
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I am the third son of the Wu family.

672
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I can't die.

673
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Wenqi.

674
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
You...

675
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Wu Xie knows

676
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
that I am the third son of the Wu family.

677
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Don't hide it.

678
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I know.

679
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Your third uncle was at the front

680
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
to kill the snake.

681
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
But he got hurt.

682
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Is the wound still there?

683
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Why is there still blood?

684
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Where is the medicine box?

685
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Wu Xie, calm down.

686
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
The medicine box is lost.

687
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
We used all the medicine we could find.

688
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Wu Xie.

689
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I am sorry.

690
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Let go.

691
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Wenqi.

692
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Don't worry.

693
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I am not dead.

694
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Wenqi.

695
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I know.

696
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Lian Huan.

697
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
It's not your fault.

698
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
You are back.

699
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
What did you call him?

700
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Xiaohua.

701
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
We haven't found the way to the West King's tomb.

702
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
My third uncle,

703
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
your uncle,

704
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Aunt Wenjing,

705
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
and our ancestors,

706
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
they all wanted to find it.

707
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Isn't it?

708
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Yes.

709
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
But I need to deal with the family business first.

710
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Yes.

711
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Sorry.

712
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Sorry.

713
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Sorry.

714
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Sorry.

715
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
He is dangerous.

716
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Look, Mark.

717
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Look, Mark.

718
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
You are bad, Tuoma.

719
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
You are like this.

720
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
You are like this.

721
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Sorry.

722
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Sorry.

723
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I am really...

724
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Sorry, director. I forgot the lines.

725
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Take a breath.

726
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Let me win.

727
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
There is nothing here.

728
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Let's go.

729
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I am sorry.

730
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Sorry.

731
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I am sorry.

732
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I am sorry.

733
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
He is coming.

734
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I will make it.

735
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I have such a case.

736
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
All big cities in history

737
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
have such cases.

738
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I have such a case.

739
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Here it is.

740
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Let's take this one.

741
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Yes.

742
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Come on.

743
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
significant

744
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I'm here!

745
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I'm here!

746
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I'm sorry, I'm late.

747
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
You're the daughter-in-law of Dingzhu Zongba?

748
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Oh, yes.

749
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
The next one.

750
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
What the hell.

751
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Who can understand you?

752
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Let me answer it.

753
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Okay.

754
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Let's go.

755
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Sorry, I'm late.

756
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I'm sorry.

757
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I'm late.

758
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I'm late.

759
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I'm sorry, I'm late.

760
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Okay, okay.

761
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I'm sorry, I'm late.

762
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I forgot the procedure.

763
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I can't remember it.

764
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Are you relieved?
