1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,900
Mr. Right

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,400
After the idea was generated

3
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,720
He appeared

4
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,600
At the same time

5
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,880
The original observation plan

6
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,120
The hindrance also occurred

7
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,000
It's him again

8
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,720
You mean

9
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,400
When the observation of the longevity secret

10
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,280
There is progress

11
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,040
People have some ideas

12
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,480
He appeared

13
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,120
So what happened here

14
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,200
It's also a part of his plan

15
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,240
This is your guess

16
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,120
But I knew this village a long time ago

17
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,520
And in the village

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,840
Hiding the secret of the unspeakable

19
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,520
When the dark eye told me

20
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,360
After the team of Qiu Dakao arrived

21
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,920
I immediately took someone to come here

22
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,200
Because I know where they are going

23
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,360
It must be dangerous

24
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,720
I tell you

25
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,320
What dangerous place did I go

26
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,000
This broken swimming

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,800
I don't care at all

28
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,480
If it weren't for me

29
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,960
I haven't eaten for a few days

30
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,400
I'm really hungry

31
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,800
I won't hang up

32
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,600
I

33
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,120
Shao Meihao

34
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,240
Don't move around

35
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,680
These grandchildren

36
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,280
Blackout

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,760
Brother

38
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,080
You are still embarrassed to say

39
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,320
I'm like this now

40
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,720
It's all because of you

41
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,840
I was confused before

42
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,120
You said you put a broken piece of iron under the bed

43
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,440
There are so many things in the cave

44
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,600
You said that thing is not worth it

45
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,560
Why do you treat it as a treasure

46
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,000
Now I finally understand

47
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,400
You just want to remind yourself

48
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,800
That place is dangerous

49
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,720
Don't go to the death

50
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,360
I said you

51
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,360
You can't blame Xiao Ge for this

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,440
He hasn't recovered his memory

53
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,040
You are here

54
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,600
How dare I blame Xiao Ge

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,720
I mean

56
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,440
Actually, since we already know

57
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,800
This entrance is in the mountains

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,280
Just chase after the chicken

59
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,640
Hurry back to search the mountains

60
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,440
Come

61
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,960
Help Fatty get up

62
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,280
I'll go to the hospital myself

63
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,560
Don't be so proud

64
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,760
Your wound is not healed

65
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,080
What if you go back to the bar

66
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,280
What if something happens

67
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,040
Can you look forward to me

68
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,240
Shut your mouth

69
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,200
Moreover, you are not in a hurry

70
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,880
Find Xiao Ge a memory

71
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,320
You are not in a hurry, I am in a hurry

72
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,800
You see, I am injured

73
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,000
It's been out for so many days

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,600
This Yun Sai should be worried about me

75
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,360
Hurry up

76
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,880
No

77
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,840
Are you really okay

78
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,040
Don't worry

79
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,800
I can do it

80
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
I can do it

81
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,120
Now I know it hurts

82
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,720
Who let you run back without healing

83
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,000
I thought it was all right

84
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,600
Who knows it still hurts a little bit

85
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,360
It's okay

86
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,600
You fat brother and I are in good health

87
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,520
This wound is like a bowl

88
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,640
This is just a minor infection

89
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,920
I'm not thinking about you

90
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,680
I'm afraid you're worried about me

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay, this time you have a good rest

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,040
Don't run around

93
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,920
Listen to me

94
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,800
OK, listen to you

95
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,360
Stand there, don't move

96
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,080
Understand the rules

97
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
Say it

98
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,480
Take this as your own home

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I said you guys

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,080
Why are you still here

101
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,840
The boss knows you are back

102
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,960
Want to see you

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,840
Cooperation

104
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,480
I am sincere

105
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,720
This is not my book

106
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,240
Correct

107
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,720
This is just a copy I bought at a high price

108
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,240
What is the sincerity of taking out a copy?

109
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,280
Can you understand the contents of the book

110
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,280
Can understand a part

111
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,520
The address above

112
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,440
It seems to be here

113
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,080
The location seems to be here

114
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,040
Yes, the clue provided by the uncle

115
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,360
This is the place

116
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,520
What else is there

117
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,960
Young people

118
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,920
What really matters

119
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,680
Should be the source of this copy

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,760
You have been pursuing uncle for so long

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,840
Have you ever thought about this uncle

122
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,280
Where did it come from

123
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,600
you know

124
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,560
I don't know anything else

125
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,120
But this piece in my hand

126
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,240
As far as I know, it was made from the Choumen Hangqi

127
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,560
Huo Xiangong

128
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,120
It turns out that this old lady Huo

129
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,440
I've already found the clues of Lu Kuangbo

130
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,520
We all have to go

131
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,960
There is nothing to be surprised about

132
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,760
People live longer

133
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,920
The more you know, the more secrets you will have

134
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,360
After all, the old Choumen's agent

135
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,640
What is still present

136
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,920
Only one left

137
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,800
How about this, Mr. Shan

138
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,440
Is my sincerity enough now?

139
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,120
it is good

140
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,440
I can cooperate with you

141
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,800
But your subordinate

142
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,560
Must cooperate with my action

143
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,080
So what is the next step

144
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,480
Search the mountain

145
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,480
You said Zhang's old building is in the mountains

146
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,920
You just have to search the mountain

147
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,360
First find the entrance to Zhang's old building

148
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,160
Little three

149
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,600
Don't worry, I know that place

150
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,920
Can't enter casually

151
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,480
Hello, little flower

152
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,640
I have a message to tell you

153
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,440
Xiu Xiu told me

154
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,920
Said that the old lady Huo's family

155
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,800
There is a video of the Gormu nursing home

156
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,880
I think she must know some details

157
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,600
After all, she is missing in Xisha

158
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,640
Is her biological daughter

159
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,800
Qiu Degao is right

160
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,560
Huo Lao Tai has lived too long

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,400
If she participates in this matter

162
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,200
I know more than we do

163
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,720
I think she is right

164
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,680
I think she is right

165
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,960
I know more than we do

166
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,400
You have been through life and death

167
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,680
It took a lot of effort to find these information

168
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,360
That old lady

169
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,720
Maybe 20 or 30 years ago

170
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,200
The gun is still old

171
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,520
Then in this case

172
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,120
It seems that I have to ask Xiu Xiu for help

173
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,520
Let her get some clues from her grandmother

174
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,720
it is good

175
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,520
Contact me anytime you have news

176
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,760
it is good

177
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,680
Help me

178
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,560
Are you using your phone to call my number

179
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,840
Carefully

180
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,360
What is the gör hefty

181
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
파�ographic

182
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,800
Here

183
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,120
Hello

184
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,200
Yes

185
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,200
say

186
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,000
I think this does sound downwards

187
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,000
I am looking for ona

188
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Are busca

189
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,360
It doesn't matter

190
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,760
It's been so long.

191
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,760
We didn't even see the entrance.

192
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,760
Since it's the entrance of Zhang's Mansion,

193
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,760
how can it be so easy to find?

194
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
Keep digging.

195
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
Maybe we'll find it soon.

196
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
Guys,

197
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
I think the clue you gave us

198
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,760
is not wrong.

199
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,760
We've been working on the mountain

200
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
for so many days.

201
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,760
Why didn't we find anything?

202
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
The boss has provided you

203
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
with so much human power and material.

204
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,760
Don't come to nothing in the end.

205
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,760
It's hard to explain to him.

206
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
The Yangjiu Mountain is so big.

207
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
We're human beings.

208
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
It's not that easy to find.

209
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
You should mind your own business.

210
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,760
You're just a lazy person.

211
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,760
Then I can only wait for good news.

212
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
You guys take a break here.

213
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
Keep looking for it when you've got enough energy.

214
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
How much water do you need?

215
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
Half of it.

216
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
Here, drink some water.

217
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,760
We've been here for so long.

218
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,760
It's the first time I've seen a milk cart from this angle.

219
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,760
It's much quieter than Beijing

220
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,760
when you're in the mountains and in the water.

221
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,760
This is what I drew before.

222
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
The map of the village under the water.

223
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
Take a closer look.

224
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,760
It's the same as the one on the ground.

225
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
It's the same as the one on the ground.

226
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,760
It's really the same.

227
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
Look at the intersection of the small road.

228
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,760
The house and the distribution of the pears.

229
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
It's exactly the same.

230
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,760
Brother, you know a lot.

231
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Do you know why?

232
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,760
Do you think it's because of this?

233
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,760
The village under the water is the original village.

234
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,760
It's just that the natural disaster

235
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
flooded the water and flooded the water.

236
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
It's all flooded.

237
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,760
The old man is in a similar place.

238
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
According to the original pattern,

239
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
it's exactly the same.

240
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Such a high similarity.

241
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,760
Unless before the original village was flooded,

242
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,760
a precise measurement was made.

243
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,760
But the technology at that time was not so developed.

244
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,760
No one has such a bad memory.

245
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
Don't talk about death.

246
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,760
What if there are good people?

247
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,760
It's not clear.

248
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,760
Because it's impossible.

249
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,760
Yao's original plan for the village

250
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,760
is not reliable.

251
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,760
The layout on this map doesn't seem to have any special meaning.

252
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,760
Why should we build a village that is exactly the same?

253
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
Then according to you,

254
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,760
there were two exactly the same mountain towns.

255
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,760
It's just a sink under the water.

256
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,760
But that doesn't make sense.

257
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,760
If you build a similar village before the flood,

258
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,760
the locals will not know.

259
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,760
At least it will leave a message.

260
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,760
I understand.

261
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,760
But we've been here for so many days.

262
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,760
We've never heard anyone mention it.

263
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,760
Isn't it strange?

264
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,760
Unless there are some people

265
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
or a force

266
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
that stopped the spread of the message

267
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,760
and deliberately hid the truth of the matter.

268
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,760
Think about it.

269
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,760
We already know the situation in the water.

270
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,760
This lake is a dead water lake.

271
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,760
The lake is connected to the mountain.

272
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,760
So it's very likely that the original village

273
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,760
was built in this mountain.

274
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,760
But someone deliberately built the lake

275
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,760
and hid the whole village under the lake.

276
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,760
Fatty, do you remember

277
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,760
the demon's story that Panma said?

278
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,760
People can't come back to life.

279
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,760
Are you sure they are exactly the same as before?

280
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,760
Exactly the same.

281
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,760
The old investigation team was wiped out.

282
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,760
A new team with unknown origin

283
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,760
replaced it without knowing the ghost.

284
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,760
Does it mean

285
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,760
that the village is copied?

286
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,760
Exactly the same.

287
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
I feel more and more

288
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,760
that what happened here

289
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,760
is like a conspiracy.

290
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,760
A conspiracy?

291
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,760
What conspiracy?

292
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,760
The core of the conspiracy is to hide.

293
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,760
That is to say,

294
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,760
A'Gui's village is fake.

295
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,760
In order not to let people find out

296
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,760
that the real village has disappeared,

297
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,760
they deliberately built a village

298
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,760
that is exactly the same.

299
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,760
There must be a bigger conspiracy behind this.

300
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,760
The original villagers have disappeared.

301
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,760
But another group of people

302
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,760
built a completely similar village

303
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,760
and disguised themselves as villagers.

304
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,760
They lived in a fake village

305
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,760
What is the purpose of the villagers?

306
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,760
It's been so long.

307
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,760
Now,

308
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,760
we can't find out the truth.

309
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,760
Of course.

310
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,760
It's just my guess.

311
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,760
What do you think this is?

312
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,760
Any information will be good to you.

313
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,760
This hat cannot be used.

314
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,760
It can sink someone.

315
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,760
I think

316
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,760
this has been her achievement.

317
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
Don't be surprised.

318
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,760
Where is this woman?

319
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,760
Where do you think foreign dreams come out?

320
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,760
They all come out impulse.

321
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,760
Of course.

322
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,740
Last time, we saw you passing by.

323
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,340
So we came here to ask what's going on?

324
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,460
By the water we finnicaly walked through!

325
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,000
You're absolutely correct.

326
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,960
What's going on here?

327
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,400
You thought I saw you?

328
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,840
Forget it.

329
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,260
He sees me.

330
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,900
I honestly gave a laugh when all this was happening.

331
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
I think that the tattoo on his body

332
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
is the same as the one on Qilin's eyes

333
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,900
when he was hanging from the corner of the building.

334
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,900
It seems that it's at least a little bit certain.

335
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,900
Xiao Ge might have forgotten about it.

336
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,900
But he must have a deep connection with the Zhang family.

337
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,900
Un rewind

338
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,900
Yun Sen

339
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,900
Yun Sen

340
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,900
I have the talent.

341
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,900
I want to save her.

342
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,900
To be the water bull head hook.

343
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,900
Her shoulder?

344
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,900
This must be a trap!

345
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,900
It must be designed by her shoulder!

346
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
This shoulder is too shameless.

347
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
Why are you putting on a face mask?

348
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,900
Why are you touching a girl?

349
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,900
Her shoulder hurt us last time.

350
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,900
It was when we were about to find the clue.

351
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
If she did it this time,

352
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,900
it proves that our guess is right.

353
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,900
Searching the mountain will definitely have a result.

354
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,900
Even if it's a trap,

355
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,900
I will go save her.

356
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,900
Let's go together.

357
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,900
Yun Cai!

358
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,900
Yun Cai!

359
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,900
Yun Cai!

360
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,900
Yun Cai!

361
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,900
Yun Cai!

362
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,900
Yun Cai!

363
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,900
Yun Cai!

364
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,940
Yun Cai!

365
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,700
post fort Jeou

366
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
The fairest!

367
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,320
I told you,the trap is a trap!

368
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
She's like human blood.

369
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,960
Who fake that Она nous les plumbing like a trickster!

370
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,940
Let's go.

371
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,420
Tell Eunuch Lei to get weezy!

372
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,380
You identical Goalkeeper,

373
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,100
go to the bow right now!

374
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:36,860
Yuncai!

375
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,620
Yuncai.

376
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,740
Yuncai.

377
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,140
It's time for the spider to come out.

378
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,860
No matter what's ahead,

379
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,540
friends are not afraid of it.

380
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,580
You're really good.

381
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,620
Did you forget the pain?

382
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,220
Isn't it enough to be bitten once?

383
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,900
I brought the herb before I went out.

384
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,100
I'll put it on.

385
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,180
Can put the spider.

386
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,420
Let's go.

387
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,460
Go.

388
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,340
You still frozen?

389
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,020
Tienzhen.

390
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,820
Your LTG is really helpful.

391
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,340
All of them are

392
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,300
going aroundنت.

393
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,140
Help.

394
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:07,860
Yuncai?

395
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,860
Help.

396
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,900
Help.

397
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,780
Help.

398
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,940
Fatty!

399
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,940
Fatty!

400
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,540
Fatty, save me!

401
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,940
Fatty!

402
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,340
Fatty!

403
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,740
Fatty, save me!

404
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,740
Fatty!

405
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,740
Fatty, save me!

406
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,940
Xiao Lian, don't be in danger!

407
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,940
Fatty!

408
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,940
Save me, Fatty!

409
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,540
Even if there's a mountain of knives and a sea of fire,

410
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,340
I'll go save him!

411
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,940
I know you're worried!

412
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,340
But look,

413
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,340
his shoulders are set up.

414
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,140
He's going to hit the edge of the cliff and kill us all!

415
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,740
We'll go save Yun Cai now.

416
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,340
If we can't, he'll hide behind the dark place and stab us.

417
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,740
We'd better be careful.

418
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,740
Fatty, save me!

419
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,140
Wu Xie, I'm serious.

420
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,340
If I can handle this,

421
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,740
I'll accept it!

422
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,940
Fatty!

423
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,740
Fatty, watch out!

424
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,540
You bastard!

425
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,740
I'll make you pay!

426
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,940
Are you okay?

427
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,140
Go save him!

428
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,540
Fatty, save me!

429
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,540
Yun Cai!

430
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,740
Fatty, be careful!

431
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,340
Fatty, be careful!

432
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,340
Fatty!

433
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,140
Coming!

434
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,140
Yun Cai, are you okay?

435
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,340
Fatty, run!

436
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,340
Run!

437
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,940
Yun Cai, what's wrong?

438
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,340
What's wrong?

439
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,140
This is a herb.

440
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,140
Put it on.

441
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,140
Fatty!

442
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,940
Fatty!

443
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,140
Are you okay?

444
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,140
I'm fine.

445
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,940
Protect Yun Cai.

446
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,940
Fatty!

447
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,340
Fatty!

448
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,140
Fatty!

449
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,540
Fatty!

450
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,940
Fatty!

451
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,740
Fatty!

452
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,140
Does Nanny Pan say

453
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,740
there's a drugstore nearby?

454
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,340
She'll wake up after putting it on.

455
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,740
Yun Cai, this place should be safe.

456
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,340
You stay here with Fatty, I'll come back.

457
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,860
Bro, you look so fine.

458
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,300
Okay.

459
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,100
I'll attack.

460
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:22,860
What?

461
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:24,620
Well,

462
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,900
I'll attack if you attack or not.

463
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,260
Hmm?

464
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,580
You continuous attack

465
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,860
is a very good defense.

466
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,100
I feel so haar.

467
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,100
Why do you like to attack?

468
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,740
Yes.

469
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,940
Fatty, I'm sorry.

470
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,940
I have no other choice.

471
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,940
You dared to put your knife near Fatty.

472
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,940
You're already dead.

473
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,940
I don't want to die like this.

474
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,940
Who are you?

475
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,940
Tianzhen, Boss.

476
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,940
Fatty just called you.

477
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,940
Who are you?

478
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,940
Fatty, you're making trouble again.

479
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,940
Fatty, are you looking for me?

480
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,940
No.

481
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,940
Then why is it cloudy?

482
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,940
This little girl doesn't like you.

483
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,940
She just wants to chat with you.

484
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,940
Looks like my dear Fatty has broken up with you.

485
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,940
You've been with us all along.

486
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,940
Because the person who sent you here

487
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,940
needs to know our information.

488
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,940
You're on her shoulders.

489
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,940
Right?

490
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,940
She's like Panma.

491
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,940
She's on her shoulders.

492
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,940
She's on her shoulders.

493
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,940
She's on her shoulders.

494
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,940
Fatty knew it was a trap.

495
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,940
He risked his life to save you.

496
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,940
Why did you do that?

497
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,940
I have no choice.

498
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,940
That person has been forcing me.

499
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,940
I was forced to do it.

500
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,940
I don't know.

501
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,940
I just want to be with you.

502
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,940
Looks like we're right.

503
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,940
Yuan Cai has been with us for so long.

504
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,940
It means his shoulders are aware of our actions.

505
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,940
He waited for so long and didn't do anything.

506
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,940
He's acting now.

507
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,940
It means he's afraid.

508
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,940
He's afraid we'll find the entrance to the gulag.

509
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,940
I'll give you a chance.

510
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,940
As long as you tell me who that person is, I'll let you go.

511
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,940
I'll forget everything you did.

512
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,940
I won't tell Fatty what you did.

513
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,940
You can go back to Beijing with us.

514
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,940
You can go back to your normal life.

515
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,940
As long as you want to.

516
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,940
I only know his name is Zhang Qiling.

517
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,940
Zhang Qiling?

518
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,940
Why is his name the same as yours?

519
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,940
I don't know.

520
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,940
Yuan Cai!

521
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,940
What's going on?

522
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,940
He's poisoned.

523
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,940
He's crying too fast.

524
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,940
He can't come back.

525
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,940
Where's the antidote?

526
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,940
Can we save him?

527
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,940
It's too late.

528
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,940
His shoulders are poisoned.

529
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,940
They're threatening him to do things for themselves.

530
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,940
He had no choice but to do it.

531
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,940
Yuan Cai.

532
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,940
Yuan Cai.

533
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,940
Yuan Cai.

534
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,940
I'm sorry.

535
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,940
I'm sorry.

536
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,940
I'm sorry.

537
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,940
Yuan Cai.

538
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,940
Yuan Cai.

539
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,940
Tian...

540
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,940
Yuan Cai.

541
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,940
Tianzhen.

542
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,940
Fatty.

543
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,940
Fatty, how are you?

544
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,940
Tianzhen.

545
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,940
Where's...

546
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,940
Where's Yu Yan?

547
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,940
How are you?

548
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,940
Yuan Cai.

549
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,940
Yuan Cai.

550
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,940
Yuan Cai.

551
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,940
Yuan Cai.

552
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,940
What?

553
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,940
Yuan Cai.

554
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,940
Yuan Cai.

555
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,940
What happened?

556
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,940
I told you to protect him.

557
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,940
I'm sorry.

558
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,940
I'm sorry.

559
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,940
I'm sorry.

560
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,940
You fainted.

561
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,940
You fainted.

562
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,940
Yuan Cai.

563
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,940
I'm sorry.

564
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,940
We were powerless.

565
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,940
We failed to save Yuan Cai.

566
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,940
Why didn't I protect you?

567
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,940
I...

568
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,940
I really like you.

569
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,940
I've never joked.

570
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,940
I'm sorry.

571
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,940
I'm sorry.

572
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,940
I'm sorry.

573
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,940
I'm sorry.

574
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,940
I'm sorry.

575
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,940
I'm sorry.

576
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,940
I'm sorry.

577
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,940
I'm sorry.

578
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,940
I'm sorry.

579
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,940
I'm sorry.

580
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,940
I'm sorry.

581
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,940
I'm sorry.

582
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,940
I'm sorry.

583
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,940
I'm sorry.

584
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,940
I'm sorry.

585
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,940
OK.

586
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,940
Yuan Cai.

587
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,940
Yuan Cai.

588
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,940
Yuan Cai.

589
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,940
Yuan Cai.

590
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,940
Yuan Cai.

591
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,940
Yuan Cai.

592
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,940
Yuan Cai.

593
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,940
We're alone in the black sky together

594
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,140
is to help the police find the evidence.

595
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,540
We must find out the secret of Zhang's shares.

596
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:47,240
Then what we pay, what Fatty pays,

597
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,140
will be meaningful.

598
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,440
His shoulder is also Zhang Qiling.

599
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,840
Could it be just a small river?

600
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,140
The Yaozhai of Ba Nai replaced the Yaozhai of Shui Xia.

601
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,640
This comparison, is it exactly the same as the Yaozhai on the ground?

602
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,240
The investigation team of Shui Xia also replaced the investigation team here.

603
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,140
It's impossible for people to live and die.

604
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,940
They must be monsters.

605
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,540
It's the monsters in the lake.

606
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,440
Could it be that you also replaced Zhang Qiling?

607
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,340
Think about it. You two are of the same name and surname.

608
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,440
And you both have Qi Chang's fingers.

609
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,940
And you are the same as him. You have been here for so many years.

610
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:41,040
The only difference is that your tattoo is Qiling.

611
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,040
And his is Qiong Qi.

612
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,840
Do you think it's possible to put Qiling and Qiong Qi's tattoos together

613
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,240
to form a map?

614
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:53,540
Or maybe you Zhang family has other god-bearing tattoos.

615
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,340
If you put all of them together, you can find Zhang's shares.

616
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,040
Forget it.

617
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,840
You can't remember anything now.

618
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,440
The only thing we can do now

619
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,940
is to help Fatty get out of here as soon as possible.

620
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,240
Fatty!

621
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,940
Fatty!

622
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,940
Xiao Ge.

623
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,940
What happened?

624
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,840
Fatty is missing.

625
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,640
We've searched everywhere.

626
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,040
I'm worried that he went to find his shoulder.

627
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,440
It's the female thief.

628
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,040
Of course.

629
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,540
Burn you to death, you bastard!

630
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,540
Burn you to death, you bastard!

631
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,540
You bastard!

632
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,540
You bastard!

633
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,240
Burn you to death, you bastard!

634
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,640
I'll burn you to death.

635
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,040
Are you crazy?

636
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,340
If we light this fire, the whole mountain will be destroyed.

637
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,540
The whole mountain?

638
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,640
I'll burn all the spiders in the whole mountain!

639
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,540
Calm down!

640
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,140
I can't calm down!

641
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,940
He killed Yun Cai.

642
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,140
I'll fight him to the death!

643
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,740
Then we'll go and catch him and hand him over to the police.

644
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,540
We can't set the fire here.

645
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:41,340
If I don't get my hands on him, he won't be dead!

646
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,740
Send me the fire extinguisher.

647
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,840
Give it to me!

648
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,240
Fatty!

649
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,440
Don't stop me!

650
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,540
Don't stop me!

651
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,340
Send me the fire extinguisher!

652
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,540
Fatty, look at me.

653
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,140
Where's your sense of reason?

654
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,540
Even if you burn all the spiders,

655
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,940
the Big Shoulder won't come out!

656
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,540
Big Shoulder,

657
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,140
don't you want me to investigate?

658
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,240
Even if I have to turn this mountain upside down,

659
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,340
I still have to find

660
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,340
Zhangjia Valley!

661
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,180
Found her!

662
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,140
I don't...

663
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,340
I'm going!

664
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,240
Want to die so badly?

665
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,340
The rodeo levels are high.

666
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,340
Let's just enjoy the alcohol.

667
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,340
Okay.

668
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,740
Happy birthday, dear little brother.

669
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,140
Being an athlete is not a must.

670
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,140
I must continue to work hard.

671
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,860
I hope then,

672
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,740
I continue to get my self-made skills.

673
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,460
I have a piece of Lu Huangbo in my hand

674
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,380
And the origin of this Lu Huangbo

675
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,540
Related to your grandmother

676
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,740
It's my grandmother again

677
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,820
You know my grandmother's temper

678
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,220
What do you think I can ask from her mouth

679
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,300
Don't worry about this

680
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,860
I have a way

681
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:09,320
코 escre

682
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:12,340
ез

683
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,700
Be buyer

684
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,300
Antique Fine

685
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,020
more beautiful

686
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,020
Our mountains are a bit poor

687
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,220
What taste?

688
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,620
Love heart taste.

689
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,220
I'm not a few years older than you.

690
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,820
Just call me Fat Brother.

691
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,220
Fat Brother, I just changed my medicine.

692
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,620
Fat Brother, you're so brave.

693
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,220
Fat Brother, you're getting better so fast.

694
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,420
It's all thanks to you taking care of me.

695
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,020
Isn't it right for me to cook for my sister?

696
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,420
Smell it. Is it fragrant?

697
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,620
It smells so good.

698
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,020
Fat...

699
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,020
Yuan Cai, how dare you play your Fat Brother?

700
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,420
I like Luo Si Feng.

701
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,220
This is called, smelly but not bitter, smelly but appetizing.

702
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,220
Isn't it, Yuan Cai?

703
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,820
Uncle Gui, just put your heart in it.

704
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,820
I promise you, when you come back,

705
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,220
this Yun Cai, even a hair strand can't be missing.

706
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,820
Fatty, where are you going?

707
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,220
Su Shan.

708
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,020
Su Shan?

709
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,220
You... are you okay?

710
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,020
I'm fine.

711
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,420
Fatty, I'm right.

712
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,620
You must find the Zhang family's bones.

713
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,620
I finally understand now.

714
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,420
You're trying to remind me.

715
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,420
I'm sorry.

716
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,020
I'm sorry.

717
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:35,420
Qi Bei, you must have the wrong clue.

718
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,420
Go up.

719
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,020
You're not going to be able to change it.

720
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,420
Fatty, you're not going to be able to change it.

721
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,020
I'll draw it for you to compare.

722
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,020
I'll give you a head.

723
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,220
Okay, I'll give you a head.

724
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,420
It's his shoulder.

725
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,820
Okay, I'll give you a head.

726
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,020
It's his shoulder.

727
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,420
Last time, he hugged me.

728
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,420
I'm sorry.

729
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,420
His shoulder.

730
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,420
I'm sorry.

731
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,020
Yun Cai!

732
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,020
Yun Cai!

733
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,020
You're really a good cat, old man.

734
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,420
You want to bite me again, right?

735
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,420
You didn't see it, right?

736
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,020
I'm not afraid of you.

737
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,020
I'm sorry.

738
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:15,620
Good morning.

739
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,420
Come again.

740
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,020
I'm sorry.

741
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,020
Come again.

742
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,620
I'm sorry.

743
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,620
I'm sorry.

744
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,620
I'm sorry.

745
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,620
I'm sorry.

746
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,620
I'm sorry.

747
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:34,620
Come again.

748
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,620
I'm sorry.

749
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,620
Hit him again.

750
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,620
Hit him again.

751
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:40,620
I'm sorry.

752
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,620
Don't be afraid.

753
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,020
Don't be afraid.

754
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,020
Don't be afraid.

755
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,820
Yun Cai.

756
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,620
Are you okay?

757
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,620
Fine, I'm fine.

758
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,820
Yun Cai.

759
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,820

786
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,980
It's different.

787
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,460
