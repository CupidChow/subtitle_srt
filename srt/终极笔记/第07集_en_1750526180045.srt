00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What is this?

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
A lighter.

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
A lighter? Don't play with fire. It will make you cough.

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
A lighter?

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
A lighter?

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yes, a lighter.

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A lighter?

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Wait a minute.

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Here, I'll give you a better one.

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What age is this? You're still carrying a lighter?

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You're really rich.

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Traditional wisdom.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Light up your life.

16
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
A big bomb.

18
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He got fired?

19
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

20
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That person looks familiar.

21
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Let's go and take a look.

22
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

23
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

24
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Isn't this a human-faced bird?

25
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This thing almost killed us in the Heaven of the Clouds.

26
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

27
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The one that Chen Wenjin marked

28
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
isn't the place where all the people

29
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
who have close connections with the Taoism Grandmaster?

30
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This human-faced bird

31
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
might be a local specialty.

32
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
When the Taoism Grandmaster

33
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
doesn't know any new friends,

34
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
he will give some to them as a gift.

35
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If that's the case,

36
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
we have to be careful.

37
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This thing is hard to deal with.

38
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

39
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Brother, what did you find?

40
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

41
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
There's a painting.

42
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Look.

43
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This should be the passage.

44
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The two sides of the road

45
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
should be the place of the statue.

46
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes.

47
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Look, there's a human-faced person engraved on it.

48
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And this place

49
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
is where we are now.

50
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
These people seem to be going to the passage.

51
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
There's someone knocking on the door.

52
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It looks like a ceremony.

53
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Since the last week,

54
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
people have been making text and recording information

55
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
on bronze plating.

56
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Such a sculpture

57
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
should have the same function.

58
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We can't see the statue now.

59
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If the information is still there,

60
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
it's more valuable.

61
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
This thing is valuable.

62
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I said it's valuable,

63
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
but I didn't say it's valuable.

64
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

65
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
There's no mechanism.

66
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's just a normal statue.

67
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But there's a hole.

68
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't know what it's for.

69
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The spine of the statue

70
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and two shoulders

71
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
are four holes in total.

72
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Panda, you said...

73
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Panda!

74
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What are you thinking about?

75
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're not thinking

76
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
about the hole, are you?

77
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I always feel

78
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
that the structure of this thing is a bit strange.

79
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's strange that it's not in the right place.

80
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Anyway, we have to be careful.

81
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We've known each other for a long time.

82
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,360
We'll save the life of the

83
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,000
old man this time.

84
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's too quiet.

85
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh.

86
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
There's no movement.

87
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's really too quiet.

88
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Think about it.

89
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This is a rain forest.

90
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
There's no sound of birds.

91
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's not normal.

92
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Being a mother is different.

93
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's very sensitive.

94
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's a pity that your mushroom seed has been broken.

95
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
How about this?

96
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll go in and check the way for the third master.

97
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
If there's nothing else, you can follow me.

98
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll go with you.

99
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'll go with you.

100
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Someone has been tested here.

101
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It seems that someone is the same as us.

102
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Using the same method.

103
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
All right, stop studying.

104
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's definitely the third master.

105
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
These two are the bags of the two unlucky workers.

106
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Everything is packed.

107
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let's go.

108
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Let's go.

109
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Be careful.

110
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The next one.

111
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I said you did it on purpose.

112
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The key is to save your life.

113
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
This room will be exposed to light.

114
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It will be blinded by the light.

115
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Do you want the sunglasses?

116
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm so kind.

117
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Please sell it.

118
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
No need.

119
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm so kind.

120
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I said you did it on purpose.

121
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
There are many ways to use the stick.

122
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's called the dog-hunting method.

123
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You said that, does that count?

124
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Dogs are pretty good, aren't they?

125
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
They are good friends of humans.

126
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You have a lot of experience.

127
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Go find a way to open the door.

128
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
How is it?

129
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
This...

130
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
should be a mouse's leg bone.

131
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Not bad, Pan.

132
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You know this?

133
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I've eaten it before.

134
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Pan...

135
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
If you're in that kind of environment,

136
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
you should eat it too.

137
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm not a mouse.

138
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm a dog.

139
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm a dog.

140
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm a dog.

141
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm a dog.

142
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm a dog.

143
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You should eat it too.

144
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Do you think there are living human birds in this statue?

145
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
These bones...

146
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
are they the only ones left?

147
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
They should be some kind of food.

148
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's okay.

149
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
If they are some kind of beast,

150
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
it's like they're giving us a meal.

151
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Tell Little Third Master and the others to come here.

152
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
There shouldn't be any danger here.

153
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Little Third Master!

154
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Come here!

155
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I can do it myself.

156
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The pictures on this statue...

157
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
don't look like anything different from the first statue.

158
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
There are still people walking in.

159
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
If these pictures were all recorded,

160
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
how could they be the same?

161
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This is too strange.

162
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
This statue is fresh.

163
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Wild animals...

164
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
won't eat it after killing the prey.

165
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I know!

166
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Think about it.

167
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The breeding technique is not good.

168
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
This place...

169
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
is probably a hunting ground...

170
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
to hunt for the queen mother.

171
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The queen mother...

172
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
might have some high-level hunting skills.

173
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
She can kill the prey.

174
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
For example, using...

175
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
the bow, the bow, the bow...

176
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
or these statues.

177
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Fatty, I'm having a headache listening to you.

178
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You have a headache because you got blocked by the factory.

179
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Pull it up.

180
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's dead.

181
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's dead.

182
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That's strange.

183
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Look at what I said.

184
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The queen mother...

185
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
can kill the prey.

186
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I think...

187
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
there must be something...

188
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
that has an effect on the animals.

189
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The animals are sensitive.

190
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Sometimes, they can't feel it.

191
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But the animals can.

192
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Fatty, are you okay?

193
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I have a headache.

194
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
In this rain,

195
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
the pressure is low.

196
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The ground is narrow.

197
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The people have been waiting for a long time.

198
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
They can't stand it.

199
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The stones fell down.

200
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Fortunately, the rocks on both sides are solid.

201
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The entrance is blocked.

202
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Let's leave here.

203
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Your ears are quite sharp.

204
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You can't lose to me.

205
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Your eyes are good.

206
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The queen mother is different from others.

207
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Just now,

208
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
it was all about the house.

209
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
How could she be blind?

210
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
She's not only beautiful,

211
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
but also can kill people.

212
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
This is a kind of...

213
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
behavior art.

214
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But she didn't expect that...

215
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
you blackmailed me and took all the equipment.

216
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's all in vain.

217
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Are you okay?

218
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You got a cold?

219
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I don't just have a headache.

220
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
My heart is getting worse.

221
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Pan Zi, hold on.

222
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Xiao Ge, Fatty.

223
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Leave the statue.

224
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
We can't go on.

225
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Two people fell down.

226
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
The rest...

227
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
are in the middle.

228
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Let's go.

229
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Isn't this the place...

230
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
where they are?

231
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The person who knocked the drum...

232
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
is different from the first statue.

233
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Ting Zhen,

234
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
do you think she looks like...

235
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Lian Huan Hua?

236
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It makes sense.

237
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The paintings on the first two statues...

238
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
are too subtle.

239
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The people here...

240
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
are clearly moving forward.

241
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Xiao Ge is right.

242
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
We can't go on.

243
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Otherwise, we'll be like the people on the painting.

244
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
We'll faint.

245
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
We can't get out alive.

246
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Look at this.

247
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Doesn't it look like a altar?

248
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
An altar?

249
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What is an altar?

250
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Where are the people?

251
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The dead.

252
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
They were in the police.

253
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
So, we're going to...

254
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Huangquan Road.

255
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
How do they die?

256
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Pan Zi is right.

257
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The reaction of animals...

258
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
is stronger than that of people.

259
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Let's go see the dead bird.

260
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
There are two kinds of injuries.

261
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Internal and external.

262
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
The bird died like a specimen.

263
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It must be internal injury.

264
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's not that serious.

265
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's hard to say.

266
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The best way is...

267
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
to check.

268
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Me?

269
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

270
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The loser will have to check.

271
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

272
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Go, go, go.

273
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Looks like the people from Wu San Xing...

274
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
have been through these organs.

275
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
But we should be careful.

276
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
A palace like this...

277
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
is not a one-off.

278
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's not important if it's one-off.

279
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's a flying sword.

280
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What a coincidence.

281
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
When did you get it?

282
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Why did you get it?

283
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It doesn't matter when I got it.

284
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What matters is what it's used for.

285
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Isn't this useful?

286
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Is this how it started?

287
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
To be continued

288
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You're the only one who claims to be the master of the martial arts.

289
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Very skilled.

290
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Many people want to hire you.

291
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Young man, you look down on me.

292
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
In that case, let's make a bet.

293
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The bird ate the explosive.

294
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The internal organs are all blown up.

295
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Xiao Ke, Xiao Ke.

296
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Xiao Ke is also hit.

297
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Let's go back and sit for a while.

298
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Let's go.

299
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Sit down first.

300
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Come, come, sit here.

301
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Wu Xie

302
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Xiao Sun Yan

303
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I said Wu Xie, you have to hold on.

304
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I can't do it alone.

305
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Think about it.

306
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What happened?

307
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yes, yes, yes.

308
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Think about it.

309
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Think about it.

310
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Think about it.

311
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The air.

312
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yes, the air.

313
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
No.

314
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Why am I okay?

315
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'll think about it.

316
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll think about it.

317
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Think about it.

318
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Think about it.

319
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Sound.

320
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Sound.

321
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
No.

322
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I didn't hear anything.

323
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
What else?

324
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What else?

325
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Light.

326
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
No, no, no.

327
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Fatty.

328
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What's wrong with the bird you just saw?

329
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
That...

330
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That bird has no wounds at all.

331
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But all the internal organs are blown up.

332
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
The internal organs are blown up?

333
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Under such extreme conditions,

334
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
what happened to the water,

335
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
the outer space,

336
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
that can cause that explosion

337
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
is just a strong impact

338
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
or a serious earthquake.

339
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
But

340
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
if something

341
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
is so powerful,

342
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
we can't have no feeling at all.

343
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Is there anything that is colorless

344
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
and not being detected by people,

345
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
but it hurts people?

346
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Then there is only the sound of the wire.

347
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
No.

348
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
When I was in the army,

349
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I heard that the wire was a weapon

350
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
that could be heard

351
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
but could also cause internal vibration.

352
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Now, in such a situation,

353
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
it's good to be dizzy and have a cold.

354
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
But when it causes internal vibration,

355
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
people are completely dead.

356
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Wire.

357
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Wire.

358
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
What is this?

359
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
What can cause internal vibration?

360
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
What is this?

361
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
This is a plant.

362
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Only those statues are made by humans.

363
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
A hole.

364
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You said the statues are those four holes.

365
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I just felt that those holes were wrong.

366
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
These human birds,

367
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
even if they cause internal vibration,

368
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
they still need an exit.

369
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I think

370
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
it's very possible that those holes

371
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
are blocked.

372
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Hurry up.

373
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yes, yes, yes.

374
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Block it.

375
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Block it.

376
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I don't know if this trick works.

377
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It works.

378
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's good, Pan Zi.

379
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
The magnetic waves are not easy to dissipate.

380
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Blocking these holes

381
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
can only prevent these plant jams

382
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
from producing new magnetic waves.

383
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
We have to leave as soon as possible.

384
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
At least not like the people on the painting.

385
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
If we don't go,

386
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
we'll die.

387
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
There are many hatches ahead.

388
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
There should be many mechanisms.

389
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Then we will compare

390
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
who finds the method of triggering the mechanism first.

391
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
The more you find, the more you win.

392
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
According to your habit,

393
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
how much money should the loser send?

394
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It's vulgar to send money in advance.

395
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
We are comparing dignity and professionalism.

396
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
But if we don't bet money,

397
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
whoever loses will

398
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
take off his pants.

399
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Anyway, the person who takes off his pants

400
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
is definitely not me.

401
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Anyway, it's not me.

402
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I'll send you the one just now.

403
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It's me.

404
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Look.

405
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
The end of this road

406
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
should be the altar.

407
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
There are many animal bodies

408
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
along the way.

409
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It seems that the magnetic waves here

410
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
are really powerful.

411
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Those living objects on the painting

412
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
will be dead

413
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
when they get to the altar.

414
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
We have also

415
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
been a memorial.

416
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Right?

417
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It's so cruel.

418
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
This is really a dead end.

419
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
This way.

420
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Let's go.

421
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Let's go.

422
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Brother, let's take a break.

423
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Slow down.

424
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
How is he?

425
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
He can't die.

426
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Look, what did I say?

427
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It's so cruel.

428
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Pan Zi,

429
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
this human is so powerful.

430
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It's a magnetic wave.

431
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's a low-pitched sound.

432
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Some things

433
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
absorb normal sound

434
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and then turn into magnetic waves.

435
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
The louder the sound,

436
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
the stronger the magnetic wave.

437
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
No wonder there are drumming scenes

438
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
on the painting.

439
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Those sculptures

440
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
are probably the material.

441
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It may also be the internal structure.

442
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
In short,

443
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
these drumming sounds

444
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
can be converted into magnetic waves.

445
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
That's why the living objects

446
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
die halfway

447
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
while walking.

448
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It seems that

449
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
the explosion sound

450
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
produced by the explosion

451
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
provided the sound source

452
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
to these sculptures.

453
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It's probably like this.

454
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
If you usually thunder,

455
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
those sculptures

456
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
can also absorb the transformation.

457
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
The bones of the animals on the road

458
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
are probably like this.

459
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
But I have a question

460
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
that I don't understand.

461
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Why are you all busy?

462
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm fine.

463
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah,

464
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
probably because you're fat.

465
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Nonsense.

466
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
In fact,

467
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
the principle of magnetic waves

468
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
is mainly based on internal resonance.

469
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
The key is the heart.

470
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So,

471
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
the better the body,

472
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
the stronger the symptoms.

473
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
You're fine, right?

474
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Are you all right?

475
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You're all right, right?

476
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Fatty, I'm back to normal now.

477
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Go.

478
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Go, go.

479
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Go.

480
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Let's go.

481
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Go, go, go.

482
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Wait a minute.

483
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Fatty, I and Jianing

484
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
were supposed to go with Xiao Ge.

485
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I didn't expect

486
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
there were so many problems

487
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
along the way.

488
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
We didn't contact

489
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Third Master.

490
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Let's just

491
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
get in touch with him earlier

492
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
to avoid his worries.

493
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Tianzhen,

494
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
if you're worried,

495
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
just say it.

496
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Look at you and your uncle.

497
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You're always nagging me.

498
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
This is the smoke

499
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
used to save the sea at that time, right?

500
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It's not easy to get this thing.

501
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Wu Sanxing is still capable.

502
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
How come the smoke is yellow?

503
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Is there anything special?

504
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yellow means

505
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
danger ahead.

506
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Be careful.

507
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And other colors

508
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
mean different things.

509
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Who knows if he will stand on the beach?

510
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Don't worry.

511
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
According to the time agreed,

512
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Third Master may already

513
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
be near the rain forest.

514
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And our survival

515
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
is enough to burn him

516
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
for three or four hours.

517
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
We can definitely wait

518
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
for Third Master's reply.

519
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
What?

520
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I won't buy it.

521
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I said you're a real blind or a fake blind?

522
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
We can't wait any longer.

523
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Let's go.

524
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
The rain forest climate changes a lot.

525
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
We have to find a safe place to camp.

526
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Let's go.

527
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Let's set off.

528
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Let's meet with Third Master's team.

529
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I haven't recovered yet.

530
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
This woman

531
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
is a cruel person.

532
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'm sorry.

533
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Turn off the flashlight.

534
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Why?

535
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Just do as I said.

536
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And then?

537
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I'll do it.

538
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Just make a bet.

539
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
What's the point?

540
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Two to one.

541
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
As for the pants,

542
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
don't take them off.

543
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
No.

544
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I'm a man of my word.

545
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I'm willing to bet and accept defeat.

546
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I'm going to take them off.

547
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I'm going to take them off.

548
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Find a room.

549
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You go over there.

550
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Okay.

551
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It's not good to have snakes in such a place.

552
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
It's still useful to clean the snake.

553
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Be careful.

554
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Wu Xie.

555
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Do you remember the words

556
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
written on Chen Wenjing's notebook?

557
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You're looking for snakes.

558
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I won't go.

559
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Hurry up.

560
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
We must find a place to hide before dark.

561
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Let's go.

562
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Come here.

563
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Are you crazy?

564
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You're being watched.

565
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Hurry up.

566
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Look.

567
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
There shouldn't be a painting here for no reason.

568
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It should be

569
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
the mechanism to open the door.

570
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
It's not a painting.

571
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It's a painting.

572
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
It's a painting.

573
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It's the mechanism to open the door.

574
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Looking at it,

575
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
only those eyes

576
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
are worth exploring.

577
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Using your hands?

578
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Yes.

579
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It's easier to use than any tool.

580
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
You find it first.

581
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You go.

582
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
You're going to give up now?

583
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
In the worst case scenario,

584
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
this is precious water resources.

585
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
If you don't give up, you go.

586
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Okay.

587
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Then I'll let you know

588
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
what professionalism is.

589
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Take it.

590
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I got it.

591
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Is this the core of the Xiwu Mugong?

592
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You'll know when you go in.

593
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Here.

594
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Drink it all.

595
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Look at you guys.

596
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You haven't taken a few steps.

597
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
You're all sticky.

598
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Come on.

599
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I'll give you a speech.

600
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I'll sing a song for you and dance a dance.

601
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Stop.

602
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
We've been tortured physically.

603
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Mentally,

604
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
we can't take the blame

605
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
for your broken throat.

606
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Nonsense.

607
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
It's your fortune

608
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
to see me sing and dance.

609
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You've been training for eight lifetimes.

610
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It's raining.

611
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Yes.

612
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
It's getting lower and lower.

613
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
It's going to rain heavily.

614
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Find a place to shelter.

615
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I'll go with you.

616
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
This Xiwu Mugong

617
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
is really something.

618
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
To build a palace,

619
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
The whole mountain is empty.

620
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
It seems that in this low temperature space,

621
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
the lamp oil has not been evaporated.

622
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
The light is too hot to trigger the mechanism.

623
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
The new king's idea is good.

624
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Wash hands.

625
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Wash hands?

626
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Wash hands?

627
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Wu San Xing, this old guy,

628
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
really knows how to think and prepare.

629
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
He doesn't even leave a mark now.

630
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
He left this behind.

631
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
San is not a troublemaker.

632
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Because he,

633
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
the way to trigger the mechanism is the same as us.

634
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
But he is more thoughtful than the young people.

635
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I'll go first.

636
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Don't be so particular when you're out.

637
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I'm going to go.

638
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Look at this painting.

639
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
It seems that someone came to see the queen mother.

640
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Interesting.

641
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Look, this guest and the queen mother are in the same body.

642
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
But the other people are smaller in proportion.

643
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
The larger the proportion, the higher the status of the identity.

644
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It seems that this person

645
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
has a lot of face in the queen mother.

646
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
The painting is beautiful.

647
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It's probably the clothes of the royal family in the west.

648
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
King of Zhou Mu?

649
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
In the painting,

650
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
the queen mother and king of Zhou Mu

651
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
are looking for people who are not old enough to live.

652
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
In the book,

653
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
there is a love story of them.

654
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I think it's a good idea to

655
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
let the queen mother and king of Zhou Mu

656
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
know the identity of the king.

657
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I think it's a good idea to let the queen mother and king of Zhou Mu

658
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
know the identity of the king.

659
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
We are so far apart.

660
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You will come again in the future.

661
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
When I return to the East,

662
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I will come to see you again

663
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
after I have ruled the country.

664
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
The legend or the truth that remains

665
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
can only be related to the queen mother.

666
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Only Zhou Mu.

667
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
The biggest feeling on this road

668
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
is that this queen mother

669
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
is definitely a cruel character.

670
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And she is very strong.

671
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Look at her palace.

672
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
There is no one to guide us.

673
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
It's hard to get here alive.

674
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Obviously, we have to tell the guests here

675
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
that if they don't behave,

676
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
they will die.

677
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Look at those lights.

678
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
These are all western style.

679
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
This shows

680
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
that she is not only polite to king of Zhou Mu,

681
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
but also accepts the culture she brings.

682
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Maybe it's because

683
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
king of Zhou Mu brought her some benefits.

684
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Let's go up and see.

685
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
The King of Zhou Mu

686
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
You are so kind.

687
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I will buy you a meal.

688
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
No need.

689
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
The King of Zhou Mu

690
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
You are so kind. I will buy you a meal.

691
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
No need.

692
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Brother.

693
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Brother, why are you so tall?

694
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Walking to you

695
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,960
Don't turn back

696
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,960
The distant time

697
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,960
We met

698
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,960
It's like we are the same family.

699
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,660
O.K.

700
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,660
I'm sorry.

701
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,660
I'm sorry.

702
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,660
I'm sorry.

703
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,660
I'm sorry.

704
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,660
I'm sorry.

705
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,660
I'm sorry.

706
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,660
I'm sorry.

707
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,660
I'm sorry.

708
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,660
I'm sorry.

709
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,660
I'm sorry.

710
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,660
I'm sorry.

711
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,660
I'm sorry.

712
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,660
I'm sorry.

713
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,660
I'm sorry.

714
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,660
I'm sorry.

715
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,660
I'm sorry.

716
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,660
I'm sorry.

717
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,660
I'm sorry.

718
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,660
I'm sorry.

719
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,660
I'm sorry.

720
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,660
I'm sorry.

721
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,660
I'm sorry.

722
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,660
I'm sorry.

723
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,660
I'm sorry.

724
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,660
I'm sorry.

725
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:40,660
I'm sorry.

726
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,660
I'm sorry.

727
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,660
I'm sorry.

728
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:43,660
I'm sorry.

729
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,660
We have to find a safe place to stay.

730
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,660
Wu Xie.

731
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,660
Do you remember what Chen Wenjing wrote in the notebook?

732
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,660
Give it to me.

733
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,660
Give it to me.

734
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,660
Make the pants bigger.

735
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:08,660
Don't spill it.

736
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,660
Give me the bag.

737
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:20,660
Okay, I won't touch it.

738
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,660
Look at this palace.

739
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,660
If no one is in,

740
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:42,660
we can't live.
