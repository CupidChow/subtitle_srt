1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,960
I am not a fool.

2
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,960
I am a fool.

3
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,040
I am a fool.

4
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,120
I am a fool.

5
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
I am a fool.

6
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,280
I am a fool.

7
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,360
I am a fool.

8
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,440
I am a fool.

9
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,520
I am a fool.

10
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,600
I am a fool.

11
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,680
I am a fool.

12
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,760
I am a fool.

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,840
I am a fool.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,920
I am a fool.

15
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:49,440
The

16
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,920
สॉ

17
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
Fudiu.

18
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,440
You go and check the equipment.

19
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,640
Tianzhen, it's your business.

20
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,680
Tian'who is that?

21
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,800
Here you are.

22
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,680
Ourever anarmonLEY Amanda,

23
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,440
and she has the one with the beHA mining Putin.

24
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,960
He looks like a person from the beatias.

25
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,880
This check..

26
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,760
just said please.

27
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,120
Many people worship him.

28
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,120
Look at this one.

29
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,680
This one is much clearer.

30
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,560
This one should be a battlefield scene.

31
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,000
These people dressed up

32
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,440
should be from the Western Kingdom.

33
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,120
But from the battleground,

34
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,320
the Western Kingdom is losing.

35
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,320
Can you see who the Western Kingdom is fighting with?

36
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,760
I can't see it.

37
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,760
But the enemy should be a very powerful civilization.

38
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,720
Look at this one.

39
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,240
The Western Kingdom has poured something

40
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,480
into the tower before.

41
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,000
Then the snakes crawled out

42
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,720
and fought with the enemy.

43
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,720
It seems that the wild chicken's neck is a warrior.

44
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,920
Not only that,

45
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,720
look at the city structure on the statue.

46
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,840
It's all connected to the city.

47
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,760
The snakes can roam around the passage

48
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,000
and be lured by people.

49
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,680
Once they are in danger,

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,120
they use something to lure the snakes out to fight the enemy.

51
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,880
This is a well-designed defense method.

52
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,440
This kind of snake is poisonous and fast.

53
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,840
No one can stop it.

54
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,560
Let's go to Brother Xiao's place and have a look.

55
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,280
This one?

56
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,400
This one looks quite harmonious.

57
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,520
This one looks quite harmonious.

58
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,680
This one should be a very high-ranking person.

59
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,240
He is sitting on a eight-horse carriage

60
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,840
and coming to the Western Kingdom.

61
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,520
I understand.

62
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,120
This carriage is a typical Western-style horse.

63
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,440
It is said that

64
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,880
King of Zhou Mu led the Seven-year-old to the Western Kingdom

65
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,640
and sat down with Queen Mother.

66
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,120
He was looking for a long-term solution.

67
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,320
You are quite good, Tianzhen.

68
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,640
You are quite capable.

69
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,240
I have done a lot of business in the past.

70
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,280
I am quite familiar with these things.

71
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,680
I think the number of snakes

72
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,680
is much more than the population.

73
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,520
The one on the statue

74
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,560
should be a double-legged horse.

75
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,120
It is fighting with the wild animals here.

76
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,560
When King of Zhou Mu was alive,

77
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,040
there were two types of snakes here.

78
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,440
So, this double-legged horse

79
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,560
should be a wild animal.

80
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,160
It is a snake.

81
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,960
A snake?

82
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,840
That's exciting.

83
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,600
A mixed snake.

84
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,640
These are two different types of snakes.

85
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,160
And they are of different sizes.

86
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,000
I understand.

87
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,800
Fatty, do you know what a treasure is?

88
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,040
I know.

89
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,720
Do you think that treasure is the same as the one in ancient times?

90
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,200
Treasure is a bird.

91
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,680
In ancient times, people thought that

92
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,800
there were only porcini birds and no parrots.

93
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,560
But it is not true.

94
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,560
This is because parrots are several times bigger than porcini birds.

95
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,640
So, it is mistakenly thought to be two different birds.

96
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,200
Spring has come.

97
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,120
Everything has been restored.

98
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,920
It is the season for animals to return to life.

99
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,040
No.

100
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,760
Wait.

101
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,720
This is not a snake.

102
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
What is this?

103
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,720
Is it a dragon?

104
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,440
It has grown so big.

105
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,000
How can it be a snake?

106
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,480
Look.

107
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
These snakes

108
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,040
are not hanging around this double-legged horse.

109
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,800
They are helping it.

110
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,840
So, the real pair

111
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,360
is this one.

112
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,480
The real pair

113
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,240
is this double-legged horse

114
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,720
and this big snake.

115
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,040
It is indeed a social snake.

116
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,160
This thing

117
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,640
should be the snake mother that I guessed.

118
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,400
It has been three or four thousand years since the talisman was carved.

119
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,480
If there was a snake mother like you,

120
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,320
it would have been a fossil.

121
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Help!

122
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Mother!

123
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,840
Is it you?

124
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,320
Don't worry about me.

125
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,040
Let's go after the man in the mud.

126
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,280
Let's go.

127
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Mother!

128
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,160
Don't run. We are good people, not rascals.

129
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,280
Don't come near me.

130
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Mother!

131
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
Tianzhen.

132
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,240
Tianzhen, are you okay?

133
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
What do you think?

134
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,720
You can't blame me.

135
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,520
If I had picked you up,

136
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,080
we would have been dead.

137
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Where is the man?

138
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,960
He disappeared when I fell.

139
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,760
Let's look for him.

140
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
Fatso.

141
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,680
Do you think he is a human?

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes.

143
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,640
Let's go and check.

144
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Why is it him?

145
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
You know him?

146
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,960
He is your uncle's man.

147
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,880
It seems that something happened to him.

148
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,520
Let's see if there is any clue about him.

149
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,360
Oh, no.

150
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Don't throw it.

151
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,960
Take it back to the camp and try to repair it.

152
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,760
Tianzhen, look.

153
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,560
There is someone there.

154
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,360
I don't know who he is.

155
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
I don't know who he is.

156
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Pinch him.

157
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
'

158
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,540
Sir.

159
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,540
How did he look like citizens?

160
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,300
Put holy fire in your eyes

161
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,800
Just a sarcasm.

162
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,140
Tell the same story.

163
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,220
Wait and see, Bin-ja.

164
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,880
How can I tell the same story?

165
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,880
I'll help you.

166
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
Okay.

167
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,880
Thank god.

168
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,880
I told you.

169
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
How can he die so easily?

170
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Take it.

171
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,880
Maybe you can use it.

172
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,880
It's better than nothing.

173
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
Let me tell you.

174
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
Last time, me and Xiao Ge

175
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,880
got you.

176
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
Good guy.

177
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,880
You're a great teacher.

178
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,880
This time,

179
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
we're very lucky.

180
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,880
You won't be so mean.

181
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,880
When did I ever...

182
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880
Stop talking.

183
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,880
Shut your mouth.

184
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,880
Take the knife.

185
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Don't look at me.

186
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
Go to hell.

187
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Go to hell.

188
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
You scared me.

189
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,880
I told you.

190
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,880
The corpse can't be taken down.

191
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,880
It's not good.

192
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,880
Let's go.

193
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,880
Something's wrong.

194
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
Of course.

195
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
It's not good.

196
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
He won't die in such a short time.

197
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,880
Stop.

198
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Stop.

199
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,880
Stop.

200
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,880
It's dangerous.

201
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Stop.

202
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
Stop.

203
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
It's dangerous.

204
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Stop.

205
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Stop.

206
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
Stop.

207
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
Stop.

208
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
I'm sorry.

209
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
Aniang.

210
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,880
Aniang is in the same situation as them.

211
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
But why did they bring her here?

212
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,880
It's so dark and cold here.

213
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
I know.

214
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,880
It's a place to store food.

215
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
Maybe this is a big food storage.

216
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,880
Wu Xie.

217
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Naughty boy, I'm talking to you.

218
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
Can't you hear me?

219
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Aniang.

220
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,880
It's really her.

221
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
She shouldn't have died in this place.

222
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,880
It seems that the person who was in the tree before was Aniang.

223
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,880
I always thought that people like Aniang wouldn't die.

224
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
At least she wouldn't be bitten by a snake.

225
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,880
The snake is so far away.

226
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
It moved the body here.

227
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
It seems that the body was moved here.

228
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
It's not a big deal.

229
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
It's just a small wound.

230
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
It's not a big deal.

231
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
It's just a small wound.

232
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,880
It seems that this is a food storage.

233
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
When we get to the restaurant,

234
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
we'll just send her to the door.

235
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
It won't be a door.

236
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
She can still move when she's driven like this.

237
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
She can still follow us.

238
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
Oh no, she's calling her partner.

239
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Where is she?

240
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
You're half way there.

241
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,880
You're still calling her.

242
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
I'm calling you.

243
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,880
I'm calling you.

244
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
Fatty, can you stop talking?

245
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,880
I'm so angry that I'm going to catch you.

246
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
Wu Xie, run!

247
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Where is Pan Tian?

248
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
You can't run away with her.

249
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
I'll take her to the snake and we'll meet later.

250
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
Fatty!

251
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
Hurry up!

252
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
Come on!

253
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Come and get me!

254
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,880
Come on!

255
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
Come on!

256
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,880
Come on!

257
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,880
Fatty!

258
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
Let's go.

259
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
I'll distract her first.

260
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,880
I'll come back to pick you up later.

261
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
I'll come back to pick you up later.

262
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
Stop!

263
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
Come here!

264
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
Come on!

265
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
Why isn't she moving?

266
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,880
She has to be�

267
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,880
Oh no, your mouth is so loud.

268
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,880
You're awesome!

269
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,880
Hey!

270
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,000
You bastard! You're so mean!

271
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,200
Where are you going?

272
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,920
How dare you try to kill me?

273
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,600
I must teach you a lesson!

274
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,600
Motherfucker!

275
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,040
Bring it.

276
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,000
It's a

277
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,140
Fat?

278
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,280
Fat.

279
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
Come on.

280
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,120
Fatso, are you okay?

281
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,480
Ani, I'm sorry.

282
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,280
I'm going to save my brother.

283
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
Fatso!

284
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,880
Fatso!

285
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
Fatso!

286
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
Fatso, wake up!

287
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,880
Fatso!

288
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,880
Blood, blood, blood.

289
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
He's still alive.

290
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Cheng Ziting,

291
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,880
I'll save you if you wake up.

292
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
I'll go back with you.

293
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
I'll go with you.

294
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,880
I'll go with you.

295
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
I'll go with you.

296
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
I'll go with you.

297
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
I'll go with you.

298
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
I'll go with you.

299
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,880
I'll go with you.

300
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
Fatso.

301
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
Fatso,

302
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,880
you must be strong.

303
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
I'll take you home.

304
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
Fatso,

305
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
you must lose weight

306
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
when you go back.

307
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
Fatso,

308
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
it's impossible to go back.

309
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,880
I'll find a way to take you back to the camp.

310
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,880
Fatso,

311
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
are you okay?

312
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,880
What is that in your stomach?

313
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,880
It must have been poisoned.

314
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,880
Is it bad?

315
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
I'll go get some water.

316
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,880
I'll go get some water.

317
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,880
Okay.

318
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
Let's go.

319
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
Go.

320
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,880
Go.

321
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,920
What is this,喝 stoves?

322
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,140
Rowels?

323
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,700
Liar!

324
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,740
What are you doing, take out the rope.

325
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,240
Bullshit.

326
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,140
Is somebody with the

327
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,880
S shepherd.

328
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,900
So,

329
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,640
It's not a good thing.

330
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,120
It's a bad thing.

331
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,200
Let's go. I'll take you back to the camp.

332
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,640
You go find Xiao Ge.

333
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,920
You go find Pan Zi.

334
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,920
Let's go.

335
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,240
Xiao Ge.

336
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
You're leaving?

337
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,680
In three days, someone will pick you up.

338
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,640
Take care of Little Third Master for me.

339
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,520
Xiao Ge.

340
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,440
You're not going to find Little Third Master, are you?

341
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,440
Take care, Xiao Ge.

342
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,880
Take care, Xiao Ge.

343
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Come on.

344
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,440
Boss, this is not a high place.

345
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,040
We still have three or four meters.

346
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,000
We'll be there as soon as we reach the cliff.

347
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,240
Never mind.

348
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,480
Let's go.

349
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,360
Hold on.

350
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,000
Crap!

351
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,660
Fatty, I promise you.

352
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,260
I will work my body on this trip back home.

353
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,900
I'll try my best to be able to make 200 Johnny's Fatty tiger könnten ser clumsy Ooh.

354
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,240
Fatso!

355
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Too many acquaintances

356
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
Fatso

357
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,240
Fatso

358
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,240
You've arrived

359
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,240
Get in.

360
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,240
There is no time.

361
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
Wu Xie hasn't come yet.

362
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,240
I have already lured him here.

363
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,240
If he doesn't have the ability to get in,

364
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,240
it means that we have all wronged him.

365
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
Fatty!

366
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,240
Fatty!

367
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Fatty!

368
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
Don't go.

369
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,240
Don't go.

370
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,240
Don't go.

371
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,240
Don't go.

372
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
Fatty!

373
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,240
Don't scare me.

374
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,240
Fatty!

375
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
This water is too fast.

376
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,240
It's hard to control.

377
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,240
What's going on?

378
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
The water stopped.

379
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,240
It looks like there is a gap on the sword.

380
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,240
When the gap is opened,

381
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,240
a whirlpool appears on the river.

382
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,240
The water is transferred to here.

383
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,240
So, this is a reservoir.

384
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,240
When the water is full,

385
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,240
the gap is automatically closed.

386
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,240
I don't know what to do.

387
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,240
I have to find a way to get out of here.

388
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,240
I have to find a way to get out of here.

389
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,240
I have to find a way to get out of here.

390
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,240
I have to find a way to get out of here.

391
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,240
And it would be a a great shame.

392
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,240
Handle them well!

393
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm in a hurry and can't even measure myself

394
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,840
How can I go down?

395
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,480
I don't have any equipment

396
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,720
Even if I have, I can't do it

397
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,360
Besides, my medicine is afraid of water

398
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,520
Medicine? What medicine?

399
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,880
I almost went blind

400
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,320
I'm lucky that my father used a medicine for my eyes

401
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,640
It's a half-year-old water

402
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,240
You're blind, dirty

403
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
Are you ready?

404
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,640
Water

405
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,320
This is the water running band you talk about

406
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,200
It's endless

407
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,600
You have to be prepared.

408
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,560
Sanjeev, be careful.

409
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,080
Everyone, get ready.

410
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,120
blir

411
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,920
What is this ignored

412
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,580
Dead

413
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,280
Are you ready Hey

414
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:42,800
Are you ready

415
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,520
Are you ready

416
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,040
Are you ready

417
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,780
Are you ready

418
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,780
Oh,

419
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:49,780
I'm not the only one who has a bad eye.

420
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,780
Shut up.

421
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,780
Okay, listen to me.

422
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,780
The water is not deep,

423
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,780
but it's all from the dust particles that are coming from the ground.

424
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,780
There's a possibility of snakes.

425
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,780
Be careful.

426
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,780
Spread out and clean the road.

427
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,780
I'll go over there.

428
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,780
I'll go over here.

429
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,780
Sanye,

430
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,780
where are we going?

431
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,780
You decide.

432
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,780
Let's go.

433
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,780
Look at the direction of the water flow.

434
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,780
We should be able to get out of here.

435
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,780
Great, Fatty.

436
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,780
We have a direction.

437
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,780
I told you.

438
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,780
We can definitely get out.

439
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,780
Who is it?

440
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,780
Who is it?

441
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,780
Who is it?

442
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,780
You called me Sanye?

443
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,780
Are you a member of the Third Uncle?

444
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,780
Who are you?

445
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,780
Who are you?

446
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,780
Who are you?

447
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,780
You called me Sanye?

448
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,780
Are you a member of the Third Uncle?

449
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,780
You are indeed a member of the Third Uncle.

450
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,780
Brother.

451
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,780
Brother.

452
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,780
Brother.

453
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,780
No.

454
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,780
This person is dead.

455
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,780
It must be the snakes.

456
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,780
No.

457
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,780
Oh no.

458
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,780
You lost the powder.

459
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,780
I'll beat you to pulp.

460
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,780
It's not you.

461
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,780
You are a snake.

462
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,780
How did this snake kill a person?

463
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,780
I'm the one who spoke.

464
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,780
Who is it?

465
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,780
Brother?

466
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,780
Where did I put that tooth?

467
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,780
Xiao Huang?

468
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,780
Why are you here?

469
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,780
Hurry up and go.

470
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,780
No.

471
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,780
This guy is moving the soldiers.

472
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,780
Hurry up.

473
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,780
Who is it?

474
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,780
Fatty.

475
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,780
Fatty.

476
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,780
Fatty is missing.

477
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,780
Don't worry.

478
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,780
Someone is working.

479
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,780
He is safe.

480
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,780
Hurry up and go.

481
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,780
Come on.

482
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,780
Third Uncle.

483
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,780
You rascal.

484
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,780
Why are you so disobedient?

485
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,780
Go.

486
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,780
I...

487
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,780
I didn't kick him.

488
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,780
Guqin.

489
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,780
What are you pretending?

490
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,780
What are you doing?

491
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,780
I'm saving your life.

492
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,780
Be good.

493
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,780
You have a lot of money on your back.

494
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,780
Go.

495
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,780
Hold him.

496
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,780
Here.

497
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,780
Hold this.

498
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,780
Go.

499
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,780
Go.

500
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,780
Hurry up and save him.

501
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,780
You know it too.

502
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,780
You won't listen to me.

503
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,780
Didn't I tell you?

504
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,780
It's dangerous here.

505
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,780
Don't go.

506
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,780
You don't know the rules.

507
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,780
You still don't understand.

508
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,780
If you weren't my nephew,

509
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,780
I would have killed you.

510
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,780
If you weren't my third uncle,

511
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,780
would I have followed you?

512
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,780
Do you know how many people I've met

513
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,780
who were bitten by snakes?

514
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,780
Every time I turn my body,

515
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,780
I'm afraid of you.

516
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,780
We've also met the snake.

517
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,780
What about you?

518
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,780
Why didn't the rascals follow us?

519
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,780
We also met the horse in the rain forest.

520
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,780
The rascals were badly injured

521
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,780
in order to save us.

522
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,780
Later, we went to your camp

523
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,780
and met the snake.

524
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,780
We left the rascals in the temple.

525
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,780
Don't worry.

526
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,780
Brother Xiao is watching us.

527
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,780
How did you and Fatty get here?

528
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,780
We met a man who was covered in mud.

529
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,780
He kept following us.

530
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,780
Later, Fatty and I met in the camp.

531
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,780
We didn't catch him.

532
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,780
Instead, we were chased by water.

533
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,780
Mud?

534
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,780
But he didn't mean to harm us.

535
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,780
So Fatty and I think he's...

536
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,780
We also guessed wrong.

537
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,780
Kid, what did you guess?

538
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,780
I've said so much.

539
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,780
It's your turn.

540
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,780
Listen.

541
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,780
There's something moving.

542
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,780
What's that?

543
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,780
You're changing the subject again.

544
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,780
Attention, everyone.

545
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,780
This place is not safe.

546
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,780
Clean it up.

547
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,780
We'll set off in a while.

548
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,780
You said he did it on purpose.

549
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,780
On purpose?

550
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,780
He did it on purpose?

551
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,780
He definitely did it on purpose.

552
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,780
Master Hua, what's your order?

553
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,780
Nothing.

554
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,780
Master Hua, didn't you just call me?

555
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,780
If you have any questions, don't be polite.

556
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,780
I didn't call you.

557
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,780
Take your hands off.

558
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,780
Master Hua, then...

559
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,780
You go ahead.

560
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,780
Master Hua!

561
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,780
Master Hua!

562
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,780
Come on, stand up.

563
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,780
Thank God!

564
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,780
I told you, the mountain is not as big as it is.

565
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,780
Shut up!

566
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,780
What's wrong?

567
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,780
Take your hands off!

568
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,780
Don't look at me!

569
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,780
Take your hands off!

570
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,780
Don't look at me!

571
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,780
Don't look at me!
