1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The King Of Blaze

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
When you come back,

3
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
there will be a pair of horses

4
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
who will beat the drum and grab the welcome.

5
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
How about it?

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's not bad, right?

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Brother Huang.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The King Of Blaze

9
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That smell again.

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Comrade Hema.

11
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Comrade Hema.

12
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Comrade Hema.

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What?

14
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Comrade Xiao Chen.

15
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Comrade Hema.

16
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Comrade Xiao Chen.

17
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The King Of Blaze

18
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Who is he?

19
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Is he Wu Xie?

20
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The King Of Blaze

21
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Hema.

22
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Let's go.

23
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The King Of Blaze

24
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You go ahead.

25
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll go ahead and check the road.

26
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Okay.

27
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The King Of Blaze

28
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The King Of Blaze

29
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Brother Hema.

30
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What's wrong?

31
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The sky is clear.

32
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The sky is clear.

33
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The probability of a puddle is small.

34
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Isn't this good?

35
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Why are you sighing?

36
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I thought this rain

37
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
could at least rain for five or six days.

38
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It will definitely cause a mud flow on the mountain.

39
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I didn't expect it to stop now.

40
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But it's okay.

41
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Without the mud flow,

42
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I can make you

43
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
not be able to get out of this mountain.

44
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I was willing to help you before

45
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
because that person

46
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
threatened me with what happened that year

47
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and made me have to surrender to him.

48
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I thought you were different from him

49
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and could help me and my family.

50
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I didn't expect you to learn this too.

51
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You pretend to be a ghost

52
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
and use what happened that year to scare me.

53
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You forced me to do things for you.

54
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Brother Hema.

55
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I wanted to tell you this

56
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
when I got to the lake.

57
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But since you found out,

58
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I apologize to you.

59
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You know that

60
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
it has been raining for so many days.

61
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's hard to walk on the mountain.

62
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I didn't mean to lie to you.

63
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And now the situation is urgent.

64
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I have to go to the mountain to save my friend.

65
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And you are the only one

66
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
who can take me to the mountain.

67
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It doesn't matter if you have a heart.

68
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't care.

69
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I killed so many people that year.

70
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
When I die,

71
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
you are not the only one

72
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
who wants to settle the score in the jade jade.

73
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I can't deal with him.

74
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Can't I deal with you?

75
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What do you want?

76
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Brother Hema, calm down.

77
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Calm down. Don't come over.

78
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Brother Hema, don't do this.

79
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I didn't want to hurt you.

80
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I just want to save people on the mountain.

81
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
When did you

82
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
save me?

83
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You still want to lie to me?

84
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I found it.

85
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I didn't lie to you.

86
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
My friend told me that

87
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
they took the old sea bone

88
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and left it here.

89
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
They should be not far from here.

90
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

91
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Are you okay?

92
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
They are back.

93
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
They are all back.

94
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You. Who are you?

95
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What are you talking about?

96
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You are not far from here.

97
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You are not far from here.

98
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But you will never see them again.

99
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You are really different from him.

100
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You actually managed to get the old sea bone.

101
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Who are you?

102
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We just want to know the truth.

103
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
As long as the truth is out,

104
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
we can't use our shoulders

105
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
to threaten you with the old thing.

106
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Brother Hema, put down the knife.

107
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You can turn around now.

108
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't use this trick to fool me.

109
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
When I killed people,

110
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I couldn't turn around.

111
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Brother Hema, calm down.

112
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Don't make another mistake.

113
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Brother Hema, calm down.

114
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Don't make another mistake.

115
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Calm down.

116
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I remember.

117
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's you.

118
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Brother Hema, calm down.

119
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I killed you.

120
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But you are a bunch of...

121
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You are good.

122
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You are good at bullying people.

123
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Stop chasing.

124
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
He is too cheap.

125
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The forest is so big.

126
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You will get lost.

127
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
We should go back to the camp first.

128
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
We can find Brother Hema and the others.

129
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
By the way, why are you here alone?

130
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm not alone.

131
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I brought you a person.

132
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
We followed the clues you left.

133
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We found it all the way here.

134
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
One minute later,

135
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
you might be here.

136
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You left the clue.

137
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Xiaohua told me.

138
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
She asked me to come here

139
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and make a mark for her.

140
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
By the way, Xiaohua,

141
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
you haven't told me yet.

142
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Last time in Changsha,

143
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
what did he want to see you for?

144
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
He was hired by someone

145
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
to stop me from seeing you.

146
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But you still came.

147
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Now he is hired by me.

148
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He came to see you with me.

149
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You are a businessman.

150
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Thank you.

151
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You two have been driving for so long.

152
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You must be hungry.

153
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Come on.

154
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's eat something.

155
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Green pepper shredded pork fried rice.

156
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This is not green pepper.

157
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Be considerate.

158
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm a bright person.

159
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The cost is...

160
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
zero.

161
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Brother Hema,

162
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Master Hei,

163
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
you can rest assured.

164
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I will send Miss Huo

165
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
safely.

166
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I am your family.

167
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Leave it to me.

168
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I will be assured.

169
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Okay, Master Hei.

170
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You can go back to your work.

171
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Sister Xiu Xiu.

172
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Who is your sister?

173
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Who is your sister?

174
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
My little aunt.

175
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
My little sister.

176
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This little Huo

177
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
is so boring.

178
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Every time he goes to a fun place,

179
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
he never takes me with him.

180
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He insists on making me go back to Beijing

181
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
to investigate this and that.

182
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What's good about going back to Beijing?

183
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This...

184
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Master Huo is also good for you.

185
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
He takes care of you so much.

186
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
He protects you everywhere.

187
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Isn't he afraid that

188
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
you will be in danger?

189
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Master Huo also told me

190
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
that he will send you

191
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
safely to the airport.

192
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Look.

193
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Did we give him a little face?

194
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Have some milk tea to cool down.

195
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Then I will send you to the airport.

196
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Grandma Huo.

197
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It seems that you have a good analysis.

198
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Those survey members

199
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
were killed by Pan Ma.

200
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Then there is another team

201
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
to replace that survey team.

202
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Pan Ma is also pitiful.

203
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Even if he runs away,

204
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
his shoulders

205
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
may not be so easy to let him go.

206
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That Pan Ma

207
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
is now a dead man.

208
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
When we find him later,

209
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
we will send him to the police station.

210
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But I promised him

211
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
to take care of his son and grandson.

212
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I can't break my promise.

213
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's a good thing.

214
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Little Third Master.

215
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
According to your previous statement,

216
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
if we go north from the sea valley,

217
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
we should be able to find the lake in front.

218
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes.

219
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We should be at the slope

220
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
that crosses the front.

221
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I will take the lead and see the way.

222
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Why is there a tourism project here?

223
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Why is there a tourism project here?

224
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
How can we develop a tourism project?

225
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Don't joke around.

226
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
How can there be...

227
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
A gold spot.

228
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Wu Xie.

229
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
How can there be a tourism project here?

230
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Oh, my.

231
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I just left for a few days.

232
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What's going on?

233
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
According to the town,

234
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
it should be An Ning's boss,

235
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Qiu De Kao's people.

236
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Qiu De Kao has been supporting the archaeology

237
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
because of his Chinese friend's source many years ago.

238
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
He is able to help the archaeology work in China.

239
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Let's go around

240
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and check out the campground.

241
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Where are you?

242
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
We've searched the whole forest.

243
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
There's nothing here.

244
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I think

245
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
these two people

246
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
will disappear in the open.

247
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It has something to do with them.

248
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
An Ning's employer is Qiu De Kao.

249
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I believe you've heard of him.

250
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
This old man

251
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
is hard to deal with.

252
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I found this in the tent.

253
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's a good thing

254
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
that he's not here.

255
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm sure he's not here.

256
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm sure he's not here.

257
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I found this in the tent.

258
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Anyway,

259
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Xiao Ge and Fatty are in their hands.

260
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I have to go and see him.

261
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Are you going to see my boss?

262
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's you.

263
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It just so happens that

264
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
my boss wants to invite you over.

265
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm going to the campground.

266
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'll be there in a minute.

267
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'll be there in a minute.

268
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'll be there in a minute.

269
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'll be there in a minute.

270
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'll be there in a minute.

271
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'll be there in a minute.

272
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'll be there in a minute.

273
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'll be there in a minute.

274
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'll be there in a minute.

275
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'll be there in a minute.

276
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'll be there in a minute.

277
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'll be there in a minute.

278
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'll be there in a minute.

279
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'll be there in a minute.

280
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'll be there in a minute.

281
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'll be there in a minute.

282
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'll be there in a minute.

283
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'll be there in a minute.

284
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'll be there in a minute.

285
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'll be there in a minute.

286
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'll be there in a minute.

287
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
He's lucky!

288
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Tang Xueasts, you've said the words.

289
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Why should I take the blame for the wipedown?

290
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:57,220
The

291
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,020
I really want to know

292
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,820
How do I know

293
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,420
Are you hiding something

294
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,300
If you don't believe

295
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,300
I can accompany you

296
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,580
Finish reading all of these

297
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:20,940
Wu Xie

298
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,660
You told me before

299
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,020
There is a red line under the lake

300
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,460
That means

301
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,660
There must be a path

302
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,700
To other exits

303
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,380
They should have been rolled there

304
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,420
Mr. Hua is right

305
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,340
They

306
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,140
It's not good to say that they are in the mountains

307
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,660
The carpet is searched

308
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,620
Should be able to find

309
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,380
If they are not in the mountains

310
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,340
If they are not in the mountains

311
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,340
Should be in a place behind

312
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,100
That place

313
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,740
We are also looking for

314
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,980
You may have never seen me

315
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,780
But I am very close to your elders

316
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,300
My name is Qiu Degao

317
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,140
I asked you to come to talk about cooperation

318
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,620
How do you want to cooperate

319
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,220
This is not the first time I came to this lake

320
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,220
If there is no professional equipment

321
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,220
Can't go down

322
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,020
Xiao Shanye

323
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,420
Your heart is not professional equipment

324
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,380
If you want to go down the lake

325
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,620
Need any equipment

326
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,900
I can provide

327
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,620
Since you have everything

328
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,100
Then why do you still want to cooperate with us

329
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,060
You come here

330
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,420
Don't you come to be kind

331
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,020
The most important thing is to meet in person

332
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,940
You want to go down

333
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,980
I also need to go down

334
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,860
And our interests are not conflicted

335
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,700
You should know what I am below

336
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,340
I understand that you don't want to tell me the information you know

337
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,940
I was like this when I was young

338
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,300
But now

339
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,740
I understand that I must trust my partner

340
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,740
I will tell you all the information I have with you

341
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,500
Go back to the below

342
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,020
Is the Zhangjia Ancient Tower

343
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,140
Zhangjia Ancient Tower

344
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,540
How do you know

345
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,300
It doesn't matter how I know

346
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,220
I don't know

347
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,260
I don't know

348
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,420
I don't know

349
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,380
It doesn't matter how I know

350
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,820
But it looks like

351
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,660
Not all of you have this information

352
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,500
Wu Xie

353
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,020
We only knew after we separated in Changsha

354
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,540
I guessed it too

355
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,140
I have told you about Zhangjia Ancient Tower

356
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,620
What I'm going to tell you next

357
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,140
What I'm looking for

358
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,380
It should be the same as what you are looking for

359
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,300
If I reach his age

360
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,020
I guess there is only one thing

361
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,740
That can make me interested

362
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,180
That's right

363
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,980
What else is more attractive than life?

364
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,740
One last question

365
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,820
Do you know

366
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,260
An Nian is dead

367
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,620
I know

368
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,940
I feel sorry for his death

369
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,260
He is the leader of my investigation team

370
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,460
I have lost a lot of people

371
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,900
who are as good as him

372
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,580
They are life and death

373
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,340
You really don't care at all

374
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,180
If I can reveal this secret

375
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,420
when I'm alive

376
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,340
They can all come back

377
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,380
God

378
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,100
Xiao Hua

379
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,820
Just listen to me

380
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,740
Qiu De Sea move, I may not believe

381
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,260
But he said only I could get in

382
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,620
It must be true

383
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,620
Since you hired so many experts,

384
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,020
and also obtained the permission,

385
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,620
why did you want to work with us?

386
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,220
I really can't think of a reason to talk about working with me.

387
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,220
It's not enough to just have experts.

388
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,620
My people had been to this lake before.

389
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,220
According to the information that was transferred back then,

390
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,420
they should have already seen the Zhang family's bones under the lake.

391
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:39,020
Unfortunately, until now, they have not obtained anything.

392
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,020
Then according to your opinion,

393
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,620
Xiao Ge and the others are very likely to see the Zhang family's bones.

394
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,820
Then will they already...

395
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,820
Not necessarily. Maybe they are still alive.

396
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,420
Maybe they already entered the Zhang family's bones.

397
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,620
But as far as I know, the Zhang family's bones cannot be entered by anyone.

398
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,620
Our people can't. I'm not sure about the Wang family.

399
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,420
But the Zhang family's Xiao Ge should be able to enter.

400
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,820
How do you know Xiao Ge can enter?

401
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,820
Even if Xiao Ge can enter,

402
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,620
what about us? You can't even get out.

403
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,220
How can we?

404
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,620
You two?

405
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,020
I don't know about you two.

406
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,620
But you should be able to.

407
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,820
Even if I can get out,

408
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,620
as you said,

409
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,020
I already obtained the Zhang family's bones.

410
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,020
Aren't you afraid that I will break the contract

411
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,220
and use it as my only friend?

412
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,420
Zhang Sheng is a secret.

413
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,620
You can share all secrets.

414
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,020
If you share it with me, it won't affect you.

415
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,020
I've been searching for this secret for longer than you guys.

416
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,420
I know more than you guys.

417
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,620
Zhang family's bones may be just a clue

418
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,020
to the answer.

419
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,220
We need more information.

420
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,420
You will need me.

421
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,820
It's too dangerous for you to go down alone.

422
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,220
I know you don't trust him. I don't trust him either.

423
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,620
But it's because we don't trust him that we need someone to guard us.

424
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,020
Or else we'll all go down.

425
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:06,020
What if we run into danger in the water?

426
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,420
We can't all go in.

427
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,820
Xiao Hua, you're so insincere.

428
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,220
Qiu De Kao is going down alone. Of course he has his own plans.

429
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,820
But no matter what his plans are,

430
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,020
his only goal is to find the last secret of Zhang family's bones.

431
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,820
So he needs Wu Xie to come back alive.

432
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,420
Moreover, the power of the Wu family and the Nine Sects is here.

433
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,820
It's no good for Wu Xie to hurt him.

434
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,420
Right?

435
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,620
Here.

436
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,620
Go out and look at the oxygen meter.

437
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,620
Don't worry. I'll make a mark for you after we go down.

438
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,820
If you really need it, just follow the mark and come to me.

439
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,820
Go down and find Xiao Ge and Fatty first.

440
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,420
They might leave you a mark.

441
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,020
You're paid.

442
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,420
Watch him.

443
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,220
I'm going.

444
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,420
Wu Xie, can you hear me?

445
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,820
No problem.

446
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,420
Keep in touch anytime.

447
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,420
Don't worry. I'll bring you back safely.

448
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,220
Wu Xie

449
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,420
It's quite deep. It's 30 meters deep.

450
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,420
The boss said that our men

451
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,620
need to go down to 60 meters before they can find it.

452
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,220
50 meters.

453
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,420
It's already 60 meters.

454
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,820
Wu Xie, Wu Xie.

455
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,420
I can't see.

456
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,220
I can't see anything.

457
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,820
What?

458
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,620
Wait.

459
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,020
There are some...

460
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,420
I can't see anything.

461
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,420
I can't see anything.

462
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,020
I can't see anything.

463
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,020
I can't see anything.

464
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,620
Keep ur like a little cat

465
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,440
I think this is such a presence

466
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,700
It's awesome

467
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,860
I think it should be

468
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,440
a tiger

469
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,160
It's just a second

470
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,560
I think

471
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,640
Amongst numerous sects,

472
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:54,140
with request from little

473
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,440
to no concluded word.

474
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,500
But...

475
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,880
Beg to bring others patent something new

476
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,780
Yang Guo...

477
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,780
Do you see

478
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,440
the spirit Kongед��

479
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,880
Chenjun warrior...

480
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,040
villagers...

481
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,880
Jingabolu by the river

482
00:27:48,080 --> 00:28:00,600
ור

483
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,720
My heaven!

484
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,720
It's no wonder he's become a combo expert.

485
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,700
There's no

486
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:17,700
There's no

487
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:23,700
There's no

488
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:29,700
There's no

489
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,700
There's no decoration

490
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,700
It's empty

491
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,700
It sounds like a bell

492
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,700
Bell sound

493
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,700
How could there be a bell sound in the water

494
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,700
Wu Xie doesn't have any experience

495
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,700
It may be a hallucination caused by water pressure

496
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:07,700
Bell sound

497
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,700
How could it be

498
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,700
Bell sound

499
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,700
I can't be dreaming

500
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,700
Hua, Black Eye, can you hear me

501
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,700
You can't imagine what happened just now

502
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,700
The water behind my wound is sharp

503
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,700
It's a water wall

504
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,700
Hua, Hua

505
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,700
Black Eye, can you hear me

506
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,700
Can you hear me

507
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,700
Wu Xie, Wu Xie, can you hear me

508
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,700
Answer me

509
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,700
There's oxygen here

510
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,700
It's very safe

511
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,700
I'm going forward now

512
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,700
I don't know if you can hear me

513
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,700
Wu Xie, Wu Xie, Wu Xie

514
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,700
It sounds like a bell

515
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,700
Bell sound

516
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,700
Bell sound

517
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,700
There's no sound

518
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,700
Bell sound

519
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,700
It's just a water wall

520
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,700
Bell sound

521
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,700
There's no sound

522
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,700
Bell sound

523
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,700
There's no sound

524
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,700
Bell sound

525
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,700
There's no sound

526
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,700
Bell sound

527
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,700
I saw the sign

528
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,700
They should be inside.

529
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,700
Xiao Hua, Black Eye, I'm going in now.

530
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,700
You guys wait up there.

531
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,700
I'll take them home.

532
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,700
Boss, ask the same as before.

533
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,700
Go.

534
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,700
Xiao Hua, Black Eye, I don't know if you can hear me.

535
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,700
This place is so weird. It's like another world.

536
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,700
There's no water here.

537
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,700
The murals on the wall

538
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,700
are the human-faced birds that appeared in the Western Palace.

539
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,700
But the air here is not flowable.

540
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:52,700
We can't judge the age of murals from the level of the walls.

541
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:59,700
But there's no information about the murals themselves.

542
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,700
But I found something.

543
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,700
The eyes of the human-faced birds are pointing to the front.

544
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,700
But the seven human-faced birds on the door

545
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,700
have different eyes from the others.

546
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,700
From right to left, the eyes are

547
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,700
left, right, left.

548
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,700
Left, left, right, left.

549
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,700
I guess this is the key to the door.

550
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,700
Xiao Hua, Black Eye, I want to take a risk.

551
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,700
Wu Xie.

552
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,700
If I guess right, I can keep going forward

553
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,700
and meet them.

554
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,700
But if I guess wrong...

555
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,700
How about you try first?

556
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,700
reduce Forty-six to 7.

557
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,700
But if you can'tcontinue my word.

558
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,700
After a few ages,

559
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,700
I think I'll pass on to the human-faced birds by three years.

560
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,700
Everyone,

561
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,700
the place is gonna be...

562
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,700
Though you can't get out,

563
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,700
don't let my emotion go back to you.

564
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,700
Otherwise, his position can be just a staying still.

565
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,300
Chen Zhen, I know you can find him.

566
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,700
But you're too smart to disappoint me.

567
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,500
Fatty!

568
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,700
Why are you here now?

569
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,900
Brother!

570
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,700
How is it?

571
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,700
You haven't seen each other for a day.

572
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,700
You miss us, right?

573
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,700
I miss you so much!

574
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,700
Seriously, you two don't have any professional equipment.

575
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,700
How did you get into such a deep place?

576
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,700
It's too exciting.

577
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,700
We were sucked in.

578
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,700
Sucked in?

579
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,700
Why did you get sucked in when the water is 60 to 70 meters deep?

580
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,700
And you two have been here for so long.

581
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,700
Did you figure out what happened to Chu Che?

582
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,700
Zhangjia Gu Building.

583
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,700
Wu Xie's partner insisted on going down for him.

584
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,700
We'll just wait.

585
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,700
We've lost a lot of time.

586
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,700
We can't trust them.

587
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,700
Right.

588
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,700
It's all our fault.

589
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,700
What's wrong with you?

590
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,700
I'm sorry.

591
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,700
I'm sorry.

592
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,700
I'm sorry.

593
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,700
I'm sorry.

594
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,700
I'm sorry.

595
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,700
I'm sorry.

596
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,700
I'm sorry.

597
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,700
We've lost all comms to Wu Xie and can't pinpoint his location.

598
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,700
If we don't go down now, I'm afraid...

599
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,700
Consider it as the oxygen.

600
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,700
If we still get nothing, send someone for him.

601
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,700
Got it.

602
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:17,500
Yes, your cultures don't work on you.

603
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
They're all flowers of culture.

604
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:26,300
Yes, they're all Xie Dan spicy noodles with waiting tourists.

605
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,000
Lift up my friend.

606
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,700
My friend, don't do mishaps.

607
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,700
FATTERMAN THsi...

608
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,500
I said FATTERMAN

609
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,500
I've already seen it.

610
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,300
We infer that

611
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,900
this village was built to protect the ancient building.

612
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,260
Later,

613
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,700
when it was flooded, it was flooded.

614
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,900
It formed the Yangjiao Mountain Lake.

615
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,500
That means

616
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,820
the red and white water system

617
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,700
at the bottom of the lake

618
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,900
was probably caused by a flood

619
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,300
and caused a large-scale mud flow.

620
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:58,700
Yes.

621
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,700
The water was blocked

622
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,900
and the village was flooded.

623
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,900
Have you been inside Zhangjia Ancient Building?

624
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,100
What's inside?

625
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,500
We were about to go in,

626
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,500
but you came.

627
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,700
Then let's try.

628
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,900
I don't know how deep the water is.

629
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,700
No need to try.

630
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,300
Watch carefully.

631
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,300
The surface of the water can stand people?

632
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,100
The whole surface of the water is like this.

633
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,500
I think

634
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,900
the three of us

635
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,500
can get through it by boiling water.

636
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,900
It looks like water.

637
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,700
It should be liquid.

638
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,500
But liquid can't bear

639
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,900
such a great gravity and pressure.

640
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,900
If it's a viscous liquid,

641
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,900
at least

642
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,900
it's also a lake.

643
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,100
It's also a lake.

644
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,100
It's too illogical.

645
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,700
The gravity is here.

646
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,300
It's useless.

647
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,500
Stop thinking.

648
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,300
These days,

649
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,500
I've figured it out.

650
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,700
The things under the lake

651
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,100
are not explained clearly.

652
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,100
The only thing that can be explained clearly

653
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,300
is the logic outside.

654
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,300
It's not clear here.

655
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,500
Think about it.

656
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,100
We were sucked into the bottom of the lake by the red breath.

657
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,500
And the water wall

658
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,700
has something to do with the gravity?

659
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,100
When I walked over from the surface,

660
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,300
I thought the water wall was a counter-gravity.

661
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,300
I didn't expect it to be here.

662
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,100
If

663
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,700
these are all the protective devices set by Zhang's family,

664
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,700
then there must be

665
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,900
a very important secret of Zhang's family in here.

666
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,300
It's a wheel and a horse.

667
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,100
You'll know when you go in and take a look.

668
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,900
Go down and take a look.

669
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,700
Look.

670
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,100
I thought that after we came in,

671
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,700
we would step on the wall and leave.

672
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,300
I didn't expect that we would come back.

673
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,300
The gravity is not working here.

674
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,700
The gravity here

675
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,500
has affected us.

676
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,700
There are double gravity.

677
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,300
When we came from the surface,

678
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,300
the gravity came from one direction.

679
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,100
The moment we entered the valley,

680
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,900
it became another gravity field.

681
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,300
Or,

682
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,900
after we passed the water wall,

683
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,100
the gravity changed.

684
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,300
Thank God, Niu Nuan didn't read here.

685
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,100
Otherwise,

686
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,500
even if we wait until the time of Wangfu,

687
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,700
we can't wait for an apple

688
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,900
to hit his head.

689
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,300
What's wrong?

690
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,500
There's a drop of water.

691
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,100
It's a bit strange.

692
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,500
Let's go and take a look.

693
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,500
I said that your family

694
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,900
can't do it.

695
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,300
Why is there water?

696
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,500
It seems to be sea water.

697
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:06,900
It's not sea water.

698
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,900
It's a waterfall.

699
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,700
Run.

700
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,900
Wait a minute.

701
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,700
I thought you were different from him.

702
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,500
You helped me and my family.

703
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,300
I didn't expect that.

704
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,300
Say it again.

705
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,300
Say it again.

706
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,700
The color of the eye is not good.

707
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,900
The color of the eye is not good.

708
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,700
It's hot.

709
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,700
It's hot.

710
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,500
One, two, three.

711
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,100
You're awesome.

712
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,100
I can't hit you.

713
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,900
Sorry.

714
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,700
I was a little confused.

715
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,700
You're here.

716
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,300
Say it again.

717
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,300
You said that...

718
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,300
I said it again.

719
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,700
I was a little confused.

720
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,700
I was really confused.

721
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,100
Should I start from the beginning or...

722
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,300
If he turns around...

723
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,300
Wait a minute.

724
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,500
You can turn around.

725
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,500
He's not here, right?

726
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,100
Are you going to see my boss?

727
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,700
It's you.

728
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,100
Just right.

729
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,100
We're in a bad position.

730
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,100
Please...

731
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,300
Start.

732
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,300
You've been watching us.

733
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,100
If not, you'll be...

734
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,100
Sorry.

735
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,300
I'm sorry for being so rude.

736
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,300
I'm sorry for being so rude.

737
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,100
But it's because I'm Yuan Xi...

738
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,100
I'll pick you up in front.

739
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,100
Come on.

740
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,500
You're a rich man.

741
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,900
Watch him.

742
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,300
I'm leaving.

743
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,700
Okay.

744
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,300
Okay.

745
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,100
From right to...

746
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,100
From right to left.

747
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,100
It's very likely that because of a mountain rain,

748
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,700
you sent a signal to the 16th floor.

749
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,900
That's how it formed...

750
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,700
I'm sorry.

751
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,700
It formed a sand storm.

752
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,700
Okay.

753
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,300
Later,

754
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,300
when it met with flood,

755
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,300
it drowned it.

756
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,900
This Yangjiashan...

757
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,700
Later,

758
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,700
when it met with flood,

759
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,700
it drowned it.

760
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,900
It formed

761
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,700
Yangjiashan Red River.

762
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:44,700
Which one?

763
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,100
It has nothing to do with me.

764
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,100
If I say...

765
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,700
The thing inside

766
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,700
is Zhang Jia's equipment.

767
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,100
I thought I would walk on the wall

768
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,700
after I entered.

769
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,100
I didn't expect

770
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,500
I would get this.
