3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,140
Which would be the firstban?

4
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,140
You'reって child

5
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,320

00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,240

Episode 16

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Master Xie, come out.

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Our boss said

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
he won't make things difficult for you.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm afraid that a gentleman like you

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
is not a good man.

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I've searched everywhere.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No one is here.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Where's the thing?

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I've checked the place.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Nothing is missing.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
There's something wrong with that blind man.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Wu Xin, the knife.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You keep it.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Long Jin.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Brother Jia, Tianzhen.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Look.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
How many layers is this?

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's a trap.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Now it's a group fight.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Come on.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm tired.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm exhausted.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm not fit.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm not fit.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
How can this thing

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
still recognize people with its eyes open?

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I feel strange too.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This thing is too accurate.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Not strange.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm tired.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm tired.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm tired.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm tired.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm tired.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm tired.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm tired.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm tired.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm tired.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm tired.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm tired.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm tired.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What's that?

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Grandma,

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
No wonder you look so familiar.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's the upgraded version of the West Queen Mother.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Boss Qiu,

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What kind of technology is this?

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let me show you.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No,

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Boss Qiu,

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What's meaning?

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is really high technology.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Take a seat.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I said take a seat, please.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Come on.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm just trying to persuade Xiao Hua.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But she doesn't understand your good intentions.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You can stop pretending now.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You two liars.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What?

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Boss,

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
They're coming.

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Your friends are very pretty.

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah.

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Kung Fu.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Chinese Kung Fu.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's brilliant.

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Boss,

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Take him.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Your cup, please, Mr. Black.

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Of course.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Why not?

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's take him.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You bastard.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You betrayed me again.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I really don't have any.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You...

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
See?

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I told you.

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is not an ordinary snake.

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
They can sense temperature.

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It was too cold in the cave before.

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So they've been hibernating.

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So you mean,

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We woke them up because we lit the fire.

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
They will wake up sooner or later.

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Xiao Ge is right.

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Even if we don't light the fire,

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Our body temperature can wake them up.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If we're hungry for a few more days,

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We'll be completely out of energy.

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We're not their match at all.

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Again?

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Tianzhen, did you bring explosives?

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm going to blow up these bastards.

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I only have diving equipment.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Where did you get the explosives?

106
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm going to blow them up.

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Tianzhen,

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I can't do this.

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,280
The faster the better!

110
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,480
The faster the better!

111
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,600
The higher the body temperature, the faster the snake!

112
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,080
Who designed this?

113
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,720
I'm protecting the ancestors, right?

114
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,880
You're the one who's out.

115
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,080
But your ancestors are too mean.

116
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,880
I mean it.

117
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,440
No!

118
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,280
If we keep fighting,

119
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,160
we'll be beaten up again!

120
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,600
We can't let the Japs come.

121
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
We have to fight them.

122
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,600
Go to the warehouse.

123
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,640
Isn't that breaking into the ruins?

124
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,480
The Japs are stronger than the Japs.

125
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,520
If the Japs come out,

126
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,440
we'll be saved.

127
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,440
This torch won't last long.

128
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,840
The Japs are stronger than the Japs.

129
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,760
There should be a few left.

130
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,360
Let's go.

131
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,320
You have to learn to bow when you're under the roof.

132
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,480
Forget it, kid.

133
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,040
Your children are quite a team.

134
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,400
Always think about saving Wu Xie's life, huh?

135
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,760
I know you may not be able to end into the old pavilion.

136
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,760
But don't worry.

137
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,760
We won't be in the way when you must go.

138
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,080
In fact, I'm gonna force you to go when necessary,

139
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,440
even if you don't want to.

140
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
But now is not the right time.

141
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,120
But Wu Xie has vanished for most of the day.

142
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,720
I believe he's still alive.

143
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,440
I left him a flare launcher before he got into the water.

144
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,320
Even if he fires underneath, we can see it.

145
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,280
I'm sure he will fire it if he's actually in danger.

146
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,840
What if Wu Xie dies?

147
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,120
What if Wu Xie dies?

148
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,080
If he's dead, we lost the GPS signal.

149
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,120
No, he must have gone to some way that we can't track.

150
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,120
Tianzhen, be careful.

151
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,720
Go.

152
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
We are a signal cannot track.

153
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,720
That's a place where you are looking for, right?

154
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,920
That's right.

155
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,320
So we can't let you to stop it.

156
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,360
You sure are patient.

157
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,760
When you live to my age, you will be.

158
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,800
I'm sorry.

159
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,920
I'm sorry.

160
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,120
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,320
I'm sorry.

162
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,520
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,720
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,800
Boss.

165
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,840
Mr. Black, you're running a good business.

166
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,440
Another boss is coming.

167
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,400
You are my boss.

168
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,280
And you.

169
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,040
Okay, you can save it.

170
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,840
Your another boss has already get in here.

171
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,880
Really?

172
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,080
So why don't you invite him in?

173
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,880
So I can treat him a cup of tea.

174
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,320
Follow me.

175
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,320
Si Lu.

176
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,040
You've been busy for so long.

177
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,480
Why are you here?

178
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,080
Are you crazy?

179
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,480
How can you go out when Lu Feng is dead?

180
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,040
That's right.

181
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,480
There must be an exit in the maze.

182
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,400
When Zhang's family is in the bath,

183
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,200
they must have left after they were out.

184
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,760
Or they would be trapped inside.

185
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,040
That makes sense.

186
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,240
Let's go back.

187
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,760
Let's go.

188
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,720
So many boxes.

189
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,080
One by one.

190
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,400
They killed us before we found the exit.

191
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,080
Brother.

192
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,080
This way.

193
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,280
You remember it?

194
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,520
I feel...

195
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,760
You feel...

196
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,120
Are you sure?

197
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,320
I can only trust you now.

198
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,560
I felt it when I was in the cellar.

199
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,320
That's why I found the iron block.

200
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,680
Okay.

201
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
I'm also a member of Zhang's family.

202
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,760
You decide.

203
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,880
Let's go.

204
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,480
You decide.

205
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,520
Let's go.

206
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,000
Brother.

207
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,240
Which way should we go?

208
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,880
Brother.

209
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:56,380
Your humanoid

210
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,640
I feel like this thing is getting bigger.

211
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,840
Maybe the torch is burnt out.

212
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,040
Here comes another one.

213
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,400
Brother.

214
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,760
Brother.

215
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,360
Brother.

216
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,560
Where are you?

217
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,080
Why didn't your ancestors leave you a mark?

218
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,440
There must be a mark.

219
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,960
Since it's a device designed by Zhang's family,

220
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,040
there must be a mark.

221
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,640
Maybe it's on the wall.

222
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,840
It's Brother.

223
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,320
Brother is the map.

224
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,120
I know.

225
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,960
But the map is lost.

226
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,320
I mean this.

227
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,520
Look at this.

228
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,280
Does it look like the cave we saw just now?

229
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,360
Uncle.

230
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,720
The dead animal just now.

231
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,920
Yes.

232
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,520
As long as we get it out,

233
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,800
there must be a way out.

234
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,400
Good for you.

235
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
Give those things to Fatty.

236
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,040
You find the map.

237
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,120
Go.

238
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,400
Qianqian, hurry.

239
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,480
Fatty, I can't hold on anymore.

240
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,680
I remember.

241
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,480
Go.

242
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,120
Fatty, go.

243
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,240
Qianqian.

244
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,040
Go.

245
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,320
You can finally leave this place.

246
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,360
Go.

247
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,800
Listen to me, brother.

248
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,640
Your ancestors are really amazing.

249
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,360
They didn't want anyone to go out alive.

250
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,560
Go.

251
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,960
This thing looks like a dragon's face.

252
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,480
It's made of fire.

253
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,640
We can get out if we can get out.

254
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,440
Is this right?

255
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,280
You should be a good person.

256
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,600
Or else when Brother sees his ancestors,

257
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,720
his ancestors will ask,

258
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,400
grandson, how did you die?

259
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,920
Brother will say, ancestors.

260
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,440
I was killed by you.

261
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,040
This scene is so embarrassing.

262
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,160
I'm sorry.

263
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,200
I'm sorry.

264
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,240
I'm sorry.

265
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,200
I'm sorry.

266
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,160
Agree?

267
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,000
Stop talking about excuses!

268
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,960
Come here to help me amiss!

269
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,560
Again?

270
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,200
For a good brother like you,

271
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,440
remember to take him out alive!

272
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,720
Get up, now!

273
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,080
Get up, ladies!

274
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,880
Get up.

275
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,720
From the beginning, we're just friends.

276
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
scenario

277
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,240
A offer from�

278
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,240
Oh

279
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,240
Oh

280
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,120
Hey

281
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,240
Oh

282
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,560
Mr. Wu you've got a lot of men here

283
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,920
What do we got here out of all yes three sounds you seems never care about German business

284
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:26,200
What do we got here out of all yes three sounds you seems never care about German business

285
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,200
German the事情我可以不管

286
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,920
that's a wuxia

287
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
What B需要怪?

288
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,240
Oh

289
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,280
Oh

290
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Oh

291
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Oh

292
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,600
You'll be dead today!

293
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,440
I can't get out.

294
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,440
We have to leave together.

295
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,040
Jun Changyin Zhen.

296
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,240
When I was in Changsha with your father, Gao Wu,

297
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,240
he treated me with the same tea.

298
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,240
My father had a habit.

299
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,240
When he met someone he hated,

300
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,240
he would treat them to this Jun Changyin Zhen.

301
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,240
Let's go.

302
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Fatty, block the exit.

303
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
Let's go.

304
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,240
Mr. Wu, why don't we talk about the corporation?

305
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,240
We have to cooperate.

306
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
What do you have?

307
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,240
Your purpose is to find the Zhang's share.

308
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,240
I want to find my nephew Wu Xie.

309
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,240
We have different purposes.

310
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,240
The equipment and people I bring

311
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,240
are far more than you.

312
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
And

313
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,240
the information you have

314
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,240
is not more valuable than me, right?

315
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,040
So you don't have the capital to cooperate with me.

316
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,040
If you don't cause me trouble,

317
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,040
I won't do anything to you.

318
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,040
But if you cause me trouble,

319
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,040
I will sink your whole team into the lake.

320
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,040
I will make you live a long life.

321
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,040
Just to save your nephew,

322
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,040
why do you have to live a dark life?

323
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,040
Who told you to talk?

324
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,040
I am representing our boss.

325
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
Boss.

326
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,040
If you say another word,

327
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,040
I will seal your mouth.

328
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,040
I haven't sealed someone else's mouth for a long time.

329
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,040
I am about to close you.

330
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,040
Fatso.

331
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,040
I will take Brother Zhang out.

332
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,040
I will pick you up.

333
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,040
I will take you back.

334
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,040
I will take you back with me.

335
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
Let's go.

336
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,040
Hold on a little longer.

337
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,040
We will be there soon.

338
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,040
No.

339
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Luckily, I didn't kill you.

340
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,040
I will take you home.

341
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
So Mr. Wu,

342
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,040
since you are the descendant of Mr. Gao Wu,

343
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,040
and he was kind to us back to the old time,

344
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,040
so you deserve the same courtesy.

345
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,040
Enjoy.

346
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
Jun Shan Yin Zhi.

347
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
Jun Shan Yin Zhi.

348
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Jun Shan Yin Zhi.

349
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,040
Boss, someone fired a flare at the mountains.

350
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,040
Oh, yeah.

351
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
I'm sorry.

352
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,040
I'm sorry.

353
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
I'm sorry.

354
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,040
I'm sorry.

355
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,040
I'm sorry.

356
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
I'm sorry.

357
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
I'm sorry.

358
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Wu Xie.

359
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Wu Xie.

360
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,040
Xiao Ge and Fatty's wounds have been treated.

361
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
Mr. Wu has been to Changsha.

362
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,040
We are going to Changsha now.

363
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Let's meet them.

364
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,040
We should go.

365
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Wait.

366
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,040
I'll go to the countryside to wait.

367
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
Little Master Shan,

368
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,040
is the cooperation going well?

369
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
I want to ask you.

370
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Why do you think I can enter Zhang's Valley?

371
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,040
I'm not sure.

372
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,040
But I think you should be.

373
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,040
We all know that Zhang's Valley is only for the people of Zhang's.

374
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,040
And you have been to the place where Zhang Qilin went.

375
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,040
Don't you think we are deliberately training you?

376
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,040
The fact that the Jiu Men train me

377
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,040
means that I can enter?

378
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,040
I can't answer this question.

379
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
You need to ask the people of the Jiu Men.

380
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
Besides, you can come out safely.

381
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,040
Doesn't it mean that you can enter?

382
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,040
I didn't enter Zhang's Valley at all.

383
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,040
And I'm not that person who can enter.

384
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,040
I'm not that person who can enter.

385
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
Under the water,

386
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,040
I did see a gorge.

387
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,040
But there is a protection outside the gorge.

388
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,040
The person you sent down there

389
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,040
must have failed there.

390
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,040
If I hadn't destroyed the illusion,

391
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
I would have died there too.

392
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,040
You really have nothing?

393
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
I don't know.

394
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
According to what you said,

395
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
after you went down the water,

396
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,040
you saw the top of Zhang's Valley.

397
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,040
It's a pity that you couldn't enter from there.

398
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,440
from the mountain.

399
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,640
Wu Xie,

400
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,240
you just said

401
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,960
the baths that attacked you

402
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,760
are the same as the ones we attacked, right?

403
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,720
They are very similar,

404
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,480
but not exactly the same.

405
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,320
The surface of these baths is green.

406
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,520
The texture is like something like a tiger's den.

407
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,280
Besides, the snakes that can drive the organs

408
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,920
can feel the temperature of the human body.

409
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,720
The organ you're talking about

410
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,920
should be called the miluotuo.

411
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
Miluotuo?

412
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,840
Uncle,

413
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,040
you've heard of it too?

414
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,320
I heard it from your grandfather back then.

415
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,680
The snake in the organ,

416
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,600
it's called the black-haired snake.

417
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,600
This snake will stay in a state of hibernation

418
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,720
at low temperatures.

419
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,520
But once the temperature rises,

420
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,520
it will wake up.

421
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,080
When your grandfather told me back then,

422
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,000
I thought he was lying to me.

423
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,160
But I didn't expect

424
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,320
they actually existed.

425
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,280
If we hadn't lit the fire back then,

426
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,480
I don't think

427
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,040
we would have awakened these things.

428
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,280
The Buddha and the Buddha are together.

429
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,080
If we hadn't awakened these things

430
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,960
and opened the passage,

431
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,160
I'm afraid you wouldn't have been able

432
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,120
to escape from the cave.

433
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,880
These organs must have been designed by the Zhang family

434
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,560
to resist invaders.

435
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,320
Once you enter the water station,

436
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,640
you will be trapped in the illusion

437
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
and will be attacked by the miluotuo

438
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,640
even if you get involved in the Hongxi Dynasty.

439
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,240
The problem is that the path you chose

440
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,160
must be wrong.

441
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,400
Otherwise,

442
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,120
as a member of the Zhang family,

443
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,760
you must have been there for several days

444
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,080
and found the entrance.

445
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,400
If all the ancient buildings in the Zhang family

446
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,760
are made of miluotuo,

447
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,480
no one will be able to enter.

448
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,280
Not necessarily.

449
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,480
Wow.

450
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,400
What is this?

451
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,880
When we were searching the mountain,

452
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:20,960
we found the pieces of miluotuo

453
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,280
from your body.

454
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,040
What's in your basin?

455
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,680
Pestilence?

456
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,440
Pestilence is a kind of antipyretic.

457
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,680
This thing melts when it is robbed.

458
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,440
So,

459
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,680
miluotuo is not that invincible.

460
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,520
That's a good point.

461
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,480
But it's useless to just rob it.

462
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,560
Think about it.

463
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,720
You've been in the water for so long

464
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,640
that you haven't found the entrance to the Zhang family's ancient building.

465
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,800
You said that

466
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,800
you escaped from the tattoo on Xiaoge's body.

467
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,440
Xiaoge is the Pestilence.

468
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,640
I know.

469
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,360
But the body is lost.

470
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,360
I mean this.

471
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,560
Look at this.

472
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,200
Does it look like the cave in the bathroom?

473
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:08,760
Yes.

474
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,160
Even if it's the Pestilence,

475
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,800
it can only draw you out

476
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,680
from the cave of the miluotuo.

477
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,840
It can't let you find the ancient building.

478
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,880
It seems that what your uncle said is right.

479
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,640
That's just a defense mechanism.

480
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,800
It's not an entrance.

481
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,320
Come in.

482
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:38,840
Uncle.

483
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,440
Can you tell me the truth?

484
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Did you know that

485
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,320
the entrance to the Zhang family's ancient building

486
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,360
is not there at all?

487
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,600
Stop thinking about it.

488
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,840
How would I know?

489
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,640
It's your uncle.

490
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,520
He's the one who told me.

491
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,200
He told me that

492
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,400
the entrance to the Zhang family's ancient building

493
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,440
is just a reference

494
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,720
to your analysis.

495
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,160
I just figured it out.

496
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,880
That's strange.

497
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,440
Why is it so important?

498
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,840
I didn't remember it.

499
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,680
Uncle.

500
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,320
Where did you get this?

501
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,440
I was wondering

502
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,560
why the valuable information

503
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,400
of the Third Master's family was missing.

504
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,720
Why is it all with you?

505
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,280
What are you talking about?

506
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,880
You guys can think of stealing here.

507
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,200
Can't others think of it?

508
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,800
I hid the thing in advance.

509
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,160
Besides,

510
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,800
this is the territory of my Wu family.

511
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,360
I touched my third brother's stuff.

512
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,080
What's wrong?

513
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,240
Uncle.

514
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,520
Where did you put

515
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,680
the information of my third uncle?

516
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,240
I don't know.

517
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,680
I just changed a place.

518
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:09,920
It's all here.

519
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,000
There's nothing missing.

520
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,800
It's dark under the light.

521
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,800
Second Master is really smart.

522
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,160
The information is not on the shelf,

523
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,320
but it's still at home.

524
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,000
The ancient building is not in the water,

525
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,840
but it's still in the mountains.

526
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,160
When I was at the bottom of the lake,

527
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,160
I saw the roof of Zhang's ancient building.

528
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,600
That means

529
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,480
the main body of Zhang's ancient building

530
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,720
should still be in the water.

531
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,280
And the bottom of the lake is connected to the bottom of the mountain.

532
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,760
There are many people-like

533
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,120
and human-like passageways in the mountain.

534
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,760
If these are all

535
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,280
the protective mechanisms set by Zhang's family,

536
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,880
there must be something they want to protect.

537
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,800
The biggest possibility

538
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,440
is Zhang's ancient building.

539
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,640
You guys

540
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,760
should be found out by you.

541
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,160
Second Master,

542
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,760
why don't you want us to investigate?

543
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,000
What's there to investigate?

544
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,440
From my grandfather to my father,

545
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,280
they've been looking for this secret.

546
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,120
My grandfather died in the Biaozi Ridge.

547
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,240
Although my father didn't die,

548
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,080
he was the one who took care of us

549
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,360
and buried us.

550
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,040
He had to use the iron coffin.

551
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,760
He was afraid that something bad would happen.

552
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,240
But now my third brother is missing.

553
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,160
Do you know why your grandfather

554
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,840
gave you the name Wu Xie?

555
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,400
For so many years,

556
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,240
there has never been a child

557
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,800
of such a clean family.

558
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,920
But now you're the one

559
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,320
who's been involved in this.

560
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,520
I went to the camp in the Chudekou River

561
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,400
to look for you.

562
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,240
You've violated my principle.

563
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,400
I can ignore the matter of the Jiumen.

564
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,320
But you,

565
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,440
I have to.

566
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,320
Boss,

567
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,560
why did you spend money

568
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,680
to protect Second Master?

569
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,360
It was him who told you to do it, right?

570
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,480
Yes.

571
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,360
You're the one he cares about the most.

572
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,720
I know.

573
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,440
He stole my flower pot.

574
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,440
Mu Song, Gu Hong,

575
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,880
out of the clouds.

576
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,440
It's a black and white battle.

577
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,080
There's no way to lose.

578
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,080
The other word, lose,

579
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,160
is in my flower pot.

580
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,640
Actually, for so many years,

581
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,120
Xie Lian Huan still misses you.

582
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:21,880
Uncle,

583
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,880
can you tell me

584
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,080
what's inside

585
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,800
the photo of the corner house?

586
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,880
What corner house?

587
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,560
Stop pretending.

588
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,840
You can spend money

589
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,440
to protect the flower with your dark eyes,

590
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,880
and you can save me from Chudekou.

591
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,480
That means you know very well

592
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,880
the whereabouts of our journey.

593
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,280
After investigating this journey,

594
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,320
I found out that

595
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,640
the person who stole the flower pot

596
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,240
was the one who stole the flower pot.

597
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,200
After investigating this journey,

598
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,120
we found that the biggest clue

599
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,440
was broken in the corner house.

600
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,400
I always thought that this photo

601
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,960
was burnt by him.

602
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,280
But he has guarded Ba Nai for so many years.

603
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,200
If he wanted to burn it, he would have done it long ago.

604
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,320
As for Chudekou,

605
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,520
he also wanted to enter Zhangjia Gu House.

606
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,720
So he had no reason

607
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,400
to burn these photos.

608
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,520
So the biggest possibility

609
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,680
is you.

610
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,560
Although the third person

611
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,160
wants you to investigate further,

612
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,240
I don't think so.

613
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,560
I'm afraid that you will

614
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,520
fall into the trap of the former.

615
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:31,800
Okay.

616
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,840
I won't force you.

617
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,920
When you want to tell me

618
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,240
or need me to know,

619
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,040
you can say it again.

620
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,800
I won't force you.

621
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,200
I won't force you.

622
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,000
I won't force you.

623
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,800
I won't force you.

624
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,040
Okay.

625
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,120
Well,

626
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,760
I can't stop you

627
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,200
from doing what you want to do.

628
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,200
But I have a condition.

629
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,080
No matter when,

630
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,880
when you are in danger,

631
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,920
you must tell me.

632
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,160
Mr. Cheng,

633
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,120
what exactly is in Zhangjia Gu House?

634
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,080
Why are there so many people in the Jiumen

635
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,240
who are looking for the

636
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:15,960
investigation team?

637
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,600
They all want to go in with their lives.

638
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,360
Haven't you found out

639
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,240
what it is?

640
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,760
We only know that

641
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,960
the secret of Zhangjia Gu House

642
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,920
is related to the longevity.

643
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,000
Yes.

644
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,160
Ancient Chinese emperors

645
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,280
were looking for the longevity secret.

646
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,760
They believed that the longevity secret

647
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,320
was hidden in the tomb of the ancient Fangs.

648
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,240
So they found many people

649
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,880
who were looking for the longevity secret.

650
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,160
During the investigation,

651
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,680
they must have found some clues.

652
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,200
These clues will form ideas.

653
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,480
When these ideas are generated,

654
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,120
at the same time,

655
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,760
the original obstacles in the investigation plan

656
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
will also be generated.

657
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,440
It will appear.

658
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,040
Everyone doesn't want

659
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,720
this secret to be known to others.

660
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,400
Especially him.

661
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,120
One, two, three.

662
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,720
You will die if you run away from me.

663
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,440
Let's see if you still run away.

664
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,920
Jimmy rows衬

665
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,520
Go right into the underground.

666
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,680
So romantic

667
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,240
I doubt myself

668
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,240
All the traces

669
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,240
I have you with me

670
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,240
Together we share the truth

671
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,240
Who has ever been in love

672
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:01,240
I just want to say thank you

673
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,240
Let me understand

674
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:12,240
There are some things that are not right

675
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,240
Only if you want to

676
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,240
I have a question

677
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,240
Go!

678
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,240
Go!

679
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,240
Go!

680
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,240
Go!

681
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,240
One, two, three!

682
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,240
Who is this?

683
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,240
I'm greeting my ancestors, right?

684
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,240
Xiao Ge, you're out

685
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,240
What are you doing?

686
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,240
Where are you going?

687
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,240
I'm here to ask everyone for help

688
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,240
You have to go with them

689
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,240
Go to the basement

690
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,240
Then I'll go with you

691
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,240
No, no, no

692
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,240
You can't go with them

693
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,240
You have to go with them

694
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,240
Everyone, please

695
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,240
Protect each other

696
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,240
I'll always be with you

697
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,240
No matter how much trouble there is

698
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,240
Trust each other

699
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,240
In the darkness

700
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,240
Xiao Ge!

701
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,240
Xiao Ge!

702
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,240
Where are you?

703
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,240
Come and have a look

704
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,240
Thank you for your hard work

705
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,240
Come and have a look

706
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,240
Xiao Ge!

707
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,240
Xiao Ge!

708
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,240
Xiao Ge!

709
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,240
Where are you?

710
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,240
Come, come

711
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
That's the back

712
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,240
Look, look

713
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,240
What's up?

714
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,240
When I was at the bottom of the lake

715
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,240
I saw Zhang's ancient tomb

716
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,240
I was thinking about something

717
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,240
When I was at the bottom of the lake

718
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,240
I saw Zhang's ancient tomb

719
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,240
If you say

720
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,240
Sorry, I'm sorry

721
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,240
How can I help you?

722
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,240
Boss

723
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,240
Why do you still spend money

724
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,240
And let me protect the flower?

725
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,240
I think he asked you to do it

726
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,240
OK, come

727
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,240
I'll pay you back

728
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,240
OK, I'll pay you back

729
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,240
OK, I'll pay you back

730
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,240
I'll pay you back

731
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,240
OK, I'll pay you back

732
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,240
Bye

733
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,240
I'm sorry

734
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,240
OK

735
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,240
I'm sorry

736
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,240
You just said you were going to attack your sister

737
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,240
OK, I'll pay you back

738
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,240
OK
