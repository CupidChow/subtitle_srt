The King of Gems

56
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 05

57
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What is the King of Gems?

58
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I've seen him twice.

59
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The first time was when I entered the palace.

60
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
At that time, he was also a flying dragon.

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Without willpower, we almost all died.

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Then we killed him with all our heart.

63
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Unexpectedly, we were led to a lot of trouble.

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We escaped from the Seven Stars Palace after dying for a lifetime.

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Today, I saw this kind of driving for the first time.

66
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Is the King of Gems related to the Queen Mother of West?

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It should be.

68
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This headdress is probably the container to train the King of Gems.

69
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The King of Gems is also a kind of biochemical weapon of the Queen Mother of West.

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It controls the Western Regions.

71
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
These worms are not just weapons.

72
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What do you mean?

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Everything is just a guess.

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The answer must be found in the Queen Mother of West.

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We were in a mess just now.

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I have no impression at all.

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But when I ran, I saw the sun.

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We probably ran in the direction of the northeast.

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't know where we are now.

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We can only go in one direction.

81
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If we are lucky, we can go out.

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If we are unlucky...

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Let's just listen to the fate.

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What else is there in the Devil City?

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No one knows.

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Fortunately, it's sunny.

87
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We have no equipment.

88
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The sun will definitely come out.

89
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The temperature here is very different from the day before.

90
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The weather has changed a lot.

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's best to leave here before dark.

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Otherwise, we will all die here at night.

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We still have six hours.

94
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The direction in front should be right.

95
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Let's keep going.

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The Military Department?

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That's one of the mushrooms.

98
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Now we have something to eat.

99
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't joke.

100
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Did you hear anything?

101
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Of course.

102
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I am blind.

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This is a long time ago.

104
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's not a person.

105
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's definitely not a person.

106
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
People don't slip away.

107
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Then who is it?

108
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The big mushroom.

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I heard there is a kind of military plant.

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's called the big mushroom.

111
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's a big mushroom.

112
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I heard there is a kind of military plant.

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's called the big mushroom.

114
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And it will destroy the military silk like silkworms.

115
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
In theory, it shouldn't be too big.

116
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But you think about it.

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's been here for at least seven or eight years.

118
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
How big is that?

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I can't say.

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Will it escape the attacker?

121
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The attacker won't.

122
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's just a natural climb.

123
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Isn't that even more scary?

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes.

125
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Plus these military silk.

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We have a lot of them.

127
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'll get it.

128
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
There are so many people dead.

129
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This is the nest of the king of the stone.

130
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The third master should have run away.

131
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It happened suddenly.

132
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He must have no supply.

133
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We have to find him quickly.

134
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Where are you going?

135
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No one has left a trace.

136
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The guide said that

137
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
the town of the devil is about 80 square kilometers.

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Even if we have to dig every inch of it,

139
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
we have to find the third master.

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's go.

141
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This guy.

142
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He said he was not worried about the threat.

143
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He's talking nonsense.

144
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
How long have we been walking?

145
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Four hours.

146
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Even if we walk five kilometers an hour,

147
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
we have 20 kilometers now.

148
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We must have walked more than 20 kilometers.

149
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Zha Xi said that

150
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
the town of the devil is about 80 square kilometers.

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Even if we are lucky,

152
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
we can walk in one direction.

153
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We should be able to get out in three days.

154
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Should?

155
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Should this word

156
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
let you die in this environment?

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
My life record is declining.

158
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Please don't scare me anymore.

159
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I didn't scare you.

160
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
If there is no physical consumption,

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
normal people can last three days after a broken water.

162
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But we have too much physical consumption now.

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We can't stand it tonight.

164
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's okay to break the water.

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I can drink urine.

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But if you...

167
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I must have lasted longer than you.

168
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Because I can eat.

169
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I can drink urine.

170
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Because I can eat.

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Didn't you say not to scare people?

172
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I didn't scare you.

173
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If there is a real deadlock, I will not hesitate.

174
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Blood can replenish water.

175
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Meat can replenish energy.

176
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And I warn you.

177
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The location near the devil's city is special.

178
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
If you dig around the plants

179
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
to fill your stomach,

180
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
it will cause a big fire.

181
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Then we can't live.

182
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Don't let me die with you.

183
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Nice.

184
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Let's go.

185
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I hope we don't get lost.

186
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Can I still go with you?

187
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You are more terrifying than the devil.

188
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Who is that?

189
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's the killer.

190
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's good.

191
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yes.

192
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
If the killer has a spy, we can get out.

193
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes.

194
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
No, you mean you can get out of the cave?

195
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You can learn to search after you go out.

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's a child's work.

197
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I can't do it.

198
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Look at the cave.

199
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
There is a desert.

200
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
There is no place to dig.

201
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Are you crazy? Why do you bother him?

202
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm studying.

203
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Look carefully.

204
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Hurry up. If you don't go,

205
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
you will be hung by these things.

206
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
How?

207
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You.

208
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's getting dark.

209
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's getting dark. It's getting cold.

210
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Your sweat is almost dripping.

211
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Here.

212
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
This is for you.

213
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You still have water?

214
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
If you don't have water, why do you give it to me?

215
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
While you are still alive,

216
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
collect your sweat and use it as a backup.

217
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Are you still a human?

218
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
If we don't find a way,

219
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
we will not be human.

220
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You scared me.

221
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You're scared.

222
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You're going to burn me, right?

223
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Fine.

224
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Help me speak out a few words.

225
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Weixiang Ke.

226
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Fatty.

227
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And my third uncle.

228
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You were shaking your hand.

229
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,200
You were shaking your hand.

230
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,280
It's obvious that you were shocked.

231
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,640
The answer is that it's to stimulate your muscles.

232
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,200
So that you won't get a stroke.

233
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,040
Let's talk about it later.

234
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
Or you'll be embarrassed.

235
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,380
hell

236
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,460
We've been walking so long.

237
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
You have the stone.

238
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,840
And you have the resistance.

239
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,060
You have the marks on the road.

240
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,600
So you know the way back.

241
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
That's the same.

242
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The photo.

243
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
We are being tricked by this evil city.

244
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What do you mean?

245
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Pan Zi, look.

246
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
There are stones at both ends of the crossroads.

247
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
There are more stones and less stones.

248
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The stones are less,

249
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
which makes people feel that it's easy to walk.

250
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Naturally, they will walk this way.

251
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Look, this is how it goes.

252
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
In the subconscious,

253
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
they will walk the side that is less.

254
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This path is chosen by yourself.

255
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But the direction has been set for you.

256
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I remember that we walked the side with more stones three times.

257
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Pan Zi, you have a good memory.

258
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But the evil side is here.

259
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Occasionally, we choose the side with more stones.

260
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We will not eat or feel it, but we will choose less.

261
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
They corrected us again.

262
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
From now on, we will choose the side with more stones.

263
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Wait.

264
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I think it's getting late.

265
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We will be getting mosquitoes soon.

266
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Let's camp here.

267
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Let's set off at dawn.

268
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Okay.

269
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm going to sleep.

270
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I didn't expect the temperature to be so high here.

271
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Take it off.

272
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
No.

273
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The clothes I bought have already been wet.

274
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's getting lower before it's dry.

275
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
If I take it off, I will die here.

276
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's no different from being killed in the evening.

277
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What are you thinking?

278
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm thinking that if we continue to walk,

279
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
we might be able to get out.

280
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
If we fail, we will die in the water.

281
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Tomorrow and the night, we will never know which one will come.

282
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Tomorrow is likely to be our death.

283
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Are you going to give up?

284
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Can you not be so sharp in your questions?

285
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Survival or death is a philosophy.

286
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I can think about it occasionally.

287
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
At this time,

288
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
if you want to think about this kind of question,

289
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
why don't you think about how to get through the night?

290
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I think we should save some energy

291
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and hide in this cave to avoid the wind.

292
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Use these stones to make a stone grass.

293
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Okay.

294
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It will warm up the body.

295
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The weight of the stones in the cave

296
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
should not exceed half your weight.

297
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Otherwise, the physical strength will be too much.

298
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It will not be a stone.

299
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Half the weight?

300
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You look down on me.

301
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Are you sure this method works?

302
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
There is no other way.

303
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I...

304
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I heard it was a good thing.

305
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But you told me to use the wind to listen to the wind.

306
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Isn't it a little bit hasty?

307
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's better than being caught by the military department here.

308
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's true.

309
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But this thing is after all about us.

310
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What about us?

311
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Listen.

312
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What?

313
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Come here.

314
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Come here.

315
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Did you hear that?

316
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Come here.

317
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I didn't hear you.

318
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What?

319
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Did you hear that?

320
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
No.

321
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Then come here again.

322
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Come here.

323
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Come here.

324
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Listen.

325
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
This is the wind, right?

326
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Then let's go here.

327
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
There must be a link between the pipes and the pipes.

328
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Not to mention the pipes from the Republic of China.

329
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The killer must have come in from here.

330
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Okay.

331
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Let's go here.

332
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
By the way,

333
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I will throw the mine to the pipes over there.

334
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
After the explosion,

335
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
the crack in the pipes here will be broken.

336
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The sand will come down immediately.

337
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I will follow the sand-covered slope and pull you up.

338
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
But the only problem is that we must hurry up.

339
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Because this is a pipeline.

340
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Before the explosion reaches this side,

341
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
you have to go up.

342
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You have arranged it so well.

343
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What else can I say?

344
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Hurry up.

345
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I am such a kind person.

346
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
If we can get out safely this time,

347
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I will definitely make you a meal without green pepper.

348
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Hurry up.

349
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Now it's warm.

350
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Why are you still so far away?

351
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Aren't the two of us in such a big place?

352
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The food is to keep the temperature.

353
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's so far away and the space is so big.

354
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What's the difference from the sky?

355
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Then wait for me.

356
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'll take another seat.

357
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Hurry up.

358
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The sky is quite clear.

359
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
We can really open a hole.

360
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What should we do?

361
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
There is no escape route.

362
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Hurry up.

363
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Hold on.

364
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Hurry up.

365
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Hurry up.

366
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What's wrong with you?

367
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What's the way to get in this time?

368
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You want to kill me, right?

369
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Fine.

370
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But you have to get out of here for me.

371
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I just wanted to kill you.

372
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Without water and food,

373
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
we can't live for two days.

374
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Then why don't you do it?

375
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
If I had to do it before,

376
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I wouldn't be soft-hearted

377
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
to live on.

378
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I don't want to be soft-hearted.

379
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I don't want to be soft-hearted.

380
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't want to be soft-hearted.

381
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I don't want to be soft-hearted.

382
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't want to be soft-hearted.

383
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You've changed.

384
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Stop talking nonsense.

385
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Let's go.

386
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
The city is about to be destroyed.

387
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's like blood.

388
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What are you doing?

389
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
If someone comes to us,

390
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
this is a chance.

391
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
At least,

392
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
they can find our bodies.

393
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Your mark is a bit expensive.

394
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's like putting a gold brick on it.

395
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's like our secret talisman.

396
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's also valuable.

397
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I hope...

398
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I hope the place he pointed to

399
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
is not our place to die.

400
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
The moon shines brightly

401
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
with the light.

402
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What are you doing?

403
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Since last night,

404
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
everything I saw was spinning.

405
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Just like my hand now.

406
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's spinning.

407
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So I want to see

408
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
if my hand is spinning

409
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
or the ground.

410
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You're just

411
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
dizzy.

412
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Maybe.

413
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
No one can tell

414
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
what's going on in the tomb.

415
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Are you

416
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
already confused

417
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
about what could happen

418
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and what could not happen?

419
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I wasn't flying, right?

420
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But I really felt

421
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I was flying.

422
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
But you were flying.

423
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I was flying.

424
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
But you were exhausted.

425
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You have no strength left.

426
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I can see the world even if I don't have strength.

427
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Look.

428
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
How big is the sun today?

429
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I hope it rains.

430
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Do you know

431
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
there's a dance

432
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
all over the world?

433
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Who is it?

434
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I was going to say

435
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I was going to dance

436
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
but I didn't.

437
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
When I was flying,

438
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
why didn't you look back?

439
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You've been an opponent for a long time.

440
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You'll get to have feelings.

441
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
But why did you

442
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
keep being so rational?

443
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's a mechanical reaction

444
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
like a computer.

445
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yes.

446
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You're a robot.

447
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's reasonable.

448
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Why didn't you walk?

449
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Why did you say

450
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
so many things?

451
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I might faint

452
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
if I don't talk.

453
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I advise you

454
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
to keep your breath in another way.

455
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You'll be

456
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
very happy.

457
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
If I turn over

458
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
the mountain of salt now,

459
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I can see the flowers next door.

460
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
But I'll go there right now.

461
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Ning.

462
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Ning.

463
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Ning.

464
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
We have to hurry.

465
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Hurry up.

466
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Don't rush.

467
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm almost sick of these stones.

468
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
These stupid stones

469
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
are so old.

470
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Wait a minute.

471
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
The same money at that time.

472
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Someone came here in the Qing Dynasty.

473
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Nonsense.

474
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's so clean.

475
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's worth a good research.

476
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
What do you mean?

477
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
You know this money too?

478
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
It's going to run out.

479
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Let's go.

480
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Let's go.

481
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Another stone money.

482
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
We're rich.

483
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Is this used to be a watch?

484
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Who uses such a valuable thing

485
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
to be a watch?

486
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I've been going south and north for so many years.

487
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It's just...

488
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Ning.

489
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Here.

490
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
These are all from the money

491
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
that Ning spent at that time.

492
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Wu Xie should be with Ning.

493
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
If he had to,

494
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
he wouldn't use such a valuable thing

495
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
to be a watch.

496
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
We have to find them quickly.

497
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Ning.

498
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Ning.

499
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Here.

500
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Here.

501
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Here.

502
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Oh my god.

503
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It's too cold.

504
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Are you a human or something?

505
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I'm a human.

506
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Are you alive or dead?

507
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I'm alive.

508
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Then why are you lying on the sand?

509
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I just wanted to dig some fresh grass

510
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
for us to eat.

511
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Then why didn't you move when I kicked you?

512
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I saw you walking over.

513
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I just wanted to scare you.

514
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I think you're a demon

515
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
who's trying to escape from the money.

516
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Otherwise, why are those things there?

517
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I meant well.

518
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I was afraid you wouldn't find me when you woke up.

519
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So I came over.

520
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
How about this?

521
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Should we get closer?

522
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Get closer.

523
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Little brother,

524
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
get closer to us.

525
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Hurry up.

526
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Fatty, you can't do this.

527
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It's not like what you're doing.

528
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You're really troublesome.

529
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Little brother,

530
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
put your hand up.

531
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Put your finger up.

532
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Two.

533
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Let's do this.

534
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Come on.

535
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Three, two, one.

536
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Yeah.

537
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Am I dead?

538
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
You're dead.

539
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
We're back in the dungeon.

540
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
If you don't believe me, try it yourself.

541
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Why aren't you hitting him?

542
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Have I ever hit him?

543
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
He's already woken up.

544
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Han,

545
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
save Sun Ye.

546
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Don't say it.

547
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
My third uncle did it.

548
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Did you hear what we said?

549
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
He's been awake for a while.

550
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
He's too lazy to look up.

551
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
When you're naive,

552
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
you're the only one left.

553
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Do you know where your third uncle is going?

554
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
He's going to Tamutu to find the West King's mother.

555
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
For Chen Wenjin.

556
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
What they're looking for is different.

557
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You know a lot.

558
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I know a fat guy.

559
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
He answered my call after I finished the tape.

560
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
He said he took on a big job.

561
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And he ran away with my third uncle.

562
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Look,

563
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
you're laughing.

564
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Your third uncle's price is really high.

565
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,840
You want a {\an8.0 boleh Doesn't he say bari-baris?

566
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:29,240
No 2' om

567
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,940
I can do anything,

568
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,400
I'm the only Oczywiścieиваем in Kry Pitts,

569
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,400
if I could finish free.

570
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,000
All right,

571
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
don't be mad.

572
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Since we found him,

573
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
then go back to home.

574
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Go back to hell?

575
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
If you don't find the truth,

576
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
we'll let my third uncle deceive us.

577
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And there are some things that I think Xiaoge wants to understand

578
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
All the way from the Seven-Qin Lu Wang Palace to the bottom of the West Desert to the Cloud Sky Palace

579
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Aren't we looking for the same things? Including the Nine Gates

580
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
All the things we've been looking for over the years are the same

581
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Our generation is looking for them, and the previous generation is also looking for them

582
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Third Uncle, Huo Ling, Chen Wenjin

583
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Didn't their archaeological team come down this road?

584
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Now the truth is coming

585
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I have to figure it out

586
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
What does the Nine Gates have to do with you in the previous life?

587
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
How is it not related to me?

588
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Someone in the West Desert looks exactly like me

589
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
The video agent asked me to climb on the ground. How do you explain it?

590
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Isn't he looking for the same things?

591
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
He is my boss

592
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'll look for it after I get the job

593
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
He has to look for it. If he doesn't, he'll die

594
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I saved you, but you don't have to thank me

595
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I've received the reward

596
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Put it on. Don't lose it

597
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Buy seven gifts and give one

598
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
There are gifts. Not bad, not bad

599
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Since everyone is looking for the same things

600
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Is it separate or look for it together?

601
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Look for it together

602
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Miss An Ning, you ask this

603
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Isn't it just looking for it with us?

604
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
rest assured

605
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
understand

606
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
At worst, after finding it, we will separate the single cover

607
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
After all, we have more people

608
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Since we have to look for it together

609
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Do you want to share the information?

610
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Information

611
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Video tape

612
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Didn't you give this video tape to Tianzhen?

613
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Since we have to cooperate, don't play dumb

614
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
From Xisha

615
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Every time we meet, you should be able to see it

616
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
All my clues are cut off

617
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
To be precise, those are not clues

618
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It's an order

619
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
This time my boss ordered me to get the magnetic plate through the tape

620
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Find the West King Mother Palace

621
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
The only clue is Dingzhu Zhuo Ma

622
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Only he knows how to enter

623
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Then Dingzhu Zhuo Ma, where is he?

624
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
We are separated

625
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But the key information is time

626
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
There is not much time

627
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Missed once

628
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Five years

629
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
So we have to enter the Devil City

630
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Find the West King Mother Palace

631
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
An Ning

632
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You received a video tape

633
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I also received one

634
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But the video tape has three parts in total

635
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Who has another one?

636
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
How do you know there are three parts?

637
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Because I have this video tape

638
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Because I have Chen Wenjing's notes

639
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Wait a minute

640
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Now the situation has changed

641
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
The information we got is richer than you

642
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Then you are not enough

643
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Tianzhen, you

644
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
You really didn't get hurt

645
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I have seen almost all the information inside

646
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I don't understand one thing

647
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
What?

648
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
He

649
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Take one

650
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
No more box of rice?

651
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Yes

652
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You ruined the last box

653
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
But you can

654
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Imagine a box of fried rice

655
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
By the way, what's your name?

656
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Just call me Black blind

657
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Think about it with your head

658
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Is it useful to call me Black blind?

659
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
What is your real name?

660
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
It's too hard to hear

661
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I can't call

662
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Then write it to me

663
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It seems that you will be called Black blind or Black blind in the future

664
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Video tape is the last insurance program they set

665
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Video tape foundation

666
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
At first, it means that the people who keep the tape cannot contact me

667
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Either I am dead

668
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Or he has found me

669
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Or he has found him

670
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
They

671
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
He

672
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Little three

673
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
How can I not understand

674
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It's really complicated

675
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
But Chen Wenjing seems to hide a great secret from him

676
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Chen Wenjing and others have studied for so many years

677
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
But they didn't understand

678
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
We can't move in a short time

679
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
We should take a step at a time

680
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
The problem now is

681
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
How can we get out of here?

682
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Fatty, I have found the rules

683
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Do you know

684
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
This is not the original Devil City

685
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Not original?

686
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
This is a huge Yadan land

687
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It's a huge city of mountains and mountains

688
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It consists of dozens of small Devil City

689
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
In the middle is the armory

690
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
And this Devil City is connected by mountains and mountains

691
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And it's connected by the end

692
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It forms a huge Devil City

693
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You mean

694
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
We keep following this cycle

695
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Or

696
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Follow the direction designed by others

697
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
My innocence is smart

698
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
There are many stones in this Devil City

699
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Look at the mess

700
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
It's very tricky

701
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
For example, you go over a mountain

702
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
There are many stones on one side and few stones on the other

703
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I understand

704
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
When you make a quick judgment

705
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You don't know where to go

706
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Your subconscious will tell you the direction to go

707
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
To the stone

708
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Correct

709
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And almost every intersection is the same

710
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Even if you go wrong

711
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
There are countless possibilities to correct you

712
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I'll show you

713
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
This is very common in ancient times

714
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
An ancient man gave it a nice name

715
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's called Qimen Dunjia

716
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
These stones look old

717
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It's probably a battlefield

718
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
This Demon of West should be a master

719
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
So these stones are probably used to defend

720
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Chen Wenjing mentioned in his notes

721
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
This Demon of West

722
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Is protecting itself under a wall

723
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Others can't see it

724
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But they will definitely turn around when they see it

725
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
This place should have been water thousands of years ago

726
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
That is to say

727
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
There is a water belt

728
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Similar to the Fu Cheng River

729
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
It's a circle

730
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
If this water belt is the wall of the city

731
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Then the Demon of West should be in this circle

732
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Or

733
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It's in the middle of the Devil City

734
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
According to Ding Zhuzhuoma

735
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
In the west of this Devil City

736
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Follow the river for two more days

737
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It's the rock pass that disappeared

738
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Between him and Chen Wenjing's team

739
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
The road that goes down

740
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Ding Zhuzhuoma doesn't know it either

741
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
We are going to wait for the third master's team

742
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Follow the river to go down

743
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Because the ancient city must be near the river

744
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
The team used to walk like this

745
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
We can also be lucky

746
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
But the ancient river has reached this point

747
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It's basically connected with the Gobi Lake

748
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I can't see it clearly

749
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
This one

750
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You don't need to

751
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Is it going to rain?

752
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
This is the Gobi Lake

753
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It can't rain once a year

754
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
There is not much time

755
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000

If you miss it once

757
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
You have to wait another five years

758
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
It's very likely to be this rain

759
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
The rain is constantly falling

760
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
The east side is down and the west side is stopped

761
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
This shows a very scary problem

762
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
The Devil City is very large

763
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That's right

764
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And we haven't had news from Wu Sanxing for a long time

765
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
This is not a good sign

766
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
We fell into the oil pipe

767
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
It was just an accident

768
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
But Wu Sanxing's direction

769
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
There will definitely be no mistake

770
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Maybe he didn't want to go

771
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And he went back

772
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
But he didn't want to go

773
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And he went back

774
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
He didn't want to go

775
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And he went back

776
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And we are still going forward

777
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
No

778
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:45,960
Wu Sanxing must find the West King's

779
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
There seems to be something different in here

780
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I don't think there is something behind the rock

781
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It seems to be bright

782
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
The fossil

783
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
It's too late

784
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Even if you can't find the West King's mother

785
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
It's worth seeing the fossil

786
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It's good to study it carefully

787
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
It may be helpful for us to get out of here

788
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
What's wrong?

789
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It's really dirty

790
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
What's wrong, fat man?

791
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
The color of the fossil is not good

792
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
The color is too good

793
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
You see for yourself

794
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Now there is no GBS on the body

795
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
GBS

796
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
It's been here for at least 60 or 70 years

797
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
70 or 80 years

798
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Right?

799
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Yes

800
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
18 degrees

801
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
It must have run out

802
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Come on

803
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Where are we going?

804
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Now there is no chance left

805
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Come on

806
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
This word should make you in this kind of situation

807
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Leave your beautiful

808
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Wait a minute, I'm sorry

809
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Come on

810
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Ready

811
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Where do you start from?

812
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
From the head

813
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I have a bad eye in the past

814
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I've been looking for people

815
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
OK

816
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
This position

817
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Brother Xu is in the front

818
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Brother Xu is in the front

819
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Don't look at the phone

820
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Brother Xu is in the front

821
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Come on

822
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
OK, come on

823
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
You give me the phone

824
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
No

825
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
What is this?

826
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I'm sorry

827
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm sorry

828
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I'll let you touch it

829
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
You didn't go

830
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Take a picture

831
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Take a picture

832
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Come on

833
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Take a picture

834
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Take a picture

835
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Come on

836
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Take a picture

837
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
You didn't take the bag

838
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I forgot

839
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Oh my god

840
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Come on

841
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I think you are a superman

842
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Come on, I'm sorry

843
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Wait a minute

844
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
You are in the front

845
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
You can't be with me

846
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Come on

847
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Next

848
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I have too many clues

849
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I don't have to explain

850
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I'm sorry

851
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Let's start from the head

852
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
OK, you look

853
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Thank you

854
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Just under an invisible wall

855
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I'm sorry

856
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Wait a minute

857
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I'm sorry

858
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Next

859
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I have too many clues

860
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
These roads

861
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm sorry

862
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Let's follow the shadow

863
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Go

864
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
OK, take a picture

865
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
The color of the painting is not good

866
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
The color is too good

867
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I'm sorry

868
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
OK, start from the head

869
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Don't go

870
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
You have to tidy up the equipment

871
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Did you take it?

872
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I took it all

873
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I took it all

874
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Quiet

875
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Let's start from the head
