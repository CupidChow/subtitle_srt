00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Water.

6
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Water.

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Water.

8
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Water.

9
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
How long has it been?

10
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't know.

11
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's been a few days.

12
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's not just a short time.

13
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
How much food do you have left?

14
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
There's a good news

15
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and a bad news.

16
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Which one do you want to hear?

17
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The bad one.

18
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
There's only one pack of duck cookies left.

19
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Okay.

20
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You're so good at acting.

21
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The last pack of cookies after eating.

22
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm not sure.

23
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll leave.

24
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Eat it when you're hungry.

25
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Sleep a little longer.

26
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You won't know if you fall asleep.

27
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

28
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Are you almost there?

29
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If we can't get out before dark...

30
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's eat this supplement.

31
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay.

32
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay.

33
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Second Master, thank god.

34
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm not good at cooking.

35
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Let me tell you.

36
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
There are many types of supplements.

37
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's right.

38
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Chicken bones can be stewed.

39
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Chicken bones with meat.

40
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Cut into pieces.

41
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You can fry it.

42
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay.

43
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I can't eat chicken bones.

44
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I can't eat chicken bones.

45
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You can fry tomatoes with meat.

46
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You can eat it with skin.

47
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You can eat it with onion.

48
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
When the onion is completely cooked,

49
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh my god.

50
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh my god.

51
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
My waist is not good.

52
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Finally,

53
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I found two ribs.

54
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
When the chicken bones are crispy,

55
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Sprinkle with cumin and chili powder.

56
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's so delicious.

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
When the oil and fat are bubbling,

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Sprinkle with a handful of chopped green onion.

59
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's so delicious.

60
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Second Master.

61
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm so tired.

62
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I haven't had a good sleep.

63
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
People have their own thoughts.

64
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
People have their own dreams.

65
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Brother.

66
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
If mom doesn't come out,

67
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'll be sorry to the hungry fat man.

68
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And I'll be sorry to me.

69
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You know to come out.

70
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Qi Ling.

71
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Brother.

72
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
When did you come out?

73
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Stop pretending.

74
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I know you're lying to me.

75
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You can't lie to me.

76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Is it possible that there is only Shiyi?

77
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Don't talk nonsense.

78
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
She didn't lose her memory.

79
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Zhang Qi Ling.

80
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Zhang Qi Ling.

81
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Brother.

82
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Zhang Qi Ling.

83
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Nothing happened.

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Nothing happened.

85
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Did Brother see something scary

86
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
inside?

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
He was shocked.

88
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Impossible.

89
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Brother didn't see anything.

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
How could he be scared?

91
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Brother.

92
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What's inside?

93
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Brother.

94
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Look at me.

95
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm a fat man.

96
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Do you remember?

97
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Brother.

98
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Brother.

99
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What's wrong?

100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
There's a goddess inside.

101
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
There's nothing.

102
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Did she blink?

103
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Impossible.

104
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Xiaohua said

105
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
she hoped I would go in.

106
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You just now

107
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
could it be...

108
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Xiaohua.

109
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Hurry up.

110
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Hurry up.

111
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Tianzhen.

112
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Did you really see

113
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
the mother of hope?

114
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's exactly the same.

115
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
How is that possible?

116
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The real mother of hope

117
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
is still in Yunyue Forest?

118
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Could it be that she really

119
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
is immortal?

120
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I can't believe it.

121
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I hope

122
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
it's a fantasy I made up.

123
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Don't worry about anything else.

124
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Brother is out too.

125
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Let's go.

126
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Hurry up.

127
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Hurry up.

128
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
There's an enemy.

129
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The mother of hope.

130
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The mother of hope.

131
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Brother.

132
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's just that tooth

133
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
that's more powerful than the sky.

134
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Tianzhen.

135
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Are you crazy?

136
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I was scared to death.

137
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I was scared to death.

138
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I was scared to death.

139
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I was scared to death.

140
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Didn't you just

141
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
look pretty manly?

142
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Don't mention it.

143
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I almost cried.

144
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Although Brother Xiaohua lost his memory,

145
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
he still remembers

146
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
the guy who saved his life.

147
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Stop talking nonsense.

148
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Let's go.

149
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Wait.

150
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
This is a mark left by the flower.

151
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It seems to be.

152
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Let's go.

153
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Here, drink the spicy one.

154
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's not spicy.

155
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's not spicy.

156
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's not spicy.

157
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's not spicy.

158
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's not spicy.

159
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Give me the bone soup.

160
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What's wrong with you?

161
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Just two glasses of wine.

162
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There's wine.

163
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
There's wine.

164
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The wine is here.

165
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's good.

166
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's good.

167
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's good.

168
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm grateful that you two

169
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
didn't throw me in the desert.

170
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm afraid

171
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I can't forget

172
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
your kindness and kindness for the rest of my life.

173
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Here.

174
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This is the mark left by us

175
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and Sanye.

176
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Help me.

177
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
There's a mark of the body.

178
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Fatty.

179
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Where's my third uncle?

180
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Don't talk nonsense.

181
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Look.

182
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The flower has also

183
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
marked a path for us.

184
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Besides,

185
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
the flower is now

186
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
a serious relative

187
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
with your third uncle.

188
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It won't let him go.

189
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Let's leave here first.

190
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You're right.

191
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It must be Xiao Hua who took him away.

192
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Let's go.

193
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
How about I do it?

194
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yes.

195
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Be careful.

196
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's not hot anymore.

197
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's for you.

198
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
This...

199
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You two are so nice to me.

200
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Let's drink a glass of water.

201
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
No.

202
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What did Hua Yi draw for us?

203
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
This is not the path

204
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
we took when we came here.

205
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
We won't starve to death here, will we?

206
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
When we were little,

207
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
who let you eat so much?

208
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's so good to eat now.

209
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You can't eat it.

210
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You can't eat it.

211
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You can't eat it.

212
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You can't eat it.

213
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You can't eat it.

214
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You can't eat it.

215
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You can't eat it.

216
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
After you eat up some water,

217
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
after you drink it,

218
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
you'll think about your family.

219
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:11,720
Also think about your own

220
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
family.

221
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Well,

222
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
How is it? Chicken flavor?

223
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,000
Lobster flavor

224
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,200
Australian

225
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,100
Right

226
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,900
I have to check Lu Huangbo next. Together?

227
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,900
I

228
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,300
have other plans

229
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
What plans?

230
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Hmm

231
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,500
Forget it. I shouldn't ask.

232
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,500
What about you? Back to Beijing?

233
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Hmm

234
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,200
What about you?

235
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,000
I have to go back to Hangzhou first. Then I will go to work.

236
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Hello, it's me.

237
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
You have to book two tickets for me.

238
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
One to Hangzhou and one to Beijing.

239
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Why do you ask them? Just book it.

240
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
First class. You have to be first class.

241
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Keep it.

242
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Hey, actually I

243
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's all in the ball.

244
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's all in the ball.

245
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's all in the ball.

246
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
была

247
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You try to drink egg whites too

248
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,080
Here is the Everything

249
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,620
Tianzhen, this poison is not as poisonous as mine.

250
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,180
I have to find one for my little brother too.

251
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,380
Big Brother, here. Eat.

252
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,700
Let's go. Let's go up and take a look.

253
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,940
Let's go.

254
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,600
It's dangerous or what,

255
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,500
there are weapons here.

256
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,400
Down there!

257
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,840
What is this?

258
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,060
Hey!

259
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,340
Lift a bag of gun booklet.

260
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,400
Ivan!

261
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,860
Where are the gun bullets?

262
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,000
They were put in there.

263
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,300
Why did you want to die?

264
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,140
Then why are you here?

265
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,980
Leave this place and die

266
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,640
This verdacious life

267
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,140
I wish to be with you

268
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,040
sings

269
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,820
Kim glasses

270
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,300
Kim glasses

271
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,500
Kim glasses

272
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,500
Chusedo

273
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,460
Wasn't right

274
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,680
Thanks.

275
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,260
Han Ze.

276
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,740
Master San.

277
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,020
You are finally awake.

278
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,900
Where's Ke?

279
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,160
He is a little bit panic.

280
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:55,480
API

281
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,240
All right, Tianzhen

282
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,560
Let Brother Green sleep for a while

283
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,720
Let's meet and save meaningful people

284
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,240
Have some water

285
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:14,860
I just feel

286
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,360
a little pressure

287
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,440
You should drink more

288
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,160
Don't worry

289
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,620
Now I got a lot of water

290
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,320
At that time

291
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,780
I'll drink some less

292
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,540
Thank you

293
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:37,540
You should put up your FUCK

294
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,160
You haven't water in a while

295
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,220
But don't drink everything at once

296
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,220
and me

297
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,580
I didn't see you

298
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,860
We just arrived here

299
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,660
It's not long

300
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,140
We haven't seen anyone else

301
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,140
come out of here yet

302
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,620
He was in front of us

303
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,300
and left a mark on us

304
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,580
Don't worry

305
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,460
He'll be fine

306
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,740
Ma Nan

307
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,260
Our brother

308
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,620
seems to have lost his soul

309
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,140
in the West Lake Palace

310
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,900
Is there any way

311
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,860
to find this soul back?

312
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:13,980
No

313
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,140
I have walked solo

314
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,380
for so many months

315
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,540
I've lost the sense of listened

316
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,540
and had a struggle

317
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,940
sometimes

318
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,300
I know

319
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,260
You are a good person

320
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,460
and I know few people

321
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,700
While everyone has to wait心

322
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,260
and find what they want

323
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,540
My grandma said

324
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,700
まだ

325
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,660
The little brother didn't get his soul

326
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:34,940
He did

327
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,580
I hid his soul

328
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,100
I just need him to find it

329
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,660
If he can't find it

330
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,900
He will definitely find it back

331
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,900
Even if he can't find it back

332
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,900
There's still me

333
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,900
Is there any other way?

334
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,900
For example, put a plaster on the belly

335
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,900
Put some grass in the ear

336
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,900
And the one that jumps

337
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,900
Chaxi, how should we go on the back road?

338
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,900
I will send you to the road

339
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,900
But the road after that depends on you

340
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,900
Thank you

341
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,900
It's okay, it's okay

342
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,900
Thank you

343
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,900
By the way, what is this water?

344
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,900
It tastes quite strange

345
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,900
This will be your life's gift

346
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,900
Yang Fen egg

347
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,900
It's really unique

348
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,900
I will remember this taste for the rest of my life

349
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,900
Thank you

350
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,900
Thank you

351
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,900
Thank you

352
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,900
You say such a good road

353
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,900
Why don't you have a travel friend?

354
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,900
I'm on the road

355
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,900
There's a car

356
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,900
Brother

357
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,900
You guys are pretty fierce

358
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,900
You guys are pretty fierce

359
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,900
From the northeast, Tie

360
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,900
From the northeast, where are you from?

361
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,900
I'm from Cang Village

362
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,900
From Cang Village

363
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,900
That little brother from Changbai Mountain

364
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,900
Changbai Mountain, do you know him?

365
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,900
I know him

366
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,900
Hurry up

367
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,900
Thank you, Tie

368
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,900
Please eat chicken soup with tofu in Cang Village

369
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,900
It's nothing, you're welcome

370
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,900
Yuexuan

371
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,140
Ye Lin

372
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,900
Hong Sanxing

373
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,900
Little fox

374
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,900
Stop running

375
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,900
I didn't mention it

376
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,900
It's for your own good

377
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,900
I'm your Third Uncle

378
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,900
I'm not nice to you

379
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,900
Who is nice to you?

380
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,900
the legend of death is more than living.

381
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,400
We do this thing very similar to them.

382
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,900
Death can be met.

383
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,900
I just don't know if it's today or tomorrow.

384
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,400
Don't worry.

385
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,900
I'm the third master of the Wu family. I can't be left out.

386
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,400
It's good to forget everything.

387
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,900
This trip is too bad.

388
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,900
The three of us

389
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,900
will all be in the hospital for half a month.

390
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,900
All right.

391
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,900
I should thank my old iron in the northeast.

392
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,400
It's been half a month. He's still not awake.

393
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,900
Didn't this bring the special guest from Beijing to see it?

394
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,900
Don't worry.

395
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,900
Hello, doctor.

396
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,900
Heart rate.

397
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,900
83.

398
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,900
Blood pressure.

399
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,400
117.68.

400
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Pancreas.

401
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,400
95.

402
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:41,900
Breath.

403
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,900
Stable.

404
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,400
What's the situation now?

405
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,900
It's just a fever. It's nothing serious.

406
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,900
Just need to water and sleep.

407
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,400
Dr. Liang.

408
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,900
Actually, this patient, besides having a fever,

409
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,900
there's also a bit...

410
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,400
He's a bit confused here.

411
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,900
He can't remember a lot of things.

412
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,400
So, when he wakes up,

413
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,900
he doesn't even know who we are.

414
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,900
This really makes the family collapse.

415
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,400
But we can't make a conclusion in a short time.

416
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
It could be something that's stimulating.

417
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,900
It could also be caused by medicine.

418
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,900
We need to keep checking.

419
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,900
Thank you, doctor.

420
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,900
Thank you.

421
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,900
You said his body temperature was always this high.

422
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,900
The fever didn't go away.

423
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,900
He even burned his tattoo.

424
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,900
He said one thing from up there.

425
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,900
He said...

426
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,900
He said he didn't have time.

427
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,900
Who knows what that means?

428
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,900
When Xiao Ge lost his memory,

429
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,900
no one would know what he saw inside.

430
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,900
Yes.

431
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,900
What's inside?

432
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,900
Now he's the only one who knows.

433
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,900
He forgot about something else.

434
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,900
As long as he doesn't...

435
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,900
Family members, don't shout in the ward.

436
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,900
This will affect the patient's normal rest.

437
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,900
We understand, Dr. Liang.

438
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,900
If there's anything,

439
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,900
why don't we talk outside?

440
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,900
Yes, outside.

441
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,900
I haven't finished yet.

442
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,900
Wait, wait.

443
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,900
I've been feeling very uncomfortable lately.

444
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,900
Do you think I'm...

445
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,900
Yes.

446
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,900
I'm not sick.

447
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,900
I said you...

448
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,900
Doctor, I know.

449
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,900
We won't talk.

450
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,900
Yes.

451
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,900
We'll have a dental appointment.

452
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,900
Yes.

453
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,900
Thank you, Dr. Liang.

454
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,900
See you later.

455
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,900
See you.

456
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,900
Hello?

457
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,900
Hello?

458
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,900
Hello?

459
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,900
Hello?

460
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,900
Hello?

461
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,900
Hello?

462
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,900
Hello?

463
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,900
Hello?

464
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,900
Hello?

465
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,900
Hello?

466
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,900
Hello?

467
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,900
Hello?

468
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,900
Hello?

469
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,900
Hello?

470
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,900
Hello?

471
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,900
Hello?

472
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,900
Hello?

473
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,900
Hello?

474
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,900
Hello?

475
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,900
Hello?

476
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,900
Hello?

477
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,900
Hello?

478
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,900
Hello?

479
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,900
Hello?

480
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,900
Hello?

481
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,900
Hello?

482
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,900
Hello?

483
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,900
Hello?

484
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,900
Hello?

485
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,900
Hello?

486
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,900
Hello?

487
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,900
Hello?

488
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,900
Hello?

489
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,900
Hello?

490
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,900
Hello?

491
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,900
Hello?

492
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,900
Hello?

493
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,660
Hello?

494
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,900
Hello?

495
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,900
Hello?

496
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,900
Hello?

497
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,900
I've already made a decision.

498
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,900
Your father...

499
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,900
My father?

500
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,900
My father?

501
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,900
What about our mouth search...

502
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,900
Bring it, I...

503
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,900
I don't believe my father.

504
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,900
What are you going to do?

505
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,900
I'm sorry.

506
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,500
You're recovering well.

507
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,300
How is Xiao Ge?

508
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,100
She lost her memory again.

509
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,300
How is she?

510
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,500
You didn't see Wu San Xing.

511
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,700
She didn't come out with you.

512
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:31,900
Didn't you and the Dark Eye

513
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,500
take Xie Ling Huan out?

514
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,700
When I was with the Dark Eye,

515
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,500
she was already gone.

516
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,700
No, didn't you look for her?

517
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,300
I did.

518
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,500
How could I not look for her?

519
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,100
She was hurt so badly.

520
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,700
I couldn't find her.

521
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,500
She should have gone out by herself.

522
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,300
She was moved out by herself.

523
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,100
She was moved out by herself.

524
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,700
She was moved out by herself.

525
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,300
Do you know that?

526
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,700
You saw her body.

527
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,500
Wu Xin.

528
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,100
Listen to me.

529
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,100
There are only two situations now.

530
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,700
The first one is that she's dead.

531
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,100
It's useless to find her.

532
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,100
The second one is that she's still alive.

533
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,300
She walked out by herself.

534
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,500
I believe in Xie Ling Huan.

535
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,900
I don't believe in Wu San Xing.

536
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,500
19 years ago,

537
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,100
I didn't believe that Xie Ling Huan was dead.

538
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,300
It's the same now.

539
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,700
I believe in Wu San Xing.

540
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,700
She's still alive.

541
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,900
She always said

542
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,500
that she didn't let me investigate

543
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,700
and let me get involved.

544
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,300
She just let me stay in Hangzhou.

545
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,500
But the places she's been to these years,

546
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,900
I've been to them all.

547
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,900
I've experienced them all.

548
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,700
Have you ever thought about

549
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,700
that she's actually

550
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,900
leading you to curiosity

551
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,100
and let you explore it all the way?

552
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,300
There are secrets in the Nine Gates.

553
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,100
Among the generations,

554
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,700
you're the only one who's been there.

555
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,900
It seems so.

556
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,100
After Chen Wen Jin and the West Sand Valley,

557
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,500
it's been more than ten years.

558
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,900
There's no new action

559
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,700
in the Nine Gates.

560
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,700
Until we're in this generation.

561
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,100
You've been exploring it all the way.

562
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,900
Whether it's Wu San Xing

563
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,700
or Xie Ling Huan,

564
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,100
it's very likely

565
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,900
that they have a new plan

566
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,900
after the West Sand Valley.

567
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,300
And you

568
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,300
are a part of the plan.

569
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,100
You mean

570
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,100
I've been arranged by the Nine Gates?

571
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,700
No.

572
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,100
The Nine Gates chose you.

573
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,100
Chose me?

574
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,100
Why?

575
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,500
I want to know why you were chosen.

576
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,900
As for why you were chosen,

577
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,700
I'm also curious.

578
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,100
Which part of me is inferior to you?

579
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,500
I've never been arranged by anyone.

580
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,300
I can find the West Sand Valley

581
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,700
with a piece of the Luhuang Bo.

582
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,300
But you, Wu Xie,

583
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,100
you should be more serious.

584
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,700
What exactly is the Nine Gates hiding?

585
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,100
Where did my Third Uncle go?

586
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,100
And Xiao Ge's corpse.

587
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,700
I'll find out.

588
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,100
I'll find out.

589
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,100
Not for the Nine Gates,

590
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,900
but for the people around me.

591
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,700
I'll find out, too.

592
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,100
Second Uncle,

593
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,100
I've been away from Hangzhou

594
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,100
and experienced some extraordinary things.

595
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,300
We went to Qinghai,

596
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,500
went into the desert,

597
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,700
walked past the armory,

598
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,300
and arrived at the jade forest.

599
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,100
We found the West King's tomb.

600
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,500
We also learned about

601
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,100
some of the truth about the West Sand Sea Tomb.

602
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,100
Some of them

603
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,900
will never change.

604
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,100
But the price is gradually losing self-awareness.

605
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,700
The only way is to enter the jade forest.

606
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,500
Xiao Ge,

607
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,700
have a bottle.

608
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,700
Here.

609
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,300
The big game arranged by Xie Lian Huan

610
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,300
is also being played in this jade forest.

611
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,300
I don't know if Xie Lian Huan has done any lowly deeds.

612
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,700
I don't know where Wu San Xing is now.

613
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,100
Little Third Uncle.

614
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:24,900
Tan Zi,

615
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,100
have you healed your wound?

616
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,700
How is Third Uncle?

617
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,300
Has Hua Yi brought Third Uncle out?

618
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,300
Xiao Hua didn't find them.

619
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,500
Didn't find them?

620
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,900
Didn't find them?

621
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,300
Or didn't find the body?

622
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,100
I don't know.

623
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,100
I don't know.

624
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,300
I didn't find them.

625
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,300
Tan Zi.

626
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,700
There will be no accident.

627
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,700
Third Uncle won't die.

628
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,900
I'll go back to the factory

629
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,100
to help him guard the port.

630
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,300
Third Uncle will definitely come back.

631
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,100
Okay.

632
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,300
I'll book you a ticket to the factory.

633
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,900
You'll be the one

634
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,700
who will help me with Third Uncle's business.

635
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,900
Little Third Uncle, you must take care.

636
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,300
If you have any news about Third Uncle,

637
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,300
please let me know.

638
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,300
Qing Shan will never change.

639
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,500
The law will always remain.

640
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,500
Brother, let's meet again.

641
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,500
Let's meet again.

642
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,100
I'll go now.

643
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,300
Go.

644
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,100
Little Third Uncle has already transferred to the psychiatry department.

645
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,100
I'm hungry.

646
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,100
It doesn't look like there's any improvement.

647
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,100
Why don't you stay here first?

648
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,500
Okay.

649
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,100
I never answer your calls.

650
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,700
I sent you an email.

651
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,300
He's replying to my calls.

652
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,300
Second Uncle.

653
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,500
You don't have to worry about the rest.

654
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,700
I'll handle it.

655
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,300
But Third Uncle...

656
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,700
I've said it.

657
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,100
I'll handle it.

658
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,700
How will you handle it?

659
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,500
You always say that.

660
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,100
You never tell me anything.

661
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,100
I've arranged everything for you.

662
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,700
But I'm involved in everything.

663
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,500
I'm telling you, Second Uncle.

664
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,100
You either let me investigate this matter

665
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,300
or tell me what happened.

666
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,900
I'll tell you everything.

667
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,500
Then tell me what happened.

668
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,700
I'm not telling you because you're doing this for your own good.

669
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,100
Are you doing this for my own good,

670
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,500
for the Wu Family's good,

671
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,100
or for the sake of your family?

672
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,900
Go back to Hangzhou.

673
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,700
I'll tell you in person.

674
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:20,900
Okay.

675
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,700
Okay then. See you tomorrow.

676
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,700
Come on.

677
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,900
Come on.

678
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,700
Come on.

679
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,900
Come on.

680
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,500
Come on.

681
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,700
It's so big.

682
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,900
Okay.

683
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,100
Oh, no.

684
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,700
Besides,

685
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,100
now, Grandpa Hua

686
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,300
and Third Uncle

687
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,500
are probably...

688
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,500
Grandpa Hua and Third Uncle...

689
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,300
Change the phone.

690
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,500
This...

691
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,300
I'm sorry.

692
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:28,900
Where's the rice-soup?

693
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,500
Where?

694
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,100
Here.

695
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,900
You've already taken it out.

696
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,700
It's finally out.

697
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,700
Here.

698
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,300
Yes.

699
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
I'm here.

700
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,900
Here?

701
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,500
How do we...

702
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,300
How do we feed it?

703
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,300
Okay.

704
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,500
Here.

705
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,100
Hey, Zui.

706
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,100
Hey.

707
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,900
It's quite stable here.

708
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,100
Let's go.

709
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,300
It's from the Northeast, Tie.

710
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,300
From the Northeast?

711
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,500
We have the Northeast.

712
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,700
Our little brother

713
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,300
from Mount Changbai.

714
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,900
It's from the Northeast, Tie.

715
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,900
From the Northeast?

716
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,700
I didn't find the camera.

717
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,700
Thank you.

718
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,700
Okay.

719
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,300
Ready?

720
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,100
Ready.

721
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:27,700
Go.

722
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,300
Wan Licheng.

723
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,700
Okay.

724
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,700
Okay.

725
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,700
One more.

726
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,700
Actually, this patient

727
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,900
has a little bit of fever.

728
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,300
Let's go.

729
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,300
What are you doing?

730
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,300
Don't touch it.

731
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,300
Just...

732
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,300
Family, don't make noise in the hospital.

733
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,300
It doesn't matter to others.

734
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,900
As long as you don't make noise in the hospital,

735
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,500
it will affect others' rest.

736
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,100
Rest?

737
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,300
What are you doing?

738
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,900
We are having sex.

739
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,100
You don't have Wu Sanxing?

740
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,700
She and you...

741
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,300
Stop.

742
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,900
Stop.
