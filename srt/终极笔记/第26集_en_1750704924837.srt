00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,640
Episode 51

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,100
I wouldn't be able to survive if I are killed like an animal

3
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,560
How am I supposed to survive if I am only killing?

4
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,360
I am a human being

5
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:24,740
How am I supposed to survive if I am only fighting like a animal?

6
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,060
They should be able to survive

7
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,260
The entrance is not here.

8
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,100
Change the location.

9
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,660
You're not good at searching the mountain.

10
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,500
Why are you taking pictures?

11
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Where's the travel agency?

12
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,500
This mountain is too big.

13
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,300
Our boss has come up with a new way

14
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,500
to search the mountain in a way of inspection.

15
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,740
I'm going to take pictures of all the landmines here

16
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,980
and send them to the headquarters

17
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,020
to get some equipment.

18
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,780
You're taking pictures of me

19
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,300
like a bandit.

20
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:08,740
Let me see.

21
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,420
Since we came to Ba Nai,

22
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,260
someone has been following us.

23
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,700
We found the exit of Xiao Ge's house.

24
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,060
We just found the iron box.

25
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,940
The bandit came out to rob us.

26
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,460
How come it's so heavy?

27
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,900
Someone is robbing us.

28
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:30,940
Go after them.

29
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:34,940
No.

30
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,660
The secret of Ba Nai is kept

31
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,740
by his shoulder.

32
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,820
He always tries to do something

33
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,340
to us.

34
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,460
How come the younger brother of Chu Guang Tou

35
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,460
got the pictures of us?

36
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,260
Yes.

37
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,380
We have Xiao Ge

38
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,980
in all the pictures we took.

39
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,580
Brother,

40
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,700
in theory,

41
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,220
Xiao Ge's pictures

42
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,420
should be more valuable

43
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,380
than the pictures on his shoulder.

44
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,380
So this picture

45
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,580
has no meaning at all.

46
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,380
Isn't it a waste of money?

47
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,900
Chu Guang Tou is in trouble.

48
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,860
When will your boss send the equipment?

49
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,420
It will take several days

50
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,780
to transport it from abroad.

51
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,900
You guys continue.

52
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,780
I'm going to take pictures.

53
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,620
How about this?

54
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,620
Let's go find Chu Guang Tou again.

55
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,180
Before Third Uncle entered Tamu Tuo,

56
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,140
he had found Chu Guang Tou.

57
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,780
Maybe he will contact him again.

58
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,580
In this way,

59
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,740
we may be able to contact Third Uncle.

60
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,340
Okay.

61
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,380
You go find Chu Guang Tou.

62
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,260
I'll stay and continue to search the mountain.

63
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,460
Xiao Ge,

64
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,340
I'm a little worried about Fatty's current state.

65
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,540
I'm afraid he will still go to his shoulder.

66
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,620
How about you stay and accompany him?

67
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,340
Fatty,

68
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,340
Xiao Ge's memory hasn't recovered yet.

69
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,340
You have to take good care of him.

70
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,740
Don't worry.

71
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,020
Don't worry.

72
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,820
I've been dreaming about that again recently.

73
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,540
For many years,

74
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,660
I've been unable to get rid of this dream.

75
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,340
I don't know if Wu Bei is doing well.

76
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,500
He has been walking on the coffin

77
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,780
for half a year.

78
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,340
I hope to meet you guys.

79
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,580
There is one thing

80
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,980
I haven't said yet.

81
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,140
Maybe it's important

82
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,700
to think about it now.

83
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,540
I hope to continue to meet you guys in person

84
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,260
and only be old friends.

85
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,460
Brother Xiao Hua,

86
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,420
is this method working or not?

87
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,340
It's not clear

88
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,620
what this old friend

89
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,940
is talking about.

90
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,060
Don't worry.

91
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,020
Those who know the secret back then

92
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,700
will know what we are talking about.

93
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,980
We'll send these letters

94
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,620
in the name of your grandma.

95
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,420
And then?

96
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:08,900
Wait.

97
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,140
That picture of Ba Nai

98
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,980
was indeed arranged by Third Master.

99
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,220
Since my third uncle gave you the picture,

100
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,980
can you contact him?

101
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,460
That's Third Master.

102
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,700
He is a man of great power.

103
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,660
How can I go to him?

104
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,500
If it was before,

105
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,700
maybe there would be a chance.

106
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,900
But these few months,

107
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,940
Third Master has completely disappeared.

108
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,260
Third Master

109
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,380
is really a man of great power.

110
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,180
He told me this morning

111
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,940
that you would

112
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,860
definitely come to him.

113
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,740
He is a man of great power.

114
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,500
No one knows what he is thinking.

115
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,420
He also said

116
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,940
that you

117
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,100
would come to me

118
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,020
for the second time

119
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,540
after you had a fight with me.

120
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,380
What do you mean?

121
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,260
Third Master has ordered

122
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,860
that if you come to me again,

123
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,740
I will give you something else.

124
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,420
If you really want to love me

125
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,420
for two times in a row,

126
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,220
then come to me.

127
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,620
Check this.

128
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,180
Can you allow me to spend three hours to love you in my heart tonight?

129
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:45,140
реж

130
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:52,940
Based on the

131
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,340
I'll be there soon.

132
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,740
Boss.

133
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,540
You've been reading for so long, right?

134
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,340
You must be hungry.

135
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,340
Have a bowl of noodles.

136
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,340
Have a bowl of noodles, boss.

137
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,540
Boss, this is from Hangzhou to Changsha.

138
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,740
Third Uncle usually has a lot of noodles.

139
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,140
I'll have some for you.

140
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,140
Thank you.

141
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,940
This is from Hangzhou to Changsha.

142
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,940
Third Uncle usually stays at

143
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,940
the hotel to watch the sunset.

144
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,740
Longji is being sent here to watch the sunset.

145
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,540
I can tell what it means.

146
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,540
But what do you think

147
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,340
the golden list means?

148
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:08,940
Does Third Uncle

149
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,940
have any special plans for the New Year?

150
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,740
No.

151
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,140
Then is there any secret?

152
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,540
If it's a secret,

153
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,540
I've left a line before.

154
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,940
The place where the five great masters live.

155
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,940
Others don't know what it means.

156
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,740
Then what does it mean?

157
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,740
The bottom of the river.

158
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,540
The bottom of the five great masters.

159
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,740
Isn't that a line from Hangzhou?

160
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,940
Boss.

161
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,340
Boss, come here.

162
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,940
Have some water, boss.

163
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,540
Here.

164
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,740
In 1976,

165
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,140
it was the planning economy, right?

166
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,340
At that time,

167
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,340
there were records of the salary.

168
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,540
Yes.

169
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,140
My grandma still has the account book

170
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,140
and the cheque.

171
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,140
If this golden list

172
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,340
is the supplementary record of the Ba Nai Bar Inventory Team in 1976,

173
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,140
do you want to tell me

174
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,540
the information of the team members is still here?

175
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,540
Information?

176
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,140
The first team member is dead.

177
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,140
But the second team member

178
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,940
is still alive as their identity.

179
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,540
If I can find

180
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,140
the list of the first team member,

181
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,940
I can find those

182
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,740
who are alive for the dead.

183
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,340
No.

184
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:40,940
You...

185
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,740
What do you mean by alive?

186
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,740
You don't understand.

187
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,340
Don't ask.

188
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,540
It's for your own good.

189
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,740
For my own good?

190
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,340
You're so anxious to call me here.

191
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,540
Is there any big deal?

192
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,540
Yes.

193
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,340
We need a big deal this time.

194
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,340
Big deal?

195
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,340
Go to find those who are dead

196
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,140
but still alive.

197
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,540
Cut.

198
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:16,740
Cut.

199
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:34,740
P LT,

200
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,180
Good.

201
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,580
Wu소

202
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,980
These are ordinaryalloys

203
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,800
hat is wrong?

204
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,840
Look at the three words you have written.

205
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,620
Hej.

206
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,460
Do you ever prepare the toilet paper?

207
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,240
I...

208
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,080

Ok.

213
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,480
You're being arrested.

214
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,940
Don't show mercy

215
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,660
You don't have the authority

216
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,340
I can only find public information

217
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,260
OK, you can find out what you can find

218
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,300
Thank you

219
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,780
Name

220
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,780
Chen Wenjin

221
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,980
Erdong Chen

222
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,540
Wen Jinxiu of culture

223
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,820
Erdong Chen

224
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,220
Wen Jinxiu of culture

225
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,700
Jinxiu of Jin

226
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
No

227
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,900
Then help me check

228
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,540
1985 West Sand Exams

229
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,260
Name

230
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,180
Xie Lianhuan

231
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,380
It means to break the nine rings

232
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,300
Still no

233
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,540
Xie Xia, let's go

234
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,980
Don't move

235
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,740
Boss, I found it

236
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,380
I moved a few times before and after the institute

237
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,660
But the last time in 1976

238
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,340
It was in the old school building of Changsha University

239
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,180
It hasn't been moved yet

240
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,180
Should be able to find

241
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,220
it is good

242
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,420
Zhang Zhe

243
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,380
Don't move

244
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,180
What are you guys doing

245
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,820
Security brother

246
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,020
Long time no see

247
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,420
You are thin

248
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,620
What do you mean I'm thin

249
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,540
Who are you

250
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,340
Who am i

251
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:46,940
You forgot me

252
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,140
I just graduated last year

253
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,940
Just graduated

254
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,020
This school is still wearing

255
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,100
Don't say

256
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,140
Is

257
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,620
I have some impression

258
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,340
Who are you

259
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,180
I

260
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,900
He and I are in the same dormitory

261
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:09,820
You forgot

262
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,660
In the same dormitory

263
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,220
Look more mature than you

264
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,500
Security brother, look

265
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,580
You still haven't changed

266
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,980
You are still so humorous

267
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,100
Wait a minute

268
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,700
No, what's wrong with your dormitory?

269
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,860
OK OK OK

270
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,500
Even if it's a school friend

271
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,100
Can't just go in, right?

272
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,700
So now the school is strict

273
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,340
You can only

274
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,740
Take a walk in that campus

275
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,380
Okay

276
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,380
understand

277
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,060
We haven't been back for too long

278
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,500
I took two pictures and left

279
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,420
Go

280
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,020
Thank you

281
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,260
Remember to come out quickly

282
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:48,780
it is good

283
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:06,880
but

284
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,860
This will probably be this one

285
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,300
boss

286
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,820
It's broken

287
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,580
The cord is broken

288
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,420
What пропley is still glued on it

289
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:27,940
You two

290
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,860
Why still haven't left

291
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:30,700
Then

292
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,700
I'm talking to you

293
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
Come

294
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,700
Very good, come

295
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,700
What's going on

296
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,700
Didn't hear me talk

297
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,700
One more, one more

298
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,700
I'm talking about you two

299
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,700
What's going on

300
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,700
Security brother, come together

301
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,700
Come come come

302
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,700
One two three

303
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,700
Okay

304
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,700
You just talked to us

305
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,700
We didn't hear it too much, sorry

306
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,700
No, I said what's going on with you two

307
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,700
Didn't you say it

308
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,700
Can only walk around the campus

309
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,700
Just go

310
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,700
Go go go

311
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,700
Wait a minute

312
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,700
That two of you

313
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,700
Leave a entry and exit record

314
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,700
That

315
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,700
Otherwise, the above will punish me

316
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,700
No problem

317
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,700
Cooperate, cooperate, cooperate

318
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,700
When you two were in school

319
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,700
Also very good

320
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,700
Okay

321
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Good

322
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,700
This is your school badge

323
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,700
When did this fall

324
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,700
I'm leaving first

325
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,700
Thank you

326
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,700
Thank you

327
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,700
Can't you shoot it clearly

328
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,700
The screen is so small

329
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,700
Can't even see the words clearly

330
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,700
Is there any information

331
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,700
Information from the past 90s

332
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,700
90s

333
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,700
Wind

334
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,700
Isn't this font familiar?

335
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,700
Isn't this the crystal body?

336
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,700
Prepare a pen

337
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,700
it is good

338
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,700
Leader

339
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,700
Why are you here today?

340
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,700
I came two days earlier

341
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,700
Has anyone been here recently?

342
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,700
Really

343
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,700
I have registered

344
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,700
look

345
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,700
crystal body

346
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,700
I want to look at the monitor

347
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,700
Okay

348
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,700
Okay

349
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,700
Okay

350
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,700
This is the windchill you wrote

351
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,700
Ninety years

352
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,700
I also learned to write a crystal body from my grandfather

353
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,700
That's weird

354
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,700
You said it's like one

355
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,700
This is exactly the same as the pen and the force

356
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,700
I must go back and see

357
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,700
Go back and forth again

358
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,700
Look at this paper

359
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,700
It's been ten years

360
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
It's exactly the same

361
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,700
Boss, hurry up

362
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,700
This we

363
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,700
We

364
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,700
We sneaked in

365
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,700
It's also a cultural relic

366
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,700
If the security comes to catch us again

367
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,700
I can only say

368
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,700
We are here to apply for security

369
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,700
I'm here

370
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
Boss

371
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,700
So much information

372
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,700
You go over there

373
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,700
I'm here

374
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,700
it is good

375
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,700
Boss

376
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,700
What year is Guangxi Banai?

377
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,700
76

378
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,700
76

379
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,700
76

380
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,700
76

381
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,700
76

382
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,700
Boss, stop looking

383
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
Look, these are all moldy

384
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,700
And moldy

385
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,700
No one has been here for a long time

386
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
Changsha was always cold and damp

387
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,700
This house is also a single-use

388
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,700
The mold is normal

389
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,700
Boss, that painting didn't mold

390
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,700
But this painting should have been moved

391
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,700
Look, so many spiderwebs

392
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,700
This spiderweb is stuck on the back

393
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,700
Such small details

394
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,700
Can be noticed

395
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,700
It was deliberately placed here

396
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,700
One two three

397
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,700
Be careful

398
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,700
Slow down

399
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,700
I'm sorry

400
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,700
I'm sorry

401
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,700
I'm sorry

402
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,700
I'm sorry

403
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
Boss

404
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,700
There is really a door

405
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,700
Here

406
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,700
This is a secret room

407
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,700
Things are very likely here

408
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,700
Find it

409
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,700
it is good

410
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,700
50

411
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,700
51

412
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,700
52

413
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,700
53

414
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,700
54

415
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,700
55

416
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,700
56

417
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,700
57

418
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,700
58

419
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,700
59

420
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,700
60

421
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,700
61

422
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,700
61

423
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,700
62

424
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,700
63

425
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,700
69

426
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,700
Boss

427
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,700
It's all 50 to 59 years

428
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
Keep looking

429
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,700
it is good

430
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,700
76

431
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,700
76

432
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,700
77

433
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,700
80

434
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,700
81

435
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,700
82

436
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,700
83

437
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,700
84

438
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,700
85

439
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,700
86

440
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,700
87

441
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,700
88

442
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,700
89

443
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,700
90

444
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,700
91

445
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,700
92

446
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,700
93

447
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,700
94

448
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,700
95

449
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,700
96

450
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,700
97

451
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,700
98

452
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,700
99

453
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,700
99

454
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,700
10

455
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,700
10

456
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,700
10

457
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,700
10

458
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,700
10

459
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,700
We were caught long ago

460
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,700
The clues are broken

461
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,700
Then check it or not

462
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,700
Check

463
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,700
What if you find something else

464
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,700
it is good

465
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,700
But it should be

466
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,700
I can't find anything

467
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,700
book

468
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,700
Note

469
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,700
Boss, you are so easy

470
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,700
Look

471
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,700
All these documents are ready for you

472
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,700
See me

473
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,700
And they are all within your closed range

474
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,700
Wait a minute

475
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,700
Why is this table so big?

476
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,700
I don't know

477
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,700
Why is this table here?

478
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,700
No

479
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,700
Boss

480
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,700
Look

481
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,700
The arrangement of these documents

482
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,700
is exactly the same as your usual habits

483
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,700
Look

484
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,700
You usually like to put the documents

485
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,700
on the right hand side

486
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,700
Right?

487
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,700
That is, books, notes, and books

488
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,700
You put the useless ones

489
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,700
on the farthest left hand

490
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Put the useful ones on the left hand

491
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,700
The most important thing

492
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,700
is to lock it

493
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,700
But only I know these habits

494
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,700
My third uncle knows

495
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,700
Third uncle

496
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,700
I

497
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,700
I understand

498
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,700
What my third uncle asked me to check

499
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,700
is not the information about the members of the investigation team

500
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,700
But to come to this room

501
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,700
Write

502
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,700
Boss

503
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:55,820
These are all

504
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,700
Look

505
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,700
It is here

506
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,700
Boss, you found it

507
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,700
Let's go

508
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,700
Ok

509
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,700
Old things are always repeated

510
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,700
Old things are always repeated

511
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,700
Brother Xiaohui

512
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,700
I received the letter

513
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,700
See you at the first o'clock in the afternoon at the Liuli Market East Street

514
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,700
Boss, you say

515
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,700
Since this information is here

516
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,700
Why is your third uncle

517
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,700
still in such a big circle

518
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,700
We want to check the information of the 76th year

519
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,700
The information is gone

520
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,700
Third uncle wanted to tell me

521
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,700
Someone is watching me

522
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,700
How does he know you will continue to investigate

523
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,700
This is really enough to understand you

524
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,700
Maybe

525
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,700
These years

526
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,700
I have been always

527
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,700
Stuck in my nose

528
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,700
I am not a good person

529
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,700
I am not a good person

530
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,700
I am not a good person

531
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,700
I am not a good person

532
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,700
Is this enough

533
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,700
Just

534
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,700
Zi Hai

535
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,700
Mang Zhong

536
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,700
Li Xia

537
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,700
Xiaoman

538
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,700
If it's not the Wu family

539
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,700
It's really hard to think about this Xiaoman

540
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,700
What does it mean

541
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,700
What is this

542
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,700
Yang Shilei

543
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
Yang Shilei is Dai Chao

544
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,700
It refers to a Lei family

545
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,700
The design of the Qing Dynasty

546
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,700
They are in charge of

547
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,700
Almost all

548
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,700
Design works of royal architecture

549
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,700
But at that time

550
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,700
The position of the craftsman was low

551
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,700
Even the world's first

552
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,700
Craftsman family

553
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,700
In the eyes of ordinary people

554
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,700
Also been active

555
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,700
Most people in modern times

556
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,700
I don't know at all

557
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,700
There is such a family

558
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,700
Only we do this

559
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,700
The principle of architecture

560
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,700
Only we

561
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,700
Only those who engage in architectural principles

562
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,700
Know how old Yang Shilei is

563
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,700
Five thousand years of Chinese history

564
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,700
Yang Shilei only existed for two hundred years

565
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,700
But the current Chinese

566
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,700
World cultural heritage

567
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,700
One-fifth is Yang Shilei

568
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,700
But then

569
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,700
Yang Shilei suddenly disappeared

570
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,700
I have seen a report

571
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,700
Said it was a nightly gas pipe

572
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,700
Very fast

573
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,700
I do not know

574
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,700
What a great life is going through

575
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,700
Yang Shilei

576
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,700
Yang Shilei is not the palace

577
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,700
And the abbey

578
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,700
What does it have to do with that

579
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,700
What does it have to do with that

580
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,700
This Yang Shilei looks like a private house

581
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,700
But it's actually just a piece of land

582
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,700
If you can find the complete

583
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,700
There may be clues

584
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,700
You take it

585
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,700
Ok thank you

586
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,700
Come and see, self-drawing

587
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,700
Look at it

588
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,700
According to what I know

589
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,700
The uncle of Qiu Degao

590
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,700
Also came out of the glazing factory

591
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,700
Then we are a pair of places

592
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,700
This three holes are ok

593
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,700
Can

594
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,700
That child

595
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,700
That child

596
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,700
I thought I was young

597
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,700
I don't understand anything

598
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,700
Open a price

599
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,700
I don't know

600
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,700
I don't know

601
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,700
I don't know

602
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,700
I don't know

603
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,700
I don't know

604
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,700
I don't know

605
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,700
I don't know

606
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,700
I don't know

607
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,700
The truth

608
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,700
Brother

609
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,700
You are really full

610
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,700
This city is on the market now

611
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,700
No more

612
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,700
Peking

613
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,700
This knife is worth this price

614
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,700
By the way, I asked you about the past

615
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,700
Old things

616
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,700
Five重提

617
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,700
It's five重提

618
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,580
What are you doing

619
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,580
That thing

620
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,580
You really didn't mention it again

621
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,060
Which matter

622
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,700
Want to trick me

623
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,060
I won't sell it either

624
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,140
I won't send it away

625
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,420
Playing hard, right

626
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:25,860
Playing hard

627
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,380
You have to inquire in advance

628
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,180
The position of the golden master in the industry

629
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,780
Offend me

630
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,740
That's the cup that fell down and hit

631
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,460
I really don't know

632
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,660
This Xie family's little wine

633
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,260
Look at my eyes

634
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,140
The fairy aunt said this thing is over

635
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,180
Why are you here again

636
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,460
Qiu Dekang and my grandma drink tea

637
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,140
Grandma asked you if you want to be together

638
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,860
Don't let the fairy aunt misunderstand

639
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,700
I sell the uncle just to make some money

640
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,060
I know the things in the mountains

641
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,860
Uncle's step is really you sold

642
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,580
It turns out that you two don't know this

643
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,180
Let you blow it out

644
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,180
Qin Wantang

645
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,180
Say

646
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,580
Where did Uncle Bo get it

647
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:11,380
Don't mention it again

648
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,780
You don't mention it

649
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,780
Then i will mention it

650
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,380
I'm so tired

651
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,180
I mention i mention

652
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,580
Don't mention don't mention

653
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,380
I don't want to say more threatening words

654
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,580
You remember

655
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,780
He is a member of the Huo family

656
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,180
I am the head of the Xie family

657
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,580
What trouble do you have in the future

658
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,580
I will keep you safe

659
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,780
Can you let me go first and talk slowly

660
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,580
Put

661
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,580
I'll put it here

662
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,980
This thing

663
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,980
I have to start with the acquaintance of me and the fairy aunt

664
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,980
I was young

665
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,860
Fairy aunt is younger

666
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,380
We are both young, you know

667
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,980
In the snowy season in Beijing

668
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,980
I'm the famous Yandu and Baishitong

669
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,980
From the box to the woman's belly

670
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,700
I'm not a bad boy

671
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,220
When I saw the calligraphy

672
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:36,100
I know all the techniques of the eight great pieces of the same embroidery

673
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,900
I spent all my time and time

674
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,220
And the ancient bowl reached a state of one-man-one-one

675
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:49,100
However, the cloud is a coincidence and the stars are a hatred

676
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,060
So many shops in the琉璃場

677
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,140
The fairy aunt walked into my room

678
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,400
It's good to be famous

679
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,100
Handle it

680
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,820
Help me

681
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,940
Boss

682
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,580
I'm doing this at Perish

683
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,200
Aber bracel

684
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:18,720
You are a

685
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,620
Master

686
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,100
You come on

687
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,040
my dear Naughty 것이.

688
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,020
Go by yourself.

689
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,480
If you insist.

690
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,380
Just go with me.

691
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,880
Back then,

692
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,000
my 1987 Lethal 첫ir had a trajectory of art.

693
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,080
Like the pronunciation of their names,

694
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,000
you've theftively sm probability

695
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,780
at getting my heart.

696
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,820
I put interest

697
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,080
even beforeأI mused.

698
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,080
The lead of that operation was Huo Xian Gu?

699
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,080
To be specific, it was nine people.

700
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
Nine people?

701
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,080
Hush. Be quiet.

702
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,080
The scale and complexity of that operation

703
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,080
is far beyond your imagination.

704
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,080
That was in early 1963.

705
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:16,080
Our team entered the Four Goddess Mountain in Sichuan.

706
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,080
Qian Gu.

707
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,080
Qian Gu.

708
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,080
Let's take a break.

709
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,080
Come on.

710
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,080
I should be the one to do this kind of dirty work.

711
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,080
Come on.

712
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,080
Drink some water.

713
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,080
I've been walking for a whole day.

714
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,080
I'm so tired.

715
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,080
Let's go.

716
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,080
Qian Gu.

717
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
Where are they?

718
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,080
According to my observation,

719
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:55,080
the whole team is over 200 people.

720
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,080
The ones who collect the information and buy the equipment

721
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,080
must be thousands of people.

722
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,080
Especially those equipment

723
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,080
were all brought from the Soviet Union.

724
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,080
The relationship behind this is extremely complicated.

725
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,080
After the explosion,

726
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,080
their operation began.

727
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,080
But I don't know what they were doing.

728
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,080
My task is simple.

729
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,080
I just stay in the camp

730
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,080
and analyze what they brought back.

731
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,080
The people who sent the information to me

732
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,080
were only the ancient books.

733
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,080
But they had a rich content.

734
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,080
There were letters, books,

735
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,080
and paper documents.

736
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,080
They were large numbers.

737
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,080
I think there must be a lot of books

738
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,080
in the mountain.

739
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,080
I think the books

740
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,080
are very valuable.

741
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,080
I think

742
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,080
they are very valuable.

743
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
I think

744
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,080
they are very valuable.

745
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,080
The volume is very large.

746
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,080
I think there must be a huge

747
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:38,900
army of

748
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,200
a large number of teachers

749
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,200
were playing with them.

750
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,900
Someone own a Vermont Brown.

751
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,900
Hurry up.

752
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,900
Hurry up.

753
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,900
Hurry up.

754
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,900
Hurry up.

755
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,900
This way.

756
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,900
This way.

757
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,900
Hurry up.

758
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,900
There are many wounded people

759
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,900
who were sent back to the camp.

760
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,900
The number of people in the team

761
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,900
has been decreasing.

762
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,900
It seems that the action is very dangerous.

763
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,900
There were many accidents.

764
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:29,900
Journal of the league of immortal

765
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,900
Legend have it.

766
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,900
Master Lin and I have been with each other

767
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,900
for three years.

768
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,900
wok

769
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,900
I see you

770
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,900
You are so beautiful

771
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,900
I feel you

772
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,900
Are you looking for me

773
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,900
Look at the color, adjust it

774
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,900
Don't look for it

775
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,900
Look at these, they are all moldy

776
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,900
And most of them are even

777
