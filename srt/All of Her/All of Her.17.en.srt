00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,800
Zejia.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,360
You gave yourself away.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,720
Ze'an has never given me the red quartz.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,120
It was you.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,040
Gotcha.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,720
Chu Zejia.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,360
Is that brilliant?

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,840
Yes, you are.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,040
Very much so.

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,240
If so, can you please think

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,040
with your brilliant mind?

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,880
Does Zejia study jewelry?

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,760
Does he support your pursuit
of superstitious stuff?

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,520
I asked him

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,520
to pass over that red quartz to you.

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,680
Also,

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,960
it wasn't bought in Nepal,

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,840
it was in Denmark.

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,880
Give it here.
I want to retouch my photo.

22
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,600
What's wrong with you?

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,440
It looks awful. Delete it.

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,680
Zhen.

25
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,480
It had been years

26
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,600
since we talked all night.

27
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
I remember

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,080
it was your first night in our place.

29
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,080
There was a guest room.

30
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,880
But I insisted on sleeping with you.

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,520
We chatted

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,360
until four, and we wouldn't stop.

33
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,680
Yes, you only got up
in the middle of the day.

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,400
But I had to wake up to go to work.

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,200
I really miss those times.

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,960
If it weren't

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,640
for your free tutoring classes,

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,800
I probably wouldn't have gotten
into the college.

39
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,920
It was your hard work

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,360
and intelligence

41
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,840
that made you achieve that.

42
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,400
I'm conceited.

43
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,080
I used to think that I was smart.

44
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,440
But, in fact, I'm a fool.

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,800
I have misunderstood you for years.

46
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,040
To be honest, I've never blamed you.

47
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,640
You're tight with Zejia.

48
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,080
Yeah.

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,160
Back then,

50
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,200
I really supported you
and Zejia being together.

51
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,800
You were so compatible
in your appearance,

52
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,120
and your sign charts
are perfectly matched.

53
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
I have a headache.

54
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,200
Let me help you.

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,200
Sure.

56
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Zhen.

57
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,520
I don't know why I always feel

58
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,920
that Zejia is still with us.

59
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,560
Yes.

60
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,960
No matter where he is,

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,200
he's always there.

62
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,320
I believe

63
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,760
we will meet one day.

64

65
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,040
Cheng, thanks for being here.

66
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,600
You rushed here after I called.

67
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,680
It was really awkward yesterday.

68
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,840
I'm still confused about

69
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,880

70

since I breathed in fresh air.

74
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,880
I'm thinking of coming here every week.

75
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,400
Cheng, what do you think?

76
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,240
No.

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,200
Please don't.

78
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,560
You're busy with your own things.

79
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,320
Listen.

80
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,640

82
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,080
and deal with Zhen.

83
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,800
You don't have much spare time for this.

84
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,440
I'm not going against Zhen anymore.

85
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,960
I was too insensible before.

86
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,080
Did you make peace already?

87
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,760
I've been talking about this
for the past four years,

88
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,840
and you wouldn't change your mind.

89
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,440
What prompted you

90
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,560
to go easy on her?

91
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,400
I wasn't going hard on her, though.

92
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,720
I wasn't that mean.

93
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,240
I've just grown up.

94
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,680

95
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,560
that you've really

96
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,000
grown up.

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,760
It feels great when I let go of hatred.

98
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,040
What's wrong with you?

99
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,880
Nothing. My back feels itchy.

100
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,560
Take your clothes off.
I'll check for you.

101
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,240
I bought the ointment.

102
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,120
I can apply it for you.

103
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,520
There's no need.

104
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,640
Why are you shy?

105
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,600
Hurry up.

106
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,080

107
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,640

108
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,840

109

Hurry.

110
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,080
