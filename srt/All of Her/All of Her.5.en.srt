Yan Zhen.

My fiancee's name

I'm your boyfriend.

00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:29,719
I told you it was fake.

00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:30,719
That doesn't count.

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,479
But my feelings for you are genuine.

But since I've recruited you,

37

it's better to clarify

would draw a clear line between them.

Am I right?

41
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,000
Shouldn't you read it carefully?

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,039
It might be a trap.

you were the one who knew him best.

51
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,800
Why ask me?

52
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:10,600

00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,839
I guess

54
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,960
it might

00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,279
Why should I?

78
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,160
I was telling the truth.

79
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,279
She orchestrated everything

80
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,600
to take over our property.

81
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:26,839

00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:28,200
It's impossible.

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,760
Mom, stay away from her.

84
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:35,279

00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,399
Xin is young.

89
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,200
She's a jinx.

00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,640

You've been back for a long time.

98
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,119

100
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,279

I don't want to affect your sleeping.

102
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,320
That's also my concern.

103
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,440
I want to stay outside.

104
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,480
Don't even think of it.

105
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,920
Go and eat the cake.

106
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:22,600
I've spoiled her so much.

107
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:25,519
It's fine. Xin is kind of direct.

108
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,679
Zejia's incident

109
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,559
hit her hard.

110
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,959
Mom, I haven't been here for two weeks.

111
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,519
Don't worry about the company.

112
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:38,679
I'm not.

113
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,239
I have faith in you

114
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,799
to take care of the company.

115
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:44,119
However,

116
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,600
the Chu Group

117
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,279
is a conglomerate.

118
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:48,959
You can't be too aggressive

119
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,440
in management.

120
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:52,359
Understood.

121
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,959
But nice guys finish last.

122
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,959
Sometimes, I need to do so
to protect myself.

123
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:02,040
Yan Zhen.

124
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,720
As your mother-in-law,

125
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,160
there's something
I shouldn't say to you.

126
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,359
But Zejia is still missing,

127
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:11,239
and you're young.

128
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,799
If there is a nice guy,

129
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:14,440
you should give it a try.

130
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,000
Mom.

131
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,160
The company needs Zhen now.

132
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,000
She should prioritize work.

133
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,799
Oh, my.

134
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,160
It doesn't mean
she can't have a relationship.

135
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,200
Besides, you're back now.

136
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,760
You can share
some of her responsibilities.

137
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:34,399
How about this? I will try to look for

138
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:35,959
a suitable match for you

139
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,239
and set you two up.

140
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,920
I'll do whatever you want.

141
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,119
Zhen, aren't you going to Zejia's room

142
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:48,440
to retrieve something?

143
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,559
I'll open the door for you.

144
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:53,079
Mom, I'm heading to Zejia's room.

145
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,640
Go on.

146
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:20,839
(It's pretty much the same)

147
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,040
(as it was four years ago.)

148
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,279
Why does it feel like

149
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,679
you're checking out my room?

150
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,920
Why does it feel like

151
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,040
you're checking out my brother's room?

152
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,399
Zejia is a very clean person,

153
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:45,959
but he doesn't like to do the cleaning.

154
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,600
He's fastidious.

155
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,440
The cleaning lady does the cleaning job.

156
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,760
And I pay her.

157
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:01,839
These are my favorite books.

158
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,399
I like those, too.

159
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,600
Do you two always

160
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,720
discuss

161
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,920
strange questions?

162
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,000
We have

163
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
similar tastes.

164
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,519
(Since she comes here to check,)

165
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,839
(I can give her a hint.)

166
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,000
Where's the ledger?

167
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:26,959
On the table?

168
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:28,839
In the cabinet?

169
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:31,199
Under the table?

170
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,719
It shouldn't be here.

171
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,280
Where do you think it should be?

172
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,719
For example,

00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,159

174
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,880
