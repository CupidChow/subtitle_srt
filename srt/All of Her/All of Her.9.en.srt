[Episode 9]

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,960
His artwork is unique.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,600
I'm really looking forward
to seeing his artwork.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,440
Yeah.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,920
Sorry. I asked you out on short notice.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,360
It's fine.

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,360
I'm ready whenever you want me.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,040
Let's go.

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,960
(Why must she dress up)

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,320
(to meet Gu Cheng?)

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,600
(Wait.)

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,320
(She has already read that letter.)

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,000
(But why does she ask Gu Cheng out?)

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,240
This painting

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,680
gives off a sense of serenity.

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,800
It's comfortable to look at.

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,640
It is.

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,400
Why don't we have
the knowledgeable Ms. Yan

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,880
to introduce this painting?

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,480
Edward Hopper.

Edward

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,520
Hopper.

24
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,120
I don't know much about art history.

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,000
Anyway, he's a well-known painter.

26
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,720
Hopper is an excellent

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,920
American realist painter.

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,680
He's good

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,920
at using

30
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,960
the strong contrast of light and shadow

31
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,160
and depicting the sense of alienation

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,280
of modern life

33
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,520

34
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,680
or a lone figure.

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,440
As the annotation says,

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,080
we're the figure in the picture
of Hopper's painting.

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,520

Explanations about loneliness

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,320
are too cliche.

41
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,680
Perhaps the painter

42
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,400
didn't intend to overly express

43
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,080
loneliness and solitude.

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,760
Love

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,600
should be something simple.

46
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,240
Why do you still want to buy paintings
from the art exhibition, then?

47
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,040
For decoration.

48
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,440
Look at this.

49
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,800
It suits the tone of my bedroom.

The right paintings will go up in value.

51

More lucrative than buying a house.

The explanations about loneliness
are too cliche.

Perhaps the painter

54
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,000
didn't intend to overly promote

56
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,080
What's wrong?

57
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,080
Does this painting

58
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,120
remind you of something nice?

59
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,720
No, I just feel cold.

60
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,920

Why?

82
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,360
Let me tell you this.

83
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,280
I got bashed on by my mom just now.

84
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,600
So I need to relax.

Yan Zhen.

194
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,080
Have you thought of escaping?

195
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,240
A friend of mine

196
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,960
bought a land in Yunnan.

197
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,360
It's near to Erhai.

198
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,240
The weather is sunny there,

199
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,960
and it's warm all year round.

200
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,880
You can enjoy great views as you like.

201
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,200
It sounds wonderful.

202
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,240
But I can't leave yet.

203
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,280
Yan Zhen.

204
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,520
I know what you had been through
over the past four years.

205
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,280
Listen.

206
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,240
You don't owe the Chu family anything.

207
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,880
With our current financial strength,

208
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,680
we can live a new life.

209
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,760
You shouldn't toil yourself.

210
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,360
I want you to live more carefreely.

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,800
You...

212
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,600
Is this

213
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,080
a confession?

214
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,400
