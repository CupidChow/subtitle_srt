9
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,520
They're some habitual offenders
on the run.

10
00:00:27,799 --> 00:00:28,559
They've already been detained.

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,840
They said they saw you alone

15
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,040
They were aiming at me.

16
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,159
Probably, someone recruited them.

17
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,119
If so, this is hard to trace back.

18
