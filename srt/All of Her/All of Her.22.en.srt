[All of Her]

00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,250
[Episode 22]

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,840
It must be difficult for you.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,600
Ze'an...

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,680
I apologize to you on his behalf.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,600
Ze'an has his own reason.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,120
He wants to do something
for the company.

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,840
I understand.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,440
He was being stupid.

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,640
Yes.

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,120
Why would he forge the last will?

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,320
He was just not in his right mind.

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,680
Mom, let's not get into this.

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,080
I don't blame him.

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,680
We're family, after all.

16
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,200
We should deal

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,280
with our family affairs properly.

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,800
Xin.

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,840
Pick a date

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,960
for Ze'an's engagement.

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,400
We should arrange it properly.

22
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:48,960
No.

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,800
He will do that himself.

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,760
Don't be angry.

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,320
I have something to talk to Mom.

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,760
Be good.

27
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,840
Go on.

28
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,680
All right.

29
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,400
Back then,

30
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,480
Mom always said that I was impatient.

31
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,640
She wanted me to practice calligraphy

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,760
and learn how to brew tea

33
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,960
to become composed.

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,480
Your mom

35
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,960
has taught you so well.

36
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,280
Honestly, I don't like all of those.

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,320
They are boring.

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,760
When

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,360
she passed away,

40
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,280
I realized

41
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,800
that she wanted me

42
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,240
to be resilient and tolerant.

43
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,320
Over the years,

44
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,280
it's the first time
you've mentioned your family.

45
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,600
I spent five years

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,360
focusing on one thing.

47
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,080
I've never told you before.

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,880
My mom is the technical director
of the Anshi Group

49
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,640
who was fired
due to the corruption case.

50
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,200
Are you...

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,920
I'm Wu Wenzhao's daughter.

52
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,680
Mom.

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,400
Now, Zejia is gone.

54
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,920
The only thing I can't let go

55
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,800
is the unfair treatment

56
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,080
my family has suffered
even until their last breath.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,360
I've been investigating the truth

58
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,320
for the past five years.

59
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,880
I didn't know

60
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,320
you were Ms. Wu's daughter.

61
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,000
I couldn't get over this
all these years.

62
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,840
I'm responsible

63
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,040
for your parents' death.

64
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,240
I have failed them.

65
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,680
Back then,

66
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,920
your parents

67
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,320
handed over the evidence
of Wang Zhongmin's wrongdoing

68
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,040
to me.

69
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,600
(Wang Zhongmin?)

70
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,040
Mr. Chu...

71
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,000
Why would he

72
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,760
die in the sea?

73
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
Wang Zhongmin

74
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,160
still uses the same low-down tricks

75
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,240
to thrive among the shareholders.

76
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,520
I need his support

77
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,320
to protect the shares of the Chu family
from dilution.

78
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,040
I've asked Ma Jun, who's from
my hometown, to look for you.

79
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,840
However,

80
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,680
Wang Zhongmin found out.

81
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,480
I was threatened,

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
and I stopped the investigation.

83
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,480
Zhen.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,920
It's been tough

85
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,480
for you.

86
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,040
You have to shoulder
the blame of your parents,

87
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,480
Zejia went missing,

88
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,360
and manage the company.

89
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,000
It's hard on you.

90
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,360
At first,

91
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,120
I thought it would be tough.

92
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,480
But with Zejia's love,

93
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,320
I wasn't afraid of anything.

94
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,680
I realized

95
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,320
it isn't hatred that pushed me
to continue the investigation,

96
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,720
but love.

97
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,440
Good girl.

98
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,160
By the way,

99
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,800
I have

100
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,320
a document.

101
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,520
It's with the lawyer, Mr. Wu.

102
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,920
He will return from a business trip

103
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,280
on the day of Ze'an's engagement.

104
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,120
I'll give it to you.

105
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,120
You'll decide

106
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,320
on what to do about it.

107
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,680
Thank you, Mom.

108
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,320
Thank you for still calling me that.

109
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,880
No matter what,

110
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,240
those years we've spent together

111
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,320
are genuine.

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Good girl.

113
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,320
You're so kind.

114
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
Based on our information so far,

115
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,320
it shows that Wang Zhongmin
is the most suspicious.

116
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,240
We must keep Yan safe.

117
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,640
What do you want me to do?

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,840
I will do anything in my power.

119
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,960
No rush.

120
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,800
The fish has already taken the bait.

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,280
The ball is in our court now.

122
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,920
Are you going

123
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,000
to hide this from Yan Zhen?

124
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,200
She protected the Anshi Group
for four years for me.

125
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,600
This time,

126
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,160
I will protect her.

127
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,600
Don't worry.

128
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,960
Regardless of what,

129
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,840
I will stay with you for the fight.

130
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,280
Thank you for taking care

131
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,760
of Yan Zhen for me.

132
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,040
You...

133
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,960
I've already gotten over her.

134
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,120
After witnessing your rocky love story,

135
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,000
I know

136
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,800
I should let go.

137
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,680
To Xin,

138
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,680
you're the only man

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,440
she cherishes.

140
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
Hopefully,

141
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,360
she'll go easy on me.

142
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,000
What are

143
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
your next plans?

144
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,040
I'm going

145
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,720
to test Wang Zhongmin

146
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,520
and see if he's the mastermind,

147
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,640
and then make him confess
to his evil doing.

148
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,280
Wang Zhongmin is a devious fox.

149
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,800
He's good at disguises.

150
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,240
It's not easy

151
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,680
to blow his cover.

152
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,600
In what kind of situation

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,640
will the villain reveal his true color?

154
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
When they are with the allies?

155
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,600
And the people who are about to die.

156
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,680
You want to put yourself in danger?

157
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,240
He has already killed me once.

158
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,160
I'm not afraid to experience it again.

159
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,720
Isn't it too dangerous?

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,440
That's why I have a double plan.

161
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,520
I'll pretend to form an alliance
with him.

162
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,160
If he agrees

163
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,480
to join forces against Yan,

164
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,800
I can gather

165
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,000
the evidence of his crimes.

166
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,440
What if he doesn't?

167
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,440
Even so,

168
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,800
if he has shown any recent activity,

169
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,120
it could prove that he's the mastermind.

170
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,800
What if Yan Zhen

171
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,400
finds out

172
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,240
you're hiding this from her?

173
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,440
You're so nosy.

174
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,600
Mind your own business.

175
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,680
Putting yourself in danger?

176
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,200
What a noble sacrifice.

177
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,640
And you,

178
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,560
why are you covering up for him?

179
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,640
I'm touched by your friendship.
