[All of Her]

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,240
[Episode 10]

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,520
Is this

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,960
a confession?

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,480
Yes.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,920
To be honest,

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,800
there was a moment

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,680
I did want to run away from here.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,960
But not yet now.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,720
Sorry.

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,160
It's fine.

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,520
Your turn.

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,520
I will tell you anything I know.

14
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,840
On the day of Zejia's accident...

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,600
Yan Zhen.

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,760
It's urgent.

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,600
Can you come out?

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,840
Why did you want to see me?

19
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,840
That day,

20
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,240
Zejia asked me to buy something.

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,040
Before he left,

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,640
he suddenly entrusted me

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,200
to take care of you

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,960
if something happened to him.

25
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,320
[Act as usual if anything happens to me.
Promise me. Trust me that I'll return.]

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,200
Unexpectedly...

27
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,080
Unexpectedly,

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,520
he really had an accident.

29
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,320
I heard

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,280
that when someone lies,

31
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,240
they unconsciously touch their noses.

32
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,200
Do you think

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,200
what I said is true

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,520
or not?

35
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,880
Sometimes,

36
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
partly truth and partly lie

37
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,160
are the safest.

38
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,080
Because truth

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,440
can be hurtful.

40
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,720
I'm not afraid of getting hurt.

41
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,560
I only want to know the truth.

42
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,760
If you mean to ask about the incident,

43
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,040
it has nothing to do with me.

44
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,600
However, I do have something

45
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,040
that I can't tell you now.

46
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,000
Why?

47
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,920
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,600
I can't tell you.

49
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,880
Thank you.

50
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,640
(Since when have they become so close?)

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,600
It's fine.

52
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,280
Thank you.

53
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,640
You don't want me to send you home?

54
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,040
I have a chauffeur.

55
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,440
Where is the person?

56
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,760
In the bathroom, I guess.

57
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,440
I'll wait for him. Go on.

58
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,040
All right.

59
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,360
Be careful.

60
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,560
Yan Zhen.

61
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,760
You're back, Chauffeur Chu.

62
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,600
Let's go.

63
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,120
What tactics are you using, Zhen?

64
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,720
I told you Gu Cheng is suspicious.

65
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,120
Why did you ask him out?

66
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,680
Have you lost your mind already?

67
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,960
You do care about me.

68
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,520
Do you really think

69
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,280
it's fine to ignore your own safety?

70
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,800
Before the explosions that year,

71
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,400
Gu Cheng called me.

72
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,240
I came here to confirm
whether it was a coincidence.

73
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,480
Gu Cheng isn't a bad guy.

74
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,560
What did he tell you

75
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,360
to prove his innocence?

76
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,920
Privacy.

77
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
I can't tell you anything.

78
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,600
Fine.

79
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,280
You believe everything he tells you,
don't you?

80
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,600
I have nothing more to say, then.

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,800
(Chu Zejia.)

82
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,640
(Let's see how far I can push you.)

83
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,320
Xin?

84
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,440
Cheng.

85
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,080
You weren't being honest with me.

86
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,560
You actually went to the art museum

87
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,160
and you were with that woman.

88
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:25,960
Well.

89
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,320
We were there for work.

90
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,320
What kind of work
needs to be done in the art museum?

91
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,760
Xin.

92
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,400
Don't be judgmental about Yan Zhen.

93
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,000
You should know

94
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,320
what kind of person she is.

95
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,520
I knew you would say that.

96
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,600
I'll take you home now,

97
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,200
okay?

98
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,000
Not okay! I'm still not over this.

99
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,600
How can you

100
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,800
calm down, then?

101
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,080
Tonight,

102
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,240
I'm going to your place

103
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,480
and sleep in my kid bed.

104
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,640
All right.

105
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,440
Let's go home.

106
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,080
Come.

107
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,000
Let's drink.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's all have a drink.

109
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,120
Cheers.

110
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,240
This is my sister-in-law.

111
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,760
Hello, Mrs. Chu.

112
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,600
Mrs. Chu.

113
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,920
Come and join us.

114
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,600
Yeah, it's merrier

115
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,440
having more people together.

116
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,160
(He means to spite me, doesn't he?)

117
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,800
Ze'an.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,840
Do follow the doctor's instructions.

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,080
You're right.

120
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,880
I won't drink, then.

121
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,640
Come, you guys enjoy.

122
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,320
Come.

123
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,160
I'll pour some for you.

124
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,840
I'm not drinking.

125
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,280
Enjoy yourselves.

126
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,680
[Yan Zhen's phone is being bugged.]

127
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,600
My bad.

128
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,880
I should've thought it through.

129
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,400
I just had surgery.

130
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,640
I'm taking antibiotics.

131
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,840
So I can't drink.

132
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,960
And Zhen isn't drinking either.

133
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,480
We should call it a day,

134
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,560
all right?

135
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,800
Let's meet up the other day.

136
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,520
Next time.

137
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,400
But we just arrived here.

138
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,120
Tell me about it.

139
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,400
What's wrong with you?

140
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,600
So disappointing.

141
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,480
I'm so sorry.

142
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,720
Sorry.

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,320
I'm staying in her place.

144
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
I have no choice.

145
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,000
How about this?

146
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,200
I'll apologize to each of you later,

147
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:33,960
all right?

148
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:34,920
Fine.

149
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,640
Okay, then.

150
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,160
Spoilsport.

151
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,880
I'm so sorry.

152
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,640
Next time. Let's catch up next time.

153
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:41,680
Bye.

154
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,040
See you.

155
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,520
Bye-bye.

156
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,960
Let go.

157
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,310
[Your phone is bugged. The signal source
is from Gu Cheng's apartment.]

158
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,560
Zhen, you're kind of touchy.

159
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,800
Did you get mad at Zejia so easily too?

160
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,160
What are you trying to get at?

161
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,700
[Follow my lead.
Do you want to test Gu Cheng?]

162
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,720
You look different
when it comes to Gu Cheng.

163
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,360
You speak so softly

164
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,920
and always smile at him.

165
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,400
People might think

166
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,120
that you hook up with him.

167
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,240
We went to the same college.

168
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,840
We're friends and colleagues.

169
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,480
What's wrong with us being close?

170
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,920
You see him as a friend.

171
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,280
But does he see you as a friend too?

172
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,120
Listen up.

173
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,720
Don't treat me like a fool.

174
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,560
He's got something else in mind
with you.

175
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,680
Don't you treat me like a fool.

176
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,920
I know who sincerely cares for me.

177
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,160
He is?

178
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,080
When you were poisoned
in the break room,

179
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,240
where was he?

180
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,040
He was the only one in the file room

181
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,080
when the ledgers were sealed.

182
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,360
He's the sole one
who could tamper with them.

183
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,520
Why do you still believe him?

184
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,680
