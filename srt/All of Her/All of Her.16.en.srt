to go on a vacation sometimes.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,120
It doesn't matter where you are

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,080
as long as you're with someone you love.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,800
During the four years you were away,

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,520
have you ever wondered

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,560
how another person might be faring?

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,840
Zhen.

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,480
I'd been living alone overseas

Ze'an.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,400
Do you know that?

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,920
The most crucial ingredient in love
is trust.

17

A good relationship has no secrets.

20

I was wrong about Zhen.

39
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,720

64

that the mastermind is aware

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,360

Early on, someone leaked the news.
