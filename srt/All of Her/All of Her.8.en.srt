[All of Her]

00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,170
[Episode 8]

3
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:11,279
But I'm just me.

4
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:13,279
If you don't believe it,

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,119
you can get a DNA test.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,760
Judging by your expression,

7
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:21,239
it seems you've already done it.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,600
Replace the DNA report

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,080
before Yan Zhen arrives at the center.

10
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,780
[Chu Zejia]

11
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,560
(What I tested)

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,439
(is the fetal hair
from Zejia's fetal hair brush.)

13
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,599
(However, the results only show
the value for twins.)

14
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,879
(Apparently, you switched the report.)

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,519
(Zejia.)

16
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,839
(What have you been through
all these years?)

17
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:32,000
(What should I do)

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,480
(to make you confess the truth?)

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,040
Zhen.

20
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,160
Have you had enough of that?

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,000
We've arrived.

22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,080
Get off.

23
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,839
You sent me home?

24
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:50,879
Yes.

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,080
I don't want you
to run into trouble again.

26
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,360
Stay away from danger.

27
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,440
Why are you still sitting here?

28
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,440
My mom and sister

29
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,639
like to nag.

30
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,680
Either one of them can drive me crazy,

31
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,360
let alone both together.

32
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:08,080
Besides,

33
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,880
I signed a contract with you

34
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,880
to be your 24-hour bodyguard.

35
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,279
I need to be responsible to my employer.

36
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,039
Right?

37
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:17,839
You have a point.

38
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,759
Well, wait for me in the car.

39
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:36,960
(What is she doing here?)

40
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,360
Hello, everyone.

41
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,520
Many of you asked

42
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,880
what plants are suitable for gifts.

43
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:43,320
Here,

44
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,440
I have a pot of cactus.

45
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,960
I prepared this for someone.

46
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,679
It helps purify the air.

47
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:48,600
Its effect may differ

48
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,279
depending on where you place it.

49
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:50,800
Well...

50
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,839
Where should I put it?

51
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,600
If it's in the office, you can put it...

52
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:01,240
Stay away.

53
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,839
You're not welcome here.

54
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,199
Is Mom in? I'm here for her.

55
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,399
Do you have any regrets about Zejia?

56
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:09,839
Whether or not I have regrets,

57
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,520
that's up to him.

58
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:15,000
I heard that twins
have a telepathic connection.

59
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,600
Why don't you ask Ze'an?

60
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,160
He's outside.

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,600
Makes sense.

62
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,000
I've heard about it.

63
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,759
Luckily, you're in one piece.

64
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,240
How's An? Is it serious?

65
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,600
Just superficial. He's been discharged.

66
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,360
I wanted to visit him at the hospital.

67
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,679
But you wouldn't let me go.

68
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,720
It's inconvenient for you
to look after him there.

69
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,720
I think

70
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,559
he'll be more comfortable

71
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,520
to rest at home.

72
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:49,479
Don't worry.
The assailant is under arrest.

73
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:50,639
The person behind this won't escape.

74
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,800
The police will soon capture them
with the help of the camera.

75
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,360
(Should I remind Mom about Gu Cheng?)

76
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,759
Mom, please take care of yourself.

77
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,759
We're all right.

78
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:16,330
[For show purposes only.
No improper guidance.]

79
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:17,199
What are you doing?

80
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,930
[For show purposes only.
No improper guidance.]

81
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,359
Go away, bad luck.

82
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:26,119
Go away.

83
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,880
Not again.

84
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,920
Have you finished your thesis?

85
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,279
You...

86
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:31,760
Something's wrong with you.

87
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:32,799
What's wrong with me?

88
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,079
You promised

89
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,399
to bring me the palo santo
when you returned.

90
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,399
It wasn't allowed to be taken on board.

91
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,320
Stop messing around with such things.

92
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,640
Something's wrong with you.

93
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,959
You always said

94
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,519
that all sciences eventually
turn into metaphysics.

95
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,559
But now you want
to keep me away from this.

96
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:48,600
You ask me to study and hang up on me.

97
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,559
Plus, your outfit.

98
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,760
Are you...

99
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,079
Don't get fresh with me.

100
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,600
Did Zejia possess you?

101
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,920
It's possible, anyway.

102
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,279
It's said that twins

103
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,480
have a telepathic connection.

104
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,359
You're more likely

105
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:12,519
to approach him in some way.

106
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,160
Ze'an.

107
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,600
Can you do me a favor?

108
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,200
Can you ask Zejia

109
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,519
and find out who harmed him?

110
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:28,839
Good idea.

111
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,480
Come closer.

112
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,079
Come on.

113
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,440
Hey.

114
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,880
Grow up, will you?

115
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,959
I didn't want to discourage
your curiosity back then.

116
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,160
Aren't you curious

117
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,839
who killed Zejia

118
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,880
and the truth?

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,559
Do you

120
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:47,160
want to get punched?

121
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,799
It seems that your experiment
doesn't work well.

122
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,000
Go and study.

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,239
Read "A Brief History of Time".

124
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,559
Is that useful?

125
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:58,720
You can study the book.
I'll wait for you.

126
00:05:59,079 --> 00:05:59,559
Are we leaving now?

127
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,119
Yes.

128
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,079
You drive.

129
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,799
"A Brief History of Time"?

130
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:09,839
I think I saw it on Zejia's shelf.

131
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:11,160
I'll go and find the book.

132
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,880
She likes talking nonsense.

133
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,160
I beg to differ.

134
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,079
If possible,

135
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,959
I'd like to talk to Zejia

136
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,480
and ask him

137
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,480
why he didn't appear in my dream
for the past four years.

138
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:28,079
Did he meet another gal down there?

139
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,679
Drive me home.
I have an appointment later.

140
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:36,559
Where are you going?

141
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,040
The DNA result

142
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,880
is out.

143
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,720
I should give up.

144
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,320
It's time to move on.

145
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:46,839
Right?

146
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,119
Yes.

147
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,640
So,

148
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,959
I'm going on a date.

149
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,160
(A date?)

150
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,320
(What is she up to this again?)

151
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,480
I'll give you a ride, then.

152
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,640
It's hard to hail a cab

153
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,600
around that hour.

154
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,119
Thank you, Ze'an.

155
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:06,880
Let's go.

156
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,279
Bodyguard, help me take off my coat.

157
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,200
Why?

158
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,239
Just do it.

159
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,239
Zhen.

160
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,640
Put on the coat.

161
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,920
You might catch a cold

162
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,359
just wearing this.

163
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:40,720
This is a chance

164
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,559
for my date to put a coat on me.

165
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:44,679
You can leave now.

166
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,880
It's fine.

167
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,359
I'll wait here.

168
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,640
No.

169
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:06,040
(I shall see who she's meeting.)

170
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:25,920
Good thing I'm prepared.

171
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:32,960
Zhen.

172
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,479
It's nippy out there.

173
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,119
Please put the coat on.

174
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:43,679
It seems you didn't see my point.

175
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,760
I don't want my own coat.

176
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,880
Someone will put his coat on me.

177
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,440
Please put it back

178
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,039
in the car.

179
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,799
Zhen.

180
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,479
I've been in the art industry for years
when I was abroad.

181
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,799
I'd be happy to give you and your friend

182
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,679
some sharing.

183
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,599
Free of charge.

184
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:10,080
I don't think it's necessary.

185
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,080
Ze'an, take a break tonight.

186
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:14,960
Go on. I wish you a pleasant day.
