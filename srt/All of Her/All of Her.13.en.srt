[Episode 13]

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,760
Cheng.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,480
I saw it with my own eyes.

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,480
Oh, my.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,120
Apparently, someone broke in here.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,320
No.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,360
It couldn't be thieves.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,720
Rather, I think
I've seen this person before.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,360
He smells like Zejia.

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,360
Probably, he's back for you.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,080
That's a novel one.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,960
But Zejia won't be here.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,520
Come on. I'll send you home.

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,120
No, I'm not going back.

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,000
Look.

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,480
Look at me.

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,280
Come on.

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,680
Just look at me.

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,560
Look at my pure and big eyes.

21
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,280
Would I lie to you?

22
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,960
I won't.

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,640
I'll never do that to you.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,800
All right.

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's say what you said is true.

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
But I can't see him.

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,880
I won't be afraid of him, am I right?

28
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,640
So just go home.

29
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,560
No, I don't want to.

30
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,320
I'm not going home.

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,000
Well.

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,600
If you play a game with me,

33
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,560
I'll leave.

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,120
Listen carefully.

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,040
You liked Yan Zhen, didn't you?

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,280
Uh... Kind of.

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,960
Me either.

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Since the first time

39
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,080
Zejia brought her back,

40
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,520
I really liked her.

41
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,400
I treated her

42
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
like my own elder sister.

43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,880
But I didn't expect her

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,360
to be someone like that.

45
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,200
If

46
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,040
she's not what you thought she was?

47
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,720
That's impossible.

48
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,480
Zejia's accident

49
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,440
must have something to do with her.

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,120
If someone like her can be whitewashed,

51
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,000
I will...

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,560
What will you do?

53
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,640
I...

54
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,880
I will...

55
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,480
I will apologize to her.

56
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,800
I'm one who bravely admits
my love or hatred.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,640
I'll apologize if I'm at fault.

58
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,120
The next question is yours.

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,920
You were born with a silver spoon.

60
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,760
You get anything you want
like a princess.

61
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,680
But why would you like

62
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,880
an ordinary man
who is nine years older than you?

63
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,400
I can't choose my own family.

64
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,720
No matter what kind of family I have,

65
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,280
I like you.

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,800
Also,

67
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,840
you're not ordinary.

68
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,080
You're mature, composed,
good at cooking,

69
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,680
emotionally stable,

70
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,960
and amiable.

71
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,880
The main point is that you look dashing.

72
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,680
Our signs match so well.

73
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,840
I don't care.

74
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,000
You're the right man for me, anyway.

75
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,520
Xin.

76
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,880
You're very young.

77
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,600
You don't know much about relationships.

78
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,200
I'm not young anymore.

79
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,280
I loathe her

80
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,840
because of my brother.

81
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,440
It seems

82
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,120
that I don't really know you back then.

83
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,240
You have eighty years

84
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,520
to get to know me well.

85
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,800
You'll be with me sooner or later.

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,800
Next question.

87
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,560
When can we eat?

88
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,240
I'm starving.

89
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,200
I've read through the ledgers.

90
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,520
The only suspicious thing

91
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,440
is the two payments to overseas funds.

92
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,800
But it was some time ago.

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,560
After Gu Cheng
took over the foundations,

94
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,600
there was an overhaul

95
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,080
and shell companies were all dissolved.

96
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,440
This is the accountant,

97
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,480
Lu Nan.

98
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,280
Perchance, this person has already...

99
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,080
The thing is,

100
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,640
I didn't come back empty-handed.

101
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,360
Hold on.

102
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,240
This is Gu Cheng's privacy.

103
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,320
We...

104
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,320
Why?

105
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,880
Are you scared?

106
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,040
You said you trusted him, didn't you?

107
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,320
His password is your birthday?

108
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,710

109
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,440

(What I'm going to do)

118
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,600
(is to hand all the documents)

119
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,160
(over to the police.)

120
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,280
(Because)

121
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,840
(I want to be in the light.)

122
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,440
What were you talking about?

123
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,000
What is he up to again?

124
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,480
Did Ma Jun deceive you?

125
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,760
Both of you are from the same hometown,

126
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,480
and he's been following you for years.

127
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,240
I always thought

128
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,120
he was acting under your orders.

129
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,240
What happened to you?

130
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,960
If the person behind Ma Jun

131
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
isn't you,

132
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,640
