that belongs to the Chu family.

00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,400
It's true

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,120
that Yan Zhen isn't suitable

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,760
for the role of the group's CEO.

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,640
I'm more than willing

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,480

I had several major surgeries,

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,840

hasn't been good.

17

the scandal between me and Ms. Yan Zhen

37
