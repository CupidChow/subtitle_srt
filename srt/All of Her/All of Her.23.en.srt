00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,250
[Episode 23]

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,120
Tell me everything.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,040
Which step of the plan are you on?

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,680
No talking.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,960
Be honest with me.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,200
We plan to meet Wang next week.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,920
Then...

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,000
You tell her.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,400
On the day of your engagement,

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,440
Mom will hand over

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,760
part of the evidence of
Wang Zhongmin's crimes to me.

13
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,600
But handing it to the police

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,120
isn't enough to bring down
Wang Zhongmin.

15
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,520
If he knows my true identity,

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,960
he will definitely do something.

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,280
When you meet him,

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,520
reveal that the evidence is with me.

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,240
No, I won't.

20
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,440
Yan.

21
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,640
I can't expose you to the danger.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,400
I was planning

23
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,760
to pretend to collaborate with him

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,880
as to test him.

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,600
I don't want him to tackle you.

26
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,160
We should just go all out.

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,400
Wang Zhongmin is shrewd.

28
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,520
I must go this time.

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,840
No, you can't.

30
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,920
I won't allow that.

31
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,440
Stay out of this.

32
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,440
Leave it to me.

33
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,360
I'll clean your parents' name

34
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,280
on your behalf.

35
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
Chu Zejia.

36
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,120
Why are you still so stubborn?

37
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,200
Four years ago, you tried
to solve the problem alone.

38
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,000
But look at what had happened.

39
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,160
How many four years
do we have in our lives?

40
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,360
Well...

41
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,240
Uh...

42
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,000
I need to call Xin back.

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,160
Well, you guys talk.

44
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,760
Yan.

45
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,240
I promised your dad
that I would take care of you.

46
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,160
But if this is how you plan
to protect me,

47
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,080
I'd rather you not.

48
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,160
I can't let you take the risk alone.

49
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,160
I've been waiting for this

50
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,240
since the day I joined Anshi.

51
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,280
I'm almost there now.

52
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,760
Only one step away
from bringing down Wang Zhongmin.

53
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,880
Yan.

54
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,000
I'd rather endure
the most excruciating pain

55
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,360
than let you hurt a bit.

56
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,600
Wang Zhongmin will only speak the truth

57
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,080
if he catches me.

58
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,200
Over the four years,

59
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
if it wasn't for the belief

60
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,920
that you were still alive,

61
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,600
I couldn't have made it through.

62
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,040
I'm not as tough as you think.

63
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,000
Chu Zejia.

64
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,200
I can't lose you again.

65
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,080
All right, then.

66
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,160
This time,

67
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,680
we'll fight together.

68
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,200
This gown is pretty nice.

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,680
My fiancee is picky.

70
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,080
Are you satisfied with this?

71
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,960
I suppose her figure

72
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,680
should be similar to mine.

73
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,280
Does your assistant have no problem

74
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,760
pretending to be your fiancee?

75
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,080
Of course.

76
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,760
I paid her.

77
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,920
Will you

78
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,480
marry me once more?

79
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,600
I will not.

80
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,120
But I will.

81
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,800
This gown is pretty nice.

82
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,680
But I don't think it's appropriate

83
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,560
to wear this at the ceremony.

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,720
Maybe

85
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,040
you should try one with a simple design.

86
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,120
Sure.

87
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,280
What's wrong, Mr. Wang?

88
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
Why did you draw the curtain?

89
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,280
People might be suspicious of us.

90
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,200
Don't worry about it.

91
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,600
The sunlight is too bright.

92
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,150
[920920]

93
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,120
What is this?

94
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,080
[920920]
The door code of Yan Zhen's place.

95
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,960
Why are you giving me this?

96
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,560
The scandal between you two

97
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,560
are making the rounds.

98
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,240
Kindly don't drag me down.

99
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,400
Yan Zhen has been hiding

100
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,720
since the shareholders' meeting.

101
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,680
Mr. Wang.

102
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,800
Don't you want to talk to her?

103
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,840
What do you mean?

104
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,120
Zejia's will

105
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,280
upset me a lot.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,840
But now,

107
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,160
I have a way to make myself happy.

108
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,760
The thing is,

109
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,320
I need your help.

110
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,240
I'm just an outsider.

111
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,200
I've been working

112
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,360
in the company for my whole life
without making any trouble.

113
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,680
I really don't want

114
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,920
to poke my nose into your family affair.

115
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,800
Mr. Wang, are you willing

116
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,280
to play second fiddle
for the rest of your life?

117
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,840
Collaborate with me.

118
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,000
We will split the shares evenly.

119
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,240
Whether you gain enormous wealth,

120
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,000
or start your own business,

121
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,400
it's much better than now.

122
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,440
Well.

123
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,920
I'm not young anymore

124
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,880
and not ambitious.

125
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
As the saying goes,

126
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,520
"Whether one can be regarded as a hero

127
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,920
depends on the people of today."

128
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,480
Ms. Yan

129
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,200
is the largest shareholder
in the group now.

130
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,440
A word to the wise.

131
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,960
You should evaluate
the current situation

132
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,720
and don't mess things up.

133
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,960
This is an advice

134
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,920
from the older generation.

135
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,360
Yan Zhen

136
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,000

She has also been encroaching

140
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,240
on the Chu family's property.

141
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,760
Mr. Wang, I'll tell you right now.

142
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,600
She is my enemy!

143
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,280
Don't be so radical.

144
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,360
You're one family.

145
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,520
One family?

146
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,120
Is she a Chu?

147
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,000
Mr. Wang.

148
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,520
Don't you consider

149
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040

I have

00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,520
made my point.

152

Between you and Ms. Yan,

153
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,920
I won't side with either of you.

I'm afraid
