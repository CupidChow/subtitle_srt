[Episode 11]

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,000
When you were poisoned
in the break room,

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,200
where was he?

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,000
He was the only one present

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,800
when the ledgers in the file room
were sealed.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,160
He's the sole one
who could tamper with them.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,280
Why do you still believe him?

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,400
(Yes, I believe him.)

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,760
Cheng.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,920
What are you doing here?

12
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,520
Nothing.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,920
You finished the soup I gave you.

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,880
Is it good?

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,040
Thank you for the soup.
I'll take you home now.

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,960
I... I don't want to go back.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,480
My mom wouldn't let me play video games.

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,520
So I'm not going back.

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,280
You've already eaten the soup, you know?

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,120
So,

21
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,080
you can't kick me out.

22
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,400
You're not a child anymore.

23
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,520
You can't always come to my place.

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,440
It's inconvenient.

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,000
Why not?

26
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:57,960
You...

27
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,440
Are you seeing someone?

28
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,480
Yes, so it's inconvenient.

29
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,520
Who are you seeing?

30
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,680
Since when?

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:09,960
You...

32
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,160
Impossible.

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,760
You're busy with work every day,

34
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,040
and I'm with you after work.

35
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,520
How could you be seeing someone?

36
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,680
Do you want to listen to the truth?

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,440
Hang on.

38
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,680
Is the truth

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,360
you're going to tell

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,840
something I expect?

41
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,640
Is that a confession?

42
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,320
Give me some time.

43
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,280
I need to get ready.

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,440
I'm the peerless beauty
in this universe.

45
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,920
How charming I am.

46
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,920
Xin.

47
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,360
Please stop making soup.

48
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,440
It's awful.

49
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,760
That was a good acting.

50
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,200
Were you testing him
to see if he felt guilty?

51
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,080
I really see him as my friend.

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,720
But you don't trust him.

53
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,200
Now, you haven't found any evidence,

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,480
and you can't even recognize
friends from foes.

55
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,960
Besides,

56
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,640
he deceives you.

57
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,480
What about you?

58
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,280
If I say I didn't,

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,400
will you believe me?

60
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,080
I must get the thing Zejia left.

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,200
Whatever your attitude is,

62
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,080
I hope you can help me.

63
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,320
That's just a ledger.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,320
It wouldn't be useful
even if you get it.

65
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:49,960
The ledger...

66
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,840
I can't sleep until I get it.

67
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,840
You don't know about this.

68
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,240
I've been taking

69
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,920
sleeping pills for some time.

70
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,160
Cheng, hurry.

71
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
I'm running late.

72
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,280
I got to go upstairs now.

73
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,720
She always acts like a child.

74
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,000
Madam scolded her,

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,600
and she just ran away.

76
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,440
She thought it was unfair.

77
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,120
She has a temper.

78
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,960
Is Madam home?

79
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,960
I want to say hi to her.

80
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,960
Yes, she is.

81
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,080
She's in the living room.

82
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,720
Ms. Yan.

83
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,160
Ms. Yan, you asked for vitamins.

84
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,280
Just arrived at the reception desk.

85
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,320
I brought it here for you.

86
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,280
Inform the marketing department
there's a meeting at 2:30 PM.

87
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,400
Postpone the meeting after that
by 30 minutes.

88
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,640
Yes, Ms. Yan.

89
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,760
Combine these two formulas.

90
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,280
Try again.

91
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,080
Zhen, Mercury retrograde comes again.

92
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,320
Aries are likely to get touchy recently.

93
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,680
This vitamin is awesome.

94
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,240
Please have it.

95
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,640
Thank you.

96
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,760
Chu Xin.

97
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,560
You know what?

98
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,520
Zejia is watching you.

99
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,120
Focus.

100
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,840
Don't reprimand her.

101
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,080
She's doing quite well.

102
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,680
Madam.

103
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,880
I sent Xin back.

104
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,040
So I came in to say hi.

105
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,400
Xin bothered you again?

106
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,360
Sit.

107
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,240
You shouldn't pamper her so much.

108
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,040
She'll go too far.

109
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,240
Gu Cheng.

110
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,240
To be frank,

111
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,720
I see both you and Xin equally.

112
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,400
Although I'm Zejia and
Ze'an's stepmother,

113
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,840
I met you

114
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,240
earlier.

115
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,360
Many years have swiftly passed.

116
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,200
Back then,

117
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,920
you were a little boy.

118
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,200
Yes.

119
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,320
(That's why)

120
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,480
(I can't accept Xin.)

121
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,800
If it weren't for you adopting me,

122
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,120
I might've died of hunger.

123
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,520
Well, have you eaten breakfast?

124
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,840
Yes.

125
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
If there's nothing else,
I'm leaving.

126
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,760
Off you go.

127
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,000

128
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,240
