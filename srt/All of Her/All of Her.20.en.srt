00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,080
Four years ago,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,120
I discovered something was wrong
with the company's finances.

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,520
It was just a simple audit,

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,360
however, the process
was unexpectedly rough.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,840
The ongoing collaborative projects

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,000

14

00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,320
that the obstacles I faced
were enormous.

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,720
On the day of our wedding anniversary,

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,320
I received news

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,680
that someone tampered with the cruise.

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,360
Once it set sail,

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,000
the tampered engine
would trigger an explosion.

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,400
That was why I asked you to act normal.

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,080
I planned to follow the murderer's plan
