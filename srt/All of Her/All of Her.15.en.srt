[All of Her]

00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,250
[Episode 15]

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,960
Why did you come back?

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,920
What's going on
between you and the chairperson?

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,720
Are you investigating Zejia's death?

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,280
Did you know anything about it

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,680
before the accident?

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,000
I don't care what you're after.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,760
You shouldn't use Yan Zhen.

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,560
Then why did you bug her?

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,680
Don't tell me

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,400
you want to protect her.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,280
Let me tell you this.

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,240
The best way to protect someone

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,800
is to tell the truth.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,200
Yan Zhen is not the murderer.

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,360
Your words mean nothing here.

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,920
Besides, she did hide something
from her husband,

19
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,640
didn't she?

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,760
Everyone has their own secret.

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,440
Zejia's death

22
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,560
has nothing to do with Yan Zhen.

23
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,200
And you?

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,400
The explosions four years ago,

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,440
you're hiding something, aren't you?

26
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,120
I know you're not the murderer.

27
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,240
You know who did that.

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,560
I used to think that I knew that.

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,120
So I'd been keeping it down low.

30
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,280
But then I realized

31
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,040
that the accountant's death

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,000
and Zejia's accident

33
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,920
had actually nothing to do

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,200
with the person I wanted to protect.

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,360
This is hilarious.

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,800
Are you saying

37
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,560
that you have no idea
who the mastermind is?

38
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,570
[Anshi Group Employee Information
Name: Lu Nan]

39
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,800
(Lu Nan is still alive.)

40
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,800
(Where has she been hiding
over the years?)

41
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,680
(Also,)

42
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,080
(good try for the acting.)

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,280
(But you're really a bad liar,)

(Chu Zejia.)

45
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,120
Talk about perfect timing.

46
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,480
Help me

47
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,160
throw all these out.

48
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,680
Aren't these belong to Zejia?

49
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
What are you doing?

50
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,400
Well.

51
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,600
I agree with you.

52
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,760
I should stop investigating.

53
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,680
I'm incapable of that, too.

54
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,680
I'll leave it to the police,

55
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,280
and start my life anew.

56
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,880
You can start your life anew.

57
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,600
But...

58
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,720
But you don't have to throw things away.

59
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,480
Out with the old, in with the new.

60
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,880
In with the new?

61
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,360
Well.

62
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,160
I'll get over the old lover
and welcome a new guy.

63
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,600
Still,

64
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,600
you don't have to do this.

65
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,200
Look at this garage kit.

66
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,000
This

67
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,160

68
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,800
They won't be produced anymore.

69
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,160
They will be upset

70
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,920
if you throw them away.

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,400

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,080
You're

73
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,480
so kind-hearted.

74
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,120
But I'm doing this for your sake.

75
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,160
What do you mean?

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,880
The new guy

77
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,160
is you.

78
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,440
I'm going out this weekend.

79
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,720
Care to join me?

80
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,760
I told you your leave won't be approved.

81
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,960
There will be more openings
without a man coming with me.

82
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,160
It's fine if you don't want to go.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,480
(It's like Ze'an cheats on me.)

84
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,160
(As if.)

85
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,560
Hello, gorgeous.

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,840
Let's have a drink

87
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,680
tonight.

88
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,720
Sorry.

89
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,120
She has plans later.

90
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,040
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

91
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,920
Hey, who are you?

92
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,720
Answer me.

93
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,360
Don't ignore me.

94
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,440
Dear, do you want a sip?

95
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,520
It's fresh.

96
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,400
Dear.

97
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,800
I thought you said you wouldn't come.

98
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,680
Nobody is here. Drop your act.

99
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,480
Dear.

100
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,960
Nobody is here.
What's there to be afraid of?

101
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,800
Dear.

102
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,440
Stick to what you have to do here.

103
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,080
Ms. Actress.

104
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,840
Since Lu Nan left the Anshi Group,

105
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,520
she went missing.

106
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,920
She might've had an accident.

107
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,160
How are you going to investigate?

108
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,400
Even if Lu Nan is gone,

109
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,480
the clues still exist.

110
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,200
What do you mean?

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,600
Do you remember
that Lu Nan has a younger sister

112
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,520
according to the employee information?

113
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,880
But I don't think

114
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,680
her sister would know anything.

115
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,040
We just need to
let the person behind know

116
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,600
that we're aware of something,

117
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,640
that's enough.

118
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,080
This is dangerous.

119
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,360
You can't do this.

120
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,440
Don't you forget

121
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,880
that I'm your employer.

122
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
You have to listen to me.

123
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,840
Or perhaps

124
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,680
you think you can't keep me safe?

125
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,720
Gorgeous.

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,880
May I sit here?

127
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,720
Sorry.

128
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,880
I'm waiting for someone.

129
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,960
Since the person hasn't arrived yet,

130
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,800
why don't we chat for a while?

131
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,760
Try your luck.

132
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,680
Who knows
if there will be an unexpected gain?

133
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,480
Miss.

134
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,960
I never sought unexpected gains

135
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,040
in my life.

136
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,440
Every step I take

137
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,800
needs a meticulous plan.

138
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,240
Plans change.

139
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,680
Surprises are always beyond expectation.

140
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,280
Lu Nan's sister

141
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,360
takes charge of the room cleaning.

142
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,960
But we don't have
the janitor's schedule.

143
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,320
You're just

144
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,920
gambling.

145
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,760
We're here for a vacation.

146
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,080
Relax.

147
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,160
Miss, here's your coffee.

148
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,760
Thank you.

149
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,560
I'm seeing a new guy,
so I need a new flavor.

150
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,080
Changing to a new flavor is easy,

151
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,480
but it's not for changing the man.

152
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah.

153
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,120
It's hard to act like
a different person, right?

154
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,520
Absolutely, Dear.

155
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,200
Let's get down to business.

156
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,960
Where is it?

157
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,160
Dear.

158
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,600
My ring is missing.

159
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,280
We got to find it.

160
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,760
No.

161
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,240
Compensation?

162
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,320
The important thing
is the meaning of the ring,

163
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,800
not the price.

164
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,440
Send me your janitor list.

165
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,920
I'll ask them in person.

166
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,880
How was it?

167
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,080
Is that convincing?

168
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,240
Not bad.

169
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,960
That way,

170
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,120
the person who knows
where the accountant is

171
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,320
will react.

172
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,880
Zhen.

173
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,440
If you really lost

174
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,920
the ring Zejia gave,

175
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,080
what would you do?

176
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,840
Why do I care about the ring

177
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,280
when the man is gone?

178
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,640
True, though.

179
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,840
Do you mean it?

180
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,840
I do.

181
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,160
Your rising sign is...

182
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,120
Your rising sign is Taurus.

183
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
Taurus is very...

184
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,000
Wait...

185
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,680
What's this?

186
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,920
Why did you report?

187
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,240
My reading is not accurate?

188
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,920
How can that be?

189
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,560
Nothing is wrong with the calculation.

190
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,800
Perhaps this person

191
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,440
got his own birthday wrong.

192
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,480
It must be.

193
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,640
Cheng said

194
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,320
there are many people
whose actual birthdays

195
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,600
are different from the dates
on their IDs.

196
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,120
I need to appeal.

197
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,040
Girl.

198
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,800
You're here to choose a birthday present
for Gu Cheng.

199
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,400
Enjoy the drink tonight.

200
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,040
I'm not drinking tonight.

201
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,520
What are you three up to?

202
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,600
They want to celebrate my birthday.

203
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,720
Will you come?

204
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,680
I saw your ID card before.

205
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,200
Today is not your birthday.

206
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,920
That's not the correct date.

207
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,240
His actual birthday is today.

208
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,360
Only the three of us know this.

209
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,560
Exactly.

210
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,040
Xin, join us.

211
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,360
Well, then.

212
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,080
Let's go.

213
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,840
Looks like you're forced.

214
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,680
Come on. Chop-chop.

215
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
This is strange.

216
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,000
