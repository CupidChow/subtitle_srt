3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,800
Out with it.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,120
Where is the pen drive?

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,960
What pen drive?

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,920
I knew

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,360
you were a reticent woman, Ms. Yan.

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,400
I don't care, anyway.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,440
The pen drive won't be helpful to you.

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,320
Your whole family is dead.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,200
Only the Chu's siblings
and their mom are left.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,640
You can't do anything about this.

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,080
See

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,720
Yan Zhen off.

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,280
Wang Zhongmin.

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,600
Anyway, everything

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,760
will vanish at last.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,880
You can't blame me
for what happened to your parents.

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,040
They could've lived a carefree life

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,200
after taking the money.

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,000
However, they ratted on me

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,400
by all means.

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,920
They made me do this.

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,400
You must miss your parents a lot,
didn't you?

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,400
Soon,

26
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,720
you will all reunite.

27
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,560
Wang Zhongmin.

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,480
You will wind up

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,720
sabotaging yourself.

30
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,000
Jun.

31
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,320
Stay still.

32
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,360
Stay still.

33
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,760
Stay where you are.

34
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,000
I've called the police.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,640
They will be right here soon.

36
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,640
Careful.

37
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,240
Luckily, we came in time.

38
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,720
Are you all right?

39
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,040
I'm good.

40
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,040
Did you record it?

41
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,280
This is a solid proof

42
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,080
of their crimes.

43
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,760
I didn't expect so many friends
to come here today.

44
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,760
Mom.

45
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,800
You look pretty today.

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,520
Sorry, please excuse me.

47
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,400
Madam.

48
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,160
Sure.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,800
Mr. Uncle.

50
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,840
Thank you so much for coming, Mr. Wang.

51
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,320
Please look out for me in the future.

52
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,520
I will.

53
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,680
Congratulations.

54
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
Please stay for a drink.

55
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,560
Sure.

56
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,240
Thank you for coming, Mr. Wang.

57
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:50,880
You flatter me.

58
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,240
Mom.

59
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,720
Please keep Mr. Wang entertained.

60
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,760
Sure.

61
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Hold on, Zhen.

62
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,320
Why are you leaving in a rush?

63
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,280
Was my acting pretty convincing, right?

64
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,000
I suppose Wang Zhongmin believes it.

65
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,200
I have no idea
whether he believes it or not,

66
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,800
I believe it, anyway.

67
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,760
Greedy and dodgy.

68
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,800
This is who you are, right?

69
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,280
Brother-in-law.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,080
How ill-fated

71
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,080
your fiancee has to be

72
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,480
to marry a man like you.

73
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Well,

74
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,520
that's enough.

75
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,400
Dear.

76
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,520
Here's something for you.

77
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,200
You look cute

78
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,680
when you get jealous.

79
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,120
This is a micro voice recorder

80
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,640
with a GPS locator.

81
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,440
It won't be easy to notice
when worn on the ear.

82
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,960
I'm giving it to you.

83
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,200
Stay safe.

84
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,680
(Four years ago,
you faced the danger alone)

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,560

(This time,)

87
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,280
(I will face it.)

88
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,080
Finally, I can stop acting as enemies
with my wife.

89
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,960
How great.

90
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,280
It's been years.

91
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,160
Everything is over.

92
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,520
It's fine.

93
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,520
From now on,

94
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,360
I'll always be by your side.
