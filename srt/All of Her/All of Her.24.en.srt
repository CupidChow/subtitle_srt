00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,320
[Episode 24]

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,280
Between you and Ms. Yan,

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,680
I won't side with either of you.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,520
I'm afraid

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,000
she won't let you off easily.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,080
What do you mean?

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,320
A few days ago,

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,640
I heard that my mom

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,160
was going to give Yan Zhen something

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,720
at my engagement ceremony.

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,120
I think

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,880
it is

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,280
the ledgers of Anshi Group

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,960
over the past years.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
It seems like

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,840
she'll use that against you.

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,040
You better bring useful information.

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,520
Yan Zhen is Wu Wenzhao's daughter.

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,000
People often say that gamblers

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,280
are colossal nuts.

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,000
They simply make up stories for money.

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,640
Mr. Wang.

24
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,040
I heard it from the horse's mouth.

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
This is true.

26
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,360
Take the money and get lost.

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,040
Don't you come to me again.

28
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,520
Please have a seat.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,160
Mr. Chu Jr.

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,960
You're young

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,120
and inexperienced

32
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,760
in managing the company.

33
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,880
The company is huge in scale,

34
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,680
and we can't avoid making mistakes

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,720
or violating rules on accounts.

36
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,120
This is normal.

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,760
Plus,

38
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,200
Ms. Yan is currently

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,680
the company's largest shareholder.

40
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,280
It's reasonable for her

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,440
to know more

42
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,680
about the past record

43
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,480
of the ledger.

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,200
Why make a fuss?

45
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,360
You're right, Mr. Wang.

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,960
Oh, I almost forgot to tell you.

47
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,840
Yan Zhen drove me out of her place.

48
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,560
But before that,

49
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,800
I saw her

50
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,000
moving a safe into her house.

51
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,440
If I'm not mistaken,

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,920
something very important

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,160
is in the safe.

54
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,480
Mr. Wang.

55
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,760
You're loyal to the group.

56
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
She will put all your behavior

57
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,560
under the microscope
to undermine you.

58
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,440
Why don't we

59
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,480
do something before her?

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,600
Well,

61
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,840
I'm not afraid of her scheme.

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,160
Let's stop here.

63
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,400
All right, then.

64
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,880
If you change your mind,

65
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,320
come to me at any time.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,720
I have got plans.

67
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,800
I should get going.

68
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,640
Should we start now?

69
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,840
Dude.

70
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,440
I need to stay upstairs with Yan
for the moment.

71
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,800
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,120
But you need to stay
in the child's room alone.

73
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,360
You make me feel like

74
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,920
I'm a little extra here.

75
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,960
[Xin]

76
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,720
Xin.

77
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,240
What's wrong?

78
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,280
Wait.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,320
Calm down, please.

80
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
All right.

81
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,400
No problem.

82
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,080
Okay, I'll hang up. Bye, Xin.

83
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,440
Who are you?

84
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,360
What are you doing here?

85
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,480
Stop right there.

86
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,160
I need backup.

87
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,280
It turns out Ma Jun works for Wang.

88
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,880
That's a smart move, Mr. Chu.

89
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,880
To make

90
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,080
Wang expose himself,

91
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,200
I pretend to collaborate with him,

92
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,480
knowing that this fox
wouldn't trust me at all.

93
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,080
"Catch the Mole" plan

94
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,160
commences now.

95
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,280
Thank you.

96
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,040
Thank you, everyone.

97
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,760
Congratulations.

98
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,280
Thanks.

99
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,000
Congratulations.

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,600
Congratulations.

101
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,280
Cheers.

102
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,640
Happy engagement.

103
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,680
I appreciate that.

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,640
Zhen.

105
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,760
If I'm not mistaken,

106
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,280
you received this necklace

107
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,280
from Zejia.

108
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,960
Correct.

109
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,760
This is a blessing

110
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,120
from Zejia and me.

111
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,120
Never mind.

112
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,520
Thank you, Zhen. It looks great.

113
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,200
Zejia has already given you the company.

114
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,040
Yet you gave me his thing

115
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,120
on my engagement ceremony.

116
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,920
Spoilsport.

117
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,840
You don't like my present

118
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,120
because this doesn't include

119
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,040
the company?

120
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,320
An.

121
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
Everyone is watching.

122
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,480
You shouldn't be rude to her.

123
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,720
Yan Zhen.

124
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,720
He's your brother-in-law.

125
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,360
Please bear with him.

126
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,320
Thank you, Zhen. I like it very much.

127
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,080
Mom.

128
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,840
I suddenly don't feel well.

129
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,440
Perhaps I ate something funny

130
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,640
that revolts me.

131
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,240
I'm going back to my room.

132
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,760
Yan Zhen.

133
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,440
It's fine, everyone.

134
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,640
Let's drink.

135
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,000
This is the information from Mr. Wu.

136
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,000
Keep it safe.

137
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,360
