You've tried everything.

00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,000
You know him so well.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,120
Then why did you marry Zejia?

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,680
I told you we went to the same college.

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,080
This is normal.

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,200
Stop being mean.

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,000
You should figure out

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,360
what the password is instead.

16

If I did,

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,720
I wouldn't have known

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,320
how deeply you know about
another man besides your husband.

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,480
This is

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,280
Zejia's car.

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,400
You can recognize his car?

25
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,160
I gave him this amulet.

26

This place

27

How do you know about this?

30
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,480
That accountant, Lu Nan,

It's all in the record system.

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,920
You know nothing
about your staff, don't you?

35
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,640
I don't have a hobby
about memorizing staff's records.

36

All right.

42

Are you mad at me?

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,600
If you come back within 15 minutes

44
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,880
and give me a goodnight kiss,

45
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,280
I might consider not being mad at you.

Why are you shy, Zhen?

Who is this man?

want to live for myself.)
