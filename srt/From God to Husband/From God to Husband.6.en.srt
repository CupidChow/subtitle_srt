12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,520
Well,

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,280
a big shot?

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,440
Who is it?

15
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,360
That's not convenient to disclose.

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,800
Well,

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,000
since that's the case,

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,160
anyway, Jiang Feng

19
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,560
is just here to cause trouble.

20
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,400
So,

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,960
for Chenfei's sake,

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,120
let's just call it a day.

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,200
We're all classmates,

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,160
so there's no need

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,480
to insist on a contest.

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's end it here today.

27
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,640
Mr. Tao,

28
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,040
I really can't stand it for you.

29
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,000
We are

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,840
in the Top Immortal's
largest private room,

31
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,840
Fubixing Room.

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,640
If we back down,

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,960
won't it make us a laughingstock?

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,280
Mr. Tao, that's right.

35
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,240
Are you going to let a son-in-law

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,960
ride on top of you?

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,000
You're the CEO of Zhongjing Group,

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,400
and you know Manager Long.

39
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,240
Are you afraid of him?

40
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,000
How could I be afraid
of a worthless son-in-law?

41
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,360
Go tell that big shot

42
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,880
that we

43
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,040
must have

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,200
this wine.

45
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,840
Yes, sir.

46
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,480
Jiang Feng,

47
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,120
I must remind you.

48
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,200
Everyone here

49
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,920
is either rich or influential.

50
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,760
Mr. Tao

51
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,480
has every right to compete.

52
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,480
You, a son-in-law,

53
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,560
might offend the important
figures in the next room.

54
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,120
You might end up in trouble.

55
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,280
Fengyasong Room bids 6 million.

56
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,480
Any more bids?

57
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,760
7 million.

58
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,760
Fubixing Room bids 7 million.

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,920
Fengyasong Room bids 10 million.

60
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,680
Any more bids?

61
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,480
Today

62
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,560
will become the highest price

63
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,480
for a wine auction

64
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,400
in the history of the Top Immortal.

65
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,320
All right, Wensheng.

66
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,320
We can drink any wine.

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,280
Don't waste so much money

68
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,000
just for the sake of a bet.

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,920
Besides,

70
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,000
Jiang Feng

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,480
relies on Chenfei to support him.

72
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,840
Where does he get the money?

73
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,400
In the end,

74
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,760
won't it be us paying?

75
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,920
Yes, let's forget it, Mr. Tao.

76
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,560
It seems that important person
is determined to get it.

77
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,120
It's better for us
to avoid confrontation.

78
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,360
Fine.

79
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,080
Then we won't bid.

80
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,680
Wait.

81
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,840
Chenfei,

82
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,400
in fact,

83
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,120
it's been such a long time

84
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,680
since we shared a drink.

85
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,000
50 million.

86
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,800
Bring the wine.

87
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,120
50 million?

88
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,440
Sir, are you sure?

89
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,720
Who dares to compete with me?

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,840
All right.

91
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,800
This is truly astonishing.

92
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,840
Jiang Feng,

93
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,840
I admire your courage.

94
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,120
I want to see

95
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,880
how long you, a worthless son-in-law

96
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,240
can keep this up.

97
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,560
Jiang Feng,

98
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,960
this is not a place for nonsense.

99
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,080
Stop this. Don't make trouble.

100
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,120
I said I'd accompany you to the end.

101
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,560
If 50 million is not enough,

102
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
then 500 million.

103
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,280
5 billion.

104
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
Even 50 billion.

105
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,160
Money

106
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,280
is just a pile of waste paper.

107
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,360
But today,

108
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,770
no one can make Chenfei suffer
even the slightest grievance.

109
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,120
Well said.

110
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,840
You're insane.

111
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,720
You know,

112
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,000
I've seen people

113
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,680
pretend to be rich without money.

114
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,960
But this level of recklessness

115
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,160
is a first for me.

116
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,600
I heard

117
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,000
someone was competing with me
for the wine here.

118
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,080
Father,

119
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,440
what brings you here?

120
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,000
I thought it was some fool

121
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,280
who bid a 1 million bottle of wine
to 50 million.

122
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Turns out it's you!

123
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,520
Father,

124
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,560
you've misunderstood me.

125
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,880
It's him!

126
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,380
He's maliciously driving up the price.

127
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,600
May I ask your name?

128
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Jiang Feng.

129
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,160
I thought you were some
young master from a wealthy family.

130
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,120
Turns out you're just a nobody.

131
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,680
A kid who hasn't even grown up yet

132
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,600
trying to act like others in an auction.

133
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,560
Do you have the capability?

134
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,000
What?

135
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,000
Do you have any objections?

136
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,160
Swipe the card.

137
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,720
Show them out.

138
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,040
This...

139
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,120
Is this the legendary
Supreme Zijing Card?

140
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,280
What?

141
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,920
Father,

142
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,800
for this kind of card,

143
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,600
there are only five in the world.

144
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,360
Jiang Feng,

145
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,040
as a son-in-law of the Liu family,

146
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,130
where did you get this card?

147
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,920
Mr. Tao,

148
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,000
I think the card
Jiang Feng has is definitely fake.

149
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,720
A counterfeit.

150
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,600
Interesting.

151
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,160
Truly interesting.

152
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,720
Kid, you may deceive others,

153
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,920
but you can't fool me.

154
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,920
In Jiangcheng,

155
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,480
only one Supreme Zijing Card

156
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,720
is held by the Lu family.

157
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,160
Didn't you inquire

158
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,800
about who owns

159
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,480
the Top Immortal

160
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,120
before you came here?

161
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,040
Jiang Feng,

162
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,480
you can fabricate it

163
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,160
and deceive others everywhere.

164
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,480
But you had to commit fraud
on Lu family's territory.

165
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
This time,

166
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,240
you've really hit a wall.

167
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,360
Excuse me,

168
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,720
call Manager Long.

169
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,560
Tell her someone is causing trouble.

170
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,560
Hey,

171
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,800
Jiang Feng,

172
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,920
are you scared?

173
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Too late now.

174
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
Ha ha ha.

175
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,000
When Manager Long arrives,

176
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,280
I want to see

177
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,360
how you'll end up.

178
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
Jiang Feng,

179
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,040
have you gone mad?

180
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,120
Daring to counterfeit
something like this?

181
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,840
I thought

182
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,920
you've made progress
in these three years.

183
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,920
Unexpectedly,

184
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,600
you've become even more reckless.

185
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,840
Who is

186
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,720
causing trouble in the Top Immortal?

187
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
Manager Long,

188
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
you're finally here.

189
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,800
There's someone here using a fake card

190
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,920
to create confusion.

191
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,160
Please address this fairly.

192
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,920
That's right.

193
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,800
Who doesn't know that the Supreme
Zijing Card belongs to the Lu family?

194
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,240
He actually dares to use
a fake card to commit fraud.

195
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,800
Isn't this insulting the Top Immortal

196
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,160
and the Lu family?

197
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,240
Young man,

198
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,240
Manager Long is here.

199
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,800
You should kneel down now.

200
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,360
Bow and apologize.

201
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,240
Perhaps you might get a lighter punishment.

202
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,720
Mr. Jiang,

203
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,680
what brings you here?

204
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,280
What?

205
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,600
What?

206
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,000
Manager Long,

207
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,600
did you mistake the person?

208
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Shut up!

209
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,240
Do you know who he is?

210
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,000
Mr. Jiang is the real owner

211
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,280
of the Top Immortal.

212
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,920
The entire Top Immortal

213
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,720
is Mr. Jiang's property.

214
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,920
Not to mention having a meal

215
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,600
or a drink,

216
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,400
even if Mr. Jiang wants
a glass of lemonade,

217
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,720
our 88 Michelin-starred chefs

218
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,480
will prepare it for him.

219
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,000
You dare to offend Mr. Jiang?

220
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,600
You're courting death.

221
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,720
He is the owner of the Top Immortal?

222
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,000
So, Jiang Feng is the real big shot.

223
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,360
Mr. Tao, please pay the bill.

224
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
You said before

225
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,720
that all expenses
would be split equally.

226
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,280
Now the total is 50 million.

227
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,040
You owe half.

228
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,600
What?

229
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,920
Half?

230
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,560
You ungrateful child!

231
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,000
Are you trying to piss me off?

232
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,400
Kneel down quickly.

233
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,920
Apologize to Mr. Jiang.

234
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,400
Father!

235
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,600
Quickly!

236
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,800
I'm sorry,

237
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,480
Mr. Jiang.

238
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,040
I'm sorry.

239
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,040
Please forgive me.

240
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,400
If I really pay half,

241
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,120
I'll be ruined.

242
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,800
Mr. Jiang,

243
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,480
I was blind.

244
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,920
Please spare me this time.

245
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,040
I'll never do it again.

246
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,720
Mr. Jiang,

247
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,480
please spare me!

248
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,600
No!

249
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,000
No...

250
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,480
Let me go!

251
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,160
Wensheng!

252
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,160
Mr. Jiang!

253
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,720
Wensheng!

254
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,040
Mr. Jiang, please spare me!

255
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,040
Jiang Feng,

256
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,840
what's going on?

257
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,040
Mr. Jiang.

258
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,600
Mr. Jiang,

259
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,480
I've long noticed
that you're extraordinary.

260
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,280
Those previous matters
were misunderstandings.

261
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,680
Please don't take them to heart.

262
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,560
Chenfei,

263
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,040
it's all Tao Wensheng's fault.

264
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,280
There's so much
I haven't had a chance to tell you.

265
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Mr. Jiang,

266
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,920
one should not judge by appearance.

267
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,600
May I ask if it's convenient for you
to leave a number?

268
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,360
I'll definitely visit you another day.

269
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,200
That's right.

270
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,960
No need.

271
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,360
If it weren't for today,

272
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,240
I wouldn't have seen
so many two-faced people

273
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,440
among Chenfei's classmates.

274
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,000
Chenfei, there's a problem at the company.

275
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,080
Someone is maliciously

276
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,720
suppressing our products in the market.

277
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,880
Hurry back to the company.

278
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,640
Okay.

279
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Don't worry.

280
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,120
I'll handle it right away.

281
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,760
What's wrong?

282
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,880
I have something to deal with.

283
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,000
You can go home alone.

284
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,120
Later,

285
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,120
I'll ask you what exactly happened.

286
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,760
Mr. Jiang, there's been

287
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,240
a lot of misunderstanding today.

288
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,480
He hit me on the chest.

289
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,240
Mr. Zhou.

290
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,480
Ms. Liu,

291
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,000
what brings you here?

292
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,360
Mr. Zhou,

293
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,240
can Liu's real estate business

294
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,480
still be done in Jiangcheng?

295
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,200
Give me an answer.

296
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,240
Ms. Liu,

297
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,000
what are you talking about?

298
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Liu's Group operates
legally and reasonably.

299
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,640
When has it been my turn to interfere?

300
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,960
Let's not beat around the bush.

301
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,990
Based on my investigation,

302
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,440
Liu's Group has been suppressed

303
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,120
because of you behind the scenes.

304
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,480
We're here for business.

305
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,280
If you have any conditions,
just let me know.

306
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,840
How about this?

307
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,240
I'll give you 20% of the market.

308
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,840
You give me 80% of the profit.

309
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,000
Sign the contract and we'll work.

310
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,840
If you don't sign,

311
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,720
that's fine too.

312
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,480
80% of the profit?

313
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,480
(It's the lion's share.)

314
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,960
As I know,

315
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,120
90% of your employees have never worked

316
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,720
in the real estate industry.

317
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,960
Your sales are in complete disarray.

318
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,240
If you continue like this,
both sides will be hurt.

319
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,840
Mr. Zhou,

320
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,440
you're not

321
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,600
faring well either.

322
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,360
Humph!

323
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,200
None of your concern.

324
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,120
Since your Liu family offended me,

325
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,640
you should be mentally prepared.

326
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,320
And this is just the beginning.

327
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
When did we offend you?

328
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,240
Enough!

329
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,360
No more words.

330
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,120
Come on.

331
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,000
Show her out!

332
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,720
Miss Liu,

333
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,960
please.

334
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,720
Jiang Feng,

335
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,960
I want you dead!

336
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,720
(Hong Li, Blade of Lishui)
Master Hong, this person

337
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,720
is quite unusual.

338
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,760
He seems quite skilled.

339
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,480
I didn't even know
how I was thrown away.

340
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,200
It was like a swoosh.

341
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,360
I fell into the water.

342
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,840
Since I'm here,

343
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,120
I won't just stand by.

344
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,160
I've examined your injuries.

345
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,400
He is also a cultivator

346
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,280
but with weak skills.

347
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,400
He's not worthy of any great praise.

348
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,440
If he's a true expert,

349
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,280
you wouldn't have survived.

350
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,120
Especially

351
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,880
at such a young age.

352
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,640
He should be

353
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,960
a novice just stepping

354
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,360
into the path of cultivation,
arrogant and ignorant.

355
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,000
Master Hong,

356
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,360
well,

357
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,480
against this person,

358
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
how sure are you

359
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,320
of winning?

360
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,360
I don't even

361
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,240
need to lift a finger.

362
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,360
Master Hong,

363
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,360
after it's done,

364
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,480
I won't forget your benefits.

365
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,640
It's raining today.

366
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,840
