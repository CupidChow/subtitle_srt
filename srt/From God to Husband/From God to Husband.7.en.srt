Mother.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,480
Stop pacing.

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,320
Chenfei,

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,400
how's it going?

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,320
Tell us.

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,920
Zhou Baxiong still won't back down.

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,040
He doesn't want
to settle things peacefully.

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,760
We should come up with another plan.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,890
How could this happen?

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,280
When did our Liu family

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,480
offend such a difficult guy?

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,040
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,080
It's my fault.

25
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,200
If it weren't for me,

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,136
Jiang Feng wouldn't
have hurt Zhou Baxiong.

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,640
We wouldn't have ended up

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,440
being maliciously suppressed.

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,520
Chenfei,

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,680
I didn't do it on purpose.

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,000
Well,

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,440
it's all Jiang Feng's fault!

33
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,080
No wonder our Liu family's business

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,440
is always being suppressed
for no reason.

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,560
Turns out,

36
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,200
it's all Jiang Feng's fault.

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,400
Jiang Feng is truly a disaster.

38
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,260
The old master
helped the Jiang family then,

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,280
and our Liu family got dragged in.

40
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,200
Now he's provoking Zhou Baxiong.

41
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,920
He really is more trouble

42
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,760
than he's worth.

43
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,176
Jiang Feng!

44
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,840
Tell us!

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
What have you done?

46
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,000
Mother!

47
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,400
What's going on?

48
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,560
Jiang Feng,

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,680
we all know you offended Zhou Baxiong.

50
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,560
What were you thinking?

51
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,120
That's Zhou Baxiong!

52
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,480
Such a big matter,

53
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,480
how could you act recklessly?

54
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,840
If it weren't for Rourou telling us,

55
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,480
we'd still be in the dark.

56
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,560
Zhou Baxiong?

57
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,480
It seems the last lesson

58
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,920
didn't make him learn his lesson.

59
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,560
If I remember correctly,

60
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,592
the cause of this matter...

61
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,312
Forget it.

62
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:37,920
Let's just say it's my fault.

63
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,280
What?

64
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,680
Just say it's your fault?

65
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,680
It's clearly all your doing.

66
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,840
That's enough.

67
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,600
Over the years,

68
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,280
you've eaten our family's food,

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,192
and worn our clothes.

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,960
It's fine if you don't help us.

71
00:02:49,968 --> 00:02:50,240
Stop.

72
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,520
You!

73
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,120
Mother!

74
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,400
You've still dragged us down!

75
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:52,832
It's okay?

76
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,600
I'm going to give you a lesson.

77
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,000
Mother!

78
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:55,930
I'll give you a lesson!

79
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,680
Stop!

80
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,840
Stop it!

81
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,560
(Master Liu of Liu Family)
Stop fighting!

82
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,360
Let me hold him.

83
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,240
Grandpa.

84
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,360
You sit over there.

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,440
About this,

86
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,680
Jiang Feng is indeed at fault,

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,240
but it was unintentional.

88
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,440
When our Liu family was at its peak,

89
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,680
a mere

90
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,960
Zhou Baxiong was nothing.

91
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,880
Could it be that the only way

92
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
for Liu's family
to handle his suppression

93
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,840
is to beg for mercy and apologize?

94
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,400
You all

95
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,080
should reflect on this.

96
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,680
Grandpa!

97
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,520
Jiang,

98
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,720
come here.

99
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,800
Mother.

100
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,960
It's fine.

101
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,800
Grandpa.

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,280
Fine.

103
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,440
Back then,

104
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,520
when you were homeless,

105
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,840
I saw that you were upright,

106
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,440
reliable,

107
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,080
and that's why I let you
into the Liu family.

108
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,680
Over the years,

109
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,560
though you haven't achieved much,

110
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,600
you have been

111
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,440
loyal to the Liu family.

112
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,120
Chenfei has always been strong-willed.

113
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,840
You must protect her well.

114
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:44,720
Grandpa,

115
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,080
rest assured.

116
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,520
No one will separate me and Chenfei.

117
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,400
Listen up,

118
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,360
this is their personal matter.

119
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,800
Stop meddling.

120
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Instead of worrying about this,

121
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,600
you should think of other ways

122
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,360
to deal with Zhou Baxiong's tactics.

123
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,040
Grandpa.

124
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,720
Well,

125
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,680
you can't let your momentary impulse

126
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,480
lead our Liu family

127
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,360
into irreversible ruin.

128
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,120
The problem could be solved
by an alliance with the Kong family...

129
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,280
Shut up!

130
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,120
If you want Chenfei to marry that dandy,

131
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,000
it will only happen over my dead body!

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,400
Liu!

133
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,120
Come here!

134
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,790
Go back to the room.

135
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,680
Grandpa, you can go back.

136
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,690
(He's a person of great loyalty
and righteousness.)

137
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,480
(If I could get
the right medicinal herbs,)

138
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,800
(I might be able to refine an elixir)

139
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,360
(to extend his life by ten years.)

140
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:58,800
Jiang Feng,

141
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,448
come with me.

142
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,040
Chenfei.

143
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,920
Chenfei.

144
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,848
I will handle the issue of Zhou Baxiong.

145
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,040
But could you please
stop causing trouble for me?

146
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,040
And I won't marry Kong Mingzhe

147
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,450
because I refuse to marry a scumbag.

148
00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:29,220
It has nothing to do with you.

149
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,400
Don't worry,

150
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:31,720
Chenfei.

151
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,360
It's not that complicated.

152
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
I'll visit Zhou Baxiong

153
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,600
tomorrow and talk it over.

154
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,800
Enough.

155
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,360
Stop causing trouble for the Liu family.

156
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,560
Leave everything to me.

157
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,660
By the way,

158
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,560
what's going on

159
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,800
with the Top Immortal?

160
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,480
Well, nothing.

161
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,560
It was just a chance event.

162
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,400
I saved Lu Changsheng's life by chance,

163
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,192
and he insisted on giving me an estate.

164
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,240
It's that simple.

165
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,840
Saving someone by chance?

166
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:05,920
Well,

167
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,240
consider it something I learned

168
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,040
during my three years of disappearance.

169
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,456
All right.

170
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,280
I need to get things sorted

171
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,680
and stabilize things at the company.

172
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,280
Otherwise, it will be chaotic.

173
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,160
Remember,

174
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,992
don't cause trouble for me.

175
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,360
Hello, sir.

176
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
Welcome to Muhetang.

177
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,440
Mr. Meng.

178
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,360
Yes.

179
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:45,720
(Mr. Meng, pharmacist)

180
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,890
(of Muhetang)
What do you need?

181
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,152
Five liang each of Astragalus,
Angelica, and Qingxia.

182
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:50,688
Eight qian of Shouwu.

183
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,290
One liang and five qian of Atractylodes.

184
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,160
If it's just these common herbs,

185
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,240
any pharmacy can provide them.

186
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,680
There's no need to come to Muhetang.

187
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,360
Other pharmacies

188
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,600
do have the herbs I need.

189
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,600
But only Muhetang

190
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,040
has a Seven-Leaf Ganoderma.

191
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,848
Seven-Leaf Ganoderma...

192
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
How do you know

193
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,992
Ganoderma grows leaves?

194
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,160
It's a perfectly normal thing.

195
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,984
It's just that most people
in their lifetime

196
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,400
never get to see it.

197
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,040
So you're a kindred spirit.

198
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,000
You've come to the right place.

199
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,840
Muhetang

200
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,800
happens to have a Seven-Leaf Ganoderma.

201
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,400
However, I can't

202
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
make the decision myself.

203
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,160
I need to consult
with our manager, Ms. Murong.

204
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
May I ask,

205
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
do you have an intermediary
to introduce you?

206
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,240
If you don't,

207
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,160
you won't be able to meet our manager.

208
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,160
How about this?

209
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,360
Tianxuan Dragon Ring!

210
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,160
Sir,

211
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,480
please follow me.

212
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,000
As expected of the number one
pharmacy in Jiangcheng.

213
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,120
Muhetang even has such rare items.

214
00:09:20,016 --> 00:09:21,184
(Master Guo)
I'm satisfied.

215
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,056
(Guest of Muhetang)
I'll transfer the money later.

216
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:23,720
(Murong Yanran)

217
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,280
(Manager of Muhetang)
You're polite.

218
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,960
As a guest of Muhetang...

219
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,200
This is our manager, Ms. Murong.

220
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,000
Since ancient times,

221
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,580
poor in literature and rich in military.

222
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,240
Especially those like you,

223
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,240
who travel and train
outside all the time.

224
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,440
There's always going to be fighting.

225
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,840
Moreover,

226
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,000
you have helped Muhetang
out of trouble multiple times.

227
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,120
I'll provide you

228
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,640
with the best medicinal materials

229
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,320
to alleviate your injuries and ailments.

230
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,000
Well...

231
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,200
In that case,

232
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
thank you, Ms. Murong.

233
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll accept your kindness.

234
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,080
Ms. Murong,

235
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,880
we have a guest.

236
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,360
He's here to purchase
a Seven-Leaf Ganoderma.

237
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,880
I'm Murong Yanran, manager of Muhetang.

238
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,080
I'm Jiang Beizun.

239
00:10:10,992 --> 00:10:11,600
Have a seat.

240
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,120
Well, you may not know.

241
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,440
Our guests at Muhetang

242
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,760
are of two kinds.

243
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,840
One type is the ordinary customers
in the front hall,

244
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,160
superficial and commonplace.

245
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,600
In fact,

246
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,480
the true business of Muhetang

247
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,840
is with our circle of cultivators,

248
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,880
special individuals.

249
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,440
Well that's

250
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,320
in the backyard.

251
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,640
These people come rarely,

252
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,480
but they are major deals.

253
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,360
Mr. Jiang, you seem

254
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,960
a bit unfamiliar.

255
00:10:45,456 --> 00:10:46,576
I'm a wandering cultivator.

256
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,000
It's normal not to know me.

257
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,480
What?

258
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,240
Is it necessary

259
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,240
for me to discuss my background?

260
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,440
No need.

261
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,440
Since you're here
for the Seven-Leaf Ganoderma,

262
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,360
you're certainly one of us.

263
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,960
However,

264
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,584
the Seven-Leaf Ganoderma
is hard to find.

265
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,840
I'm not exaggerating.

266
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,880
In Jiangcheng,

267
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,240
only Muhetang has one,

268
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,120
and it's flawless.

269
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,640
So Mr. Jiang should

270
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,000
have a mental preparation for the price.

271
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,480
As long as it's genuine,

272
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,880
money is not an issue.

273
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,120
Great.

274
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,320
I like dealing
with straightforward people like you.

275
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,120
Mr. Meng,

276
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,120
please fetch the Seven-Leaf Ganoderma

277
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,320
from the storage.

278
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,080
And prepare a Muhe Order as well.

279
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:33,840
Yes.

280
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,720
Master Hong,

281
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,200
that guy is in there.

282
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,080
Lead the way!

283
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,640
Yes!

284
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,720
(Jiang Feng,)

285
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,640
