(Why did the reunion take place here?)

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,160
Fei!

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,560
Long time no see.

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,720
I miss you so much!

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,080
Long time no see.

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,120
You look more beautiful.

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,840
Let me introduce you.

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,600
This is

21
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,800
my fiance,

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,520
Tao Wensheng.

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,160
A genuine rich second generation.

24
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,440
How is he?

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,360
Handsome, right?

26
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,320
Mr. Tao is indeed handsome.

27
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,600
And the person next to you...

28
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,200
Isn't he...

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,080
He's Jiang Feng, the famous son-in-law
of the Liu family, right?

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,720
Hello,

31
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,440
nice to meet you.

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
I'm Tao Wensheng,

33
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,320
CEO of Zhongjing Technology,

34
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,320
a listed company.

35
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,520
I've heard Haiqing mention many times

36
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,360
that you're

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,600
a top figure
in the real estate industry.

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,640
Meeting you today,

39
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,640
you're truly beautiful.

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,920
You live up to your reputation.

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,680
Your husband,

42
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,720
who walks hand in hand with you,

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,720
must not

44
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,760
be too bad either.

45
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,880
Wensheng,

46
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,600
why are you asking
about people right away?

47
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,560
All of us classmates know

48
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,400
that the Liu family
has a live-in son-in-law.

49
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,760
If he really had any ability,

50
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,920
he wouldn't have
to live under others' scrutiny.

51
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,640
I spoke out of turn.

52
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,560
I'll punish myself with a drink later.

53
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,760
Let's head inside first.

54
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,400
Our classmates should be arriving soon.

55
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,400
Sure.

56
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:54,920
Let's go.

57
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,680
Let's go.

58
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,040
It seems to be here.

59
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,680
Isn't that Mr. Tao?

60
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,680
Mr. Tao!

61
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,920
You truly look impressive.

62
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,920
I'm Liu Kai,

63
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,560
director of Yaoyang Company.

64
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,640
Speaking of which,

65
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,560
you are still our key client.

66
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,480
I used to always be
in touch with your subordinates.

67
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,760
Today, thanks to Haiqing,

68
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,400
I finally get to meet you in person.

69
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,200
You didn't bring your assistant today.

70
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,840
So today,

71
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,920
let me

72
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,000
serve you.

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,400
Please,

74
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,840
come in.

75
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,680
I'll lead the way.

76
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,480
Okay.

77
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,200
Look,

78
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,920
this is the way of the world.

79
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,280
Liu Kai,

80
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,560
you are flawless

81
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,000
in social etiquette.

82
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,480
Unlike some people,

83
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,040
who don't understand
the basics of reading the room.

84
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,200
The weak need to flatter others.

85
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,760
Such behavior is no different
from a petty person.

86
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,120
Who are you calling petty?

87
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,840
I didn't mention any names.

88
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,400
Why are you so anxious?

89
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,400
You!

90
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,560
Ms. Liu,

91
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,400
the Liu family's manners are lacking.

92
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,560
Even a live-in son-in-law

93
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,880
dares to argue with others.

94
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,160
All right.

95
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,680
Jiang Feng didn't mean it that way.

96
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,840
Fine.

97
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,560
Let's go.

98
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,400
Let's go.

99
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,560
After you.

100
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,600
All right.

101
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,000
Here.

102
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,600
Have a seat.

103
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,520
Okay.

104
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:16,272
Go ahead and sit.

105
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,400
Oh,

106
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,280
did I see wrong?

107
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,840
How come there's still a tag
hanging on the waist?

108
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,680
Fei,

109
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm not judging you.

110
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,120
It's one thing for the suit not to fit,

111
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,560
but why didn't you take the tag off?

112
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,680
Are you planning to return it

113
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,440
after the meal?

114
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,080
Could it be that for this gathering,

115
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,720
you rented the suit last minute?

116
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,560
Qing.

117
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,000
Miss Liu

118
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,360
has to support so many people

119
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,400
in the Liu Company.

120
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,600
When she goes home,

121
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,560
she still has to support a freeloader.

122
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,800
Life,

123
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,360
naturally, would be a bit tighter.

124
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,720
Miss Liu,

125
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,680
I wonder

126
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,720
if your husband

127
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,840
has a job.

128
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,840
How about

129
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,000
coming to my company?

130
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,000
Just in time,

131
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,880
my company recently

132
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,840
has an opening for a security guard.

133
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Monthly salary of 3,500.

134
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,800
No need.

135
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,720
Thank you.

136
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,680
Jiang Feng

137
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,880
already has a job.

138
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,000
A job?

139
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,280
What kind of job?

140
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,600
Is he moving bricks
at a construction site

141
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,000
or screwing bolts in a factory?

142
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,280
Liu Kai,

143
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,400
don't look down on people like that.

144
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,720
Mr. Jiang

145
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,280
seems quite proud.

146
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,280
Surely,

147
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,680
he's in some big business.

148
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,080
Mr. Jiang,

149
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,360
may I ask,

150
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,400
which industry are you in?

151
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
Why not share

152
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,600
some insights with us?

153
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,560
This is...

154
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh?

155
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,560
Mr. Jiang,

156
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,520
could it be

157
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,800
you're also in the catering industry?

158
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,800
Coincidentally,

159
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,680
I know

160
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,720
Manager Long of the Top Immortal.

161
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,480
How about

162
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,600
I invite her over

163
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,040
and you two

164
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,560
can discuss business strategies?

165
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,560
Mr. Tao,

166
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,600
if it weren't for you hosting us
in such a high-end place,

167
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,120
we probably wouldn't have the chance

168
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,240
to eat in a place like this
in our lifetime.

169
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,480
Later,

170
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,360
please introduce Manager Long to me.

171
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,120
Many of my friends
want to book a table here,

172
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,360
but can't get a reservation.

173
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,160
Yes, Mr. Tao.

174
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,040
Today,

175
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,480
we must drink to our hearts' content.

176
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,120
Don't worry about the cost.

177
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,040
Well,

178
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,720
what are you saying?

179
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,040
Everyone, drink as much

180
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,920
as you like today.

181
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,920
All expenses

182
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,040
are on me.

183
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,240
Later,

184
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,360
I'll call Manager Long over

185
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,920
to meet everyone

186
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,160
and have a few drinks together.

187
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,160
Mr. Tao is indeed extraordinary,

188
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,360
being able to invite
even the manager of the top estate

189
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,480
in the city.

190
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,696
Later, I'll definitely toast you
several times.

191
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,480
That's right.

192
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
I'm envious of Haiqing

193
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,240
for having such an impressive fiancé.

194
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,160
All right.

195
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,840
Since we're all classmates,

196
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,680
Wensheng is one of us.

197
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
No need to be formal.

198
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,840
Chenfei,

199
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,840
this Coral Whitebait

200
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,360
is the specialty dish here.

201
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,120
You can have a try.

202
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,480
Let's let everyone order first.

203
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,560
Well, what a hurry.

204
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,280
Your intention is quite clear.

205
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,840
I've seen people crash wedding banquets,

206
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
but this is the first time
I've seen someone crash

207
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,800
their wife's class reunion.

208
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,160
It's just a meal.

209
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,680
No need to crash it.

210
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,920
As long as Chenfei wants,

211
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,840
at the Top Immortal,

212
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,990
there's nothing she can't eat.

213
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,920
Jiang Feng, stop it.

214
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,000
Such confidence.

215
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,920
It seems today

216
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,900
someone is competing
with Mr. Tao to pay the bill.

217
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,280
But, Jiang Feng,

218
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,120
when you looked at the menu,

219
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,160
did you notice the prices?

220
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,600
A casual meal here

221
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,040
costs tens of thousands.

222
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,800
The Liu family allowance you get

223
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,480
is far from enough.

224
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,680
How about it?

225
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,280
Today,

226
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,480
let's follow his lead.

227
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,560
After all,

228
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,720
he said it himself.

229
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,920
Today,

230
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,400
let's order the most expensive set menu

231
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,480
and let Mr. Jiang pay.

232
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,240
Okay.

233
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,000
Mr. Jiang just said

234
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,040
that at the Top Immortal,

235
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,240
there's nothing he can't afford to eat.

236
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,280
So, we will graciously accept.

237
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,000
Waiter.

238
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,280
Serve us dishes worth

239
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,560
188,000 yuan.

240
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,240
Okay,

241
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,920
Mr. Tao.

242
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Here is 200,000 yuan.

243
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,280
Take it and pay the bill later.

244
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,800
Chenfei,

245
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,160
a bit of money

246
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,680
means nothing to me.

247
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,920
Mr. Jiang,

248
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,920
you act like you're rich.

249
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,560
But in the end,

250
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,600
you still rely on women.

251
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,000
So, after all this fuss,

252
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,800
in the end,

253
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,160
it's still Miss Liu paying?

254
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,600
Well,

255
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,800
you're truly a live-in son-in-law.

256
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,680
How about it, Jiang Feng?

257
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,240
Today,

258
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,480
we two can

259
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,360
split all expenses equally.

260
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,330
I'll share the burden with you,

261
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,480
but you can't use a woman's money.

262
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,920
Dare you?

263
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,240
Not interested.

264
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,160
What?

265
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,160
Are you afraid?

266
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,040
You're just a coward.

267
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,040
Probably,

268
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
you can't even come up
with a thousand yuan.

269
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,160
Fine,

270
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,560
I'll play along with you.

271
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
Chenfei,

272
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,720
just order.

273
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,400
Why are you acting
impulsively like before?

274
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,160
It's okay.

275
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,920
Great.

276
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,040
Waiter.

277
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,040
Go tell the chef

278
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,360
to use the finest ingredients.

279
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,480
I'm willing to pay five times the price.

280
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,040
Every dish,

281
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,360
serve two portions.

282
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,000
One to eat,

283
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,280
one to look at.

284
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,240
Such extravagance.

285
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,990
Isn't it inappropriate?

286
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,480
If you can't afford it, just say so.

287
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,920
Don't talk about wasting food.

288
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,240
Mr. Tao,

289
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,480
I must remind you

290
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,480
Top Immortal does not encourage waste.

291
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
If it's too excessive,

292
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,480
your VIP status might be revoked.

293
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,040
If you're interested,

294
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,560
Top Immortal's special auction tonight

295
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,840
cordially invites you to join.

296
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,240
All right.

297
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,160
In that case,

298
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,840
since everyone is so interested,

299
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,360
why don't we

300
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,360
have a change of plans after the meal
and attend the auction?

301
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
What do you say?

302
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,160
I'll join you to the end.

303
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,600
It's said that at the Top Immortal,

304
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,520
there's always a wine auction.

305
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
They auction

306
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,880
the finest wines from overseas.

307
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,320
Mr. Tao,

308
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,240
are you going

309
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,960
to let us common folk

310
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,320
experience it firsthand?

311
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,320
What a pity.

312
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,080
Mr. Tao is willing to do so,

313
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,520
but someone can't keep up the act.

314
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,000
After all, he's a live-in son-in-law

315
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,120
with limited means.

316
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,000
Jiang Feng,

317
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,120
just tell me

318
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,720
do you dare to join?

319
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,440
I'll stay with you to the end.

320
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,320
Great.

321
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,640
Everyone,

322
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,360
this bottle

323
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,760
of Henri Jayer Romanée-Conti

324
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,880
is the highlight of tonight's auction.

325
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,000
Starting bid

326
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,960
is one million yuan.

327
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,480
Each increment must be
at least 100,000 yuan.

328
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,000
Everyone,

329
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,840
please place your bids.

330
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,000
For such an item,

331
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,240
only those in the private rooms
can participate.

332
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,360
We can only

333
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,600
watch from the sidelines.

334
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,240
I've heard that tonight,

335
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,360
Top Immortal

336
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,720
will have several
important figures attending.

337
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,600
It looks like this bottle of wine

338
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,640
will become a competition among them.

339
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,840
Witnessing such an event,

340
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,600
our night here won't be wasted.

341
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,320
Jiang Feng,

342
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,760
I brought you here

343
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,840
because I felt guilty

344
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,720
for misunderstanding you yesterday.

345
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,120
Don't act recklessly.

346
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,184
If you embarrass yourself,

347
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,840
I won't help you.

348
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,200
Chenfei,

349
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,080
I know what I'm doing.

350
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,760
Fine.

351
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,520
Take it easy.

352
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,080
Making money isn't easy.

353
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,960
Well, don't worry.

354
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,640
It won't take many rounds.

355
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,840
He'll definitely flee in defeat.

356
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,240
Hey,

357
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,960
I bid

358
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,480
1.1 million.

359
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,000
2 million.

360
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,480
Hey, are you deliberately causing trouble,

361
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:13,840
huh?

362
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,520
The auction usually increases
by 100,000 each time.

363
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,080
Where did you bid so high?

364
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,000
If you don't understand,
don't shout nonsense.

365
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,720
Liu Kai,

366
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,120
this is an auction.

367
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,240
Everyone

368
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
has the right to bid freely.

369
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,880
I bid 3 million.

370
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,720
5 million.

371
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,720
This son-in-law has no sense.

372
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,480
Auctions are in thousands,

373
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,480
does he think it's just 500 yuan?

374
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,720
Chenfei.

375
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,200
Why is she leaving?

376
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,480
Chenfei,

377
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,120
this atmosphere is so good.

378
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,760
Is there something

379
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,000
you need to leave for right now?

380
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,760
Don't be in such a hurry.

381
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,200
I'm waiting to taste your husband's

382
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,000
Henri Jayer Romanée-Conti.

383
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,880
That's right.

384
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,440
Your husband is spending so lavishly.

385
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,600
He doesn't seem
at all like a son-in-law.

386
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
He's acting like a big boss.

387
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,600
Why are you in such a rush to leave?

388
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,880
Are you afraid
he won't be able to pay later

389
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,000
and embarrass you?

390
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,240
Since Mr. Jiang is so generous

391
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,000
and so well-liked,

392
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,520
I won't

393
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,120
disturb his enjoyment here.

394
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,760
But Mr. Tao,

395
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,320
I know very well what kind

396
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,480
of person my husband is.

397
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,600
By the end of your bet where each

398
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,480
of you pays half,

399
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,070
I'm afraid you'll only end up suffering.

400
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,360
Well,

401
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,320
Chenfei,

402
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,890
let's all enjoy the excitement together.

403
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,880
Why are you so upset?

404
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,000
Besides,

405
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
this is the Top Immortal.

406
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,320
Anyone who

407
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,480
participates in the auction

408
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,480
but refuses to pay

409
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,000
won't even get past this door.

410
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,720
Fei,

411
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,720
we're finally gathered together.

412
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,000
Just stay here and relax.

413
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Besides,

414
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,640
you must try

415
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,360
this expensive wine.

416
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,080
I know your fiance is capable,

417
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,360
but there's no need to be so aggressive.

418
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
It seems

419
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,840
I won't attend

420
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,240
such gatherings in the future.

421
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,520
Oh?

422
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,480
Chenfei,

423
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,880
don't worry.

424
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,600
Today,

425
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,080
I will definitely not disappoint you.

426
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,360
The Fubixing Room bids 5 million.

427
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,840
Is there any higher bid?

428
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,120
Wait...

429
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,480
5 million?

430
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,200
I thought I was

431
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,360
already a master at spending wealth.

432
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,000
I didn't expect

433
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,240
there's always

434
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,360
someone better.

435
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,640
One bottle of wine

436
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,640
can actually reach 5 million.

437
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,480
Well...

438
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,000
Young Master Wang,

439
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,600
this is the Top Immortal.

440
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,320
Even adding a zero at the end

441
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,000
wouldn't be surprising.

442
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,600
Just I wonder who this important person is.

443
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:04,840
Mr. Tao,

444
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,360
a big shot in the Fengyasong Room

445
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,240
let me tell you,

446
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,720
he'll have this bottle.

447
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,400
Are you sure you want
to continue bidding?

448
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,760
Well,

449
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,640
a big shot?

450
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,360
