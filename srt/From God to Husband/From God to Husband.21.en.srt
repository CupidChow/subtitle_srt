(Liu's Residence)

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,160
Chenfei,

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,560
have a taste.

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,600
Wow!

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,040
It smells good!

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,000
Jiang Feng,

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,640
you're awesome!

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,480
Quickly tell me,

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,360
how could you be Jiang Beizun?

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,480
Jiang...

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,080
Master Jiang Beizun,

23
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,200
you are already famous
throughout Jiangcheng.

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,000
Why settle for being

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,560
in this second-rate family,

26
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,896
washing dishes and making soup?

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,600
Rourou, eat quickly.

28
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,640
After this meal,

29
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,920
there won't be any more.

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,320
Chenfei.

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,200
Chenfei,

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,400
then I'll eat it.

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,560
How dare you!

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,920
Rourou,

35
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,640
why are you so clueless?

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,680
Get up now.

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,480
Mother!

38
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,120
Get up!

39
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,760
This seat is mine.

40
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,840
Now Beizun is the head of our family.

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,680
Don't you see?

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,040
There's a long line outside,

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,840
coming to flatter us.

44
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,400
This is all thank to my good son-in-law.

45
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,280
As the head of the family,

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,120
he should start eating first.

47
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,136
It's not proper for you
to eat before others.

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,200
Jiang Feng, what do you say?

49
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,840
Beizun, well,

50
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,120
how is it?

51
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:23,560
If the simple home-cooked dishes

52
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,760
doesn't suit your taste,

53
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,680
I'll immediately call Songhelou

54
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,680
to send a five-star chef over.

55
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,840
Let me tell you.

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,120
Their signature dish

57
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,320
is the Jade Dragon Tendon.

58
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,400
That taste...

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll stop talking.

60
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,920
Chenfei, why are you still sitting there?

61
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:43,776
Prepare a few more dishes.

62
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,160
Tonight,

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,400
I'm going to get drunk

64
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,400
with my brother-in-law.

65
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,680
Great!

66
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,000
I remember Master Liu

67
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,840
has a bottle of wine that's been
aged for over fifty years.

68
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
I'll go get it...

69
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,840
Enough!

70
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,600
Chenfei.

71
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,600
Calm down.

72
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,360
Calm down.

73
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,800
I'm sorry

74
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,840
for losing my composure.

75
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,560
Should I call you Jiang Feng now,

76
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,280
Jiang Beizun or Young Master of Yandu?

77
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,560
I really can't tell anymore.

78
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,120
How many things are there

79
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,520
that I don't know?

80
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
Compared to now,

81
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,560
I'd rather you were still Jiang Feng.

82
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,280
At least you wouldn't feel so strange.

83
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,000
Chenfei,

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,120
no matter who I am,

85
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,240
you are still my wife.

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,960
I just want to be a good husband to you.

87
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,240
Over these years,

88
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,680
I have my own difficulties.

89
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,208
Chenfei, that's right.

90
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,000
At today's apprenticeship ceremony,

91
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,680
we only just learned

92
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,880
that the past three years

93
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,120
Jiang Feng didn't disappear
for no reason.

94
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,000
He must have had many difficulties.

95
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,400
Not three years!

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,560
Chenfei,

97
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,560
it's been a full thousand years.

98
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,240
Jiang!

99
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,840
A thousand...

100
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,360
Then I'll leave?

101
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,608
If there's something,

102
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,240
let's talk about it here.

103
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,600
Speak.

104
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,240
Kong Tianhai is dead.

105
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,280
What?

106
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,000
Kong Tianhai was an expert.

107
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,560
How could he suddenly die?

108
00:04:36,992 --> 00:04:38,080
Yesterday at the ceremony,

109
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,600
though I threw a punch,

110
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,000
it wasn't fatal.

111
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,880
It was bearable for him.

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,680
He could have lasted a while longer.

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So, Kong Tianhai

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,480
was likely killed by someone

115
00:04:52,496 --> 00:04:53,780
after sustaining severe injuries.

116
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,680
That's right.

117
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,400
And you probably don't know

118
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,400
who killed Kong Tianhai.

119
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,120
Who?

120
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,920
Kong Mingzhe!

121
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,720
Kong Ming...

122
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,600
It's true.

123
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,160
Now the Kong family has fallen.

124
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,600
Kong Mingzhe is missing.

125
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,920
He's most likely run away.

126
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,360
I never expected this.

127
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,600
Kong Mingzhe

128
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,800
is so ruthless and merciless.

129
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,040
He even dared to kill his own father.

130
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,240
Mother,

131
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,040
I told you long ago

132
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,240
that Kong Mingzhe is cruel.

133
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,800
Now you know, right?

134
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,360
This is indeed surprising.

135
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,000
Kong Tianhai,

136
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,280
who dominated this life,

137
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,040
never expected to die

138
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,560
at the hands of his own son.

139
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,400
A father sacrifices his son,

140
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,280
and the son kills his father.

141
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,360
It truly fits the saying

142
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:58,120
that "a kind father and a filial son".

143
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,920
There's another

144
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,040
troublesome matter.

145
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,680
There's news

146
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:05,600
that the Huang family of Yandu

147
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,840
is leading a group of disciples

148
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,040
to Jiangcheng.

149
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,040
They want to meet you.

150
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,560
The Huang family from Yandu?

151
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,720
They've finally lost their patience.

152
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,240
Jiang Feng,

153
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
what exactly happened

154
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,400
in Yandu back then?

155
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,160
Back then,

156
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,720
Young Master Huang Tianzong

157
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,360
used my sister as a furnace
to aid his cultivation.

158
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,840
During the conflict,

159
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,280
I accidentally injured Huang Tianzong.

160
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,720
To avoid the Huang family,

161
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,720
my mother secretly
sent me to Jiangcheng.

162
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,600
I hid my identity

163
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,040
and lived in hiding.

164
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,920
But my Jiang family was annihilated.

165
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,040
The Huang family

166
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,240
and I are sworn enemies.

167
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,040
Grandpa.

168
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,360
Grandpa.

169
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,480
Back then,

170
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,720
in the Battle of the Jiazi,

171
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,240
the Jiang family was annihilated.

172
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,120
The once prosperous

173
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,480
Jiang family of Yandu,

174
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,120
now only has Jiang Feng left.

175
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,400
The last survivor.

176
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,920
I never thought

177
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,560
that the once-great

178
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Jiang family in Yandu

179
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,400
would fall so dramatically.

180
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,600
Jiang,

181
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,720
now you hold

182
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,600
tremendous power.

183
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,680
Why not return to Yandu

184
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,800
and start anew?

185
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,720
How about this?

186
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,800
With your reputation and my abilities,

187
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,360
we can completely

188
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,600
reap the rewards.

189
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,480
We?

190
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
Are we that familiar?

191
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,480
Look.

192
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,800
Our Liu family in Jiangcheng

193
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
has finally become prosperous.

194
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,800
Well...

195
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,560
If we can avoid trouble,

196
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,040
let's just avoid it.

197
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,240
Jiang Feng,

198
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,920
what do you say?

199
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,920
Right now,

200
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,360
the name of Beizun is known everywhere.

201
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,680
This is the perfect opportunity
to seize Yandu.

202
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,680
Beizun,

203
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,480
if you want to conquer Yandu,

204
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,040
I am willing to be your assistant.

205
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,000
Make your decision.

206
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,720
Everyone, be quiet.

207
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,840
Give Jiang Feng and Chenfei
some space.

208
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,360
I never expected

209
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,840
that Jiang Feng carried
so much burden before.

210
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,680
I really shouldn't have treated him
like that before.

211
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,840
Chenfei,

212
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,920
please don't blame him
for keeping things from you.

213
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,152
Chenfei,

214
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,720
please forgive me.

215
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,240
The wine.

216
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,600
Jiang Feng.

217
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,480
A person who betrays their vows

218
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,600
and disappears
without a trace for three years

219
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,960
has no right to make oaths again.

220
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,720
Why should I trust you again?

221
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,000
Didn't you say
you wouldn't deceive me again?

222
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,760
The young master of Yandu?

223
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,840
Jiang Beizun?

224
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,960
What should I call you now?

225
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,320
How many things

226
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,640
do I not know about you?

227
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,480
Chenfei,

228
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,520
I don't want you
to worry about the past.

229
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,840
So much has happened recently.

230
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,360
I don't even know where to start.

231
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
Why did you bear

232
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,880
so many grievances alone
without saying anything?

233
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,360
Why did you endure all of that alone?

234
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,888
The Jiang family's issues
are in the past.

235
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,176
Talking about it will
only add to your troubles.

236
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,640
The matter of Beizun is complicated.

237
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,600
I truly don't know
how to explain it to you

238
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,000
that why I became like this.

239
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,080
And the past involving Yandu...

240
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:37,440
I don't want
to drag the Liu family into it.

241
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,440
Regardless of what happens,

242
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,480
I hope you will tell me
everything from the past.

243
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,960
Do you think

244
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,600
that if you offended
the Huang family of Yandu,

245
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,480
I would abandon you because of it?

246
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,360
If you really think that,

247
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,600
you've misunderstood my character.

248
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,320
Chenfei, thank you.

249
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
I misunderstood you.

250
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,480
I'm sorry for that.

251
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,720
Now I'm thinking

252
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,960
about something else.

253
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,320
With your current identity and status,

254
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,360
I don't know how

255
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,600
to interact with you.

256
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,600
Please give me some time.

257
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,240
Is that okay?

258
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,760
Okay.

259
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,272
(To the only survivor
of the Jiang family:)

260
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,200
The Huang family from Yandu

261
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,760
has arrived in Jiangcheng

262
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,120
with three Heavenly rank masters

263
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,928
and a hundred Earth rank peak experts.

264
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,240
We're expected
to meet with you tomorrow

265
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,840
for a demonstration.

266
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,000
Jiang Feng,

267
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
what should we do?

268
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,840
It's fine.

269
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,200
