12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,120
Chenfei,

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,720
you run first. I'll hold him off.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,904
Rourou, don't worry.

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,640
I'll handle this.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,000
Ms. Liu...

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,480
I...

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,520
No.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,160
As your brother,

20
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,640
it's all my fault.

21
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,280
Rest assured.

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,360
I've withdrawn all personnel.

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,680
The Liu's Group is

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,000
back to normal.

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,220
There won't be any issues.

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:07,760
See?

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,040
These things are my apology gifts.

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,720
Is that okay?

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,200
Please accept them.

30
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,080
Mr. Zhou, what are you doing...

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,560
I have something to attend to.

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,600
I'll be leaving now.

33
00:01:20,816 --> 00:01:21,520
I'll see you off.

34
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,960
No need.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,512
You're busy, so do your business.

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,680
I can leave on my own.

37
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,720
Let's keep in touch more.

38
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,240
Okay?

39
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,320
Rourou,

40
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,840
see you next time. Goodbye.

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,840
What's wrong

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,040
with Zhou Baxiong?

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,200
What a complete turnaround in attitude.

44
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,320
Did I see that right?

45
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,560
You went to the kitchen!

46
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,480
A live-in son-in-law
should act like one.

47
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,120
Jiang Feng,

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,840
well,

49
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,000
you're not still mad at me, are you?

50
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,840
I swear,

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,280
I won't target you again in the future.

52
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,400
And about Zhou Baxiong...

53
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,200
Forget it.

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
I'm not so bored

55
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,280
as to pick fights with a kid.

56
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,120
Go wash your hands.

57
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,760
The meal is ready.

58
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,200
Who are you calling a kid?

59
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,200
I'm already eighteen.

60
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
I'm an adult.

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
Besides,

62
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,320
just because you saved me,

63
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,120
doesn't mean I'll think highly of you.

64
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,680
In my eyes,

65
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,040
my sister is always the best
and most outstanding woman.

66
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
You're not worthy.

67
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,000
Humph!

68
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,360
Rourou.

69
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,840
Chenfei.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,800
Where is Jiang Feng?

71
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,120
I need to ask him something.

72
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,560
He's in the kitchen cooking.

73
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,840
Cooking?

74
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,680
When did he learn to do this?

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,720
You can take a look.

76
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,360
See?

77
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:57,880
Mother.

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,000
Mother!

79
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,240
Coming.

80
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,720
What's the matter?

81
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,400
Look what's this!

82
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,880
What's with the mystery?

83
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,032
(Distinguished Liu family,
you are cordially)

84
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:13,090
(invited to host the banquet.)

85
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,960
Banquet?

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,840
The head of the Kong family,
Kong Tianhai,

87
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,400
is hosting a banquet in Jiangcheng

88
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,560
and has specifically requested
the Liu family to organize it.

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,960
What?

90
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,800
Kong Tianhai?

91
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,960
Give it to me.

92
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,000
Wasn't Master Kong

93
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
supposed to have passed away years ago?

94
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,400
Could it be...

95
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,680
He didn't die, but has been

96
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,120
in seclusion all these years.

97
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,520
I heard

98
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,440
that Master Kong is coming out

99
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,680
to make friends with a senior

100
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,520
named Jiang...

101
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,400
Oh.

102
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,680
Jiang Beizun.

103
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,400
At that time,

104
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,840
all the prominent figures in Jiangcheng

105
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
will be present.

106
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,560
Great.

107
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,560
That's great!

108
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,080
I didn't expect

109
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,080
that my Liu family would also host

110
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,400
such a grand banquet.

111
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,080
It's truly a blessing from Buddha.

112
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,680
Blessings from Buddha!

113
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,080
Mother,

114
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,840
what are you talking about?

115
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,280
Don't you think

116
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,000
if not for our connection
with Young Master Kong,

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,880
we wouldn't have the chance
to host such a good thing.

118
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,840
Madam Liu.

119
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,440
Chenfei,

120
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,840
long time no see.

121
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,800
Well,

122
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
my dear son-in-law.

123
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,520
Are you satisfied with this great gift?

124
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,720
Of course.

125
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,120
Sit here.

126
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,424
I'm very satisfied.

127
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,800
Please, take a seat.

128
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,840
Sit here.

129
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,280
Young Master Kong,

130
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,240
you haven't been around these days.

131
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,240
I thought

132
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,600
our Liu family had offended you.

133
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
I didn't expect

134
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,120
you were preparing such a big event.

135
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,920
You're returning good for evil.

136
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,920
You have bestowed our Liu family
with a great blessing.

137
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
Why are you laughing?

138
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,560
Chenfei, come here.

139
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,600
To host a banquet
for someone we've never met

140
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,920
makes your Liu family so obsequious.

141
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,120
Even failing to recognize
your own son-in-law.

142
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,600
Jiang Feng,

143
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:39,120
do you know
that to establish oneself in Jiangcheng

144
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,720
isn't just about capability?

145
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,480
No!

146
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,120
It relies on background,

147
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,600
on power,

148
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,160
and on support.

149
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,240
And what our Liu family relies on

150
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,560
is Young Master Kong.

151
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,920
Well,

152
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,240
someone like you

153
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,360
wouldn't understand
the rules of the upper class.

154
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,600
Qingtian, well said.

155
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,040
A frog in a well

156
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,840
would never understand
the dynamics of high society.

157
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,720
Do you know who Jiang Beizun is?

158
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,840
Even the second most powerful family
in Jiangcheng, the Hong family,

159
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,800
dares not challenge him directly.

160
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,480
And you, Jiang Feng,

161
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,560
even though you share
the same surname as that senior,

162
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,480
your status is worlds apart.

163
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,120
To get even
a distant glance of that senior

164
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,840
is already a fortune
from your past life.

165
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,040
Well, Young Master Kong.

166
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,720
Here.

167
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,840
Sit here.

168
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,920
There's no need to waste words
with such people.

169
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,360
We should quickly discuss

170
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,400
the details of hosting the banquet.

171
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,240
Young Master Kong, about this banquet,

172
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,000
will the compensation be covered

173
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,120
by our Liu family?

174
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,800
Mother,

175
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,480
Young Master Kong is thorough.

176
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,240
Such expenses
will certainly not be borne by us.

177
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,600
Now that Master Kong is coming out,

178
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,920
Jiangcheng will surely be abuzz.

179
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:10,840
At that time,

180
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,240
all the social elites will attend.

181
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,600
This is a great opportunity
for us to make a name.

182
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,040
If we do it well,

183
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,680
and impress the big shots,

184
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,480
our Liu family won't have
to worry about money.

185
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,280
Well...

186
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,920
That's right.

187
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,160
This is something I had
to go to great lengths to get

188
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,040
from my father.

189
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,680
If we're fortunate enough
to gain Jiang Beizun's favor,

190
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,240
it will be hard
for the Liu family not to rise.

191
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,360
I hope Chenfei

192
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,600
and the Liu family

193
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,600
will be grateful.

194
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,040
Oh, thank you very much!

195
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,000
Young Master Kong,

196
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,720
thank you for your great kindness!

197
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,360
Chenfei!

198
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,240
Young Master Kong,

199
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,120
how about moving to the meeting room

200
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,040
to discuss how to organize the banquet.

201
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,680
Chenfei,

202
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,560
this matter is crucial.

203
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,000
It's a major secret of our Liu family.

204
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,600
He must not be involved.

205
00:08:20,592 --> 00:08:22,680
Young Master Kong, please.

206
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,120
Please.

207
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:25,392
Mother, let's go.

208
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:35,160
For someone like the Kong family
to go to such lengths

209
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,400
just to make connections,

210
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,000
Jiang Beizun

211
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,120
must be an extraordinary person.

212
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,040
Chenfei,

213
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,040
the meal is ready.

214
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,800
Be careful.

215
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,600
These are all made by you?

216
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,480
Yes.

217
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,600
And more.

218
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,800
Wait for a second.

219
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,920
If you came to apologize

220
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,840
for what happened
with Zhou Baxiong yesterday,

221
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,080
there's no need.

222
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,240
He came to see me today.

223
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,720
He said it was a misunderstanding

224
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,760
and has lifted the pressure
on the Liu's Group.

225
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,240
Everything seems to have disappeared

226
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
in an instant.

227
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,720
Jiang Feng,

228
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,600
do you know about this?

229
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,200
I didn't expect Zhou Baxiong

230
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,760
to be so discerning.

231
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,080
But I think,

232
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,120
Zhou Baxiong must understand

233
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,440
that it's unnecessary to offend

234
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,480
someone as renowned as Ms. Liu Chenfei,

235
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,120
so he retreated.

236
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,440
It seems you were unaware.

237
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,960
I almost thought...

238
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,120
Never Mind.

239
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,600
This time,

240
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,120
the new crisis for the Liu's Group

241
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,360
has finally passed.

242
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,480
Let's...

243
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,000
Chenfei,

244
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,240
didn't we agree to wait for me?

245
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,240
Why did you start eating?

246
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,600
Sit down quickly.

247
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,840
Why are you chatting so happily?

248
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,720
I haven't seen you
smile like this in a long time.

249
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,600
Thank Jiang Feng

250
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,880
for preparing such a lavish meal for us.

251
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,320
Let's raise a toast.

252
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,720
To wish the Liu's Group

253
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,960
ever greater success.

254
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,520
Here.

255
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,120
Cheers!

256
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,360
Chenfei,

257
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,240
you can try this.

258
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,880
If it's good,

259
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,120
I'll make it for you every day.

260
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
Jiang Feng,

261
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,840
my sister doesn't need a househusband.

262
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,840
What she needs is a partner

263
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,200
who can help her achieve

264
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,840
her dream
of revitalizing the Liu family.

265
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,360
The best partner.

266
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,120
You can only handle housework.

267
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,720
My poor sister.

268
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,200
In the end, she's suffering...

269
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,240
Rourou, all right.

270
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,080
Isn't eating enough to silence you?

271
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,120
Jiang Feng,

272
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,240
the guests haven't left yet.

273
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,520
How can you start eating?

274
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,120
You're getting more
and more disrespectful.

275
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,080
Go!

276
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,440
Get me some tea!

277
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:03,720
Chenfei!

278
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,760
I'll do it.

279
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,080
Mother,

280
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,080
don't be angry.

281
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,480
I'll just get the tea.

282
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:19,232
I know that recently,

283
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,840
the Liu family and the Kong family

284
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,520
have indeed been getting closer.

285
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,360
But being in a family like ours,

286
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,240
there are many helpless situations.

287
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,000
After all,

288
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,720
they are my relatives.

289
00:11:30,736 --> 00:11:31,240
Jiang Feng...

290
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,120
I understand.

291
00:11:34,384 --> 00:11:35,600
I don't care about anyone else.

292
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,200
I only care about you.

293
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,720
The preparations for the Kong family's
banquet are about to start.

294
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,560
I'm a bit tired and I'll rest now.

295
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,000
You should also rest early.

296
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,360
If you don't want to do it,

297
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,000
then don't.

298
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,360
No.

299
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,360
This opportunity is hard to come by.

300
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,520
The whole Liu family values it greatly.

301
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,120
Organizing this banquet,

302
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,760
we might get to meet Jiang Beizun

303
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,520
and other important figures.

304
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,080
Even if we can't talk to them,

305
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,480
we'll at least see them.

306
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,600
How can we not host it?

307
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,080
So what if I were that important person?

308
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,520
Chenfei, would you believe me?

309
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
Here we go again.

310
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,440
Aside from the same surname,

311
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,860
what else do you two have in common?

312
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,240
Besides, I don't aspire to a life
like Jiang Beizun's.

313
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,720
That kind of level is too far from us.

314
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,000
I just want to rely on myself

315
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,936
to make the Liu family better,

316
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,480
and to make the Liu's Group better.

317
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,600
I understand.

318
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,360
Chenfei,

319
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,520
no matter what choice you make,

320
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
I will support you.

321
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,960
Grandpa,

322
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,600
it's time for your medicine.

323
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,880
This is a special herbal medicine

324
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,840
made by Dr. Hua for you.

325
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,960
When will you be willing

326
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,080
to serve me the medicine?

327
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,000
Speak.

328
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,200
What is it this time?

329
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,960
Grandpa,

330
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,640
about the old mansion in Nankang...

331
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,960
Who do you plan to leave it to
among us three?

332
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,360
Oh,

333
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,360
I heard people say

334
00:13:26,528 --> 00:13:27,600
that in the old mansion,

335
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,440
there is the wealth
accumulated by several

336
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,720
generations of the Liu family.

337
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,000
At least,

338
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,000
let your grandson know.

339
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,840
I don't know!

340
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,000
Get out immediately!

341
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,600
And you better stay away from
that scoundrel from the Kong family.

342
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,480
He will sooner or later harm you.

343
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,120
Young Master Kong has promised

344
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,520
that as long as I assist him,

345
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,960
not only will the entire Liu family

346
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,520
be given to me, but even several
of the Kong family's assets.

347
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,240
But you,

348
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,840
even if you want to favor Liu Chenfei,

349
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,360
it's useless.

350
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
You unfilial kid!

351
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,880
If you do anything harmful
to the Liu family,

352
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,760
I will risk my life to kill you!

353
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,240
All right.

354
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,440
Grandpa,

355
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,110
if you won't give me, that's fine.

356
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,360
It's fine.

357
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,080
Be careful not to upset your health.

358
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,480
Don't provoke me.

359
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,520
Everything will be fine.

360
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,720
Oh no.

361
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,600
This...

362
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,320
What's going on here?

363
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,240
Tell me!

364
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,960
Get out!

365
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,480
Both of you get out!

366
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,240
Jesus! It's terrible.

367
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,640
You!

368
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,240
Look at what you've done!

369
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,240
You pissed your grandpa off,
and he died!

370
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,840
Huh?

371
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,360
What should you do?

372
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,200
Say something!

373
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
What should we do?

374
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,360
This...

375
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
You know,

376
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,200
it might be better if he dies sooner.

377
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,200
Otherwise, he'll obstruct the engagement
with Young Master Kong.

378
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,320
That's a big issue.

379
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,080
