00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,520
Come on!

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,200
Hit me here!

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,640
I want to see if this stray dog
from the Liu family dares to bite.

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,160
Lu Changsheng from the Lu family
requests an audience.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,160
Why is Master Lu here?

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,640
It must be because

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,120
of the marriage
between the Kong and Liu families.

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,800
Invite him in.

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,480
I'm Lu Changsheng,

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,640
and I'm here

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,800
for an urgent matter.

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,680
Well,

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,360
you've graced us with your presence.

25
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,360
We've been remiss in welcoming you.

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,120
Grandmaster,

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,920
what brings you here?

28
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,520
You didn't inform us.

29
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,360
I could have gone to greet you.

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,440
You must be Kong Tianhai's eldest son.

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,680
So sharp and brash.

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,640
Although the Kong family

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,880
is flourishing now,

34
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,840
young people

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,120
should still be more restrained.

36
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,040
Yes.

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,360
Master Lu, you're right.

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,520
Senior,

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,040
you are indeed here.

40
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,440
(Senior?)

41
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,680
(What happened?)

42
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,360
(Since when does
the Liu family have someone)

43
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,720
(worthy of Master Lu's respect?)

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,840
Master Lu,

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,440
what do you mean?

46
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,280
Master Lu,

47
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,560
this person is just a son-in-law
our Liu family raised.

48
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,120
He is not worth mentioning.

49
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,480
Master Lu,

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
I heard

51
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,120
you are looking for a senior.

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,280
Where is that senior now?

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,760
You all may not know,

54
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,920
but the senior I want
to pay my respects to

55
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,040
is right in front of us,

56
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,120
Senior Jiang.

57
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,920
What?

58
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,200
He...

59
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,760
Well...

60
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,280
How is that possible?

61
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,920
I'm Lu Changsheng from the Lu family.

62
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
I hope

63
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,344
you won't hold a grudge.

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,040
Could we speak in private?

65
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,120
Sure.

66
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,760
Chenfei,

67
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,400
wait for me at home.

68
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,200
I have something to do.

69
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,760
This is simply absurd.

70
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,040
Master Lu is one of the most
mysterious figures in Jiangcheng.

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,560
How could he show
such respect to a son-in-law?

72
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,640
What is the reason?

73
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,840
Your power

74
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,560
is truly extraordinary.

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,560
I have finally witnessed it.

76
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,360
Hongling, you're here.

77
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,000
Grandpa,

78
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,560
I heard that you found that senior.

79
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,000
Where is he now?

80
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,560
Far in the heavens,

81
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,280
but also right in front of you.

82
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,000
He?

83
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,840
You mean him?

84
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,840
You want me to be a maid for him?

85
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,800
Grandpa,

86
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,600
he's a passerby.

87
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,360
How could he be a master
with heavenly powers?

88
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,720
You must have been deceived.

89
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,800
Don't be rude.

90
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,880
If it weren't for Senior Jiang's
timely intervention,

91
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,840
you would have been a corpse by now.

92
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,080
Forgive her, please.

93
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,840
She is my granddaughter.

94
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,840
And she has been spoiled
since childhood.

95
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,280
If she offended you,

96
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,240
please don't take it to heart.

97
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,720
If you could do me a favor,

98
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,280
let me host a banquet

99
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,160
where we can eat and talk.

100
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,520
No need.

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,400
Just speak plainly.

102
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,360
In that case,

103
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,000
I will speak frankly.

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,720
I have observed

105
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,360
that with every gesture

106
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,840
you exhibit

107
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,080
it's a master's grace.

108
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,720
It shows the demeanor
of a grand master.

109
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,880
I hope you can accept
my granddaughter, Hongling,

110
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
as your personal maid.

111
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,000
She will serve you.

112
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,720
Grandpa,

113
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,560
this person is a fraud.

114
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,120
How could...

115
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,560
Be quiet!

116
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,880
I hope you will consent.

117
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,360
There's no need for a maid.

118
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,840
I, Jiang Beizun, have always

119
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,000
walked alone.

120
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,280
So you are Jiang Beizun.

121
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,000
How audacious.

122
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,400
My grandfather
is a prodigy of the times,

123
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,680
and a master of the Earth rank.

124
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,240
How dare you accept his respect.

125
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,560
Hongling,

126
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,120
you are still young.

127
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,800
I have been

128
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,560
cultivating for over sixty years

129
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
and have barely managed
to reach the Earth rank.

130
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,720
I have never seen
such a terrifying surge

131
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,600
of spiritual energy as last night.

132
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,480
Your strength

133
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,360
is truly unfathomable.

134
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,480
You are seeking me,

135
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,840
not just because
of this incident, right?

136
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,360
Could it be that you have already
discerned the condition within me?

137
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,040
Your Yang energy declines,

138
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
the toxins are deep,

139
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,240
and you're dying.

140
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,480
You have less than half a year to live.

141
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,240
Indeed,

142
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,040
I cannot hide it from your keen eyes.

143
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
I have devoted my life to my work,

144
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,480
only to end up in such a state.

145
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,400
Recently,

146
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,240
my child passed away young,

147
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,400
and I have been poisoned.

148
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,800
Time is running short.

149
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,160
I seek nothing more.

150
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,160
I hope you will accept Hongling

151
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,600
to protect my family
from being harmed by traitors.

152
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,560
If you agree,

153
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,840
I am willing to offer you the most valuable asset
of the Lu family,

154
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,040
the Top Immortal Estate,

155
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
as a gift.

156
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,360
I remember now.

157
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,240
Lu Changsheng of the Lu family.

158
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,280
I heard that in recent years,

159
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,240
you've been building bridges
and roads in Jiangcheng,

160
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,560
benefiting the region.

161
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,720
You are indeed a kind-hearted person.

162
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,360
Please step forward.

163
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,360
Grandpa!

164
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,360
Grandpa!

165
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,680
What's wrong?

166
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,360
What have you done to him?

167
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,160
If anything happens to him,

168
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,360
I will never forgive you.

169
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,040
Hongling,

170
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,800
don't be disrespectful.

171
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,560
Just now,

172
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,600
with the expulsion of blood,

173
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,040
the toxins in my body
mysteriously vanished.

174
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,600
It's as if I became ten years
younger in an instant.

175
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,480
This is incredible.

176
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,240
This is toxic blood.

177
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,120
By catalyzing and expelling it
from the organs,

178
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,560
the toxins are naturally resolved.

179
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,360
I see.

180
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,600
I am deeply grateful

181
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,000
for your great kindness.

182
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,800
From this day, you are

183
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,840
the greatest benefactor
of the Lu family.

184
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,720
Hongling,

185
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
come quickly,

186
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,000
bow and express your thanks,

187
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,480
and serve the Senior.

188
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,600
No need.

189
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,160
I am used to freedom.

190
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,920
If you were mad

191
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,360
because Hongling offended you,

192
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,000
well,

193
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,280
I am willing

194
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,600
to apologize on her behalf.

195
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,040
Though you have some skills,

196
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,920
it is already your great honor

197
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,800
to have me accompany you.

198
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,480
You even dare to refuse?

199
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,160
How dare you

200
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,240
speak so arrogantly!

201
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,720
Please don't blame her.

202
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,240
I will definitely
teach my granddaughter a lesson

203
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,120
and ask her

204
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,720
to apologize

205
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,560
and serve.

206
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,240
Well,

207
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,040
it's just a small effort.

208
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,680
Don't take it seriously.

209
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,360
Your granddaughter
has quite a personality.

210
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,160
Please don't mind.

211
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,800
It's just a bit of medical skill.

212
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,400
What's so impressive about that?

213
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,800
Hongling!

214
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,240
Well,

215
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,360
thank you.

216
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,480
Grandpa,

217
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
now that your health has been restored.

218
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,920
It's truly a great thing.

219
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,040
I will return now

220
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,720
and inform everyone.

221
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,990
Senior Jiang's single thought

222
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,480
has resolved the Lu family's
life-and-death crisis.

223
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,600
This kindness

224
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,720
is something I can never forget.

225
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,400
Senior,

226
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,920
this is a Supreme Zijing Card.

227
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,720
It has a balance
of one hundred billions

228
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,480
for your use.

229
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,920
And also this item.

230
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,560
The Tianxuan Dragon Ring

231
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,560
can command the entire
underground world of Jiangcheng.

232
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,920
I hope

233
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,240
that you'll not refuse.

234
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Let me ask you,

235
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,600
what is your relationship
with Kong Mingzhe?

236
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,120
Kong Tianhai,
the head of the Kong family.

237
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,600
Well, he is Kong Mingzhe's father,

238
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,200
and was once one of my disciples.

239
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,200
The Kong family's rise today

240
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,080
was entirely due to my support.

241
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,840
It's unfortunate for the sect.

242
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,120
Oh?

243
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,200
What's that about?

244
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,000
The Kongs

245
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,480
have strayed from the righteous path.

246
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,360
Since their rise,

247
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,960
they have colluded
with several families in Yandu,

248
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
engaging in all sorts of shady dealings.

249
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,840
Although Kong Tianhai
died eight years ago,

250
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,720
this Kong Mingzhe

251
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,240
is also quite a nuisance.

252
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,120
If I were a few years younger,

253
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,080
I would certainly deal with him.

254
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,120
Senior,

255
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,840
if there is anything I can do,

256
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,600
just let me know.

257
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,480
No need.

258
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,240
I have my own plans.

259
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,720
Where did this beggar come from?

260
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,960
He's not in charge.

261
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,840
I think

262
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,080
you should go elsewhere.

263
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,360
Jiang Feng,

264
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,000
my sister has already
shown you great kindness.

265
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,600
Don't think you can keep pushing
poor relatives onto the Liu family.

266
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,320
Does my sister make money so easily?

267
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,880
The young ones of the Liu family

268
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,640
speak rather aggressively.

269
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,080
Senior,

270
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,080
do you need my help?

271
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,720
The children are just being foolish.

272
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,480
No need.

273
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,120
Who are you talking about?

274
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,360
You're just a useless son-in-law!

275
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,760
Do you believe I'll...

276
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,280
Stand!

277
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,070
You're disrespectful.

278
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,120
Remember,

279
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,000
call me "brother-in-law" later.

280
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Stop dawdling.

281
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,640
We should leave now.

282
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,440
Rourou!

283
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,720
Rourou!

284
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,440
What did he do to me?

285
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,520
Did something earth-shattering happen

286
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,240
during these three years he disappeared?

287
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,520
What's going on?

288
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,240
Well,

289
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,480
I need to make a phone call.

290
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,000
Right.

291
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,480
Hello?

292
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,120
Miss Lu,

293
00:11:15,296 --> 00:11:16,640
I want to inquire about something.

294
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,840
Do you know Jiang Feng?

295
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,200
Why is it another Jiang?

296
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,840
I don't know anyone named Jiang Feng.

297
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,320
Kong Mingzhe,

298
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,760
my time is very precious.

299
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,420
Don't call me unless it's important.

300
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,000
I knew it.

301
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,520
Master Lu

302
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,760
must be deceived due to his old age.

303
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,000
But, just now,

304
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,000
the way Master Lu behaved

305
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,520
didn't seem fake.

306
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,840
How could this be?

307
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,840
Even Miss Lu doesn't recognize him.

308
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Then Master Lu must be senile.

309
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,840
I knew it.

310
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,000
How could a man in his twenties
be regarded as a senior?

311
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
Jiang Feng...

312
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,840
Hello?

313
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,000
How's it going?

314
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,440
Today

315
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,600
we'll postpone

316
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:23,960
the engagement.

317
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,720
I have an urgent matter.

318
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,320
I'll leave.

319
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:26,630
Well...

320
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,120
how about

321
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,840
these...

322
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,120
Well,

323
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,840
the bride price

324
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
can be left here for now.

325
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,640
Take the money away.

326
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,200
Greetings, Master Lu.

327
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,720
- Greetings, Master Lu.
- Greetings, Master Lu.

328
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,760
Master Lu, you haven't been out
for years.

329
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,600
Why have you come today?

330
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,640
Mr. Jiang

331
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,080
will be the new owner
of the Top Immortal Estate from today.

332
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,720
Long,

333
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,360
Mr. Jiang is the savior
of the Lu family.

334
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,240
You must serve him well from now on.

335
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,320
Yes.

336
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,840
Mr. Jiang,

337
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,760
I am the manager of the Top Immortal.

338
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,000
You can call me Long.

339
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,360
The air here is clean.

340
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,840
It's perfect for Chenfei
to rest and vacation.

341
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,360
Mr. Jiang,

342
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,240
please.

343
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm Liu Rourou.

344
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,520
Come quickly
to the outskirts Jingwu Club.

345
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,840
