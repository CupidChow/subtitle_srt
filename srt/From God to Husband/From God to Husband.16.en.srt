=Episode 16=

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,640
This is impossible.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,160
How can a mere mortal

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,480
control heavenly lightning?

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,240
I've practiced for years,

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,400
and I've never seen such a thing.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,880
It's fake.

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,320
It must be fake.

19
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,200
This must be an illusion
you've carefully set up.

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,160
Jiang Beizun!

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,480
You can't scare me!

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,720
Ah!

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,680
Hong Chongxiao has been defeated.

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,080
One move to defeat him.

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,000
Hong Chongxiao was instantly killed.

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,720
What kind of person is Jiang Beizun?

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,000
Such terrifying strength!

28
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,240
I've never heard of it!

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,200
It's unprecedented!

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,360
He won?

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:30,920
Yes.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,960
And we won.

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,640
Beizun won.

34
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,264
And he won this life-or-death battle

35
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,640
with overwhelming force.

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,320
From now on,

37
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:40,192
there will be
no Hong family in Jiangcheng.

38
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,496
Jiang Beizun will be famous in the world.

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,840
I was wrong, Grandpa.

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,320
I finally understand

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,280
why you referred to Jiang Beizun
as a senior.

42
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,920
This guy

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,400
is terrifyingly powerful.

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,560
This isn't just a skilled cultivator.

45
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,840
He's clearly a deity.

46
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,760
It's a pity we couldn't see
the face of that great figure.

47
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,560
Now you understand the gap between us

48
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,840
and these otherworldly cultivators?

49
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,320
But I really don't like these cultivators.

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,000
If it weren't for them
joining various great families,

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,400
the business world
wouldn't have so many bloody disputes.

52
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,760
But I think that

53
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,760
the appearance of that lightning

54
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,280
seems a bit familiar.

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
(Thunder Technique)
The sun and moon wax and wane.

56
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,280
And the stars align.

57
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,760
Heaven,

58
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,640
Earth,

59
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,000
Mystic,

60
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,680
and Yellow.

61
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,080
What are you mumbling about?

62
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,680
Nothing.

63
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's leave first.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,400
If we're found later,

65
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,160
we'll be in trouble.

66
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,400
Now you're scared?

67
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,520
Let's go.

68
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,240
Oh, no.

69
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,120
(Jiang possesses
the Tianxuan Dragon Ring.)

70
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,440
According to the rules,

71
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,120
he is my superior.

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,520
If my superior is in trouble,

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,080
I can't run away.

74
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,680
Is this a big deal?

75
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,560
How disgraceful!

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Shameless!

77
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,800
But the Hong family...

78
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,960
Oh no!

79
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,160
It's all over.

80
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,800
Jiang might be reduced to ashes.

81
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,704
I need to go back

82
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,790
to collect his remains.

83
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,400
Right.

84
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,600
I can't break the rules.

85
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,960
Everyone, kneel!

86
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,440
We are willing to bow
down to Master Jiang

87
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,712
and pledge our allegiance.

88
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,600
Please spare

89
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,240
our lives.

90
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,280
This matter has nothing to do with you.

91
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,840
I will not pursue it further.

92
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,400
Master Jiang, thank you!

93
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,840
He's so young,

94
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,816
yet possess such a high level of grace.

95
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,720
I believe if it were
any other young person,

96
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,360
they would have pressed the attack

97
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,800
to eradicate all traces.

98
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,880
Isn't this a bit too merciful?

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,560
No.

100
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,440
If one lacks strength,

101
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,800
that would be true mercy.

102
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,120
Jiang Beizun's actions demonstrate

103
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,600
his disregard for everything.

104
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,840
He doesn't even see Hong Chongxiao,

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,240
or even the entire Hong family,
as a threat.

106
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,280
Would you still worry about these ants

107
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,960
seeking revenge?

108
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,280
Stop!

109
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,680
Well...

110
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,240
Stop!

111
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,840
I am Zhou Baxiong.

112
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,600
I ask the Hong family

113
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,840
to show some respect for me.

114
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,160
Leave some ashes...

115
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,040
Jiang!

116
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,720
How did you die?

117
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,600
How could you have been dead

118
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,600
before I got here?

119
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,800
Heaven!

120
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,240
Earth!

121
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,600
Why don't you open your eyes?

122
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,360
Jiang...

123
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,400
Jiang!

124
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,160
You're not dead!

125
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,800
Zhou Baxiong is truly a talent.

126
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,800
The Hong family must be fuming.

127
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,920
These ashes belong
to the head of the Hong family.

128
00:05:31,536 --> 00:05:32,720
You mourned the wrong person.

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,280
Hong Chongxiao?

130
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,400
He... He died?

131
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,160
I wasn't dreaming.

132
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:41,952
Alright.

133
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,720
It's fine now.

134
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,040
You can leave.

135
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,280
I...

136
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,280
Get out of here.

137
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,380
What a powerful Thunder Technique!

138
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,160
Master Jiang,

139
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,720
you have truly opened our eyes.

140
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,480
Miss Lu's previous concern
was appreciated.

141
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,352
I've witnessed the strength
of an Earth expert.

142
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,680
It is truly rare.

143
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,400
You!

144
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,160
After this battle,

145
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,720
Jiang Beizun's name

146
00:06:06,864 --> 00:06:08,480
is sure to resound
throughout Jiangcheng.

147
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,904
With the fall of the Hong family,

148
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:11,720
the entire situation in Jiangcheng

149
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,800
will also be in turmoil.

150
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
About the banquet,

151
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,920
we'll surely attend.

152
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,400
This battle has ended.

153
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,800
How about we escort you back?

154
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,600
Master Jiang, please.

155
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,920
Dash it!

156
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
After we return,

157
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,360
cancel the banquet preparations.

158
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,280
Father, why cancel it?

159
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,280
Jiang Beizun is highly skilled

160
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,360
and powerful.

161
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,400
Our family being able
to connect with such a figure

162
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,480
is a great fortune.

163
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,480
We cannot miss this opportunity.

164
00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:43,720
Precisely because of that,

165
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,600
we must cancel it.

166
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,710
There were too many people just now,

167
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,390
and I could not go
to pay respects to Beizun.

168
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,280
It was a good thing
I didn't act hastily.

169
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,400
What do you mean?

170
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,480
Jiang Beizun's strength
far exceeds everyone's,

171
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,360
including my expectations.

172
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,240
Facing him,

173
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,360
I'm afraid I wouldn't be able
to withstand that Thunder Strike either.

174
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,800
Even you are not his match?

175
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,920
Then Jiang Beizun must be...

176
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,800
Jiangcheng is too small

177
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,480
to contain this true expert.

178
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,920
Only sacred places like Yandu

179
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,480
can have people who can rival him.

180
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,480
To associate with him,

181
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,920
our Kong family is not qualified.

182
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Draft a new invitation.

183
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,800
This time, the theme is...

184
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,040
A Master-Apprentice Ceremony.

185
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,360
I understand.

186
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,160
You want me
to become Jiang Beizun's disciple.

187
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,720
To gain an advantage being close, right?

188
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,680
No.

189
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,040
The one to become his disciple is me.

190
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,280
In three days,

191
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
