(Adapted from "From God to Husband"
by Yueyingguxiangming)

00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,980
=Episode 19=

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,000
Congratulations, Young Master Liu.

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,920
You're truly a fine talent.

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,840
We should continue to maintain
our connections in the future.

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,480
Master Lu.

16
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,920
Miss Hongling.

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,200
I remember you.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,320
You seem to
be the eldest son of the Liu family.

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,760
How come so soon

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,560
you've become a sycophant

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,120
and a watchdog for the Kong family?

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,080
(You girl!)

23
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,720
(Once the Kong family rises completely,)

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,560
(I'll show you how I'll deal with you.)

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,520
Master Ma is also here.

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,520
Young Master Fang is here, too.

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,200
I haven't seen Master Ma for years.

28
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,000
Today even you've come here.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,920
Of course.

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,200
I've heard that Jiang Beizun has emerged

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,320
with a thunderous force

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,720
and swiftly killed Hong Chongxiao.

33
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,040
That's the top person in Jiangcheng.

34
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,560
Today is also Kong Tianhai's
apprenticeship ceremony.

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,280
How could we not come?

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,064
This is Huqian Longjing.
[*The name of a tea.]

37
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,000
I had someone specially fetch it

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,920
from Sunan for me.

39
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,120
I'm sure Master Beizun

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,120
will like it.

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,480
Huqian Longjing is indeed excellent.

42
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,760
But compared to the gift I have,

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,840
you might fall short.

44
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,280
I've long heard
of Master Beizun's bravery.

45
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,120
The Huangjingzhi that my Fang family
has kept for years

46
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,200
can help Master Beizun's skills

47
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,320
advance further.

48
00:02:18,816 --> 00:02:20,120
Lu Changsheng from the Lu family

49
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,680
brings Emerald Jade

50
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,560
to pay respects to Master Beizun.

51
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,040
What?

52
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,400
Emerald Jade?

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,920
It's said that Emerald Jade
is the world's best jade.

54
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,560
Wearing it for a long time
can prolong life.

55
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,680
Indeed, the top family in Jiangcheng

56
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,840
even possesses such a rare item.

57
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,680
It seems our prepared gifts

58
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,280
are somewhat inferior.

59
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:42,840
Ladies and gentlemen,

60
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,720
the ceremony is about to begin.

61
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,840
Please come in.

62
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,120
Master Lu, you're generous.

63
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,120
But this apprenticeship ceremony

64
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,840
is organized by the Kong family.

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,000
If the Lu family does this,

66
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,560
could it be a bit

67
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,880
overstepping their bounds?

68
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,520
What?

69
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,560
As long as my Lu family exists,

70
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,160
Jiangcheng will never be
under the Kong name.

71
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,120
Such arrogant boasting!

72
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,960
I wondered who dared to speak so boldly.

73
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,840
Turns out, it's Master Lu himself.

74
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,600
My apologies.

75
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,520
I've been so busy lately

76
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,880
that I forgot about you.

77
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,000
I didn't even send you an invitation.

78
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,000
Is that so?

79
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,600
Perhaps, it was intentional.

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,120
Who knows?

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,840
Kong Tianhai,

82
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,680
years ago, you knelt
at the gate of the Lu family,

83
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,960
begging to be taught.

84
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,560
My grandfather pitied you

85
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,680
and kindly taught you.

86
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,120
After you gained your skills,

87
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,280
you turned away
and started your own sect.

88
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,520
But now you still want to carve a piece

89
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,560
out of my Lu family?

90
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,840
Calling you an ungrateful wolf
isn't wrong at all.

91
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,840
Tianhai, I'm sorry.

92
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,400
Hongling is young,

93
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,000
and she speaks without restraint.

94
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,280
No worries.

95
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,680
If there's a chance later,

96
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
I'll ask Master Jiang Beizun

97
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,960
to give Hongling some guidance.

98
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,000
Well, Master Kong,

99
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,960
you've finally arrived.

100
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,520
Father, this is Chenfei's mother.

101
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,400
From now on, we'll be family.

102
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,600
So, we're in-laws.

103
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,280
My son may be unworthy,

104
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,520
but please take good care
of him in the future.

105
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,120
You're polite.

106
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,680
To be honest,

107
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,120
our Liu family is honored

108
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,592
to be connected to the Kong family.

109
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,480
That's right.

110
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,840
Everyone in the Liu family

111
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,160
holds your son in high regard.

112
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,240
After today,

113
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,860
when Chenfei marries into your family,

114
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,120
please take good care of her.

115
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,720
Yes.

116
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,400
Our Liu family is truly blessed

117
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,920
to be joined with you in marriage.

118
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
Right.

119
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,160
Stop talking nonsense!

120
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,600
I will never marry into the Kong family!

121
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,480
Shut up!

122
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,720
Who gave you the right to speak here?

123
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
You should obey

124
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,160
your parents' command.

125
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,160
I think you need some discipline!

126
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,920
Stop right there!

127
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,480
Bullying a weak woman?

128
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,680
Is this how your noble family behaves?

129
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,240
Jiang...

130
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,040
Jiang Feng!

131
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,600
How dare you

132
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,800
sneak into the grand ceremony!

133
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,840
My apologies.

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,600
This is my oversight.

135
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,272
I'll make him get out of here.

136
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,360
You made the marriage decision
on your own,

137
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,040
but did you consider
Chenfei's opinion?

138
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,560
Did you consider mine?

139
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,560
Your opinion?

140
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,680
Humph!

141
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,360
You're just a son-in-law.

142
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,040
What right do you have to an opinion?

143
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,120
Right.

144
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,280
What status do you have?

145
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,120
Even a dog at the gate of this ceremony
has more value than you.

146
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,240
Who is he?

147
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,040
He?

148
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,720
The son-in-law of the Liu family.

149
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,360
He keeps ruining my plans.

150
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
If it weren't for today,

151
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,000
out of respect for
Master Jiang Beizun's ceremony,

152
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,600
I'd make sure he pays dearly for this.

153
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,720
I've taught you since you were young,

154
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,120
to be ruthless in all matters.

155
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,680
As for this son-in-law, once this is over,

156
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,680
have someone deal with him.

157
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes.

158
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,680
Jiang Feng,

159
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,360
I'm not trying to make
things difficult for you.

160
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,120
But this kind of place

161
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,680
is simply not where you belong.

162
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,720
See this?

163
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,720
This is the legendary
Ten Thousand-Year Snow Lotus.

164
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,480
Its selling price has never

165
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,360
been less than eighty million.

166
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,120
And, it's incredibly rare,

167
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,920
almost impossible to find.

168
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,040
This is what we've prepared

169
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,280
as a gift for Master Beizun.

170
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,480
It's a token of sincerity
from the Liu family.

171
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,920
Ten Thousand-Year Snow Lotus?

172
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,840
The Liu family
has truly spared no expense.

173
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,240
It seems they're willing

174
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,600
to drain their entire fortune

175
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,800
just to earn a sliver
of favor from Beizun.

176
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
The Huang family
from Yandu has arrived!

177
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,600
They've come from Yandu?

178
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,040
What's going on?

179
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,360
Yandu is a sacred place,

180
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,600
and the Huang family

181
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,240
is the pinnacle of the elite.

182
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,720
For this ceremony
to even catch their attention?

183
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,040
It seems the forces

184
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,480
behind this Jiangcheng event

185
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,160
are far greater

186
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,480
than anticipated.

187
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,568
(You've come at the perfect time.)

188
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,120
Butler Huang,

189
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,648
I'm sorry I didn't greet you sooner.

190
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,400
Are you Kong Tianhai?

191
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,480
I've heard of you.

192
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,040
You're quite a character,

193
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,240
and even in our Yandu,

194
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,160
you might just make it
into the first tier.

195
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
You flatter me.

196
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,600
Well, where is Jiang Beizun?

197
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,920
Please be patient.

198
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,800
Master Jiang Beizun will appear soon.

199
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,600
The time should be

200
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,240
just about right.

201
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,040
Everyone, it is time

202
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,840
to invite Master Jiang Beizun
to the stage.

203
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,160
Kong Tianhai of Jiangcheng,

204
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,800
with a heart of sincerity
in pursuit of cultivation,

205
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,000
presents the treasured
family sword, Haixuan,

206
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,720
to humbly request Master Jiang
to take the stage

207
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,480
and conduct the disciple
acceptance ceremony.

208
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,120
Please, Master Jiang Beizun,
take the stage!

209
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,120
Please, Master Jiang Beizun,
take the stage!

210
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,480
Chenfei, no need to do this.

211
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,200
Could it be that Master Jiang
hasn't arrived yet?

212
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,320
Impossible.

213
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:34,480
He has already taken residence
in Longting Villa.

214
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,320
He must be here.

215
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,760
As for why he hasn't
taken the stage yet,

216
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,720
I'm afraid it might be because...

217
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,840
How dare you!

218
00:09:50,112 --> 00:09:51,840
Master Jiang is about
to take the stage,

219
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,000
and you dare show disrespect?

220
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,360
Of all the people here,

221
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,640
only Butler Huang, who has come afar,
is exempt from kneeling.

222
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,520
As for the Lu family,

223
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,840
you bear resentment towards the Master?

224
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Tianhai,

225
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,200
this baseless accusation,

226
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,120
I can't bear it.

227
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,120
Why shouldn't I bow to Jiang Beizun?

228
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,240
Hongling,

229
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,840
kneel.

230
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,240
Please, Jiang Beizun, take the stage.

231
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,240
Master Lu is right.

232
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,720
All members of Muhetang,

233
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,520
bow to Beizun!

234
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,080
Please, Jiang Beizun, take the stage.

235
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,760
Young man,

236
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,360
know your place.

237
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,840
Kneel down at once!

238
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,880
If you disrupt this ceremony,

239
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,590
I'll use you as a sacrifice
to the heavens!

240
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,480
Jiang Feng,

241
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,760
we can't afford to offend anyone here.

242
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,720
Kneel down quickly!

243
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,760
I think I'm better off standing.

244
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,240
You're courting death!

245
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,640
It's been years since I've seen

246
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,480
such an arrogant youngster.

247
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,120
After Master Jiang takes the stage,

248
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,760
I will personally twist your head off

249
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,240
to quell any anger
the Master may have.

250
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,600
Is that so?

251
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,320
Please, Jiang Beizun, take the stage.

252
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,840
Please, Jiang Beizun, take the stage.

253
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,760
Aren't you all here
to pay respects to Jiang Beizun?

254
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,240
I am Jiang Beizun.

255
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,760
Now who will be the first?

256
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,520
You impudent kid!

257
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,640
You're asking for death!

258
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,760
I'll grant your wish!
