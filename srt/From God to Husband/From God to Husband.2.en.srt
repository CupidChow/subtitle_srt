Jiang Feng!

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,480
(has mostly dissipated.)

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,290
Are you okay, Jiang Feng?

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,960
This time,

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,000
I finally saved you.

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,840
I've fulfilled the regret

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,160
of a thousand years.

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,360
You're insane!

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,632
Are you throwing your life away?

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,920
Even if I sacrifice everything,

23
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,840
I will protect you for life.

24
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,320
(Waiting for a thousand years
to reverse time and space.)

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,240

26
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,520
(no one can harm you.)

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,680
Grandpa,

28
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,520
even you were alarmed?

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,600
What kind of great figure could it be?

30
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,520
In this world, cultivators

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,200
are divided into

32
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,200
Heaven, Earth, Mystic, and Yellow ranks.

33
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,080
I have cultivated for decades,

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,320
and only just reached the Earth rank.

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,280
The spiritual power of that great figure

36
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,520
is a hundred times stronger than mine.

37
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,960
Grandpa.

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,088
By the way,

39
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,320
Hongling,

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,480
send someone to investigate.

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,280
If we can find this senior,

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,200
I will personally pay a visit.

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,680
Grandpa,

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,040
our Lu family

45
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,680
is the top family in Jiangcheng.

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,120
And you're the strongest
martial artist here.

47
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,120
You haven't gone out for over a decade.

48
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,760
Why humble yourself?

49
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,000
How about

50
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,760
I pay a visit on your behalf?

51
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,640
Inappropriate.

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,840
With my cultivation,

53
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,040
I'm nothing in front

54
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,120
of that senior.

55
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,680
Moreover,

56
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,760
I am now poisoned,

57
00:02:12,464 --> 00:02:13,480
and have little time left.

58
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,040
If I could bring you

59
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,280
to serve that senior as a maid,

60
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,680
it would be
beneficial for you and our family,

61
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,200
ensuring prosperity
for the next hundred years.

62
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,200
Maid?

63
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,640
Me?

64
00:02:29,456 --> 00:02:32,752
(Liu Family,
lowest family in Jiangcheng)

65
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,440
(Family Instructions of Liu Family)

66
00:02:37,472 --> 00:02:40,144
(Madam of Liu Family)

67
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,808
The night before your engagement,

68
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,160
you ran away from home.

69
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,000
How dare you come back!

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,360
Kneel!

71
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,280
Servants!

72
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,400
Bring the discipline rod!

73
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,840
The young master of the Kong family

74
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,120
is outstanding among men in Jiangcheng.

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,440
He's from a prominent family.

76
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,120
If he takes a fancy to you,

77
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,600
it's your fortune accumulated
over eight lifetimes.

78
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,520
Our Liu family

79
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,280
could use this opportunity

80
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,840
to rise even higher.

81
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,720
But look at you!

82
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,160
Instead of cherishing

83
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,840
such a rare opportunity,

84
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,440
you chose to do something
as ridiculous as running away.

85
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,590
Based on the instructions,

86
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,240
you...

87
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,664
You deserve to be punished...

88
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,800
Jiang Feng?

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,680
How dare you come back?

90
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,960
All of this

91
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,520
is thanks to the young master
of the Kong family.

92
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,240
If it weren't for him,

93
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,680
how could I have come back?

94
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,440
Who do you think you are?

95
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,840
You're just a son-in-law.

96
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,680
How dare you judge Young Master Kong?

97
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,280
It looks like

98
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,840
you need some discipline.

99
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,880
Immediately,

100
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,360
kneel outside the door!

101
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,280
You're not worthy to kneel inside.

102
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,840
Forgive me, I won't kneel.

103
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,160
A mere son-in-law

104
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,000
disappeared for three years,

105
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,840
and now you've got some nerve.

106
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,680
You dare

107
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,800
talk back to me?

108
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,360
Mother!

109
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,080
The whole of Jiangcheng

110
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,840
knows

111
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,000
Kong Mingzhe is a philanderer.

112
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,520
The number of women he has harmed

113
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,600
is countless.

114
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,890
You insist on forcing me
to marry into the Kong family,

115
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,280
just because you
covet their power, don't you?

116
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,840
You worthless girl!

117
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
Our Liu family

118
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,560
is in decline.

119
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,880
If not for relying on the Kong family,

120
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,560
how would we

121
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,000
have a place in Jiangcheng?

122
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,440
And you!

123
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,680
You're being
a son-in-law for five years.

124
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,240
We've treated you

125
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,040
with utmost kindness.

126
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,040
Now that you dare to show up,

127
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,920
then why not

128
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,000
get a divorce today?

129
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,040
Divorce?

130
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,800
Sure.

131
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,240
As long as Chenfei agrees,

132
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,480
I'll leave immediately.

133
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,240
But if she doesn't,

134
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,920
no one in this world

135
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,120
can force her.

136
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,040
A worthless freeloader

137
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,840
dares to speak nonsense here?

138
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,240
The gap between you and Chenfei

139
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,400
is like heaven and earth.

140
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,600
Only someone like Young Master Kong,
a man of great talent,

141
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,160
is worthy of her.

142
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,040
Tomorrow, Young Master Kong
will come to propose.

143
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,360
He has prepared a bride price
worth tens of millions!

144
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,400
But you...

145
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,560
Jiang Feng,

146
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,360
can you even

147
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,480
take a thousand yuan?

148
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,480
Money is trivial.

149
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,040
As long as Chenfei desires,

150
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,040
I could pluck the stars

151
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,480
from the sky for her.

152
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,840
Chenfei,

153
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,000
get up.

154
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
How dare you!

155
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,160
Don't you dare get up!

156
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,800
Great.

157
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,920
As a son-in-law,

158
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,040
you dare

159
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,040
to resist our Liu family?

160
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,040
Servants!

161
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,900
- Yes.
- Yes.

162
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,800
Beat this disrespectful

163
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,000
scoundrel out!

164
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,096
- Yes.
- Yes.

165
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,240
Enough!

166
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,240
Mother,

167
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,800
it's enough.

168
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,280
Jiang Feng,

169
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,560
is this how you solve problems?

170
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,920
I see now,

171
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
and I'm disappointed.

172
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,800
Chenfei!

173
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,480
Chenfei!

174
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Rest well for now.

175
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,840
Tomorrow,

176
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,840
I will change everything.

177
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,680
(Compared to the Immortal Realm,)

178
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,600
(the spiritual energy here)

179
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,560
(is even more scarce
than I anticipated.)

180
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,680
(Now, all my cultivation is lost.)

181
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,480
(The most important thing now)

182
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,920
(is to recover some of my strength.)

183
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,480
(Starting over isn't a big deal.)

184
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,560
(With a lifetime
of cultivation experience,)

185
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,720
(I can still be invincible
in this world.)

186
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
This place is barely acceptable.

187
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,480
This will do.

188
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,800
Grandpa,

189
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,680
are you sure it's here?

190
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,840
No mistake.

191
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:49,920
There are

192
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,840
races of intense activity here.

193
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,720
It seems

194
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,280
that senior must have appeared nearby.

195
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,720
There's a young man ahead.

196
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,800
Let's ask him

197
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,360
if he saw any
unusual phenomena yesterday.

198
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,240
Grandpa!

199
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,240
What's that noise?

200
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,480
I got distracted,

201
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,160
and didn't see anything.

202
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,160
Excuse me,

203
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
can I ask you something?

204
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,280
Last night...

205
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,720
How dare you!

206
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,000
Do you know

207
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,680
who stands before you?

208
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,240
What does that have to do with me?

209
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,240
Has anyone told you

210
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,920
not to bother others unnecessarily

211
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,890
to avoid accidental harm?

212
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,160
Accidental harm?

213
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
From you?

214
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,050
Even ten of you
wouldn't be enough for me.

215
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,920
Hongling!

216
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,600
Young friend,

217
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,360
here is the thing.

218
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,240
Recently,

219
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,840
has there been

220
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,560
anyone unusual worth noting?

221
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,600
Or rather

222
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,040
have there been

223
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,920
any unusual occurrences?

224
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,160
I don't know.

225
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,480
Go ask someone else.

226
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,680
I have things to do.

227
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,360
You...!

228
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,320
It's fine.

229
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,440
He's just a passerby
doing his morning exercise.

230
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,600
As the future leader of the Lu family,

231
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,720
why bother with ordinary people?

232
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,520
Grandpa, you're right.

233
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,720
I understand now.

234
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,520
But his attitude was really bad.

235
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,520
How about this?

236
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,120
I'll go around and ask more people.

237
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,840
Grandpa, you can go rest.

238
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,320
If there's any news,

239
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll report to you immediately.

240
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,960
Okay.

241
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,080
If I could seek advice from that senior,

242
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,120
my life would be worthwhile.

243
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,360
What a pity.

244
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,720
Flying flowers and leaves

245
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,240
can kill with a flick.

246
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,320
So it's him!

247
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
Morning, Young Master.

248
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,120
(Liu Qingtian, eldest son of Liu Family)

249
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,840
Young Master,

250
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,480
Jiang Feng, that son-in-law

251
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,840
came back last night.

252
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Jiang Feng?

253
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
Yes.

254
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,960
He returned just
before Young Master Kong proposed.

255
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,520
(Liu Rourou,)
I think he

256
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,920
(second daughter)
is up to no good.

257
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,690
I'm afraid he's here to cause trouble.

258
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,640
Why panic?

259
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,240
What trouble can
a useless son-in-law cause?

260
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,000
He's back at the Liu family

261
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,000
just to get some more money.

262
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
With me here,

263
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,240
he won't get a single coin.

264
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,200
Let's go.

265
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,200
Today is my sister's big day.

266
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,600
I have prepared some gifts for her

267
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,360
and my new brother-in-law.

268
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,480
Liu,

269
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,480
go fetch

270
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,600
the things for me.

271
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,720
Is Jiang Feng here to cause trouble?

272
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,240
Ignore him.

273
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,600
Let's

274
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,120
head back.

275
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,520
Is the tea ready?

276
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,640
Take the vase away.

277
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,480
Chenfei,

278
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,360
cheer up.

279
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,320
Be happy, okay?

280
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
Oh dear,

281
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,240
why aren't Qingtian

282
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,960
and Rourou back yet?

283
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,120
It's such a big day at home.

284
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,960
Mother!

285
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,520
Chenfei!

286
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,360
Why are you frowning

287
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,840
on such a happy day?

288
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,880
I went to Haitian this time,

289
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,600
specifically to buy your favorite bag.

290
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,000
Qingtian,

291
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,880
why are you back so late?

292
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,760
Young Master Kong will be here soon.

293
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,720
You must accompany him for a few drinks.

294
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,720
Don't neglect our guest.

295
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,240
Mother, don't worry.

296
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,640
With me here,

297
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,840
our Liu family won't lose face.

298
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,600
Where are the Liu family members?

299
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,120
Young Master Kong brings gifts,

300
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,120
coming to marry Liu Chenfei.

301
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,240
Madam Liu.

302
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:13,960
Hello,

303
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,000
how have you been?

304
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,760
My good son-in-law,

305
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,760
what took you so long?

306
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,240
Here.

307
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,000
Take a seat.

308
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,080
Rourou,

309
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,960
quickly,

310
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,240
serve tea to Young Master Kong.

311
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,240
Young Master Kong, your attire

312
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,960
truly makes you look magnificent,

313
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,290
and a man of extraordinary talent.

314
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,000
Your presence truly
graces our humble home.

315
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,240
You must be tired now.

316
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,200
Please rest well.

317
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,600
It's you?

318
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,240
How are you still alive?

319
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,880
What?

320
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,120
You seem surprised

321
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,520
to see me standing here.

322
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,000
So what if you're back?

323
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,080
You're hard to kill.

324
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,960
But let me warn you,

325
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,640
Chenfei will soon be my wife.

326
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,080
I will give her a lifetime
of wealth and honor.

327
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,120
Stay away from her.

328
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,120
You come to my house

329
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,240
and tell me to stay away from my wife?

330
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,640
Are you out of your mind?

331
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,840
Now that I'm back,

332
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,840
I will protect Chenfei well.

333
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,640
You, an outsider, have no say.

334
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,880
Outrageous!

335
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,600
How dare you speak
to Young Master Kong like that!

336
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,400
Have you forgotten

337
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,240
who you are?

338
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,320
Madam Liu, don't worry.

339
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,000
He's just a son-in-law.

340
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,320
Wants to protect Chenfei?

341
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,840
I'd like to see what he's capable of.

342
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,240
Kong Mingzhe of the Kong family

343
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,200
brings ten million in cash,

344
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,240
five mines,

345
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,360
and one hundred million order

346
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
to marry Miss Liu.

347
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,960
Hoping for the Liu family's approval.

348
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,480
Hoping for the Liu family's approval.

349
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,120
In terms of power,

350
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,720
status,

351
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,600
and wealth,

352
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
you think you

353
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,600
are worthy of competing
with me for a woman?

354
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,080
Young Master Kong,

355
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,440
don't be angry.

356
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,360
Let me.

357
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,480
Jiang Feng,

358
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,240
what do you want

359
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,720
to leave Chenfei?

360
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,240
Aren't you staying in our Liu family

361
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,600
just waiting for this question?

362
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,960
Then let me ask you,

363
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,240
what kind of conditions

364
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,240
will make this annoying fly go away?

365
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,120
How dare you insult me!

366
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,360
Does anyone in the Liu family
manage this stray dog?

367
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,360
Jiang Feng,

368
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,240
how dare...

369
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,200
How dare you speak to him like that!

370
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,440
Do you know who he is?

371
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,200
In Jiangcheng,

372
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,600
when Young Master Kong says east,

373
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,760
no one dares go west.

374
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,600
Madam Liu,

375
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,440
I still respect Master Lu,

376
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,410
who has been in seclusion
for many years.

377
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,720
Mother,

378
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,600
nowadays,

379
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,360
Master Lu's prestige remains.

380
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,440
How can you speak like this?

381
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,080
Master Lu?

382
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,120
Hasn't he

383
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,000
been in seclusion for many years

384
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,360
and never came out?

385
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,360
That's right.

386
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,600
He's indeed been
in seclusion for ten years,

387
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,520
but the Lu family's
foundation still remains.

388
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,760
Even my father...

389
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,360
When he was still alive,

390
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,840
he was only one
of Master Lu's disciples.

391
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:21,940
Jiang Feng,

392
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,000
who do you think you are?

393
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,520
In Jiangcheng,

394
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,240
besides Master Lu,

395
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,880
I don't fear anyone.

396
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,360
And you dare to negotiate with me?

397
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,600
Aren't you just trying
to get more benefits?

398
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,880
This is enough

399
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,200
for you to do a small business,

400
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,240
and live without worries.

401
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,320
Take it and get lost.

402
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,840
Just this?

403
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,600
Your appetite isn't small.

404
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,440
This!

405
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,480
And this!

406
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,980
It's enough for you to live carefree
for the rest of your life.

407
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,200
If you get greedy,

408
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,080
I will

409
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,000
take it all back.

410
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,440
Young Master Kong,

411
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,840
well,

412
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,760
he is not

413
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,640
worth this much money.

414
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,520
Well...

415
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,120
This...

416
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:22,960
Could it be

417
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,880
from the Liu family's

418
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,600
bride price?

419
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,320
Mother!

420
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
Young Master Kong,

421
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,200
you are a nobleman.

422
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,320
Why bother with

423
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,120
a powerless and insignificant son-in-law?

424
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,640
Right.

425
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,600
Even if it's for Chenfei's sake,

426
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,120
don't you think

427
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,600
this is a bit too generous?

428
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,720
A dog

429
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,840
is naturally not worth my pity.

430
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,520
I just don't want Chenfei

431
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,280
to be bothered by this person again.

432
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,360
If he dares to be troublesome again,

433
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,320
I have plenty of underhanded

434
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,640
methods.

435
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,600
Jiang Feng left for three years,

436
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,704
and my sister waited bitterly
for three years.

437
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,120
He comes back
at this critical moment to please her,

438
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,600
clearly wanting a divorce settlement.

439
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,200
Chenfei,

440
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,320
you must open your eyes.

441
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,120
Enough!

442
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,240
Although Jiang Feng is powerless,

443
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,600
he is still part of the Liu family.

444
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,840
You don't have
to humiliate him like this.

445
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,200
Qingtian.

446
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,000
Rourou.

447
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,840
You two leave immediately.

448
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,480
Don't interfere in this matter anymore.

449
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,640
Wait...

450
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,240
Chenfei...

451
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,200
What?

452
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,240
Can't you understand
what my fiancée said?

453
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,720
Get out!

454
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,120
Just go.

455
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,760
Don't worry, Fei.

456
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,600
Before,

457
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,360
you met a wrong person.

458
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,920
In the future,

459
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,000
as long as you serve me well,

460
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,680
I will

461
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,240
make it up to you.

462
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,640
Do you want to lose this hand,

463
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,640
or your life?

464
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,280
You dare to threaten me?

465
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,480
I see you have the audacity.

466
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,680
Are you going to hit me?

467
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,880
Come on!

468
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,960
Hit me here.

469
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,760
Come on!

470
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,240
Just hit me here!

471
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,480
I want to see if this stray dog
from the Liu family

472
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,920
dares to bite.

473
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,080
