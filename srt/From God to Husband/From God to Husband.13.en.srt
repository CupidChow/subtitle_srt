Ghost!

All this noise!

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,200
What's with all the people
gathered here?

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,880
Wait...

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,320
Master Liu...

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,320
Your seventh day
hasn't even passed yet...

18
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,880
- What are you...?
- Nonsense!

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,440
I heard you're making Chenfei remarry?

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,000
What?

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,040
Are you the one in charge
of this family now?

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,080
Is this your final radiance?

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,080
Be careful. Get down.

24
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,720
(Jesus, he's coming back to life.)

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,720
(We should need a new plan.)

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,320
Chenfei,

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,240
seeing Grandpa's energy,

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,840
he seems fine.

29
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,000
Grandpa must be recovering.

30
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,480
I told you,

31
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,480
Jiang Feng would definitely find a way.

32
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,960
I feel great.

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,880
I haven't slept this well in ages.

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,440
I feel like
I've become younger by years.

35
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,680
It's a pity
that there's no good wine at home.

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,800
Otherwise, I'd have a good drink.

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,880
Grandpa,

38
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,880
Jiang Feng just saved you.

39
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,440
You've just recovered,

40
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,320
so don't drink.

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,400
Take good care of yourself.

42
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
Okay.

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,520
Jiang,

44
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,800
Chenfei said you saved me.

45
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
It was nothing.

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,320
Master Liu, you lived a righteous life,

47
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,240
full of honor.

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,880
If you were to die without reason,

49
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,520
it would be Jiangcheng's loss,

50
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,040
and the Liu family's disaster.

51
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,440
I knew my judgment wasn't wrong.

52
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,520
Great.

53
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,800
Humph.

54
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,680
Over the years,

55
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,600
the decline of the Liu family

56
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,080
is not just due to external factors,

57
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,520
but also internal chaos
within the family.

58
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,240
Guard against thieves by day,

59
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,352
but family traitors
are hard to guard against.

60
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,600
I'm not dead yet,

61
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,080
and you already want to remarry Chenfei.

62
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,680
And you,

63
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,240
unfilial grandson!

64
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,640
Such a scoundrel!

65
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,760
If you hadn't infuriated me,

66
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,920
the Liu family wouldn't be in this mess,

67
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,560
making a laughingstock for outsiders.

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,200
As for the company,

69
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,280
your position is revoked.

70
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,000
Starting today,

71
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,560
without my permission,

72
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,200
you're not allowed
to touch any Liu family affairs.

73
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,960
Grandpa, you can't do this.

74
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,960
I'm doing this
for the good of the Liu family.

75
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,280
What? Really?

76
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,760
If you really cared for the Liu family,

77
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,480
you wouldn't have rushed
to hold my funeral.

78
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,640
And you certainly wouldn't
have seized control of the Liu family,

79
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,680
forcing Chenfei to remarry an outsider.

80
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,280
Young Master Kong,

81
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,800
please leave.

82
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,960
The Liu family

83
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,960
doesn't recognize this marriage.

84
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,080
Well...

85
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,800
Master Liu, as a junior,

86
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,960
I shouldn't say this.

87
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,640
But let me kindly remind you

88
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,240
that you might not survive for long

89
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,840
without the Kong family's protection.

90
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
Nonsense!

91
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,800
Even if the Liu family declines,

92
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,560
it's not your place to lecture me.

93
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,680
Come on.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,120
See him out.

95
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,680
Master Liu, I'm still young.

96
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,800
I have plenty of time

97
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,920
to wait for your death.

98
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,480
Get out!

99
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,080
I'm afraid you won't live
to see that day.

100
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,360
The Liu family has people,

101
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,400
and it's not your place to interfere.

102
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,760
Master Liu, rest assured.

103
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,840
I will protect Chenfei
and the Liu family.

104
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,520
Humph.

105
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,240
Since you're so confident,

106
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,080
let's see how things turn out.

107
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,920
After the grand banquet,

108
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,080
I'll deal with you.

109
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,400
The storm
from the Kong family is coming.

110
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,240
By then, once we align with Jiang Beizun,

111
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,320
my great task will be complete.

112
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,080
Your death will also come.

113
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,640
Is that so?

114
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,570
I'm looking forward to it.

115
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Hey!

116
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,440
Mother.

117
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,320
You two!

118
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,640
Tear down
all the festive decorations outside.

119
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,880
Hurry up!

120
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,560
Let's go.

121
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,200
Chenfei, I haven't been out
for a long time.

122
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,440
Will you take me for a walk?

123
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,520
Sure.

124
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,120
Jiang, come with us.

125
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,120
Okay.

126
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,120
The weather is really nice.

127
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Chenfei, you've suffered a lot these days.

128
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,000
As long as you are well,

129
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,400
I'm willing to do anything.

130
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120
Jiang,

131
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,760
while I was sick,

132
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,520
you must have suffered a lot too.

133
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,760
Don't worry.

134
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,000
No matter what others
in the Liu family say,

135
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,080
I will always

136
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,520
set an extra pair of chopsticks for you.

137
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,520
Master Liu, you worry too much.

138
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,400
Honestly, I never had any grievances
against the Liu family.

139
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,760
I do dislike some people
of the Liu family,

140
00:06:06,864 --> 00:06:08,120
but that's a different matter.

141
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,640
If it weren't for you insisting
on taking me in back then,

142
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,000
I wouldn't be here today.

143
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,520
I'll always remember this kindness.

144
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,880
Knowing that you understand this

145
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,960
puts my mind at ease.

146
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,400
Chenfei,

147
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,440
Jiang Feng is someone you can rely on.

148
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,320
You must understand
and tolerate each other.

149
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,880
Rest assured.

150
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,680
I'll protect Chenfei with my life.

151
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,000
In the past,

152
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,240
I was the one protecting Chenfei.

153
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,000
Now, someone else can
finally protect her for me.

154
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,320
Chenfei, I want to go

155
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,560
back to the old mansion
in Nankang tomorrow

156
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,400
to pay my respects.

157
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,880
I miss your grandmother.

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,552
Are the people in front watching fish?

159
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,560
I didn't expect
you to really have medical skills.

160
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,640
What did you think

161
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,400
I was doing all the time I was missing?

162
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,560
Everyone needs to learn something.

163
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,000
Jiang Feng, thank you.

164
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,000
If it weren't for you,

165
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,440
Grandpa might really have...

166
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,240
No wonder Zhou Baxiong
was so polite to you.

167
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,440
Well,

168
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,800
having the skill to save lives

169
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,760
is indeed a great asset.

170
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,320
Jiang Feng,

171
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
you really are different from before.

172
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,440
I told you, this time I'm back,

173
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,440
to make up for the wrongs
I did to you in the past.

174
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,000
Even though you've made progress now,

175
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,080
you still need to work hard.

176
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
Keep improving.

177
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,640
Don't get complacent.

178
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,000
I understand.

179
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,200
I'll prove myself with my actions.

180
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,640
But don't call me verbose.

181
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,560
Though you now know some medical skills,

182
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
still,

183
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,560
they are just some minor skills.

184
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,000
You shouldn't spend
all your energy on this.

185
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,400
There are too many
important figures in Jiangcheng.

186
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,120
Even though you've improved,

187
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,440
you mustn't be impulsive as before.

188
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,760
Okay.

189
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,560
About your methods,

190
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,320
in front of true cultivators,

191
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,780
you still need to keep a low profile.

192
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,640
I don't want any accidents for you.

193
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,080
I only hope you can live

194
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,200
a safe and steady life.

195
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,880
Keep a low profile?

196
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Me?

197
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,800
As long as you understand.

198
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,232
Go into the lake and grab it.

199
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,512
Master, congratulations.

200
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,360
You've caught a koi.

201
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,240
How is the matter I asked you about?

202
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,240
Master,

203
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,400
the challenge letter has been sent.

204
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,000
It's scheduled for tomorrow, at 3 PM,

205
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
at Tianxuan Mountain, Yunguan Temple.

206
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,880
But I worry

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,120
that Jiang Beizun

208
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,120
might be too scared
to accept the challenge.

209
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,640
No.

210
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,760
He will definitely come.

211
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,600
Since ancient times,

212
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,920
once grudges escalate
to life-and-death battles,

213
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,120
no one has the right to stay out of it.

214
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,120
As cultivators,

215
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,360
we spend our lives seeking competition.

216
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,360
Competing for resources,

217
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,240
connections, and luck.

218
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,120
If Jiang Beizun hesitates
in the face of battle,

219
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,600
do you think

220
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,000
the world will see him in a good light?

221
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,520
In the future,

222
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,760
how will he have the face

223
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,480
to stay in Jiangcheng?

224
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,520
I understand.

225
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,000
You want me to notify the Lu family,

226
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,520
and have the heroes
of the world witness it.

227
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,120
There's another layer of meaning to it.

228
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,160
However, the Kong family...

229
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,720
Kong Tianhai, this fox,

230
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,120
pretending to be dead
and retreating behind the scenes,

231
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,360
really fooled us all.

232
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,040
Now he's spreading the word

233
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,000
that he'll hold a grand banquet,

234
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,640
trying to win
over Jiang Beizun for himself.

235
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,000
Humph.

236
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,120
His calculations are quite clever.

237
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,760
It's just a pity that after tomorrow,

238
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,480
there will be no Jiang Beizun
in Jiangcheng.

239
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,120
Ms. Murong, it's late at night.

240
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,240
Is there something important?

241
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,120
Seeing me,

242
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,040
you seem surprised, Mr. Jiang.

243
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,400
Not really.

244
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
After all, this house

245
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,040
is under your name.

246
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,480
Your presence here is reasonable.

247
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,160
No.

248
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,360
This house was indeed once mine.

249
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,360
But now it belongs to you.

250
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,400
Since I gifted it to you,

251
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,760
there's no reason to look back.

252
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,040
Tonight, I intrude
into a private residence.

253
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,520
Please forgive me, Mr. Jiang.

254
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,520
Didn't you tell the people I sent

255
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
to let me come here?

256
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,520
What?

257
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,400
You've forgotten

258
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,000
what you said before?

259
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,120
Now that I'm here,

260
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,920
how do you feel?

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,610
