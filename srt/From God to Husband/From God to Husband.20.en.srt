(Adapted from "From God to Husband"
by Yueyingguxiangming)

00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,980
=Episode 20=

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,320
You impudent kid!

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,040
You're asking for death.

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I'll grant your wish!

15
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,640
How could that be?

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,200
Master Kong is one of the top Earth
rank martial artists in Jiangcheng.

17
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
But this son-in-law

18
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,200
defeated him with just one move!

19
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,680
Father!

20
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,000
It's only because I haven't
fought in ten years

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,416
that this kid managed to gain
the upper hand for a moment.

22
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,280
For someone with
the cultivation of Jiang Beizun,

23
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,088
he must be at least in his sixties.

24
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,920
(Jesus, the son of the Jiang family
has become so powerful.)

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,040
(I must quickly assess his strength,)

26
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,400
(and report to Young Master.)

27
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Everyone, follow me

28
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,280
to kill this person now

29
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,680
to honor Beizun.

30
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,760
Wait a second.

31
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,640
Master Kong,

32
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,000
if you let this group of martial artists

33
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,680
attack this young man all at once,

34
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,760
it might be criticized by others.

35
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,280
Since this man claims

36
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,040
to be Jiang Beizun,

37
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,920
I have a treasure here,

38
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,760
and we'll know with one test.

39
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,560
This is...

40
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,680
What's this?

41
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,720
What an impressive method.

42
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,560
Butler Huang,

43
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,720
is this the Tianyin Bell?

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,280
It is said to be made of mysterious iron
from the heavens.

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,880
Indestructible.

46
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,680
Even a Heaven-level martial artist

47
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,112
can't shake it in the slightest.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,120
A full-strength strike

49
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,880
only makes it ring twice.

50
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,440
Instead of fighting,

51
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,680
why not let this young man try?

52
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,960
We'll see his cultivation level

53
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,960
with one try.

54
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,880
Jiang Feng,

55
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,400
this is no ordinary bell.

56
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,400
If you can make it ring just once,

57
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,680
you pass.

58
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,120
Did you claim to be Jiang Beizun?

59
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,000
Come on.

60
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,840
Let everyone see.

61
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,280
Strike the bell,

62
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,240
and make it ring once to prove myself.

63
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,680
You ants,

64
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,960
you dare to command me,

65
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,360
and talk so big.

66
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,960
Such arrogance!

67
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,690
Don't think that because you got lucky

68
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,160
and caught our master off guard,

69
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
we're afraid of you.

70
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,720
Humph!

71
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,400
Everyone,

72
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,960
watch how I subdue him!

73
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,400
Too much talking.

74
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,680
This...

75
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,000
Greetings, Beizun.

76
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,960
One ring marks a master.

77
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,240
Two rings mark a grandmaster.

78
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,360
The five rings...

79
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:27,840
Mother!

80
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,680
Kneel quickly!

81
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,800
Jiang Feng really is Jiang Beizun.

82
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,440
He is no longer
just our family's son-in-law.

83
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,000
We misjudged him.

84
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,448
Remember to pass on a message

85
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,120
that Young Master Jiang of Yandu

86
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:45,680
has not forgotten the past.

87
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,680
Is this really my brother-in-law
or Jiang Beizun?

88
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,000
I see everyone kneeling...

89
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,120
Should we kneel or not?

90
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Master...

91
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,400
If during tomorrow's ceremony,

92
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,240
Kong Mingzhe makes such a request,

93
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,560
please, I beg you, do not agree.

94
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,040
Why not?

95
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,240
(No wonder at that time)

96
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,240
(I felt the voice was so familiar.)

97
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,600
Impossible!

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,800
This can't be.

99
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,920
You're a son-in-law of the Liu family!

100
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,120
You have nothing!

101
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,832
How could you possibly
be Jiang Beizun?

102
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,896
This must be a trick
you're playing on me.

103
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,000
Impossible!

104
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,360
Father!

105
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,800
How could you...

106
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,720
Shut up!

107
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,040
Earlier, I did not recognize
your true identity.

108
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,920
I deeply apologize.

109
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,480
Please forgive us.

110
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,320
Kong Tianhai,

111
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,720
even if your son
hadn't provoked me today,

112
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:43,840
I still wouldn't accept you
as a disciple.

113
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,800
You and your son have committed
countless evils in Jiangcheng,

114
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
bringing harm to many.

115
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,360
How could I associate
with people like you?

116
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
Three years ago,

117
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:56,160
the Kong family conspired
to murder me,

118
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,648
leaving me to die in the wilderness.

119
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,360
If not for the sliver
of life left in me,

120
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,840
I would have long
been gone from this world.

121
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,400
Chenfei would have
become a mere object

122
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,040
for your Kong family to toy with.

123
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,280
What is ridiculous is

124
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,720
that you still have the audacity
to be my disciple?

125
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,160
Three years ago...

126
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,640
Hurry up!

127
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,040
Is it done?

128
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,752
Young Master, he's dead for sure.

129
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,920
Now no one will dare compete
with you for Miss Chenfei.

130
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,120
I understand.

131
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,920
So three years ago,
Jiang Feng didn't run away.

132
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,120
He was murdered by the Kong family.

133
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,720
Chenfei,

134
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,160
we've been wrong
about him all this time.

135
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,560
Today,

136
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,552
with the blood of the Kong family,

137
00:06:45,664 --> 00:06:47,520
I shall warm the wine
and raise the banner.

138
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,720
Everything is

139
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,000
just a misunderstanding!

140
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,480
Regarding this matter,

141
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,800
I knew nothing at all!

142
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,920
Everything is done by this rebellious son!

143
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,800
Now, I hand him over to you.

144
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,480
Whether he lives or dies

145
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,800
is for you to decide.

146
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,480
Just spare me.

147
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,560
What a wonderful show!

148
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,160
To secure your own escape,

149
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,240
you would even abandon your own son.

150
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,160
Even a tiger doesn't eat its cubs.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,160
People like you,

152
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,280
for Jiangcheng,

153
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,800
are a disaster?

154
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,160
How about it?

155
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,800
10% of my power.

156
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,920
Since you've accepted it,

157
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,680
whether you stay or go,

158
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,680
it's up to you.

159
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,040
Father!

160
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,160
Father!

161
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,480
Are you okay?

162
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,600
Father! Are you okay?

163
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,600
Quickly!

164
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,040
Leave!

165
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,920
Master Jiang,

166
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,360
are you going to let them go?

167
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
Chenfei is still here.

168
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,800
It can't be too bloody.

169
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,480
After today,

170
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,176
Jiangcheng will have no more Kong family.

171
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,920
Chenfei.

172
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,040
Didn't you say you wouldn't
deceive me again?

173
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,720
Young Master of Yandu?

174
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,360
Jiang Beizun?

175
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,160
How should I address you?

176
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,720
How many things are there
that I still don't know about?

177
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,600
Chenfei.

178
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,800
Don't touch me!

179
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,360
I...

180
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,920
I can't accept this all at once.

181
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,560
Let me slowly process it.

182
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,000
Jiang...

183
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,240
Mr. Jiang Beizun,

184
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,440
I'm sorry.

185
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,120
Chenfei!

186
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,480
Chenfei!

187
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,240
Chenfei!

188
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,720
Get out!

189
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,480
All of you! Get out!

190
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,360
Father,

191
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,640
what should we do now?

192
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,440
How dare you ask me that!

193
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,600
It's all your fault!

194
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,440
You've destroyed the Kong family's
great enterprise.

195
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,360
If it weren't for you,

196
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,840
how could my plan
to unify Jiangcheng have failed?

197
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,200
I wish I could swallow you alive
and flay you to the bone!

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,760
Me?

199
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,760
Why me?

200
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,016
Who could have known
Jiang Feng was Jiang Beizun?

201
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,120
And who knew those fools
couldn't even kill one person?

202
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,000
Or how would
today have happened?

203
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,120
Every time you lecture
this one and that one.

204
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,480
Every time you scold me
until I'm covered in insults.

205
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,600
Have you ever considered
my feelings even a little?

206
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,360
How dare you talk back!

207
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,840
It's too late.

208
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,640
It's too late now.

209
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,240
Go to him and beg
for forgiveness in person.

210
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,200
Maybe there's still
some room for negotiation.

211
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,760
Otherwise, when Jiang Beizun punishes,

212
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
even I might not survive.

213
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,080
Why are you waiting for?

214
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,120
Help me sit down!

215
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,320
You're a blind and useless fool!

216
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,760
I'm also ruthless.

217
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,440
You taught me that.

218
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,600
Father!

219
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,640
Father!

220
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,720
Father!

221
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,840
Who's there?

222
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,120
Not bad.

223
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,760
(Huang Tianzong)

224
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,960
(Young Master of Huang)
Your

225
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,840
temperament is fit to work for me.

226
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,640
Butler Huang,

227
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,720
you saw what just happened, right?

228
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,440
He forced me!

229
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,080
If he hadn't forced me to my death,

230
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,360
how could I have...

231
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,440
You're wrong.

232
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,760
It wasn't him who forced you.

233
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,120
It was Jiang Feng!

234
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,600
Jiang Beizun.

235
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,240
What are you saying?

236
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,080
This person here
is the young master of the Huang family,

237
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,200
Huang Tianzong.

238
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,240
He came to Jiangcheng
specifically to help you.

239
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
Why are you...

240
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,000
I have nothing now.

241
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,840
No, you're wrong.

242
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,840
I'm not here to help you.

243
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,440
But you, this stray dog,

244
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,840
still have some use left in you.

245
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,360
That's all.

246
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,120
Do you know

247
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,720
who Jiang Feng, Jiang Beizun really is?

248
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,320
The Liu family's son-in-law.

249
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,240
All people in Jiangcheng knows.

250
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,600
The Liu family's son-in-law?

251
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,840
That was just a temporary measure
to save his life back then.

252
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,360
Jiang Feng's true identity

253
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,880
is the young master
of the Jiang family in Yandu,

254
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,120
one of the survivors
of the Battle of Jiazi years ago.

255
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,600
Let's make a deal.

256
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,000
Don't you want revenge?

257
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,360
I'll give you that chance.
