12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,880
Jiang Beizun?

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,480
I've dealt with many cultivators,

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,080
but I've never heard
of the Jiang family.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,800
Could it be that you

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,160
are a new cultivator

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,280
just starting out?

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,920
This is...?

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,040
Let me introduce.

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,160
This is Master Guo, a guest

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,840
of Muhetang.

22
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,640
He is highly esteemed in our circle.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,640
He has many insights
on the path of cultivation.

24
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,640
Since Mr. Jiang is new here,

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,760
if you encounter any problems,

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,080
you might consult Master Guo for advice.

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,520
It will surely benefit

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,680
your cultivation path.

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:24,840
Great.

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,280
This is what I wanted.

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,240
Since you're satisfied,

32
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,520
let's discuss the price.

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,560
Thirty-six million.

34
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,560
How is it?

35
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,920
If you think it's too high,

36
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,200
we can discuss it further.

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:39,920
No need.

38
00:01:41,136 --> 00:01:42,180
Let's settle at this price.

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,920
Supreme Zijing Card?

40
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,480
I didn't expect

41
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,680
Mr. Jiang to have

42
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,280
this connection with the Lu family.

43
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,120
(Weird.)

44
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,400
(How did the Supreme Zijing Card
end up in his hands?)

45
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,920
(Could he be from the Lu family?)

46
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,120
Who's there?

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,280
You're indeed straightforward.

48
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
The Seven-Leaf Ganoderma

49
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,530
will be delivered
to your residence shortly.

50
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,200
This is the Muhe Order.

51
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,480
When you visit again,

52
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,400
show the Muhe Order,

53
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,480
and someone
will guide you to the back hall.

54
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:43,216
(Muhetang)

55
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,840
Hong Li, title of Lishui Blade.

56
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
What do you mean by this?

57
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,840
Don't you know that I'm
doing business with a valued guest?

58
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,968
Not only did you
barge into my territory,

59
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,240
but you even dare to act.

60
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,280
Do you intend to break the rules?

61
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,000
Ms. Murong, no offense.

62
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,960
I came here

63
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,440
just to kill someone.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,120
I'll leave soon.

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,080
That's right.

66
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,840
This matter
has nothing to do with Muhetang.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,180
The rules of the martial world
will be handled as such.

68
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,280
Once the matter is settled,

69
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,240
I'll personally apologize to you.

70
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,400
Jiang!

71
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Today is the day you die!

72
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,000
You've come at the right time.

73
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,840
I was planning

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,840
to find you tomorrow,

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,400
but you delivered yourself to me.

76
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,120
Good.

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,400
That saves me some trouble.

78
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,600
Still trying to be defiant?

79
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,000
You don't even know you're about to die.

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,840
Do you know who this is beside me?

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,680
Hong Li!

82
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,840
Master Hong!

83
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,120
Just because you have some skills,

84
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,120
and you can act arrogantly?

85
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,560
Master Hong has long been famous.

86
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,120
He's an expert in the Mystic rank.

87
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
I invited him today

88
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,680
to make up for the situation
from that day.

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,440
Master Hong, you may act now.

90
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,120
Today I want to see him

91
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,080
stand in front of me and kneel down.

92
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,680
And plead for mercy and apologize.

93
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,440
No matter what grudges you have,

94
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,080
once you're in Muhetang,
you're a guest of us.

95
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,720
On Muhetang's grounds,

96
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,160
there has never been a fight.

97
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,000
It won't happen in the future either.

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,840
It's the rule!

99
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:10,160
(In this way,)

100
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,680
(I'll do Jiang Beizun a small favor.)

101
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:14,960
(If he has any connection
with the Lu family,)

102
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,720
(this favor)

103
00:04:16,064 --> 00:04:16,880
(is worth doing.)

104
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,600
Ms. Murong is right.

105
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,960
Muhetang never takes the initiative
to get involved in disputes,

106
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,400
but we won't

107
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,440
ignore provocations either.

108
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,840
As a guest of Muhetang,

109
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,240
with me here,

110
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,600
you guys can't fight anyone.

111
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,680
Is that so?

112
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,520
Guest?

113
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,800
You're just a lackey.

114
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,360
Others might give you some respect,

115
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,160
but I don't.

116
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,560
As a cultivator,

117
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,440
you keep sticking to your old ways.

118
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,120
You're no match for me.

119
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,680
Arrogant.

120
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,040
Today, let's compete with each other.

121
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,000
Hey, just kill yourself.

122
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
My blade strikes,

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,160
it always draws blood.

124
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,920
Today, you must die!

125
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,040
But with your cultivation and strength,

126
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,560
you're far from qualifying
to be a victim under my blade.

127
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,600
How about it?

128
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,720
I'll give you a chance
to sever your own meridians.

129
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,680
Is that so?

130
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,120
Just kill me.

131
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,600
Stop the nonsense.

132
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:40,544
(Muhetang)

133
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:40,920
Wait.

134
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,600
(Oh, no.)

135
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,280
What happened?

136
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,480
(The power has diminished...)

137
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,720
Why did the rain suddenly stop?

138
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:51,184
(Dealing with you)

139
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,480
(is more than enough for me.)

140
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,080
(Muhetang)

141
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,160
How is this possible?

142
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,680
I didn't even catch
the trajectory of his blade.

143
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,480
Such strength

144
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,000
is not something
an ordinary cultivator can achieve.

145
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,720
Could it be that Hong Li was too careless?

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,820
Underestimating him?

147
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,280
Master Guo,

148
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
if it were you,

149
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
just now...

150
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,680
If it were me,

151
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,360
I'd probably end up

152
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,000
in the same situation as Hong Li.

153
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,120
He is a master.

154
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,240
A true master.

155
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,920
This person is far from being
as simple as he seems.

156
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,920
I dare say,

157
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,720
his move just now

158
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,360
was not using his full strength.

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,400
Even Master Guo

160
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,240
has given such a high evaluation.

161
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,800
What exactly

162
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,360
is Jiang Beizun's background?

163
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,380
(Muhetang)

164
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,240
Master Hong!

165
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,360
Master Hong!

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,120
How could this happen?

167
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,920
Oh my god!

168
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,920
Impossible!

169
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,600
Mr. Jiang...

170
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,800
Oh, no. Master Jiang.

171
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,720
Master Jiang.

172
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,040
It's a misunderstanding.

173
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,680
Really?

174
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,840
You didn't say that just now.

175
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,600
You...

176
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,280
You want to kill me?

177
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,720
Alright then.

178
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,920
Jiang!

179
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,120
I was wrong today.

180
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,240
But I'm not a coward.

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,600
It's just a life!

182
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,440
Come on!

183
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,160
Do it!

184
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,280
I'm ready!

185
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,600
Get lost.

186
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:41,408
You're not worthy
of dying under my blade.

187
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,240
Mr. Jiang,

188
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,800
you've really impressed me.

189
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,920
Today, your grace

190
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,480
of sparing my life

191
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,800
will be...

192
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,120
Wait!

193
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,360
Tianxuan Dragon Ring?

194
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,800
You recognize this?

195
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,320
In Jiangcheng,

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,360
who would dare say
they don't know Tianxuan Dragon Ring?

197
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:12,880
Once this ring appears,

198
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,200
it can command
the entire underground world.

199
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,600
Well, Mr. Jiang.

200
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:20,200
I'm one of the underground world.

201
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,360
It's all a misunderstanding.

202
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,240
Oh no.

203
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:22,720
Jesus.

204
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,120
From now on,

205
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,440
I will certainly reform myself.

206
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,220
I won't disturb you any longer.

207
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,240
Later, I will visit you

208
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,240
to apologize.

209
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,320
Come on.

210
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,112
My legs are numb.

211
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,080
Help me up!

212
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,360
Drag Hong Li away for me.

213
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,000
Don't dirty Mr. Jiang's place.

214
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,080
Mr. Jiang,

215
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,240
