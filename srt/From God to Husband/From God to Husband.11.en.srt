12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,480
Grandpa!

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,520
Grandpa!

14
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,680
Grandpa, what's going on?

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,080
What did you do to Grandpa?

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,480
You ask me?

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,800
Who should I ask?

18
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,640
I want to know what's wrong with you.

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,800
Huh?

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,960
Most likely it's because of you,

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,440
the unfilial grandchild
who betrays their family.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,320
It's fine.

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll call the doctor right away.

24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,760
Dr. Lin, how is my grandpa?

25
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,120
Master Liu has been
working hard for years,

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,720
and his health has deteriorated.

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,360
He doesn't have much time left.

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,560
I'm afraid

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,760
it won't be long before...

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,440
Dr. Lin!

31
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:39,720
Chenfei,

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,040
how's it going?

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,480
The doctor said

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,760
Grandpa doesn't have much longer.

35
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,040
Grandpa really can't hold on
much longer this time.

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
What should we do?

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Actually, Grandpa might
not be beyond saving.

38
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,200
Really?

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,640
Chenfei, do you remember

40
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,680
I told you before
that I have some knowledge of medicine?

41
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,840
His current condition...

42
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,280
I might try to help with that.

43
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,760
Okay.

44
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:17,760
Okay.

45
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,336
Don't worry.

46
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,320
All right.

47
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,480
All right.

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,120
Don't be anxious.

49
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,760
How come I didn't know

50
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,096
that our family's useless
son-in-law learned medicine?

51
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,280
Liu Chenfei,

52
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,040
Grandpa doesn't have much time left.

53
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,560
You don't trust the doctor,

54
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,920
but you trust him?

55
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,760
Can't you just let Grandpa finish
his last journey peacefully?

56
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,400
Exactly.

57
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,400
A person who just talks nonsense

58
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,000
and knows nothing,

59
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,560
what can he possibly do?

60
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,680
Humph.

61
00:02:52,832 --> 00:02:53,872
It's a crucial matter.

62
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,680
I'll go prepare the medicine.

63
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,520
Chenfei, stay strong.

64
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,120
I believe I can save Grandpa.

65
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,840
Don't worry.

66
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,840
You guys, quickly get everything in place.

67
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,800
Hurry up.

68
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,840
Mother, what's going on?

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,080
What are you doing?

70
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,120
Liu Chenfei, you also know
Grandpa's condition.

71
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,560
I think we both

72
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,840
need to stop pretending
not to understand.

73
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,160
Chenfei.

74
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,960
Grandpa is still alive.

75
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,880
Why are you preparing for the funeral?

76
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,520
Do you even have a heart?

77
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Get out of here.

78
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:44,560
What do you know?

79
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,080
I'm being thorough.

80
00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:48,720
When Grandpa goes to the afterlife,

81
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,600
he will have to praise me

82
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,680
for handling things properly

83
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,840
and being a dutiful person.

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,560
Master Liu,

85
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,400
please take care of Master's affairs.

86
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,080
Mr. Liu, don't worry.

87
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
Since you invited me,

88
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,560
I will make sure
to satisfy the Liu family

89
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,160
with my rich reward.

90
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
In a moment, I'll perform

91
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,160
a profound ritual in the courtyard

92
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,680
to send off Master Liu.

93
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,400
Jiang Feng said

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,240
he could save Grandpa.

95
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,240
At least we still have a final hope.

96
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,280
Chenfei,

97
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,720
why is Jiang Feng nowhere to be seen
when there's an issue?

98
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,680
Why are you still blocking the way?

99
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,080
You're not helping.

100
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,680
You might as well go back inside.

101
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,440
Your elder brother has foresight.

102
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,000
The funeral arrangements
should be on the agenda now.

103
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,680
Otherwise,

104
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,960
we'll be in a panic.

105
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,520
What are you waiting for?

106
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,240
Hurry up and leave.

107
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,120
Go!

108
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,120
Mother...

109
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,800
Master Liu,

110
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,840
please proceed inside.

111
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,440
Okay.

112
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,240
You all, keep going.

113
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,680
Please.

114
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,160
Continue.

115
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,720
All right.

116
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,880
Everything  should be set up.

117
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Mother, let's go back.

118
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,560
Chenfei,

119
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,600
Jiang Feng always says
he knows medicine.

120
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,584
I've noticed he's been
acting mysteriously lately.

121
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,240
Maybe he really has a way.

122
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,920
This quack really has no bottom line.

123
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,800
Grandpa isn't dead yet,

124
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,130
and he's here to perform a ritual.

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,480
Despicable.

126
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,160
Jesus, Jiang Feng...

127
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,240
Shh.

128
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:38,720
He's been gone for so long
and hasn't returned.

129
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,200
Is he capable or not?

130
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,920
Forget it.

131
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
I didn't have high hopes for him anyway.

132
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,912
It's getting late.

133
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
You should go rest.

134
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,920
I'll stay with Grandpa.

135
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,920
Take care of yourself.

136
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,360
(Can Jiang Feng really save Grandpa?)

137
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,800
(Dear God,)

138
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,160
(if Grandpa really recovers,)

139
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,800
(I'm willing to sacrifice everything.)

140
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,840
(If Grandpa doesn't make it,)

141
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,240
(then)

142
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,280
(I'll really have no one to rely on.)

143
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,720
Where's my phone?

144
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,800
What's going on?

145
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,600
So mysterious.

146
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,040
There's nothing special about it.

147
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,360
Oh,

148
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,360
Thunder Technique?

149
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Jiang Feng is so boring.

150
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,480
Who believes in this stuff?

151
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,920
This is a master we paid a huge sum for.

152
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,000
It's different.

153
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,640
Just look at how professional he is.

154
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,000
Even if Master Liu
has a bit of resentment,

155
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,480
the master's ritual will disperse it.

156
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,600
The money is well spent.

157
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,000
Mother, you know what?

158
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,600
Master Liu only performs rituals
for top families.

159
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,560
Grandpa is fortunate
to be sent off by him.

160
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,600
This shows we, the younger generation,

161
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,920
have done our filial duty.

162
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,680
Yes.

163
00:07:51,312 --> 00:07:54,176
(Thunder Technique)

164
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,400
The sun and moon wax and wane.

165
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,920
And the stars align.

166
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,600
Heaven,

167
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,360
Earth,

168
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,600
Mystic,

169
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,800
and Yellow.

170
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,480
Break!

171
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,800
Humph.

172
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,360
What's going on?

173
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,120
This is the real thunder?

174
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,600
Master Liu!

175
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,400
Master Liu' soul

176
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,720
is coming for him!

177
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,800
He is coming!

178
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,040
It's here!

179
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,360
It's a coincidence.

180
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,160
Really!

181
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,240
I'm scared to death.

182
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,360
What is this?

183
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,360
Master Liu, protect us.

184
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,160
Come on.

185
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,360
Move the cauldron here.

186
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,120
Mr. Jiang really is extraordinary.

187
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,000
The cauldron needed

188
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
is so special.

189
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,600
Mr. Meng, I wonder if Mr. Jiang

190
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,120
could let us observe his alchemy process.

191
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,840
