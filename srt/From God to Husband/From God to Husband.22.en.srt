00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,220
(Adapted from "From God to Husband"
by Yueyingguxiangming)

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,980
=Episode 22=

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,400
(Muhetang)

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,200
Beizun, the Huang family

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,720
is using the pretext of a visit

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,320
to arrange a duel at the arena.

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,080
They call it a duel,

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,560
but they've mobilized
three grandmasters.

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,320
It's clearly a trap.

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,240
That's right.

20
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,000
At present,

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,640
this matter is known by everyone

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,640
in Jiangcheng and even Yandu.

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,000
Just the cultivators coming to watch

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,480
have already filled Jiangcheng.

25
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,000
Moreover,

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,120
with your past

27
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,360
dealings with the Huang family,

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,320
you'll have to fight tomorrow.

30
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,760
It seems like the world

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,640
is waiting for Huang Tianzong
to storm the city.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,640
They want to witness him stepping
over my dead body to claim supremacy.

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,720
They think it's reasonable.

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,560
Humph.

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,000
Aren't you afraid

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,760
of being caught in the crossfire?

37
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,400
Under a fallen nest,

38
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,640
how can there be unbroken eggs?

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,000
With the Huang family's
ruthless style,

40
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,560
if Mr. Jiang loses,

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,520
we might not escape disaster either.

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,720
Therefore, for tomorrow's battle,

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,480
if you have any needs,

44
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,280
Muhetang will spare no effort.

45
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,200
The Lu family will do the same.

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,040
Jiang...

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,480
Mr. Jiang,

48
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,320
if there is a battle tomorrow,

49
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,280
I'm willing to be at the forefront.

50
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,920
I have grievances
with the Huang family.

51
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,400
You don't need to get involved.

52
00:01:57,728 --> 00:01:59,840
The battle tomorrow
won't take place at the arena.

53
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,560
You don't need to go.

54
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:07,000
It's time to settle the score,

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,920
Huang Tianzong.

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,480
It's over.

57
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,640
Chenfei,

58
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,400
I just got Beizun as my brother-in-law.

59
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,920
And now he's going to fight.

60
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,040
Will our Liu family
also be finished soon?

61
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,000
Stop worrying.

62
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,840
Jiang Feng is confident.

63
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,920
He'll get through it safely tomorrow.

64
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,640
Chenfei, I know.

65
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,560
I definitely trust my brother-in-law.

66
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,480
But the Huang family's power

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,680
is too great.

68
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,760
Even if my brother-in-law is now

69
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,480
the top in Jiangcheng,

70
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,120
he still can't match
the top family in Yandu,

71
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,568
which has mobilized all its forces.

72
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,920
I heard

73
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,120
that Huang Tianzong has brought
three grandmasters with him.

74
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,120
The disparity
between the two sides is immense.

75
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,800
Instead of dwelling on these worries,

76
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,000
you should think of a solution.

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,160
For years,

78
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,680
Jiang Feng has been
shouldering everything alone.

79
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,680
As his wife,

80
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,000
how could I just stand by?

81
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,880
Chenfei, you're not angry
with him anymore?

82
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,240
When he was at his
most distressed and upset,

83
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,360
I couldn't help him.

84
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,520
I didn't even understand him.

85
00:03:17,856 --> 00:03:19,840
How could I have any right
to be angry with him?

86
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,880
It's just that I'm still struggling
with my own feelings.

87
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,440
That's true.

88
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,600
If it were me,

89
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,680
with an ordinary husband by my side,

90
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,120
suddenly turning into a hero

91
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,000
that everyone admires,

92
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,120
I'd probably feel the same way.

93
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,000
This is not the time
for such thoughts.

94
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Let's focus on what to do tomorrow.

95
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,520
Yong Master Huang, your family

96
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,870
is rich and you're talented,

97
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,840
strict with yourself and works diligently.

98
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,160
Compared to you,

99
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:57,280
I spent the first half
of my life playing around.

100
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,560
I am truly ashamed.

101
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,160
To reach the top of the mountain,

102
00:04:04,528 --> 00:04:05,560
there is only one path.

103
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,560
The path of working harder
than everyone else.

104
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,520
You think that being

105
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,280
the young master of Yandu's top family

106
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,240
is an easy job?

107
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,160
You're right.

108
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
It's beneficial for my life.

109
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,880
By the way,

110
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,840
this time,

111
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,840
even though there are
three grandmasters present,

112
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,280
Jiang Feng's strength is still formidable.

113
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,400
In case of an emergency,

114
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,840
we should still
prepare an escape plan.

115
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,800
Let me hear it.

116
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,600
You are unaware,

117
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,280
but Jiang Feng's biggest weakness

118
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,120
is his wife,

119
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,400
Liu Chenfei.

120
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,400
Okay.

121
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,440
I'll leave this matter to you.

122
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,000
If we can eliminate him tomorrow,

123
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,120
I'll remember your contribution.

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,800
Okay.

125
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,240
Liu Qingtian,

126
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,480
are you interested in making a deal?

127
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,560
Chenfei, Jiang Feng
went alone and quietly.

128
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,160
He didn't want you to worry.

129
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,600
If we go,

130
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,720
won't we just cause him more trouble?

131
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,360
I understand that.

132
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
But with Jiang Feng in such danger,

133
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,240
as his wife,

134
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,920
how can I just wait at home?

135
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,240
No matter what happens today,

136
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,920
I will stay by his side.

137
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,360
Chenfei!

138
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,160
Chenfei!

139
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,400
Wait!

140
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,360
You can't go!

141
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,160
Move aside.

142
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,770
Kong Mingzhe and the Huang family
are plotting to capture you.

143
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,592
They plan to use you
to threaten Jiang Feng.

144
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,240
Until Jiang Feng's matter is settled,

145
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,040
you should stay home safely.

146
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,360
Don't go anywhere.

147
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,160
Qingtian, you...

148
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,920
Why are you suddenly like this...?

149
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,840
This isn't the time
for such discussions.

150
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,600
I've pretended to agree with
Kong Mingzhe to capture you.

151
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,160
If you really care about Jiang Feng,

152
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,920
you should ensure
your own safety first.

153
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,480
I still need to go.

154
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,240
No matter what happens,

155
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,560
I will live and die with Jiang Feng.

156
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,160
Since you're so determined,

157
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,120
I'll notify the Lu family.

158
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,120
They will protect you.

159
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,480
Let's go.

160
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,720
Qingtian, wait...

161
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,040
Why are you going too?

162
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,000
These skilled fighters

163
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
won't make a big show

164
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,120
like Kong Tianhai.

165
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,360
They're in a place

166
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:46,240
where ordinary people can't find them.

167
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,160
Come with me.

168
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,680
Qingtian, why the rush?

169
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,240
Take her away!

170
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,040
Jiang Beizun?

171
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,840
I didn't expect

172
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,800
that the Jiang family's remnant
who escaped from Yandu back then

173
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,280
would now become

174
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,600
the revered Beizun.

175
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,400
How unpredictable life is.

176
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,160
But I didn't expect

177
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,040
that you'd dare seek death.

178
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,360
If I don't come,

179
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,120
how would you die?

180
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,400
Arrogant.

181
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,920
Jiang Beizun,

182
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,840
I've heard

183
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,720
you've mastered lightning techniques.

184
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,720
Today, the three of us would like
to experience them.

185
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,280
With your skills,

186
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,040
you're far from being able to teach me.

187
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,720
You want to die!

188
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,920
Please.

189
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,040
Enter meditation.

190
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,280
(We've ended up in)

191
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,240
(Jiang Beizun's illusion.)

192
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,840
(Where is this place?)

193
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,280
(It's full of spiritual energy.)

194
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,000
(An immortal realm?)

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,280
(He's here.)

196
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,480
(Just a distant glace...)

197
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,360
(How's it possible?)

198
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,680
(The pressure is terrifying.)

199
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,240
How can this be?

200
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,120
No one can survive

201
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,440
the Blood Ghost Illusion.

202
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,080
Jiang Feng!

203
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,640
I will make you regret

204
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,240
ever being born into this world.

205
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,768
(Mausoleum of Fairy)

206
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,080
Let me go.

207
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
Let go!

208
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
What have you done to Jiang Feng?

209
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,480
Young Master, we got her.

210
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,720
Great.

211
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,000
You didn't disappoint me.

212
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,240
Young Master,

213
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,600
it's an honor to be valued by you.

214
00:09:39,776 --> 00:09:41,184
As long as you give the order,

215
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,000
I will go through fire and water

216
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,960
without hesitation.

217
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,200
Okay.

218
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,240
Then I'll use your last bit of value.

219
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,480
What?

220
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,320
Your last bit of value

221
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,120
is to use your body

222
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,480
to open the Blood Ghost Illusion.

223
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,640
Where is this place?

224
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,840
You are a great gift
I prepared for Jiang Feng.

225
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,960
Jiang Feng!

226
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,720
How are you?

227
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,520
Jiang Feng!

228
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,360
Jiang Feng!

229
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,120
Jiang Feng!

230
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,440
Jiang Feng,

231
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,240
if you want to get out,

232
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,520
you must kill her.

233
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,080
Chenfei!

234
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,600
Chenfei!

235
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Don't go in!

236
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,240
This is the Blood Ghost Illusion,

237
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,120
created by ten ancient masters
four hundred years ago.

238
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,120
I didn't expect such a forbidden object

239
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,080
to fall into the hands
of the Huang family.

240
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Once you enter,

241
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,640
there's no way to come out.

242
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,200
You seem to be trembling.

243
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,240
Let me guess.

244
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,240
You're scared.

245
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,720
This gift is quite cruel, isn't it?

246
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,840
After all, he can only get out

247
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,760
by killing you.

248
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,360
Are you ready to watch

249
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
the person you love

250
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,240
kill you with his own hands?

251
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,360
Yes.

252
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,120
I'm very scared.

253
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,520
I'm afraid Jiang Feng

254
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,360
won't have the heart to kill me.

255
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,000
Jiang Feng!

256
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,360
Jiang Feng,

257
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
kill me!

258
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,760
Jiang Feng.

259
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,360
Jiang Feng.

260
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,480
Jiang Beizun,

261
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,440
I'm curious how will you choose?

262
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,760
Jiang Feng!

263
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
Chenfei, don't worry.

264
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,168
I've spent a thousand years cultivating.

265
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,520
Now I'm back to be your Jiang Feng.

266
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,960
What cultivation?

267
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,520
Immortal Emperor?

268
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,120
Even Jiang Beizun?

269
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,360
I don't care.

270
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,840
My sword!

271
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,360
Break!

272
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,240
No!

273
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:40,320
He's trying to forcibly
break the illusion.

274
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,880
Impossible!

275
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:44,000
It's a known fact
that no one can forcibly

276
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,600
break the illusion from within.

277
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,480
Could it be that...

278
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,240
Master Jiang

279
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,360
plans to use
all his cultivation as a price,

280
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,840
to open the heavens

281
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,480
with his own strength!

282
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,080
For a woman?

283
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,528
You're going to give up
all your cultivation?

284
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,720
How could you do that?

285
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,600
(Jiang Feng!)

286
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,360
Jiang Feng!

287
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,720
Jiang Feng!

288
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,360
Jiang Feng!

289
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,600
Stop!

290
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,480
Jiang Feng!

291
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
Jiang Feng!

292
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,520
Jiang Feng,

293
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,880
if my sacrifice will truly help,

294
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,600
then I'm willing.

295
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
During this time,

296
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I've seen your true heart

297
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,240
and recognized my own feelings.

298
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,000
Jiang Feng!

299
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,240
Hurry up!

300
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,520
Jiang Feng, stop it!

301
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,480
There must be another way!

302
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,200
Jiang Feng!

303
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,520
Chenfei!

304
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,600
Chenfei!

305
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,720
Chenfei!

306
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,480
I'm no long going to be

307
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,120
Nine Extremes Immortal Emperor!

308
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,000
It's settled!

309
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,240
Jiang Feng!

310
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,720
Jiang Feng!

311
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,320
Ah!

312
00:14:26,224 --> 00:14:27,240
Jiang Feng.

313
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,080
Huang Tianzong,

314
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,120
you lost.

315
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,320
Don't come near.

316
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,840
You're a madman!

317
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,760
You're insane!

318
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,600
Stop there!

319
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,360
I'm telling you,

320
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,480
I am the true young master
of the world's top family.

321
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,720
I am the new king

322
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,120
unifying all cultivators under one rule.

323
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,080
I'm telling you!

324
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,440
I'm that king!

325
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,760
I make the call!

326
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,120
How could you possibly come out?

327
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,240
I am the ruler of this world.

328
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,440
You cannot escape.

329
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,840
You can't possibly escape!

330
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,840
The outcome is decided.

331
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,640
It's fine.

332
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,200
I'm still alive.

333
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,600
I'm okay.

334
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,320
Jiang Feng.

335
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,600
Chenfei, now I'm back.

336
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,480
There's no more Jiang Beizun.

337
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,360
No more Nine Extremes Immortal Emperor.

338
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,520
I'm only your husband,

339
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,720
