00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,220
(Adapted from "From God to Husband"
by Yueyingguxiangming)

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,980
=Episode 17=

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,120
Senior Jiang,

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,848
(Murong's Side Yard)
you're at leisure.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,520
You just did something

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,640
earth-shattering,

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,480
and now you're tending

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,736
to these flowers and plants.

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,560
It's truly remarkable.

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,960
What brings you here today?

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,040
I'm ashamed to say.

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,480
I've heard that Hongling
has been neglectful.

22
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,480
So today, I came

23
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,000
to apologize in person.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,960
No need to apologize.

25
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,320
I won't hold it against you.

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,200
The flowers in the yard are overgrown,

27
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,640
so I need to tend to them.

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,640
Senior Jiang,

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,120
you do have a refined taste.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,272
I've heard about the Kong family.

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,720
Is it true that you plan
to accept their invitation?

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,840
Why not?

33
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,960
If the Kong family wants to talk,

34
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,760
then I'll follow them.

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,000
I need to settle
some old scores with them.

36
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,000
I hope the day after tomorrow,

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,480
the Kong family won't be too surprised.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,400
Kong Mingzhe from the Kong family

39
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,400
requests to see Senior Jiang Beizun.

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,400
Master Lu?

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,840
Jiang Feng?

42
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,040
Why are you here?

43
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,480
I see.

44
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,280
You must be here

45
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,000
to win over that esteemed senior.

46
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,400
I must say, people of lower status

47
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,560
are like you.

48
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,200
Your attire matches your demeanor.

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,000
However,

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,280
with your humble status,

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,984
no matter how much you curry favor,

52
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,640
others won't even

53
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,680
spare you a glance.

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
Master Lu...

55
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,200
Forgive my rudeness.

56
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,920
At your age, you're playing tricks.

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,120
Aren't you afraid that people will

58
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,200
laugh at the Lu family?

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,400
Outrageous!

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,840
Kong Mingzhe,

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,040
do you know who you're talking to?

62
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,200
I know.

63
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,490
You're the head of the Lu family.

64
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,200
Out of respect for your age,

65
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,560
I'll call you Master Lu.

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,680
But if I were less polite,

67
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,584
I'd remind you kindly that the Lu family

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,200
is already a thing of the past.

69
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,680
My Kong family

70
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,120
has already visited the big figure
behind this villa

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,400
as our backer.

72
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,840
My father will host a banquet

73
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,568
to acknowledge Jiang Beizun
as his master.

74
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,000
By then,

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,240
in Jiangcheng,

76
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,120
it will be my Kong family who rules,

77
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,600
not your Lu family.

78
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,600
Your father has been scheming for years,

79
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,720
even faking his death to deceive others.

80
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,560
Now, he is impatient, huh?

81
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,720
With Beizun's reappearance,

82
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,600
my father will surely take the lead

83
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
and invite him out.

84
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,720
But Master Lu, you really are senile,

85
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,560
hanging out with a son-in-law
of the Liu family all day.

86
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,400
This man is clearly a fraud.

87
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,520
Only you are kept in the dark.

88
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,120
Forget it.

89
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,800
I have important things to do.

90
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,960
Move aside quickly.

91
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,680
Kong Mingzhe from the Kong family,

92
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,776
by the order of my father,

93
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:38,096
specially sends
the apprenticeship invitation.

94
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,600
My father, Kong Tianhai,

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
holds a ceremony
to acknowledge you as his master.

96
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
We hope you,

97
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,720
in your busy schedule, can attend.

98
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,000
The grand ceremony

99
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,144
hopes that you can grace us
with your presence.

100
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,720
A mere son-in-law

101
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,280
dares to sneak
into the senior's courtyard?

102
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,560
Ridiculous.

103
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,120
On the day after tomorrow,

104
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,560
when he arrives at the grand ceremony

105
00:04:19,744 --> 00:04:20,960
and discovers that Jiang Beizun

106
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,000
is actually you, Jiang Feng,

107
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,440
I wonder how he will feel.

108
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,520
Mr. Jiang is here!

109
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,280
Greet him!

110
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,800
Greetings, Mr. Jiang.

111
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,160
You're totally senseless.

112
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,640
Jiang, the Kong family's matter
has been arranged.

113
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,160
The ceremony
the day after tomorrow

114
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,800
will be held at this Longting Villa.

115
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,160
The facilities here are complete.

116
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,000
You can rest for a while.

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,728
If you need anything,
just call me anytime.

118
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,560
You do know how
to consider the situation.

119
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,480
Not bad.

120
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,560
Jiang, it is an honor to serve

121
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,840
as your scout.

122
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,520
It is truly an honor!

123
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:10,040
Second Uncle. Third Uncle.

124
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,600
Come in.

125
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,160
Today,

126
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,120
I specifically called you all here

127
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,720
to discuss together the matter

128
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,840
of the apprenticeship ceremony
the day after tomorrow.

129
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,040
Is everyone here?

130
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,720
Well,

131
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,560
I never imagined

132
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,120
that our Liu family

133
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,600
would be so fortunate

134
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,280
to personally arrange

135
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,032
the Kong family's
apprenticeship ceremony.

136
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,720
That's right.

137
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,000
All of this,

138
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,560
we must thank Young Master Kong.

139
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,240
Without his arrangements,

140
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,560
how could our family have such a chance

141
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,840
to bring honor to our ancestors?

142
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,680
Right.

143
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,480
Besides,

144
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,280
I heard Master Jiang Beizun

145
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,800
single-handedly

146
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,928
brought down the Hong family

147
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,720
and ascended to the top of Jiangcheng.

148
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,360
Young Master Kong

149
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,400
can associate with such a high-ranking figure.

150
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,920
Well,

151
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,000
how could he not succeed?

152
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,560
Everything is just beginning.

153
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,400
Since today

154
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,920
everyone is here,

155
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,800
I will announce a major event.

156
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,072
The day after tomorrow,

157
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,840
at my father's apprenticeship ceremony,

158
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,360
I'll invite all of you to witness

159
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,400
together with Master Jiang Beizun

160
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,400
the moment when I marry Chenfei.

161
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,480
Great!

162
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,030
This is the apprenticeship invitation.

163
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,800
Everyone present has one.

164
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,400
Good!

165
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,120
Great!

166
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,280
Well,

167
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,480
this invitation

168
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,480
on the black market

169
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,920
is already being sold for three million.

170
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,800
The Kong family is truly generous to us.

171
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,360
With the ceremony approaching,

172
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,160
many influential people

173
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,240
are fighting to get in.

174
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,720
I didn't expect

175
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,560
that you're so generous.

176
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,120
Yes.

177
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,360
I think this marriage is a good match.

178
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:53,720
Ha ha ha.

179
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,120
Since that's the case,

180
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,360
the day after tomorrow

181
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,240
at my father's apprenticeship ceremony,

182
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
I can meet you guys.

183
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,040
Great!

184
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,160
Madam Liu, congratulate you in advance

185
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,040
for finding such a great son-in-law.

186
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,376
Well, thank you.

187
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Chenfei!

188
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,840
Did you hear

189
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,600
that Second Uncle and Third Uncle

190
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,720
are going to attend
the apprenticeship ceremony.

191
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,360
I think Kong Mingzhe

192
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,160
must have ulterior motives.

193
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,160
Chenfei, you seem worried.

194
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,560
The ceremony is the day after tomorrow.

195
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,240
I am thinking,

196
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,240
if Kong Mingzhe
causes trouble on the spot

197
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
and proposes in front
of that important figure,

198
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,600
what should I do?

199
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,920
After all,

200
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,400
when Grandpa was gravely ill,

201
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,600
they did such outrageous things.

202
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,000
I really fear something might happen.

203
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,160
Perhaps, we can ask Jiang Feng for help.

204
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,720
I always feel

205
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,280
he isn't as simple as he appears.

206
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,600
Jiang Feng is impulsive by nature.

207
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,920
Let's not make things difficult for him.

208
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,040
Now,

209
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,560
he has made some progress,

210
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,800
but in front of the Kong family

211
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,160
and that important figure,

212
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,160
it's like an ant trying to stop a cart.

213
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,280
That's true.

214
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,040
I heard that important figure

215
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,600
has already moved into Longting Villa.

216
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,360
Anyway, the ceremony is
the day after tomorrow.

217
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,720
How about we sneak in early

218
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,000
and ask that figure for a favor?

219
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,840
Maybe there's a way.

220
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,360
Isn't that a bit inappropriate?

221
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,400
After all,

222
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,400
we don't know

223
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,480
what kind of person
that important figure is.

224
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,360
What if he doesn't like being disturbed?

225
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,720
You won't know unless you try.

226
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,840
Hello.

227
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,680
Excuse me,

228
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,680
I'd like to ask which room is

229
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,000
Senior Beizun staying,

230
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,600
who will host the ceremony tomorrow?

231
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,976
We have urgent business
and wish to see him.

232
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,712
We cannot disclose the location
of his suite for privacy reasons.

233
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
We're sorry.

234
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,920
However...

235
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,600
Chenfei, let me handle this.

236
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,720
We're here with very important matters.

237
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,840
If your villa's obstruction

238
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,120
causes any problems,

239
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,960
can you take responsibility?

240
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,192
Please, don't make things
difficult for me.

241
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,600
How about this?

242
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,720
We won't make things hard for you.

243
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,000
Please inform Senior Beizun

244
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,640
that Liu Chenfei from the Liu family

245
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,720
requests an audience.

246
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,360
If he declines,

247
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,840
we will leave immediately.

248
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,120
Alright.

249
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:26,320
I will pass on the message.

250
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,360
Chenfei.

251
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,840
Well, about your words...

252
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,880
If that important figure

253
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,240
refuses us, what then?

254
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,120
If we are rejected,

255
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,600
there's nothing we can do about it.

256
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We'll have to think of another way.

257
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,360
All right.

258
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,600
Sir, there are two ladies outside
requesting to see you.

259
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,312
One of them claimed to be Liu Chenfei.

260
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,000
Chenfei?

261
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,240
Let them in.

262
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,480
Yes, sir.
