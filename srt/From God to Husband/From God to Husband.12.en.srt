(Adapted from "From God to Husband"
by Yueyingguxiangming)

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,980
=Episode 12=

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,664
For us martial artists,

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,064
if we can use one kind
of inferno for alchemy,

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,840
we are considered highly talented.

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,320
But Mr. Jiang can effortlessly
control three kinds of inferno.

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,400
It truly puts us to shame.

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,360
Now we understand

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,600
why Mr. Jiang needs such a special

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,320
alchemy cauldron.

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,320
If it were an ordinary cauldron,

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,760
how could it control three types
of inferno simultaneously for alchemy?

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
What happened today

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,880
must not be disclosed to anyone.

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,280
If outsiders knew

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,120
Mr. Jiang has such power,

26
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,360
they would be frightened and uneasy.

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,040
Yes, Mr. Meng.

28
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,840
(Seven-Leaf Ganoderma.)

29
00:01:38,496 --> 00:01:41,370
(Muhetang)

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,120
Why is the thunder without rain so abrupt?

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,760
Master Guo,

32
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,760
could it be the work of a mysterious master?

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,400
Ms. Murong, you worry too much.

34
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,480
As cultivators,

35
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,840
we train our body and mind.

36
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,200
No matter how powerful,

37
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,200
no master can achieve this.

38
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,040
This is beyond the Mystic rank,

39
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,840
and even the Earth rank.

40
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,920
The thunder just now,

41
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,040
was purely a weather phenomenon.

42
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,696
It has nothing to do with people.

43
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:21,680
(Muhetang)

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,840
I was thinking,

45
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,760
recently, Jiangcheng's situation

46
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,680
is becoming increasingly unstable.

47
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,120
First, a mysterious person appeared,

48
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,640
then Kong Tianhai from the Kong family

49
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,040
faked his death and returned,

50
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,128
holding a grand banquet,

51
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,760
and befriending Jiang Beizun.

52
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,000
It's really a sign
of an impending storm.

53
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,000
Although the conditions
were rudimentary,

54
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,120
fortunately, it still
worked out in the end.

55
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,000
With this Yuan Cultivation Pill,

56
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,560
as long as Master Liu
has one breath left,

57
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,000
he can revive on the spot.

58
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,160
Extending his life
by ten years is not a problem.

59
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:14,840
Come on.

60
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,000
Move these two.

61
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,800
Over there.

62
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,400
Go.

63
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,440
Mother, where should we put this?

64
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,560
Hey, put it here.

65
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,120
Here.

66
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,160
That's right.

67
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,000
Great.

68
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,600
What do you all take Grandpa for?

69
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,000
Chenfei,

70
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
why are your eyes so red?

71
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,590
Did you cry too much
last night and didn't sleep well?

72
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,560
But I have to remind you,

73
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,880
you'd better put on some makeup.

74
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,120
Soon,

75
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,360
there will be good news coming.

76
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
What good news?

77
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,120
Liu Qingtian,

78
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,960
Grandpa is still critically ill!

79
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,416
What good news could there be?

80
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,880
Good news.

81
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,000
A great joyous event.

82
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,560
Chenfei,

83
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,680
you are about to get married.

84
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,400
Get married?

85
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,160
Mother, do you know what you're saying?

86
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,560
Yesterday,

87
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,840
you prepared for Grandpa's funeral.

88
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,680
Today, the house is decorated in red?

89
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,000
Is this still a home?

90
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,840
Why wouldn't it be?

91
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,656
Yesterday, if we didn't quickly
handle the funeral arrangements,

92
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,680
how could we have a wedding today?

93
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,280
What's done is done.

94
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,000
Don't think Grandpa
can protect you anymore.

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,240
From now on,
when you're in the Kong family,

96
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,380
you'll be wealthy and noble.

97
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,280
Don't forget about me and your brother.

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,680
Mother!

99
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,960
How long will you continue
to follow Liu Qingtian and mess around?

100
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,850
It's okay, Mother.

101
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:47,296
Let's see how things are over there.

102
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,840
Grandpa has just fallen critically ill,

103
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,240
and you are already
rushing me to remarry?

104
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,040
For so many years,

105
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,920
I have worked hard for the Liu family,

106
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,600
and supported the family by myself.

107
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,720
In your eyes and hearts,

108
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,560
besides money and power,

109
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,000
what else is there?

110
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,600
Do you even consider me family?

111
00:05:17,744 --> 00:05:18,160
Over here.

112
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,720
Put this here.

113
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,920
And this one.

114
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,470
My husband disappeared,
and you forced me to remarry,

115
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,270
The family had crisis,
and you forced me to remarry.

116
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,460
Now Grandpa is ill, and you still
force me to remarry!

117
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,160
In your eyes,

118
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,280
I am just a...

119
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,040
All right.

120
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,360
I'm an item to exchange for benefits.

121
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,600
Do you even consider me family?

122
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,920
Come on.

123
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,240
In your hearts, what else is there
besides money and power?

124
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,360
I am like a clearly priced item for you.

125
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,240
For you, and for Liu Qingtian,

126
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,840
to exchange for benefits
again and again.

127
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,680
You know what?

128
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,160
I have had enough!

129
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,240
There will be no wedding
in this family today.

130
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,360
I will not get married.

131
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,840
There will not be
such absurd things happening.

132
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,240
I don't have such
ridiculous family members like you.

133
00:06:06,592 --> 00:06:07,600
Is there anything missing?

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,800
Kong Mingzhe of the Kong family

135
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,000
is here to propose to Miss Liu.

136
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,600
Kong Mingzhe of the Kong family

137
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,280
is here to propose to Miss Liu.

138
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,600
My good son-in-law,

139
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,360
you could have just come yourself.

140
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,240
Why bring so many things?

141
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,720
Come, put them here.

142
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,432
Young Master Kong,

143
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,840
please sit.

144
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,240
What's going on?

145
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,800
On such a joyous day,

146
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,400
who made my bride unhappy?

147
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,800
Qingtian, how did you handle things?

148
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
In this house,

149
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,600
why is there still so much white?

150
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,040
It's really unlucky.

151
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,680
Quickly remove them!

152
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:04,920
Come on.

153
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,160
Move them now!

154
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,720
Right now.

155
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,800
Hurry up!

156
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,920
Take them all away.

157
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,480
I told you,

158
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,680
in this family,

159
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,920
there will be no wedding today.

160
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,560
I will not marry you, Kong Mingzhe.

161
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,400
This is my home.

162
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,000
Even if I die...

163
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,120
Stop there!

164
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Calm down, Chenfei.

165
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,400
Chenfei, I'm telling you.

166
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,600
Today, you will marry

167
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,880
whether you want to or not.

168
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,680
Do you think there is still anyone

169
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,120
who will protect your stubbornness?

170
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,280
Chenfei!

171
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,920
Grandpa...

172
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,160
Grandpa is...

173
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:20,920
Chenfei.

174
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,160
Grandpa's death is already certain.

175
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,160
Why waste time making
Young Master Kong wait?

176
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,240
Can't you tell

177
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,480
what's more important?

178
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,600
Alright, stop wasting time.

179
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,504
Quickly have Chen Fei
change into the wedding dress.

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,720
Mother!

181
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,000
Qingtian!

182
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,040
Do you still have any conscience?

183
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,720
Didn't you hear?

184
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,720
Grandpa, he...

185
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,720
You child...

186
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,040
What are you talking about?

187
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,160
Stop talking about Grandpa.

188
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
Get up quickly.

189
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,680
Don't miss...

190
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,720
What are you doing?

191
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
Put on the dress.

192
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Hurry up! Get up!

193
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:09,880
You!

194
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,520
I'm still here.

195
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,840
How dare you force her to remarry?

196
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,640
Jiang Feng,

197
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,880
stop pretending to be noble.

198
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,240
Are you okay?

199
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,600
Master Liu treats you as a person.

200
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,480
We are not so easily fooled.

201
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,360
Young Master Kong's
wedding car has arrived.

202
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,120
Today, if you dare to ruin
the Liu family's big event again,

203
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,760
and make Young Master Kong angry,

204
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,600
I think your life will be in danger.

205
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,840
How dare you!

206
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,120
Regardless of whether
Chenfei wants to remarry,

207
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,240
who does Kong Mingzhe think he is?

208
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,880
I just didn't bother
dealing with him before.

209
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,000
You are forcing her in this way,

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,520
and trying to make things irreversible

211
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
to finalize everything.

212
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,240
If Master Liu really dies,

213
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,216
I think the Liu family
will surely fall apart sooner or later.

214
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,600
Chenfei, don't worry.

215
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:03,680
As long as I'm here,

216
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,480
Grandpa will be fine.

217
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,520
Well said.

218
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,440
Listen to him.

219
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,480
What kind of son-in-law

220
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,960
has such confidence?

221
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,440
Jiang Feng,

222
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,600
is there something wrong with your mind?

223
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,120
In the entire Liu family,

224
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,320
only Master Liu supports you.

225
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,120
And now that
he is hanging by a thread.

226
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
Do you think at this crucial moment,

227
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,904
anyone else can stop the marriage
between the Kong and Liu families?

228
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,480
You're overestimating your abilities.

229
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,480
Who said Master Liu is in danger?

230
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,440
Are you so sure that I can't save him?

231
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,480
(Master Liu's body functions
have deteriorated greatly.)

232
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,640
(Now he has only one last breath left.)

233
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,016
(He should be nourished
with true energy)

234
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,440
(to nourish his internal organs.)

235
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,960
Oh dear,

236
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,240
Master Liu's condition

237
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,000
is worse than I imagined.

238
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,200
Even if a god came,

239
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,480
he'd shake his head and try to save him.

240
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,600
Playing tricks.

241
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,600
Who knows if these so-called elixirs

242
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,320
are actually poisons?

243
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
Do you want Grandpa
to suffer one more time

244
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,600
before he dies?

245
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Be quiet.

246
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,760
Hey.

247
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,600
Alas, Qingtian.

248
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,120
Let him lose.

249
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,600
If he loses convincingly,

250
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,320
he won't cause any more trouble.

251
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,120
(That's enough.)

252
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,440
Jiang Feng,

253
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,120
what did you do to Grandpa?

254
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,760
Alright.

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,720
It's done?

256
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,600
It's that simple?

257
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,320
I told you,

258
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,360
for Master Liu's condition,

259
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,760
even a god couldn't help.

260
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,720
So many doctors
from big hospitals couldn't save him.

261
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,320
And he still wants to try?

262
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,760
It's just wasting time,

263
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,520
and torturing a dying person.

264
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,240
Grandpa might have had one last breath.

265
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,840
But after all this,

266
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,360
I guess even that breath is gone.

267
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,080
I think we should prepare.

268
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,720
After the engagement
between the Kong and Liu families,

269
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,720
we should find a good burial place.

270
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,880
I thought he was so capable,

271
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,600
but it's just this?

272
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,440
Ha ha ha.

273
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,840
Jiang Feng,

274
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,600
you really impressed us!

275
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,120
Mother, this is unlucky.

276
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,872
Let's go out first.

277
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,240
Let's go.

278
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,200
