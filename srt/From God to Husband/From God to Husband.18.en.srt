=Episode 18=

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,880
That important figure
is currently in seclusion

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,960
and cannot be disturbed.

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,640
Our Longting Villa

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,080
holds that figure in high regard.

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,960
Please, when you meet with him later,

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,160
keep your voices down

18
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,800
and make your visit brief.

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,000
Senior Beizun, they've arrived.

20
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,800
I'm Liu Chenfei from the Liu family.

21
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:01,600
I'm Liu Rourou from the Liu family.

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,000
- Greetings, Senior Beizun.
- Greetings, Senior Beizun.

23
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,320
We apologize for the intrusion.

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,680
Please don't take offense.

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,640
I'm here to ask a favor.

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,640
At tomorrow's apprenticeship
ceremony of the Kong family,

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,360
Kong Mingzhe

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,920
might propose a marriage alliance

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,240
between our families
in front of all Jiangcheng.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,600
But I'm already married,

31
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,120
and have my heart set on someone else.

32
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,720
Therefore...

33
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,640
So...

34
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,360
Well...

35
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,920
Chenfei, let me do this.

36
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,760
Senior Beizun,

37
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,480
my sister doesn't like
Kong Mingzhe at all.

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,560
Even though my brother-in-law
lacks wealth and power,

39
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,920
he is devoted to my sister.

40
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,640
You wouldn't know it,
but Kong Mingzhe...

41
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,760
Rourou!

42
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,920
Well, I'm telling the truth.

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,200
Senior, if Kong Mingzhe makes such a proposal

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,040
at the ceremony tomorrow,

45
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,280
please do not agree to it.

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,760
Do it for my sister's sake, please.

47
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,480
Rourou, stop it.

48
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,040
Senior, my younger sister is still young.

49
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,840
Please don't take her words to heart.

50
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
I know

51
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,480
this request is indeed a bit rude.

52
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,560
And I know my position is humble.

53
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,400
So if it causes you any inconvenience...

54
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,560
Why not?

55
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,480
Senior,

56
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,200
does this mean you agree?

57
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,920
Chenfei, he has really agreed!

58
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,320
Well,

59
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,040
thank you, Senior Beizun.

60
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
In that case,

61
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,280
we will take our leave now.

62
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,360
We won't disturb
your practice any longer.

63
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,840
Oppose the marriage alliance?

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Chenfei, don't worry.

65
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,720
Tomorrow,

66
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,080
I will surely eradicate the Kong family

67
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,000
and remove them completely.

68
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,680
Rourou,

69
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,120
you were really bold just now.

70
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,680
You kept disrespecting
the Kong family in front

71
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,720
of that important figure.

72
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,720
Did you ever think

73
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,840
the Kong family will
host the ceremony tomorrow?

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,080
And it's an apprenticeship ceremony.

75
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,240
Considering this,

76
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,768
the Kong family's relationship
with that figure must be close.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Luckily, Senior Beizun
has a good temperament.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,560
Otherwise...

79
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
Well, Chenfei,

80
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,560
it worked out, didn't it?

81
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,120
I told you my plan would work.

82
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,120
Now, with that important figure's stance,

83
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,280
I'm curious to see what Kong Mingzhe

84
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,280
will try at the ceremony tomorrow.

85
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,000
This time, we got lucky,

86
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,800
but next time, we might
not be fortunate.

87
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,840
From now on,
we need to be more cautious.

88
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,560
Do you understand?

89
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,000
All right!

90
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,800
But speaking of which,

91
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,800
didn't you think that important figure's

92
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,120
voice sounded familiar?

93
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,240
Like you've heard it somewhere before?

94
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,280
I didn't notice.

95
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,560
Chenfei,

96
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,440
I think you're just overthinking things.

97
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,512
After the ceremony,
take a good rest for some days.

98
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,800
Let's go.

99
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,160
Jiang Feng?

100
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,520
What are you doing here?

101
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,960
I came to take you home.

102
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,160
Let's go.

103
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's go.

104
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,800
I...

105
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,840
Grandpa,

106
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,080
are we really going
to attend this ceremony?

107
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Since the Kong family
dares to host this ceremony,

108
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,680
how could I not attend?

109
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,280
Kong Tianhai hopes to become

110
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,600
Jiangcheng's top family

111
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,720
by taking Senior Jiang as his master.

112
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,720
Humph!

113
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,400
What a fantasy.

114
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,512
Little do they know, Senior Jiang

115
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,920
would never side with them.

116
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,560
But Grandpa...

117
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,800
I understand.

118
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,480
You're worried about

119
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,720
feeling awkward meeting Senior Jiang.

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,800
Is that so?

121
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,040
Well, Grandpa,

122
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,920
why didn't you say so earlier?

123
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,240
You made me lose face

124
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,720
in front of Jiang Beizun.

125
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,120
If I don't correct your

126
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,400
impudent behavior,

127
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,040
you might cause trouble in the future.

128
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,360
All right.

129
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,800
The time is almost here.

130
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,040
The ceremony is about to start.

131
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
Our Lu family

132
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,800
cannot lag behind others.

133
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,840
Let's go.

134
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,680
Please.

135
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,904
(Yuqing Gate)

136
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,280
Jiang Feng.

137
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,160
Jiang Feng,

138
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,600
you've delivered Chenfei.

139
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,120
Wait in the car.

140
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,160
Don't embarrass our Liu family.

141
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,600
Mother, Jiang Feng is my husband.

142
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,120
Why can't he go in?

143
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,720
Your husband?

144
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,160
After today,

145
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:31,792
Young Master Kong will be your husband.

146
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,040
Our family and the Kong family

147
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,720
will be a true family.

148
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,720
What's Jiang Feng?

149
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,360
Does he deserve to be
at such a prestigious ceremony?

150
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:42,176
Aren't you afraid he'll
lower the event's prestige?

151
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,800
Huh?

152
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,720
Jiang Feng,

153
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,040
if you want to go in, you can.

154
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,600
But first,

155
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,480
you need an invitation.

156
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,840
Otherwise, I cannot let you in.

157
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,000
This ceremony

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
is organized by our Liu family.

159
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,360
Isn't there an extra invitation?

160
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,176
You think you can just get one?

161
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,200
Mother...

162
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,720
Later, someone might see

163
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,120
a son-in-law coming in.

164
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,360
They might laugh at our Liu family.

165
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,240
Besides, at such a grand occasion,

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,720
Jiang Feng,

167
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
you're not fit to attend.

168
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,360
But...

169
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,280
Jiang Feng,

170
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,160
today's attendees

171
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,360
are all prominent figures in Jiangcheng.

172
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,160
It's inappropriate for you to wait here.

173
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,360
Maybe, find another place.

174
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,280
You guys are interesting.

175
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,240
Jiang Feng,

176
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,600
I bet you're thinking

177
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,480
of sneaking in somehow.

178
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,360
Let me tell you,

179
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,840
this ceremony

180
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,240
has extremely strict security.

181
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,208
I advise you not to humiliate yourself.

182
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,000
How about this?

183
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,808
Wait until the ceremony
is over and everyone has left,

184
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,240
you can follow the cleaners
to go in and clean up.

185
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:57,712
It'll be an eye-opener for you.

186
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,480
At least, you won't have come in vain.

187
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,360
Liu Qingtian,

188
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,040
I'm afraid that after today,

189
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,920
you'll regret it deeply.

190
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,120
Regret?

191
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,040
Jiang Feng,

192
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,200
is there something wrong with your head?

193
00:08:18,384 --> 00:08:20,360
The Kong family's
apprenticeship ceremony today,

194
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,680
is known throughout Jiangcheng.

195
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,040
After today, Young Master Kong

196
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,560
will become Jiangcheng's top young master.

197
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
And our Liu family

198
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,600
will naturally benefit greatly.

199
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,920
If I'm fortunate enough
to speak with that important person,

200
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,360
I might earn his favor.

201
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,560
I am someone you can never

202
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,360
hope to reach in your lifetime.

203
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,400
Understand?

204
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,240
Of course.

205
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,280
Then I congratulate

206
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,360
you, Young Master Liu.

207
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,600
Wishing you all the best.

208
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,600
Chenfei, you can go in.

209
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,824
Don't worry about me.

210
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
At least this useless person
knows his place.

211
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,120
Liu Qingtian!

212
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,080
Chenfei,

213
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,520
stop talking. Let's go.

214
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,390
You can go in.

215
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay.

216
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,760
Mr. Jiang.

217
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,480
Please.

218
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,080
Please.

219
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,720
Mr. Jiang.

220
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,080
Ms. Murong, you're also here.

221
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,360
Kong Tianhai wants
to apprentice under you.

222
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,960
It's the hottest topic
in Jiangcheng these days.

223
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,000
How could our Muhetang miss it?

224
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,840
I just didn't expect

225
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,352
that you and the Kong family
have such a deep connection.

226
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,080
Connection?

227
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,960
Yes.

228
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,440
It's from many years ago.

229
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,600
Mr. Jiang,

230
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,480
today is your big day.

231
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,880
Why don't you let me
and the others stay with you?

232
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
I can see that the Kong family

233
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,520
put in a lot of effort.

234
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,520
That's to be expected.

235
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,720
With Master Jiang's status,

236
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,080
the Kong family would
want to climb higher.

237
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:18,000
It's that the Kong family
was the first to realize this.

238
00:10:18,128 --> 00:10:19,824
Others who want to ally
with Master Jiang

239
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,320
don't have the Kong family's power.

240
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,808
However, Master Jiang,

241
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,600
if I may be so bold,

242
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,080
Kong Tianhai is rather sinister.

243
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,520
If you take him as your disciple,

244
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,440
you should be extra cautious.

245
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,320
When have I ever said

246
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,680
that I would accept him as a disciple?

247
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,360
Then what do you mean?

248
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,880
I came to exterminate their family.
