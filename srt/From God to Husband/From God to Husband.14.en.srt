(Adapted from "From God to Husband"
by Yueyingguxiangming)

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,980
=Episode 14=

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,520
Now that I'm here,

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,440
how do you feel?

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,480
It seems you've
misunderstood my intention.

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:46,880
Please sit.

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,200
The affairs of Muhetang are numerous,

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,920
so there's no need
to put effort into me.

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,320
With your skills,

19
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,360
you would surely be the most
valuable partner for Muhetang.

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,840
Every word and action

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,840
is treated with the highest respect.

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,680
No need.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Are you refusing me?

24
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,160
What do you mean by that?

25
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,400
Do you think

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,920
I'm some kind of courtesan

27
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,520
that you keep your distance from me?

28
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,400
It's said

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,440
that when a man reaches a certain age,

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,440
beauty is secondary.

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,720
Power and career are primary.

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,680
I wonder if you share this view.

33
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,320
I'm 31 years old this year.

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,800
And I've never been moved by anyone,

35
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,680
except you.

36
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,400
The wind is strong.

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Don't catch a cold.

38
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,520
You might have misunderstood something.

39
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,320
I'm here today with only one purpose.

40
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,800
That is to give you this.

41
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,720
A challenge letter from the Hong family.

42
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,320
Or did you think it was something else?

43
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,520
Alright.

44
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,400
Since the letter is delivered,

45
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,880
I won't disturb you any longer.

46
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,080
You can consider

47
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,600
whether to avoid the battle.

48
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,320
After all,

49
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,160
the head of the Hong family,
Hong Chongxiao, is no ordinary opponent.

50
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,160
He is a true Earth rank expert.

51
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,160
Losing to him is not shameful.

52
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,680
As the saying goes,

53
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,520
"While the green hills remain,

54
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,920
one need not worry about firewood."

55
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,980
You can make a decision
after careful consideration.

56
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,000
If needed,

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,080
please feel free to ask.

58
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,960
Regardless of the outcome,

59
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,520
Muhetang will always support you.

60
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,520
There are countless men

61
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,000
who want to undress me.

62
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,760
But none have ever dressed me.

63
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,480
Jiang Beizun...

64
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,128
(Challenge Letter)

65
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,960
Tianxuan Mountain.

66
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,360
Interesting.

67
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Chenfei!

68
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,680
Chenfei!

69
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,680
Wait for me!

70
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,360
Chenfei!

71
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,088
Come with me to Tianxuan Mountain.

72
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,760
Why are you going there?

73
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,920
It's the weekend.

74
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,800
I had planned to go hiking
with some friends.

75
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,120
But they all bailed on me.

76
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,960
Chenfei, do you want to join me?

77
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,120
No.

78
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,400
I still have work to do.

79
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,680
Alright.

80
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,360
I understand.

81
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,280
Then I'll go alone.

82
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,680
If it gets dark

83
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,560
and there are wild animals
on the mountain,

84
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
I will...

85
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,080
Chenfei,

86
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,120
how long has it been
since you went out to play with me?

87
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,680
I heard there's a temple
on the mountain that's effective.

88
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,640
It's called Yunguan Temple.

89
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,520
Do you want to go and pray?

90
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,240
Alright.

91
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,896
Jiangcheng hasn't been very peaceful.

92
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,280
I'd be worried if you went alone.

93
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,240
So I'll go with you.

94
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,240
Great!

95
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,920
Let's go right now!

96
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,520
I knew it.

97
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,800
You are the best!

98
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,840
Hongling,

99
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,640
the task of guiding Mr. Jiang falls to you.

100
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,760
Remember.

101
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,240
When you meet Mr. Jiang,

102
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,800
treat him with respect.

103
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,200
Alright, Grandpa.

104
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
I understand.

105
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,640
Jiang Beizun, I want to see
how long you

106
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,320
can keep up this act.

107
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,520
It's you.

108
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,560
What are you doing here?

109
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,760
If I could refuse,

110
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,680
do you think I'd want to see you?

111
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,960
My grandfather insisted

112
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,440
that I come and pick you up

113
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,880
and take you to Tianxuan Mountain.

114
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,000
So are you really going

115
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,760
to accept the challenge?

116
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,760
Well, you think

117
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,680
I should shut myself away?

118
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,400
Of course.

119
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,960
I see you're new here

120
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,080
and don't know how deep

121
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,760
Jiangcheng's waters are.

122
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,200
Hong Chongxiao is no ordinary person.

123
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,320
He's an Earth rank expert,

124
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,560
one of the top figures in Jiangcheng.

125
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,640
Even my grandfather

126
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,760
can't claim to be certain
of defeating him.

127
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,200
You, a peak Mystic rank,

128
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,120
daring to challenge an Earth rank,

129
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,200
are simply arrogant and ignorant.

130
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
If I were you,

131
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,488
I wouldn't accept the challenge.

132
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,520
Such an action is akin

133
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,680
to seeking death.

134
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,880
I haven't fought yet.

135
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,440
How can you be so sure I'll lose?

136
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,200
Or do you prefer to shrink back
in the face of danger?

137
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,880
You!

138
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:13,240
It's pointless to argue.

139
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,120
You'll understand when you truly face

140
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,640
an Earth rank expert.

141
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,120
Miss Lu,

142
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,640
don't worry about it.

143
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,000
Chenfei,

144
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,440
we didn't invite Jiang Feng
to come along.

145
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,880
He won't be upset, right?

146
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,200
He's not that petty.

147
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,880
Wait, you start regarding him
as your brother-in-law.

148
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,640
Why?

149
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,296
The prejudice against him is gone?

150
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,200
Chenfei, have you noticed

151
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,520
that Jiang Feng seems
like a different person?

152
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,200
He's more reliable now and more charming.

153
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,000
He also brings us little surprises.

154
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,320
Chenfei,

155
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,400
I think I saw Jiang Feng.

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,800
Really?

157
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,760
Rourou, you must have seen wrong.

158
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,760
How could he be here?

159
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,440
Aren't you going to play?

160
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,200
Let's go.

161
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,200
Okay.

162
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,760
This place truly
is a feng shui treasure.

163
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,080
Mr. Jiang, you're here.

164
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,560
So this is Yunguan Temple.

165
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,400
Yes.

166
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,000
Speaking of Yunguan Temple,

167
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,520
it has a great history.

168
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,680
It's situated at the top
of Tianxuan Mountain,

169
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,000
above the clouds,

170
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,808
with a view
that stretches to the horizon.

171
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,560
It's said that the Bodhisattva Wuxiang

172
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,560
meditated here for a hundred years

173
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,440
without drinking a drop of water,

174
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
steadfast as a mountain,

175
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,448
chanting Buddhist scriptures
day and night.

176
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,440
In the end,

177
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,520
he achieved immortality saving all beings.

178
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,320
These folk tales are quite interesting.

179
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:50,800
Yes.

180
00:07:51,984 --> 00:07:54,208
Mr. Jiang, would you like
to try drawing a fortune slip?

181
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,400
I see many people
fulfilling their vows here.

182
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,800
It should be quite effective.

183
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,640
No need for that.

184
00:07:59,856 --> 00:08:01,120
I don't believe in these things.

185
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,960
Jiang Beizun, you really are fearless.

186
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,640
Even in front of the Bodhisattva,

187
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,784
you dare to speak so boldly.

188
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,200
I advise you to sincerely

189
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,640
pray and make a vow.

190
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,320
To see whether you'll live through your
life-and-death duel

191
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,000
with Hong Chongxiao.

192
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,760
Whether you'll survive or be crippled.

193
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,000
Is that so?

194
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,760
I only believe in myself.

195
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,080
This...

196
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Chenfei, hurry up!

197
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,880
Come on.

198
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,760
Quickly!

199
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,120
There's a wishing area.

200
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,200
Let's go take a look.

201
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,320
Chenfei, quickly!

202
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,280
Hey, how do we draw a fortune slip here?

203
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,720
I heard it's very effective.

204
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,560
Is that true?

205
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,800
Master, my sister is reckless.

206
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,240
Please don't take it to heart.

207
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,120
Patron, it's fine.

208
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,080
I see that this young patron

209
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,200
is naturally lively.

210
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,880
Her heart is at ease.

211
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,960
There's nothing wrong with that.

212
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,600
The fortune slips at Yunguan Temple

213
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,520
come in many varieties.

214
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,720
What are you two seeking?

215
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,600
I want to wish for family prosperity,

216
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,840
my sister's safety,

217
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,480
and good health.

218
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:19,920
Oh, I see.

219
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,640
Ha ha ha.

220
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,280
Young lady, please.

221
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,040
Eighty-seven.

222
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,400
"With wholehearted efforts in business."

223
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,240
"You'll dance like bees
and butterflies on flowers."

224
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,000
"When you go,
the fortune will assist you."

225
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,040
"When you return,
you'll find your bag full of gold."

226
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,520
What does that last sentence mean?

227
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,760
It means our family

228
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
will become very wealthy!

229
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,120
Ha ha ha.

230
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,640
This is a good fortune slip.

231
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,720
Master, about the incense money...

232
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,760
It's up to your wish.

233
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yunguan Temple never forces anyone.

234
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,000
Chenfei, why don't you also try one?

235
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,240
I...

236
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,520
Since we're here,

237
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,600
just give it a try.

238
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,720
You've already wished for family safety,

239
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,400
so I'll wish for something else.

240
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,640
Master, can I wish for romance?
