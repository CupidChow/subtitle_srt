12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,600
Xiong.

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,760
Someone is bullying me.

14
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,280
What?

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,000
In Jiangcheng,

16
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,420
(Zhou Baxiong, leader of underground)
who dares to bully my sister?

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,640
It's that useless son-in-law
of my family,

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,320
Jiang Feng.

19
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,280
I don't know
where he learned marital arts,

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,120
and he dared to mock me.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,200
You have to help me get revenge.

22
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,360
Teach him a lesson.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,680
Don't worry.

24
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,640
I will handle it personally.

25
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,000
I promise you'll be satisfied.

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:31,960
Find a place,

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,040
and we can talk as we go.

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,000
Okay.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,320
Well,

30
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,720
I don't know what he'd done,

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,640
and I was stuck there.

32
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,680
Hey,

33
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,840
someone is here.

34
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,040
Hey,

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,200
where did you come from?

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,760
How could Chenfei be
in a place like this?

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,480
Get him!

38
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,680
Rourou,

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,040
how do you want me
to deal with that guy?

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,480
I have ninety-nine thousand
nine hundred and ninety-nine ways.

41
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,280
I'll kill him!

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,120
Giving him a good beating is a given.

43
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,840
But,

44
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,920
don't go too hard on him.

45
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,280
After all, my sister...

46
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,840
If he gets seriously injured,

47
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,280
my sister has to support him.

48
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,320
So

49
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,120
just be moderate.

50
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,520
Rourou,

51
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,400
I'll do whatever you say.

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,280
Xiong,

53
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,560
what are you doing?

54
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,160
You can tell me.

55
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,280
In Jiangcheng,

56
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,520
I play the tyrant.

57
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,080
So just

58
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,960
for your sake,

59
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,088
I'm taking action personally.

60
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,960
There must be something in it for me.

61
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,000
What are you doing?

62
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,400
What are you doing?

63
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,720
Who dares to disturb my matters?

64
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,840
Jiang Feng!

65
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
Save me now!

66
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,000
If anything happens to me,

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,520
my sister won't forgive you.

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Oh, is that so?

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,650
I'm passing by.

70
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,240
Continue.

71
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,960
He's passing by.

72
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,000
Jiang Feng!

73
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:22,840
Brother-in-law!

74
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,880
I was wrong!

75
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,280
Please save me!

76
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,280
Brother-in-law!

77
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,400
Wait...

78
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,840
Where are you?

79
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,800
Daring to ruin my things,

80
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,080
you're asking for a beating!

81
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,120
Brother-in-law!

82
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,680
I was wrong.

83
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,280
If you dare to cause trouble again,

84
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,680
I will not spare your life.

85
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,200
Why am I being controlled?

86
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,880
Jiang Feng?

87
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,920
What's wrong with Rourou?

88
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:17,800
Here.

89
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,080
Gentle.

90
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,520
Rourou?

91
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,640
What happened to her?

92
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,480
Rourou!

93
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,600
Chenfei.

94
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,680
What's wrong with you?

95
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,320
Jiang Feng...

96
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,200
Jiang Feng!

97
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,640
What did you do to Rourou?

98
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,520
Nothing at all.

99
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,640
This...

100
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,480
Is that what you call nothing?

101
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,640
Jiang Feng!

102
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,480
Let me tell you.

103
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,720
Rourou is the person
I care about the most.

104
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,280
If something really happened to her,

105
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,480
I will never forgive you
for the rest of my life.

106
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,280
Wait...

107
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,160
Chenfei.

108
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,960
It's not what...

109
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,280
It's not like you think.

110
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,200
Father,

111
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,160
you want to see me?

112
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,360
Kneel down.

113
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,920
The engagement with that girl
from the Liu family

114
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,720
is hereby canceled.

115
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,400
Why?

116
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,640
You know I've been fond
of Liu Chenfei for years.

117
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,920
Now, it's finally within reach,

118
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,640
and we're on the verge of engagement.

119
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,840
Why cancel it?

120
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,640
Father.

121
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,400
I have been pretending
to be dead to set up a plan,

122
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,720
and enduring for eight years.

123
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,080
Now is the most crucial time.

124
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,840
At this critical juncture,

125
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,720
you'd better not cause me any trouble.

126
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,040
A woman is nothing.

127
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,640
If this affects important matters,

128
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,280
that would be a foolish move.

129
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,040
Go receive thirty strikes.

130
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,040
Leave.

131
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,360
Yes.

132
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,280
The spiritual energy in Jiangcheng
is growing stronger.

133
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,960
There must be some
great figures emerging.

134
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,040
It seems Jiangcheng

135
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,280
is about to undergo a change.

136
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,840
If I can get help
from these great figures...

137
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,520
You...!

138
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,360
Rourou,

139
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,920
you're awake.

140
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,920
Chenfei,

141
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,400
how did I get back?

142
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,720
Have some water.

143
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,520
I remember...

144
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,480
It was Jiang Feng

145
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,720
who brought you back.

146
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,960
Rourou,

147
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,040
what happened?

148
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
You can tell me,

149
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,080
and I'll support you.

150
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,600
He saved me.

151
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,280
You mean

152
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,040
Jiang Feng saved you?

153
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Right.

154
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
If it weren't for him,

155
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,640
I might have been...

156
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,640
Fortunately, Jiang Feng arrived in time.

157
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,200
So nothing happened.

158
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,400
In that case...

159
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
Jiang Feng!

160
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,040
What did you do to Rourou?

161
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,520
(I was worried)

162
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,200
(and misunderstood Jiang Feng.)

163
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,600
Why didn't you come back all night?

164
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,760
And you didn't answer my call.

165
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
Last night...

166
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,600
Well...

167
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,160
Forget it.

168
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,096
Let's not talk about it.

169
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,040
Change into this outfit.

170
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
We're going somewhere.

171
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:05,840
Today

172
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,840
is my university classmates' reunion.

173
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,040
Originally,

174
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,840
I planned to go alone.

175
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,400
But after all,

176
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,160
you are my nominal husband.

177
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,960
The invitation said
to bring family members.

178
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,520
So come with me.

179
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,160
Alright.

180
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,640
Well...

181
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,080
About yesterday...

182
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,600
I'm sorry.

183
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,520
Is this how you apologize?

184
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,600
It's the most luxurious estate

185
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,520
in all of Jiangcheng.

186
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,640
Jiang Feng,

187
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,840
although today is a class reunion,

188
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,600
it's also a social occasion.

189
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,160
You must be careful
with your words and actions.

190
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,040
Okay.

191
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,760
I see.

192
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,640
It's a bit ill-fitting.

193
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,680
And you don't have any decent clothes.

194

I borrowed it from a brand

195
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,920
just for this temporary solution.

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,400
It has to be returned later.

00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,920
Try to be discreet
and minimize your movements.

under the Liu family.

don't talk nonsense.

204
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,240
Okay.
