Xi!

Come here!

22
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,400
Madam.

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,640
Madam.

24
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,879
Come here.

25
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,159
Madam!

26
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:03,439
You've got me. It's my turn.

27
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,840
Where are you, Xi?

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,240
I'm going to get you soon.

29
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,479
Somebody help me.

30
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,360
I don't want to give my first time

31
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,479
to this old woman.

32
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,280
Jianwei.

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,840
What's the situation over there?

34
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,599
Xi.

35
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,919
I never thought you'd play hard to get.

36
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,759
How naughty of you, but I like it.

37
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,639
Yeah, madam.

38
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,080
We should take our time to have fun.

39
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,719
You're quite adorable, Xi.

40
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,199
I'm getting you soon!

41
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,879
I got you, Xi!

42
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:48,639
Xi.

43
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,159
Xi. Aren't I brilliant?

44
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,400
Yang Guifei used to take her bath
at the Huaqing Pool.

45
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,240
Now both of us are playing with water
here at the Blossom Pool.

46
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,000
How arousing it's been.

47
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:19,879
Xi. I can wait no more.

48
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,439
You...

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,800
look like...

50
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,719
Madam.

51
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,560
I noticed you've been distracted today.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,080
I get sleepy after drinking.

53
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,120
I'm off to get some sleep.

54
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,759
Once you've seen the vast sea,
no other waters compare.

55
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:09,960
Once you've known Mount Wu,
no other clouds will do.

56
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,879
(What was my father's relationship)

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,439
(with Wan Qianhong?)

58
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,959
Stop daydreaming.

59
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,319
I'm asking you a question.

60
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,680
Is Little Walnut here?

61
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,079
I think so.

62
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,279
What do you mean by that?

63
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,160
Have you found Little Walnut?

64
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,439
Is she here?

65
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,000
If she is,

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
let's leave this place now.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,639
This is a living hell.

68
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,879
That old woman almost

69
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,759
got me just now.

70
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,160
This is an unordinary place.

71
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,000
I assume

72
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,519
Little Walnut is in no danger.

73
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,839
Like the Ghost Valley,
it's not easy to leave

74
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,480
this Blossom Manor.

75
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,720
Besides,
judging from Wan Qianhong's skills,

76
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,839
we're no match for her

77
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,120
even if we join hands.

78
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,399
As long as Little Walnut is safe.

79
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,040
How did we end up here?

80
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,360
I think this is no place for me.

81
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,800
I always stayed dry
back in the mountain.

82
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,240
Now I got soaking wet here.

83
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,360
In my opinion,

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,839
that madam is still a beauty.

85
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,759
Do you even mean what you just said?

86
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,079
Madam?

87
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,439
She's as old as my mother.

88
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,879
I must stay away

89
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,519
from a desperate woman like her.

90
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,319
And you need to promise me one thing.

91
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,639
What's it?

92
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,319
You know what I'm talking about.

93
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,560
Anyway, if you ever brought that up,

94
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,199
I'd make sure you die an ugly death.

95
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,279
Are you threatening me?

96
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,680
I think

97
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,959
we should deal with Wan Qianhong first.

98
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,000
(At worst I'd die from the fall.)

99
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,600
Little Walnut.

100
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,160
Little Walnut.

101
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,199
I've brought you something. Check it out.

102
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,319
It's the chicken soup I made for you.

103
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,279
Quick, have a taste.

104
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,519
Little Walnut.

105
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:57,279
I never meant to make you stay.

106
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,959
It's just that, whenever I see you, I...

107
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,079
What's the matter, madam?

108
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,600
Did you know?

109
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,560
You really

110
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,360
look like my daughter.

111
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,360
You two look like.
And you look like her when you smile.

112
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,399
And you're as kind as her.

113
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:32,920
Even this beaded bracelet you're wearing

114
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,399
looks like what she had.

115
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,000
(I found this bracelet in the woods
when I was small.)

116
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,319
(Could it be that she mistook me
for her daughter?)

117
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,720
Well, where is your daughter?

118
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,040
Don't be sad, madam.

119
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,319
I've been an orphan since I was young.

120
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,000
Perhaps I'm your daughter?

121
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,560
Here, my queen.

122
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,600
I wonder what that old woman
is up to now.

123
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,120
Put this into her drink
without her knowing.

124
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,919
Xi.

125
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,799
Today, you two will play

126
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,919
our most exciting game here.

127
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,039
Well, go on.

128
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:06,000
As usual, whoever loses the game
will end up as a fertilizer.

129
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,440
Are you ready? The game will begin soon.

130
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,639
Round one. Go!

131
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,720
How clumsy of you!

132
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,879
Round two. Go!

133
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,240
It's you?

134
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:06,000
Well, here's a grape for you.

135
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,840
Carry on with it!

136
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,840
I quit! I quit!

137
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,039
What a naughty boy.
Do you have a death wish?

138
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,720
Do something to make sure they live.

139
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:23,919
Continue the game.

140
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,039
Go!

141
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,919
Xi. Jianwei.

142
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,720
How kind-hearted you are.

143
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,159
But in this world,

144
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,720
not all kind acts
come with a good ending.

145
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,200
Please spare me, my queen.
I won't do that again.

146
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,919
Since you're so lovely,

147
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,480
here's a minor punishment for you.

148
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,919
Well, you'll be flogged to death.

149
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,240
Nice one!

150
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,399
I'm tired already.

151
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,000
Xi, Jianwei. You'll drink with me.

152
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,440
Coming.

153
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,000
Please, my queen.

154
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,360
Sure.

155
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,279
Why are you still here?

156
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,559
Scram.

157
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,519
Yes.

158
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,440
Madam.

159
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,919
Why did you have to be such extreme?

160
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,320
Indeed, madam.

161
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,559
That... That was insane.

162
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,919
You gave me a fright.

163
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,720
Youngsters nowadays

164
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,960
sure know the way
to pursue fame and fortune.

165
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,120
Why did they do

166
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,080
to deserve such a fate?

167
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,919
Human life is no trivial.

168
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,720
How cruel of you, madam.

169
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,600
Me? Cruel?

170
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,279
So what?

171
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:51,519
This world runs on
the law of the jungle.

172
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,919
Moreover, I'm above all else

173
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,480
in the Blossom Manor.

174
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:08,639
Don't think you can speak out of turn

175
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:12,240
just because I favor you two.

176
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,440
You have a death wish, huh?

177
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,919
You... You poisoned my drink?

178
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,519
No. I think you're drunk, madam.

179
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,799
Speak! Where is the antidote?

180
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,480
There's no antidote to it.

181
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,510
Are you going to tell me or not?

182
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:37,519
Let go of him.

183
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:41,080
Give me the antidote, then.

184
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,360
No, don't give her the antidote.

185
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,610
Are you going to give it to me?

186
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,759
Fine, I'll do it.

187
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,720
Didn't I tell you not to do that?

188
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,120
If I hadn't done so,
she would've killed you.

189
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,600
This isn't the antidote.
How despicable of you!

190
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,480
I almost got killed.

191
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,879
Of course
we had to do something about it.

192
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,080
She's been severely poisoned.

193
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,559
I don't think she'll last long.

194
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,279
Well,

195
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,120
we should find Little Walnut first.

196
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,399
Madam Wan! Please have mercy on him!

197
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,000
Little Walnut.

198
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,440
What are you doing here?

199
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,399
Madam, I saw some dead bodies

200
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,679
in the garden. I'm scared.

201
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,320
There, there, Little Walnut.
Don't be afraid.

202
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,679
This place is filthy.
Let me send you back to your room.

203
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,360
For the sake of my daughter,

204
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,440
I'll spare you two today.

205
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,840
Let's go.

206
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,759
Madam. What's wrong, madam?

207
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,200
Are you alright?

208
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:38,000
What's it with you, madam?

209
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,080
