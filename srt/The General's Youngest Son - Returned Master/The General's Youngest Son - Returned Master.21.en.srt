Little Walnut, don't scare me.

Little Walnut.

Jianwei.

Jianwei has his own unspeakable reasons.

27
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,520
You have to forgive him.

28
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,439
Okay.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,280
As long as you're alright,

30
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,879
I'll do whatever you say.

31
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,560
Take this back.

32
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,520
I know

33
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,439
you still care about it.

34
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,800
Little Walnut.

35
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,319
Enough talk.

36
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,280
I care about you the most.

37
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,599
It's a shame

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,120
I can't sew clothes

39
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:24,479
for you anymore.

40
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,479
Little Walnut!

41
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,719
Little Walnut.

Little Walnut.

43
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,599
Little Walnut.

44
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,479
Don't touch her!

45
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,319
Leave.

46
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,840
Your Highness, he's here.

47
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,580
(Li Qingshan, Li Pu's Deputy General)

48
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,199
This is my daughter's jade pendant.

49
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,240
Where is she?

50
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,079
If you hurt her,

51
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,519
I'll risk my life to kill you!

52
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,480
What admirable spirit.

53
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,680
You're indeed Deputy General Li.

54
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,079
I don't know what you're saying.

55
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,800
Want to know where your daughter is?

56
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,000
Answer me one question first.

57
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,240
I know nothing.

58
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:59,040
Why did you give up your career,

59
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,160
causing today's separation from her?

60
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,600
You say you love your daughter,

61
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,360
yet spend your days drinking.

62
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,839
Is that what a loving father does?

63
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,360
You hide the truth,

64
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,120
leading loyal men to die unjustly.

65
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,680
Is that what a good soldier does?

66
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,199
Let go of Her Highness!

67
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,680
What are you trying to do?

68
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,360
Father, what are you doing?

69
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,879
Ran!

70
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,040
Ran!

71
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,160
Your Highness, are you alright?

72
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,839
- Father.
- Ran.

73
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,439
I'm fine.

74
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,279
My dear Ran!

75
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,399
I searched very hard for you.

76
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,439
Thanks to Her Highness.

77
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,160
I was saved from the traffickers.

78
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,240
She's our savior!

79
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,920
I, Li Qingshan,

80
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,000
former deputy general under Li Pu,

81
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,800
thank Your Highness for your kindness.

82
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,240
What you want to know
should've died with me.

83
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,639
I will now tell you everything,
even if it costs me my life.

84
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,079
Deputy General Li, please rise.

85
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,160
I shouldn't have done this,

86
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,720
but this matter is important.

87
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,959
We need both witness and proof.

88
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,060
(Ghost Valley)

89
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,040
Jianwei, what did you do?

90
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,639
What did I do?

91
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,639
Isn't it too late to ask now?

92
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,199
Who on earth are you?

93
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
That was Li Family's Spear Skills!

94
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,519
Who am I?

95
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,519
I'm a soul
that fled from the netherworld.

96
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,240
I'm a son of the Li family

97
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,639
that you slaughtered
last Chinese New Year's Eve!

98
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,319
Tonight,

99
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,680
I'm Li Yan who came for revenge!

100
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,759
It's you?

101
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,399
All year long, you've been pretending.

102
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,079
All for today.

103
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,360
You didn't expect it, did you?

104
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,000
Someone from the Li family lived.

105
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,839
The Li Yan you tried to kill

106
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,279
now stands before you!

107
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,839
I infiltrated Ghost Valley for revenge.

108
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,399
All I want

109
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,959
is to avenge the Li family!

110
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,959
Being able to sneak into Ghost Valley,

111
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,360
I admit you've got guts.

112
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,199
But it's a shame

113
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,120
you're a traitor and rebel.

114
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,759
You're just a bandit,

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,040
a traitor in hiding.

116
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,639
Who are you calling the traitor?

117
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,800
Do you know what happened

118
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:47,120
on Jianwei Mountain 20 years ago?

119
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:50,160
It's written in the history records.
Everyone knows.

120
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,839
In Year 7 of Yongning,

121
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,199
General Chen Weishan
led Zhongyong Army to rebel

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,720
and was killed here.

123
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,680
The records

124
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,000
said so little and vaguely,

125
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,199
yet it defined us?

126
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,000
Did your father, Li Pu,

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,920
ever tell you

128
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,360
about the battle

129
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,839
that became his rise to glory?

130
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,319
What about it?

131
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,000
If Li Pu didn't tell you,

132
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,839
I will.

133
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,240
Zhongyong Army fought the Bailan Tribe

134
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,559
for three months.

135
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,519
Li Pu was ordered to aid us
but delayed for no reason.

136
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,120
It was the dead of winter.

137
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,320
We ran out of food and ammo.

138
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:47,360
Zhongyong Army
fought to the death against Bailan.

139
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,159
Countless people died.

140
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,000
For delaying reinforcements,

141
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,919
Li Pu should've been executed.

142
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,639
General spared him

143
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,759
for the sake of his wife's sisterly bond

144
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,679
and because she'd just given birth.

145
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,919
No one expected

146
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:15,320
Li Pu would strike and slaughter us

147
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,799
when we were weak.

148
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,039
He stole the glory and hid the truth.

149
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,000
The few of us who survived

150
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,159
fled into Jianwei Mountain

151
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:28,120
with General's orphan.

152
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,200
Since then on,

153
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,279
we became
the mountain bandits you despise,

154
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,120
rebels, and deserters.

155
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,440
While your father, Li Pu,

156
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:42,559
was honored
as First-rank Protector General!

157
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,679
Ridiculous. How ridiculous!

158
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,559
Nonsense!

159
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,840
You think you can twist truth

160
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,320
just by running your mouth?

161
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,320
Tonight,

162
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,320
I'll make you pay
for what you did to the Li family!

163
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,120
Chen Wang!

164
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,039
Yan, stop!

165
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,960
Aunt Qing?

166
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,240
- Yan.
- Even now,

167
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,159
you still want to stop me?

168
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,039
Did you forget what you promised me?

169
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,399
Yan, it's not what you think.

170
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,960
Yan? You're really Yan?

171
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,360
You've grown so much
in the blink of an eye.

172
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,960
Child, let it go.

173
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,840
We were all wrong.

174
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:29,919
You're...

175
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,039
I fought beside your father
in countless battles when I was young.

176
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,559
I served as his aide for over ten years.

177
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,840
After the Battle of Jianwei,

178
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,759
we parted ways.

179
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,879
All because your father
turned on Zhongyong Army.

180
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,159
It was outrageous.

181
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,120
Even your mother was kept in the dark.

182
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,200
It's normal you didn't know.

183
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,440
Don't be so stubborn, Yan.

184
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
Why should I trust you?

185
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,759
The army log states clearly

186
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,639
that Li Pu arrived at Jianwei Mountain
on the 5th of the 11th month

187
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,960
to aid Zhongyong Army

188
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,399
against Bailan.

189
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,679
You must've seen this painting.

190
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,919
I remember you once asked

191
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
about Wan Qianhong
and Li Pu's relationship.

192
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:17,840
Now look.

193
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,519
When was this painting made?

194
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,919
Year 7 of Yongning.

195
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:25,600
Winter Solstice.

196
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,900
(Wei)

197
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,140
(I could only take risks
to hide the truth.)

198
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,039
He wanted to use Bailan
to destroy Chen Weishan

199
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:07,919
and leave Zhongyong Army helpless
in the snow.

200
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,240
But Chen Weishan
was a brilliant strategist.

201
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,600
Zhongyong Army fought bravely.

202
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,480
Even without reinforcements,

203
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,279
they forced Bailan to retreat.

204
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:23,399
Your father
knew his delay was inexcusable,

205
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,600
so he struck in the night
and killed them.

206
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:27,399
Shut your mouth!

207
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,679
I don't believe it!

208
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,960
Why are you here?

209
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,240
This letter had been hidden
inside the wooden box

210
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,120
Wan Qianhong gave Little Walnut.

211
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,919
Perhaps this is fate.

212
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,600
You should recognize this handwriting.

213
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,480
(I lingered too long at your place)

214
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,360
(and delayed military operations.)

215
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:58,120
(This caused grave losses
to Zhongyong Army.)

216
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,840
(I fear I can't escape blame.)

217
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,879
(After careful thinking,)

218
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,720
(I could only take risks
to hide the truth.)

219
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,559
(If I succeed,
it will bring eternal glory.)

220
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,200
(If I fail,
let this letter be my farewell to you.)

221
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:21,960
While Zhongyong Army fought
and suffered heavy casualties,

222
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,159
he indulged in carnal pleasures
with Wan Qianhong.

223
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,720
So he planned this in advance.

224
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,279
Despicable.

225
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,799
Despicable indeed.

226
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,240
Yan!

227
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:51,919
Father, how could you?

228
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,960
I'm sorry.

229
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,940
(Xi)

230
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,399
My father killed Zhongyong Army first.

231
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,559
You slaughtered the Li family later.

232
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,039
So many grievances.

233
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,519
As a son of the Li family,

234
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:18,159
I have no more excuses!

235
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,840
Today,

236
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,120
I give you

237
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,600
my life!

238
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,480
It's not your fault.

239
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,399
