We're brothers after all.

23
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,400
Leaving without informing me?

24
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,719
Thank you.

25
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:14,800
What did you say?

26
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:15,719
I can't hear you.

27
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,879
Thank you for seeing me off.

28
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,439
Take care.

29
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,080
Take care.

00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,680
Yan!

31
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,240
Don't go, Yan!

32
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,960
Yan, did your mother ever tell you

33
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,960
why she named you Li Yan?

34
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,120
So this was

35
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,759
the unspeakable secret

36
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,840
that Huiniang held back.

37
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,960
You really are Wanniang's child.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Huiniang has always known this.

39
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,439
Xiaoxi, take off your clothes.

40
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:22,639
Quick.

41
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:30,439
What's wrong?

42
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,759
Jianwei is General Chen's real son.

43
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,719
Xiaoxi

44
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,719
was mistakenly switched.

45
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,560
He's actually
the youngest son of the Li family.

46
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,919
I failed Wanniang

47
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,919
and General Chen.

48
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,199
You're their real son.

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,560
Impossible.

50
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,280
Impossible.

51
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,319
This can't be true.

52
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:12,919
I'm not.

53
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,400
How could I be?

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,639
Impossible.

55
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,000
You're lying to me.

56
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,759
Chen Xiaoxi.

57
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,399
You're all lying to me!

58
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,959
Chen Xiaoxi, calm down!

59
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,720
Listen to me.

60
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,399
I don't want to see all of you!

61
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,079
What do you want?

62
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,040
It's just an identity.

63
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,519
Just an identity.

64
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,920
Easy for you to say.

65
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,319
I've hid in Ghost Valley
for over 20 years

66
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
just to avenge my father!

67
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,120
Now you tell me

68
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,879
my birth father is my enemy.

69
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,319
Just an identity?

70
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,639
Then tell me

71
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,240
who I am.

72
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,839
Who on earth am I?

73
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,079
Do you remember

74
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,639
asking me the same thing?

75
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,759
Who are you?

76
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,040
Even now, you still won't tell me?

77
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,839
And who are you?

78
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:47,839
I...

79
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,199
I'm the son of Chen Weishan,

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,399
Zhongyong Army's commander

81
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,480
who was killed
in Battle of Jianwei Mountain.

82
00:05:59,399 --> 00:05:59,920
What about you?

83
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,800
Who on earth are you?

84
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,519
I'm...

85
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,279
I'm Li Jianwei.

86
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,600
You're you.

87
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,100
You don't need an identity
to define yourself.

88
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,519
You're Chen Xiaoxi.

89
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,120
The young master of Ghost Valley

90
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,959
and my friend.

91
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,240
Live your life however you want.

92
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,480
But how can I face all this?

93
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,120
How do I face

94
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,240
the fact that my father was a traitor,

95
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,560
and I killed him myself.

96
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,920
So many Zhongyong soldiers
died unjustly.

97
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,839
I killed Little Walnut

98
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,160
and almost killed you too.

99
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,600
I've committed grave sins.

100
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,959
My hands are stained with blood.

101
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,120
I'm now a lowly pest.

102
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:04,879
Chen Xiaoxi.

103
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,000
We're friends and brothers.

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,040
We can face it together.

105
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,360
Besides, this isn't your fault.

106
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,820
Then whose fault is it?

107
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,879
Should I blame this cruel world?

108
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:25,600
Li Jianwei.

109
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,360
I'm not worthy of being your friend now.

110
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
Let me go.

111
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,680

General wouldn't want

131
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,320
to see you like this.

Is that the best you can do?

But...

175
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,720

176
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,799

You upheld justice over family ties
and corrected the wrongs.

180
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,000
People will only admire you for it.

181
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,960
Don't try to comfort me!

182
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,120
I'm telling the truth.

183

Besides,

184
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,200
we made a promise

185
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,399
to be best friends forever.

186
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,320
Why run away?

187
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,399
You can't break your promise.

yet it lights the road ahead of us.

the darkness behind with courage.

197
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:02,399
We fear nothing

198
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,720
