20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,439
Xiaoxi, look.

21
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,760
This is the training ground.

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,799
This is the backyard.

23
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,640
My brother and I used to
slack off and play chess there.

24
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,599
This is the study.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,359
But Li Pu doesn't allow us
to enter freely.

26
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:10,879
I want to go in and take a look.

27
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,879
Li Pu's final words.

28
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,660
(I, Li Pu,
presents this plea with blood.)

29
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,599
This was a letter of confession

30
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,439
he wrote after delaying military orders.

31
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,439
Isn't this solid proof
to clear Zhongyong Army's name?

32
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,960
When Zhongyong Army is exonerated,

33
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,360
it will mark the Li family's
fall into eternal damnation.

34
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,599
Eternal damnation?

35
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,800
But the Li family has already fallen,

36
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,479
hasn't it?

37
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,879
While you were bathing,

38
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,600
I got you a new set of clothes.

39
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,879
Try them on.

40
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,439
Does it still hurt?

41
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,079
Thank you.

42
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,560
Come on, let's go home.

43
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,839
Home?

44
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Ghost Valley is home.

45
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,800
Jianwei.

46
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,240
I don't want to go back to Ghost Valley.

47
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,600
How nice.

48
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,480
What did you say?

49
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,199
Nothing.

50
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,079
Jianwei.

51
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:54,959
Tell me.

52
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,759
Can we return to how we were?

53
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,800
Yes. You're still the young master.

54
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,240
And you?

55
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,639
I'm your younger brother.

56
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,439
Alright.

57
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,920
From now on, you must listen to me.

58
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,879
Then as my older brother,

59
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,360
you got to go easy on me.

60
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Of course.

61
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,240
I'll take good care of you.

62
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,720
But you must learn
to take care of yourself too.

63
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And Chen Dawang,

64
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:34,800
Mr. Hua, Chai, and Stone.

65
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,079
You must take good care
of everyone in Ghost Valley.

66
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,560
If Little Walnut were still alive...

67
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,920
Forget it.

68
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,600
Though that girl long liked you...

69
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,319
I know.

70
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,639
Good thing you know.

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,639
Remember everything I tell you.

72
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,360
Or you'll be sorry

73
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,240
when I return.

74
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,680
Why are you laughing?

75
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:02,720
Stop laughing.

76
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,720
After saying all that,

77
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,519
what about you?

78
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:09,600
Me?

79
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,160
From now on,

80
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,959
we'll start everything anew.

81
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,079
Let's start over then.

82
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,399
I'm not afraid.

83
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,240
Do you have any plans?

84
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,160
The world is vast. I can go anywhere.

85
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,759
I want to hear tunes in Jiangnan,

86
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,560
take the Shu Road, eat hotpot,

87
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,800
pray at Mount Tai, see sunrises,

88
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,399
and taste every fine wine.

89
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,879
Jianwei, got any wine?

90
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,360
I'll fetch some.

91
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:08,480
Jianwei.

92
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,279
We'll always be brothers.

93
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,839
Do everything I said

94
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,759
for me.

95
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,480
Jianwei.

96
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,639
It's snowing.

97
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,840
Tell me.

98
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,080
Why aren't people like snow?

99
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,279
How about we find a physician?

100
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,320
Ask him this.

101
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,440
If the seed has gone bad,

102
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,480
can it still be saved?

103
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,720
Of course.

104
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,799
If not, we'll descend the mountain
and buy new ones.

105
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,600
Jianwei, go!

106
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,360
Hurry!

107
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,759
We can't choose how we're born,

108
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,799
but we can shape our lives.

109
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,440
But fate goes against our will.

110
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,919
We'll fight fate to the end then.

111
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,000
Come on.

112
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,039
Li Jianwei.

113
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,240
Do you admit your wrongs?

114
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,159
I admit my wrongs.

115
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,720
I give you my life!

116
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,399
From this day on,

117
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,919
we're finished.

118
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm saying

119
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,440
if I die,

120
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,639
you must take me
back to Jianwei Mountain

121
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,759
and bury me under the wordless monument.

122
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,080
Take care.

123
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:43,120
Year 7 of Yongning,
Zhongyong Army's rebellion

124
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,440
(One Year Later)
was caused by the traitor, Li Pu.

125
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,080
(Eternal Loyalty)
All names have been cleared.

126
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:53,480
The fallen soldiers are deeply mourned.

127
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,639
A national ritual is held
to bring peace to the restless souls.

128
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,879
Jianwei.

129
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:07,519
Jianwei.

130
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,840
I stole this Drunken Lord
from Chen Dawang.

131
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,960
Let's drink it together.

132
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,360
Xiaoxi.

133
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:19,639
Xiaoxi.

134
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,440
Once we finish drinking,

135
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,830
let's go to the back mountain
to catch fish.

136
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,279
I haven't had grilled fish in ages.

137
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,960
You better
not fight me for it this time.

138
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,120
Young Master.

139
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,039
Si Yu, you're back.

140
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,200
Did you find his whereabouts?

141
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:04,799
Maybe he's already...

142
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,360
No.

143
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,960
Young Master, there's more bad news.

144
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,279
Everyone.

145
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,480
Bailan invaded the northern border
months ago.

146
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,200
How can we sit back and do nothing?

147
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,080
Young Master.

148
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,240
We once followed General Chen

149
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,519
and crushed Bailan's army.

150
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:43,159
Today we'll put on our armor

151
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,240
and return to the battlefield!

152
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,399
Alright.

153
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,000
I will follow my father's will

154
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,240
and restore Zhongyong Army's name.

155
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,840
No return till Bailan is defeated!

156
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,240
- No return till Bailan is defeated!
- No return till Bailan is defeated!

157
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,799
This grass

158
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,279
has grown year after year.

159
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,759
I've lost count how many times.

160
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,799
In hindsight,

161
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,720
it's just like what you said.

162
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,559
Jianwei, look at this grass.

163
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,970
Though it's fragile
and unable to withstand the storm,

164
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,679
they're unyielding.

165
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,600
Even scattered on hillsides,

166
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,519
they grow again in the spring breeze.

167
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,759
Seasons change,
grass grows and birds fly.

168
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,120
Even they can do so,

169
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,759
why not you?

170
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,000
Who knows where you are now?

171
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,159
But don't worry.

172
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,159
I've taken good care of everyone.

173
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:06,480
Speaking of,

174
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,240
Bailan invaded a few months ago.

175
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,440
I must head into battle

176
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,279
to restore Zhongyong Army's honor.

177
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,240
If you can hear me,

178
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,240
bless us with victory

179
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,279
and let us return in triumph.

180
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,480
