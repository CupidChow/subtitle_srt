20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,920
He's no brother of mine.

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,840
Ghost Valley doesn't need
an outsider like him.

22
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,719
Let alone have Chen Dawang
name him as his foster son.

23
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,079
- Young Master.
- Xiaoxi!

24
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,439
Jianwei, I'll help you up.

25
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,840
We're all outcasts.

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,879
Why make things so hard for Jianwei?

27
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:54,840
Exactly, Young Master.

28
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,959
- Yes.
- That's right.

29
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,920
People with different principles
can't work together.

30
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,840
He's just a fake and a hypocrite!

31
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,840
My father deserves the highest honor.

32
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,879
As his son, I must carry on.

33
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,680
I won't mix with people like him!

34
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,919
Xiaoxi.

35
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,680
Ghost Valley judges by merit, not birth.

36
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,599
Nonsense!

37
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,199
So are right and wrong,

38
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,560
good and evil no longer matter?

39
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,599
What is wrong with you two?

40
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,159
If there's something
you're not telling us, speak up.

41
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,759
Valley Master will decide for you.

42
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,599
Ask him yourself!

43
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,439
Jianwei.

44
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,240
Little Walnut.

45
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,039
I'm the young master.

46
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,120
I have my reasons for doing this.

47
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,520
Chen Xiaoxi.

48
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,199
As Valley Master,
do I need your approval

49
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,879
to name a foster child?

50
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,800
You're reckless by nature.

51
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,400
How can I entrust Ghost Valley to you?

52
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,560
How could I ever feel at ease?

53
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,479
Jianwei is calm and wise.

54
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:05,039
You should learn from him
and follow the example of the virtuous,

55
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,080
not be narrow-minded and jealous.

56
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,759
I'm jealous?

57
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,400
Afraid two tigers
can't share one mountain?

58
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,680
Scared he'll steal your thunder?

59
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,520
What a joke. I'm afraid of him?

60
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,599
Stone, speak.

61
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,520
Do you think so too?

62
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,319
Young Master.

63
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,840
Jianwei

64
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,639
is indeed exceptional.

65
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,439
Say that again!

66
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,719
If that's not it,

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
we can't fathom the reason behind this.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,599
Enough. My mind is made up.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,759
No more discussion.

70
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,159
Alright.

71
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,000
Alright then.

72
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,840
All of you

73
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,800
are blind fools.

74
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,120
Utterly incompetent!

75
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,719
Just wait.

76
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,680
One day...

77
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,439
One day I'll prove it

78
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,599
to every one of you!

79
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,439
Li Jianwei.

80
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,839
Just you wait.

81
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,040
Tomorrow

82
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,519
is the day you die.

83
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,519
This...

84
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,079
Young Master.

85
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,480
Little Walnut? Why are you here?

86
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,759
Xiaoxi, I made you new clothes.

87
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,439
I thought
I'd bring them for you to try on.

88
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,839
Why the sudden new clothes for me?

89
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,439
You're my brother.

90
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,319
Sewing for you is only natural.

91
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:47,560
I just don't know
if I'll get the chance again.

92
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,360
Silly girl,
why are you talking nonsense?

93
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,800
What's wrong?

94
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,920
Tell me if something's up.

95
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,040
Once wolf pups grow up,

96
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:03,240
they no longer stay with their mothers.

97
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,439
They have their own paths.

98
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,199
I understand.

99
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,319
Little Walnut, do you have a crush?

100
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,360
Tell me who it is.

101
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,319
Little Walnut.

102
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,920
This wolf tooth is for you.

103
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,439
Young Master, what are you looking for?

104
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,160
Xiaoxi, what are you trying to find?

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,519
Careful.

106
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,199
Keep it as a keepsake.

107
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,199
Who's there?

108
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,800
Jianwei, it's me.

109
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
Open the door.

110
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,360
Little Walnut, what is it?

111
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,560
Now's not a good time.

112
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,040
Jianwei.

113
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,120
I made you new clothes.

114
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,040
You can wear them
at tomorrow's ceremony.

115
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,279
I know you're in pain,

116
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,879
but we must look ahead

117
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,199
and live in the light.

118
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,399
I had no parents growing up.

119
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,240
People in Ghost Valley raised me.

120
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,360
They gave me kindness, love, and care.

121
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,439
I must repay them.

122
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,000
Little Walnut.

123
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,720
I heard Foster Father
loves Zuixian Pavilion's roasted duck.

124
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,279
Could you help me buy some tomorrow?

125
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,360
Zuixian Pavilion's roasted duck?

126
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:02,519
Sure.

127
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,519
Rest early, Jianwei.

128
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,800
I'll leave the clothes at your door.

129
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,160
Having seen the vast sea,

130
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,639
other waters won't do.

131
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,920
I glance back rarely amidst the flowers.

132
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,959
Half for enlightenment,
the other half for you.

133
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,639
Winter Solstice, Year 7 of Yongning.

134
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,660
(Li Pu)

135
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,000
Winter Solstice?

136
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,799
Winter Solstice, Year 7 of Yongning.

137
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,480
That's the 20th of the 11th month.

138
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,000
That means
he was still at Blossom Manor.

139
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,240
Your Highness,
a letter from the inspectorate.

140
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,060
(To Qingyuan)

141
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,799
Li Pu was ordered

142
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,919
to reach Jianwei Mountain

143
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:01,840
by the 5th of the 11th month

144
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,360
to aid Zhongyong Army,

145
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,960
but he only arrived on the 25th.

146
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,200
He was 20 days late.

147
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,440
Delaying military action
is a grave offense.

148
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,679
Did he...

149
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:13,750
Speaking of, Your Highness,

150
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,080
we found
the person you were looking for.

151
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,519
Where is he?

152
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,660
(Ghost Valley)

153
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,600
Heaven and Earth bear witness.
A tribute to the departed heroes.

154
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,159
The revered Chen Dawang

155
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:36,879
is a man of great virtue,
feared yet respected.

156
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,279
The young Li Jianwei

157
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,480
is a man of honor and unmatched talent.

158
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,720
Today, they become father and son.

159
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,720
In this lifetime, a father-son bond
and loyalty shall bind them.

160
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,039
It's what everyone hopes for!

161
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:58,000
- Good!
- Good!

162
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,519
I, Li Jianwei, bow to Foster Father.

163
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,120
Good, now rise.

164
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,720
A blood pact!

165
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,960
The rite is complete!

166
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,639
- Good!
- Good!

167
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,399
- Good.
- Good.

168
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,120
Here's to you.

169
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:13,279
Jianwei, we're family from now on.

170
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,440
The road ahead is long.

171
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,200
Don't let me down.

172
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,120
Congratulations on gaining a foster son.

173
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,720
- Congratulation, Valley Master.
- Congratulation, Young Master.

174
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,639
Congratulations.

175
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:28,399
- Congratulation, Valley Master.
- Congratulation, Young Master.

176
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,919
Come on, everyone.

177
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,840
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

178
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:41,879
How could you start

179
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:43,120
such an important occasion without me?

180
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,600
What are you doing?

181
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:46,879
Chen Dawang.

182
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,559
If you want him as a foster son,

183
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:52,039
shouldn't you discuss it with me first?

184
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,440

Valley Master,
the wine must be poisoned.

00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,240
You think you can stop me?

191
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,960
Let's see
how many times you can kill me.

192
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,399
It's not that I want to kill you.

193
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:33,519
You have your revenge. I have my hatred.

194
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,799
We might as well
settle everything today.

195
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,360
Stop it!

196
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,960
You're no fool after all.

197
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,639
I underestimated you.

Don't!
