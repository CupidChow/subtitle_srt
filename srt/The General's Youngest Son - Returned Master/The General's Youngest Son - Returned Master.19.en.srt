Let go.

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,040
- Young Master.
- Get out!

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,439
I never want to see you again!

23
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,159
I never want to see you again!

24
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,359
Young Master.

25
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,359
- Out!
- Chen Xiaoxi!

26
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:47,879
Out!

27
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,100
You rebellious brat!

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,640
What's wrong with you now?

29
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,959
Ouch... My head hurts.

30
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,480
Jianwei.

31
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,200
What on earth happened?

32
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,439
Little Walnut.

33
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,879
Take care of Xiaoxi.

34
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,599
Xiaoxi, I'll help you to rest.

35
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,280
Come on.

36
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,879
Jianwei, you...

37
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,680
Xiaoxi's really gotten out of control.

38
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,719
What exactly happened between you two?

39
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,159
If you won't say,

40
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,879
I won't force you.

41
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,039
You and Xiaoxi are like brothers.

42
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,319
You should look out for each other.

43
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,199
One day, more of Ghost Valley's affairs

44
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,400
will be entrusted to you.

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,439
Ouch.

46
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,360
Ouch.

47
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,439
Ouch.

48
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,680
Young Master.

49
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,879
Your Grace, found anything?

50
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,439
This book records

51
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,599
that in Year 7 of Yongning,

52
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:27,319
Li Pu was ordered to reach
on the 5th of the 11th lunar month

53
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,520
to aid Zhongyong Army.

54
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,000
Si Yu, find someone for me.

55
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,560
His name is Li Qingshan

56
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,719
and is from Yuzhou.

57
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,360
Aunt Qing.

58
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,360
One more thing.

59
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,080
Do you know

60
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,800
about the past
between Blossom Manor's Wan Qianhong

61
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,479
and my father?

62
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,919
Wan Qianhong

63
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,719
and Li Pu?

64
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:03,800
Si Yu.

65
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,719
Looks like
we need to visit Blossom Manor.

66
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,400
Yes.

67
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,479
Be careful.

68
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,639
Handle gently.

69
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,660
What happened the day before yesterday

70
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,759
revealed we lack proper supplies.

71
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,199
In urgent times,

72
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,199
most were damaged.

73
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,600
So I had people

74
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,839
prepare liquor, gunpowder, and saltpeter

75
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,639
and placed them at guard posts.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,319
We'll inspect monthly from now on.

77
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,519
We should've done so long ago.

78
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,120
Jianwei's thoughtful.

79
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,279
Yes.

80
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,079
- Here.
- Alright.

81
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,000
There's more. Coming.

82
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,319
Jianwei.

83
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,079
Are you really sure?

84
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,279
Why not just leave?

85
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,120
Little Walnut.

86
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,800
You don't need to persuade me.

87
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,240
I've made up my mind.

88
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,680
But Xiaoxi will really kill you.

89
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,519
I don't want any of you to get hurt.

90
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,879
If he wants to kill me, let him.

91
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,399
It wouldn't be the first time.

92
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:05,759
What are you doing?

93
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,480
It's winter. The weather is dry.

94
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,439
Using fire day and night?

95
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,399
You want to die?

96
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,920
Young Master, Jianwei worked very hard

97
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,120
to get these supplies for battle.

98
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,279
Even you are disobeying me?

99
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,680
It's not what you think.

100
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,000
Get lost.

101
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,519
Fine.

102
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,519
Young Master, why yell at Stone?

103
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,000
Jianwei has done so much for us.

104
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,759
And you?

105
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,439
Yes.

106
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,839
Young Master is getting
more and more outrageous.

107
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,720
Exactly.

108
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,360
Xiaoxi.

109
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,480
Kill me now if you dare.

110
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,639
Don't think I won't.

111
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:52,839
There are two days left.

112
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,560
Once time is up,

113
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,680
I'll kill you.

114
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:00,839
I'll be waiting.

115
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,240
Li Jianwei.

116
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,639
(Father, I swear I will make them all)

117
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,000
(pay with their lives.)

118
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:23,000
We've hidden in Ghost Valley
for 20 years.

119
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,639
Though I killed my enemies,

120
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,199
our name as traitors
still isn't cleared.

121
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,480
My health is declining each day.

122
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,040
I should make early plans

123
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,120
for Ghost Valley's future.

124
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,319
Valley Master, are you saying

125
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,720
you want to name
someone from the juniors to take charge?

126
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,240
What do you think of Xiaoxi?

127
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,600
Young Master?

128
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,360
He's kindhearted

129
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,639
but a bit unruly.

130
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,800
What do you think of Jianwei?

131
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,959
He's mature beyond his years.

132
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,680
Bold, decisive, and compassionate.

133
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,040
He's a natural-born leader.

134
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,600
I believe there's no reason

135
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,639
he can't lead.

136
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,199
Young Master is the general's son.

137
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,759
He's unruly, but he's not evil.

138
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,000
And we raised him ourselves.

139
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,720
He does carry General's blood...

140
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,519
but as a leader...

141
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,600
I think Zhongyong Army values ability,

142
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,480
not bloodline.

143
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,040
I believe Li Jianwei
is trustworthy and capable.

144
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,720
Valley Master, what do you think?

145
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,959
If the two of them
can support each other

146
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,600
and work together,

147
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
it would be best.

148
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,360
But Li Jianwei

149
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,000
isn't one of Zhongyong Army.

150
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,079
Jianwei acts mature and capable,

151
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,920
but he lacks a proper background.

152
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,519
We ought to give him a proper title.

153
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,519
Valley Master, I have an idea.

154
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:18,800
Little Walnut.

155
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,040
You're here, Xiaoxi.

156
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,319
Why so mysterious?

157
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,680
Where is he?

158
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,039
Jianwei, you're here.

159
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:37,840
Sit down.

160
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,639
Xiaoxi, sit too.

161
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,440
Xiaoxi.

162
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,320
Little Walnut.

163
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,720
What game are you playing?

164
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,120
I don't want to see him.

165
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,360
Xiaoxi.

166
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,759
Calm down.

167
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,480
Today is my birthday.

168
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:16,039
I want you two to spend it with me.

169
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,039
Whatever grudge you have,

170
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,759
just let it go for today.

171
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,279
You were raised by wolves.

172
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,600
How do you even have a birthday?

173
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,679
But you brought me back

174
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,600
18 years ago today.

175
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:31,759
Xiaoxi.

176
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,240
Little Walnut.

177
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,720
Happy birthday.

178
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,840
Come on.

179
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,200
Here.

180
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,799
Here, let's drink one more.

181
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,120
Drinking like this is boring.

182
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,720
Li Jianwei.

183
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,360
Let's arm wrestle.

184
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,039
Loser drinks.

185
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,240
How childish.

186
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,600
Sure.

187
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,919
Arm wrestling is a great idea.

188
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,840
Ready.

189
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,320
Go!

190
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,879
Come on.

191
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,639
Come on.

192
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,039
Come on.

193
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:39,440
Come on.

194
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,159
Come on.

195
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:41,279
Come on!

196
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,159
Again.

197
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,080
Go, Xiaoxi!

198
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,200
Here, Jianwei.

199
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,440
Come on.

200
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:58,559
Come on!

201
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,120
We're out of wine.

202
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,120
Wait here, I'll go get more.

203
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,840
If I tell them who you are,

204
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,919
you'll be dead for sure.

205
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:39,840
So what?

206
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,960
I don't want to see you die here.

207
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,200
As long as you leave,

208
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,039
I'll pretend none of this happened

209
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,120
and act like I never met you.

210
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,200
You once said,

211
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,480
the grudges of the last generation
shouldn't be passed to the next.

212
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,519
Take Little Walnut and leave.

213
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,679
Live in hiding.

214
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,200
We'll part ways peacefully.

215
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,399
Live in hiding? Part ways peacefully?

216
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:11,279
Why?

217
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,879
We've lived like ghosts

218
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,360
for over 20 years here.

219
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,279
Do we have to keep hiding forever?

220
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:21,639
I didn't expect...

221
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,639
I didn't expect you'd

222
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,840
twist truth like this.

223
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:35,440
After tonight,

224
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,559
you have one day left.

225
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,559
I have a big announcement today.

226
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,200
Little Walnut, what is it?

227
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,440
No idea.

228
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,759
Do you know what it is?

229
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:08,639
Jianwei, come here.

230
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,840
Everyone, tomorrow is an auspicious day.

231
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,720
I'll hold a ceremony,

232
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,320
pay respects to the dead,

233
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:23,159
and officially name Li Jianwei

234
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,879
as my foster son.

235
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,720
Foster son?

236
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:28,639
Silly boy,

237
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,840
what are you waiting for?

238
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,279
Greet your foster father.

239
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,840
What? You don't want to?

240
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,000
Foster Father.

241
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,559
I object!

242
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:47,039
Young Master,
Jianwei is upright and virtuous.

243
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,399
He's born to lead.

244
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,519
Valley Master did this for...

245
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,679
Have you gotten senile?

246
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,799
You said he's born to lead?

247
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,000
Are you calling me

248
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,799
a petty thief and scoundrel?

249
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:58,360
I...

250
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,559
Young Master, that's not what I mean.

251
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:04,320
You and Jianwei
have always been like brothers.

252
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,360
What's wrong with this arrangement?

253
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,600
He's no brother of mine.

254
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,600
Ghost Valley doesn't need
an outsider like him.

255
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,360
Let alone have Chen Dawang
name him as his foster son.

256
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:14,399
Xiaoxi.

257
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:14,720
