My leg.

22
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,200
Where are we?

23
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,680
What is this?

24
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,560
Love Lock.

25
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,080
Crazy woman, unlock this now!

26
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,759
Love Lock binds love and life.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,680
Only when one dies

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,960
can the other be free.

29
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,800
Since he won't kill you,

30
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,680
you two can kill each other.

31
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,759
Despicable.

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
You old hag, have you lost your mind?

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,360
Oh right,
your old lover told me about you.

34
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,560
Want to hear about it?

35
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,199
What did he say?

36
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,479
It was so explicit.

37
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,159
I dare not say it out loud.

38
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,039
How about you come closer?

39
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,319
Tell me!

40
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,599
My eyes!

41
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,520
You jerks lied to me again!

42
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,400
Is she dead?

43
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,399
She was quite pretty

44
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,160
but died looking hideous.

45
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:48,959
She probably hated us to the core.

46
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,480
(Though I don't know)

47
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,560
(your relation to my father,)

48
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,079
(nor why you hated him,)

49
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,920
(I hope you let go of your grudges)

50
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,480
(in the afterlife.)

51
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,399
Valley Master!

52
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,800
Little Walnut.
It's Little Walnut's voice!

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,560
Little Walnut.

54
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,000
Little Walnut, are you alright?

55
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,279
Where's Young Master and Jianwei?

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,399
Valley Master, save Xiaoxi and Jianwei.

57
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,720
Hurry and save them.

58
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,560
Do you know where they are?

59
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,480
Blossom Manor.

60
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,360
Valley Master, hurry and save them.

61
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,120
Where is Blossom Manor?

62
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,680
We've never heard of it.

63
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,319
Little Walnut, do you know

64
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,759
who kidnapped you?

65
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,959
Her name is Wan Qianhong.

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,839
She owns Blossom Manor.

67
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,319
Speaking of, she also gave me this.

68
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,800
Little Walnut, leave.

69
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,279
I'm not your mother,

70
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,600
and you're not my daughter.

71
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,319
My daughter died long ago.

72
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,000
I knew it from the start.

73
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,480
This gold lock was for her.

74
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,639
Now I leave it to you,

75
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:23,360
as a token of our fate.

76
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,300
(Imperial Gift)

77
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,800
What should we do now?

78
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,360
What is this darn place?

79
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,800
Why do we keep circling back here?

80
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,240
We're back where we started.

81
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,000
Are we caught in a maze?

82
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,680
I'm done walking.

83
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,800
Our mistress doesn't know this item.

84
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,040
Please leave.

85
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,120
(Yuan, do you still resent me?)

86
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,439
Please inform your mistress.

87
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,959
If she won't see me,

88
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,360
I shall kneel here forever.

89
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,279
Take a break.

90
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,480
There are no ghosts.

91
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,190
This place has traps
of Five Elements and Eight Trigrams.

92
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:59,360
We just can't figure it out yet.

93
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,079
Jianwei, are we heroes

94
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,240
going to die here?

95
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,560
If someone came to collect our bodies,

96
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,959
will they think we're her lovers?

97
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,319
That'd be unfair for us.

98
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,040
Talk nonsense again and I'll hit you.

99
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,639
I'm just kidding.

100
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,720
Jianwei, stop pressing on me.
My hand is numb.

101
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,480
I'm not.

102
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,120
What's going on?

103
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,559
Maybe I was poisoned

104
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,000
when Wan Qianhong bit me.

105
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,480
Wake up. Don't sleep.

106
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,080
We'll be out soon.

107
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,919
We'll be out soon.

108
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,879
Li Yan, are you here for my life?

109
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:10,639
Take my life if you must.

110
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,759
Don't take Jianwei's.

111
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,840
This has nothing to do with him.

112
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,559
Chen Xiaoxi, wake up.

113
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,879
Don't talk nonsense.

114
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:20,360
No one's taking your life.
You're hard to kill.

115
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,559
Jianwei.

116
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,639
It's so dark.

117
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,639
Your face shows doom and sorrow.

118
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,120
You'll lose your loved ones.

119
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,919
In ten steps, blood will spill.

120
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,679
In three days, all your family will die.

121
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,240
As the saying goes,

122
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,039
you reap what you sow.

123
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,759
You brought this on yourself.

124
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,279
Why is it you?

125
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,840
I'm the one who can save your family.

126
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,320
Do you like this wine?

127
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,080
If you do,

128
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,159
I'll send two more jars next year.

129
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,639
Remember when you said

130
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,879
in Rong City

131
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,039
that hatred should end after death?

132
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,080
Since you've had revenge,

133
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,639
why shame him again?

134
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,279
(Li Pu)

135
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,120
Jianwei,

136
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,159
you're right.

137
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:51,440
Dust to dust, earth to earth.

138
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,159
Let everything end here.

139
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,080
Chen Xiaoxi.

140
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,639
Are you alright? Feeling better?

141
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,600
There are no herbs here.

142
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,519
I can only seal your blood veins

143
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,399
to drive out some poison.

144
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,759
Sure.

145
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,759
Chat with me.

146
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,720
I'm afraid I won't wake up if I sleep.

147
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,360
Sure, talk. I'll listen.

148
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,039
That's not what I meant.

149
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,600
I dreamed of the wordless monument
on Jianwei Mountain.

150
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,240
Wordless monument?

151
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,000
Didn't you ask

152
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,240
about the story behind it?

153
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,639
Stop talking. You can tell me

154
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,000
when we're out.

155
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,240
My father, mother,

156
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,000
and the brothers from Jianwei Mountain

157
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,159
are all there.

158
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,360
Why is it nameless?

159
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,000
Because there's too many names to carve.

160
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,919
That's why I put up this monument.

161
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Chen Dawang said

162
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,039
their names need not be carved.

163
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,240
They should be remembered in our hearts

164
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,440
and recorded in history.

165
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,120
History?

166
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,720
A lousy fortune-teller like you
won't get it.

167
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
What will Ghost Valley's brothers

168
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,480
do without me?

169
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:31,200
Jianwei, if we really can't escape,

170
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,240
do you have any final wishes?

171
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:35,480
Yes.

172
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,440
There's one mission I must finish,

173
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,600
but completing it
isn't up to me anymore.

174
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,679
What is it?

175
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,600
No matter what it is,

176
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,080
you have to make it out alive.

177
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,399
Or Little Walnut will be upset.

178
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,720
Really?

179
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:05,960
Jianwei,

180
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,799
what do you think of Little Walnut?

181
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,720
She's kind, smart,

182
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,279
and good-looking.

183
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,120
I think she treats you differently.

184
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,320
Why don't you be my brother-in-law?

185
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,039
Take care of her for me.

186
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,240
What kind of brother are you?

187
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,519
Take care of your own sister.

188
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,080
Jianwei,

189
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,279
I really want to see the world.

190
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,200
I want to hear tunes in Jiangnan,

191
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:48,799
take Shu Path and eat hot pot,

192
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,399
but I doubt I can now.

193
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,559
Go in my place.

194
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:00,320
Chen Xiaoxi, stop talking.

195
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,039
I'm just joking.

196
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,279
You're so easy to tease.

197
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:11,840
I forgot you're hurt too.

198
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,840
Nothing good happened after we met.

199
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,240
Maybe you're bad luck for me.

200
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,320
Looks like you never read your fate.

201
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,039
For every day

202
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,080
we're stuck here,

203
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,360
I'll be your friend for that day.

204
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,600
I want to be

205
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,759
your friend forever.

206
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:51,799
Alright, I'll teach you Li Family's Spear Skills

207
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,519
if we make it out of here.

208
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,279
Sure, I'll teach you
Chen Family's Sword Skills.

209
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,399
Then...

210
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,960
It's a deal.

211
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,360
You lousy fortune-teller,

212
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,399
I have one last request.

213
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,320
Go on.

214
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,519
If...

215
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,279
I'm saying

216
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:26,600
if I die,

217
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,960
you must take me
back to Jianwei Mountain

218
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,039
and bury me under the wordless monument.

219
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,120
Xiaoxi.

220
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,919
Xiaoxi!

221
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,720
Xiaoxi.
