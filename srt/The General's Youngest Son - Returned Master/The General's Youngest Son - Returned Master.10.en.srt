20
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,890
I noticed you haven't had
any decent outfits to wear

21
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,959
since your arrival here.

22
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,650
The one you were wearing yesterday
is broken too.

23
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,280
No.

24
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,120
Take it back.

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,959
It's a gift for you.
How could I take it back?

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,719
Hurry up.

27
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,159
Put it on now.

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,359
Why?

29
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,040
Feeling shy?

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,120
Fine,

31
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,879
do it yourself.

32
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:07,879
I'll wait for you there.

33
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,280
Silly you.
You don't even know how to tie it.

34
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,560
Here, I'll give you a hand.

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,520
Did you hear what I said in my dream?

36
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,879
Yes, I could hear you loud and clear.

37
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,400
What?

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,759
You said you weren't Li Jianwei.

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,479
You're...

40
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,439
What?

41
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:36,919
You're a darned fortune-teller.

42
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:39,560
Duh.

43
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,599
There, there. I'm just teasing you.

44
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,560
Stay still.

45
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,520
I'll be done in a while.

46
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,199
Not bad.

47
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,080
You look dashing.

48
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,840
But you're still a bit less than me.

49
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,710
What are you doing?

50
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,039
I've gifted you a new outfit.

51
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,159
Leave my wolf fang alone.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,479
(He actually cares a lot
about this wolf fang.)

53
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,639
(Forget it.)

54
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,639
(You'll eventually die along with it.)

55
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,159
You jerk!

56
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,680
What exactly have you done to her?

57
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,919
I'll fight you to death!

58
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,560
What's got into you, Stone?

59
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:22,599
You scoundrel.

60
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,759
I knew you're up to no good!

61
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,759
Let him explain himself, Young Master.

62
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,159
What's really happened, Jianwei?

63
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,639
You still refuse to admit it, huh?

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,599
Young Master.

65
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,120
Little Walnut

66
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,319
has gone missing!

67
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,560
Little Walnut!

68
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,520
Little Walnut!

69
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,800
Little Walnut!

70
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,159
Little Walnut!

71
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,000
You can't go there.

72
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,240
Why not?

73
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,039
Is there some dark secret behind it?

74
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,159
That's...

75
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:56,719
What's it?

76
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,159
Is there anything more important
than finding Little Walnut?

77
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,520
I don't mean it that way.

78
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,520
If so, let's check it out.

79
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,000
Jianwei!

80
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,079
What's happened? Who did this to you?

81
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,800
I went to look into the Ghost Valley

82
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,240
as per Young Master's instructions.

83
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,800
Unexpectedly,

84
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,120
I ran into a martially skilled woman.

85
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
A woman?

86
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,360
And this flower

87
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,800
belongs to her.

88
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,240
It's such a strange-looking flower.

89
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,360
Your Highness.

90
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,319
There's another thing
that I don't understand.

91
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,279
Since your return from Rong City,

92
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,560
something seems
to be bothering you all the time.

93
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,360
Twenty years ago,

94
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,920
I thought this friend of mine

95
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,000
perished in the battlefield,

96
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,000
becoming a wandering soul.

97
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,000
Looks like

98
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,000
some of them

99
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,480
did survive that war.

100
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:41,240
Do you mean the Zhongyong Army's rebellion
happened 20 years ago?

101
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,439
I saved Yan

102
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,639
out of kindness.

103
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,680
It didn't expect

104
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,399
fate would play a trick on us all.

105
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,439
Forget it, Si Yu.

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,500
You need not travel
to the Ghost Valley again.

107
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,920
Focus on your recovery for now.

108
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,519
Yes, Your Highness.

109
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,639
What's this unmarked monument about?

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,120
That's a long story.

111
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,639
Just tell me the gist of it, then.

112
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,920
Finding Little Walnut is our priority.

113
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,439
I'll tell you about it
if there's the chance, okay?

114
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,680
I bet you don't know
how to break it to me.

115
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,680
Indeed.

116
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,360
I'm an outsider after all.

117
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,000
I've never seen you as an outsider.

118
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,680
It's just that

119
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,639
there's a long story to this monument.

120
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,639
Once we've located Little Walnut,

121
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,240
I'll tell you everything. Okay?

122
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,600
Come here, Young Master!

123
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,920
What's it, Stone?

124
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:06,879
Young Master.

125
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,000
That's Little Walnut's bamboo basket.

126
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,759
But she's nowhere to be found.

127
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,439
Li Jianwei.

128
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,800
What did you say to her yesterday?

129
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,879
If anything happens to Little Walnut,

130
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,199
I won't spare you!

131
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:20,759
Yesterday?

132
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,680
Little Walnut.

133
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,160
Don't be too nice to me.

134
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,639
Got it?

135
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,480
Not at all.

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,639
Forget it.

137
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,800
You'll never understand it.

138
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:43,920
Anyway,

139
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,639
you need not do so.

140
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,800
Jianwei.

141
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,279
Do you find me annoying

142
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,480
like Stone does?

143
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,920
Li Jianwei.
How could you call her annoying?

144
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,839
I had too much to drink last night.

145
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,040
Really?

146
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,399
Stone!

147
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,439
Now isn't the time
to blame Jianwei for it.

148
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,519
What matters is find her.

149
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,240
Young Master, don't you think
the Ghost Valley has changed

150
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,040
since his arrival here?

151
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,879
What are you talking about, Stone?

152
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,959
Have you ever seen
Little Walnut being this upset?

153
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,279
Also,

154
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,480
you hang around with him all the time,

155
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,920
always defending him.

156
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,279
Valley Master has been in low spirits,

157
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,079
but you've never shown your concern.

158
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,199
Stop talking nonsense, Stone.

159
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,680
That's got nothing to do with Jianwei.

160
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,920
Little Walnut got upset and left

161
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,120
because he gave her the cold shoulder.

162
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,160
Since when the Ghost Valley's
started mistreating its own kind

163
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,519
over some outsider?

164
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,279
Jianwei is already one of us.

165
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
He's our brother.

166
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,600
Brother?

167
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,919
Young Master.

168
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,799
You actually see this outsider
as a brother?

169
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,919
Don't you worry.

170
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
I'll bring Little Walnut home

171
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,200
unharmed.

172
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,320
Drop your act already!

173
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,840
We've never been on the same page,

174
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,600
so why pretending to be nice?

175
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,559
Shut up, Stone.

176
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,600
Young Master!

177
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,000
He's a mere con man
that popped out of nowhere.

178
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,399
Don't fall into his trap.

179
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,360
Aren't you curious about

180
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,480
his origin at all?

181
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,279
Why are you all defending him?

182
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:00,919
I'm not.

183
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:04,170
No? I guess
you've been bewitched by him,

184
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,039
and you're too deep into it.

185
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,720
You're just denying it!

186
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,399
S... Stone.

187
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,240
Young Master.

188
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,120
I...

189
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,320
Young Master!

190
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,960
Are you alright?

191
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,039
What's the matter with you,
Young Master?

192
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,720
Is your migraine acting up again?

193
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,799
It was all my fault.

194
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,960
I shouldn't have said those harsh words.

195
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,679
I'm fine. Don't mind me.

196
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,000
We have to find her first.

197
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,159
Yes, Young Master.

198
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,679
I'll search the back mountain.

199
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:33,360
Sure.

200
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,759
Li Jianwei.

201
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,480
Take good care of our young master

202
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,200
or I'll settle all the scores with you.

203
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,320
Go now.

204
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,159
Jianwei.

205
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,279
I never thought you knew how to do this.

206
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,279
Just how many things
are you keeping from me?

207
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,000
My father suffered from migraine too.

208
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,159
I'd give him a massage

209
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,000
whenever it acted up.

210
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
I see.

211
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,639
Thank you, Jianwei.

212
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,639
I feel much better.

213
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:17,639
Jianwei.

214
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,240
Don't blame Stone.

215
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,480
He grew up together with Little Walnut.

216
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,039
They share a deep bond.

217
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,320
He said what he said
because he got worked up.

218
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:33,879
It's alright. It was my fault after all.

219
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,480
Where could Little Walnut be?

220
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,159
Someone could help us.

221
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,519
Aunt Qing.

222
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,320
Yan.

223
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,360
Have a seat.

224
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,639
Where is your young master?

225
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:02,879
This is a sudden visit,

226
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,399
so I had him wait outside.

227
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,720
Ask him to come in.

228
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,200
I'd like to meet him.

229
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,759
Why do you want to see him?

230
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,120
Yan, since you're going
to stay in the mountain,

231
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,720
I'd like to meet them.

232
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:20,279
Rest assured. I know what to do.

233
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,300
(Moonlight shines bright,
stars grow faint)

234
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,240
Since you're Jianwei's friend,

235
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,639
I won't beat around the bush, then.

236
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,080
My sister has gone missing.

237
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,519
Who are you, wild brat?

238
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,639
How unruly of you.

239
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:55,159
You!

240
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,080
Calm down.

241
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,840
(He doesn't look like Chen Wang at all.)

242
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,159
(I bet he's not his child.)

243
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:05,840
Aunt Qing.

244
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,130
All this happened all of a sudden,

245
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,080
and we had no choice.

246
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,200
Xiaoxi cares much about his sister.

247
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,840
We're not sure if she's safe.

248
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,440
Be sincere when asking for a favor.

249
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,840
I don't see he cares much about her.

250
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,000
What do you mean by that?

251
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,879
We came to ask for your help sincerely,

252
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,200
but you're giving us a hard time.

253
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,159
Let's go, Jianwei.

254
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,080
Calm down, Xiaoxi.

255
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,600
Locating Little Walnut
is our priority now.

256
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,159
Only Aunt Qing can help us now.

257
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,600
Aunt Qing.

258
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,519
Please do us this favor.

259
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,919
I'll kneel.

260
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Jianwei. What is this?

261
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,279
You should ask
for the Bodhisattva's help instead.

262
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,279
Calm down now, Xiaoxi.

263
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,960
If so,

264
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,919
you may leave.

265
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,200
Life is but unpredictable.
A man meets both fortune and misfortune.

266
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,639
All this is the cycle of karma.

267
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:01,360
Pardon me for my rudeness, Aunt Qing.

268
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,720
I said what I said

269
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,519
because I was worried about my sister.

270
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,519
Please don't it

271
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
to heart.

272
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,080
Forget it.

273
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,200
Get up.

274
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,320
Give it to me.

275
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:24,360
Aunt Qing.

276
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,840
We found this at the spot
where Little Walnut went missing.

277
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:35,240
Wait for me.

278
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,080
This is infuriating.

279
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:46,399
Jianwei.

280
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,399
If it hadn't been for your sake,

281
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,600
I'd have hacked her.

282
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:50,399
Also,

283
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,240
is she even reliable?

284
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,799
If she got in our way

285
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,799
and anything happened to Little Walnut,

286
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:56,639
I wouldn't let her get away with it!

287
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,039
Don't you believe me?

288
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,200
I do believe you.

289
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,679
But...

290
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,360
Open it.

291
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,759
What's this?

292
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,960
Where did this beauty come from?

293
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,200
How lovely.

294
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,440
She's beautiful.

295
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,240
How pretty.

296
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,919
Who are you people?

297
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,279
Don't come near!

298
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:52,519
This is strange.

299
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,039
It's actually a woman.

300
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,720
You're scaring her.

301
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:11,480
You.

302
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,279
