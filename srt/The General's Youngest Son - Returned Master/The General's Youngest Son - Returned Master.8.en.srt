The Li family had it coming.

Jianwei.

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:49,840
Chen Dawang.

23
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,200
You've had too much to drink.

24
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,920
Don't take it to heart, Jianwei.

25
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,319
We had our reasons.

26
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,959
I'll explain it to you after this
if I have the chance.

27
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,799
It's getting late.

28
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,879
Head back and get some rest.

29
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,680
Aunt Qing?

30
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,080
Why?

31
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
Just why?

32
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,039
You promised
to help me kill the enemies,

33
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,240
but why did you stop me?

34
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,039
Yan.

35
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:39,000
I didn't mean to stop you,

36
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,800
but I had no choice.

37
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,280
I'm afraid it's not as simple
as we think it is.

38
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,199
So what?

39
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,479
They massacred my whole family.
Don't they deserve death?

40
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,879
Or

41
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,719
you've always been in cahoots with them?

42
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,439
Calm down, Yan.

43
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,230
If you're going to kill them,
you need to figure out the truth first.

44
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,520
Aren't you curious

45
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,800
about the feud
between their family and yours

46
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,800
and the reason why they killed?

47
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,719
The heavens are clear,
the sun and moon shine bright.

48
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:12,120
The wise see things as clearly as fire.

49
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,360
They perceive the big picture
from the tiniest clues.

50
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,120
To see the big picture...

51
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,599
Yan.

52
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,360
I've done you wrong tonight.

53
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,479
I'm aware you're full of doubts.

54
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,800
However, please believe me.

55
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,039
I will get to the bottom of it.

56
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,879
Sure.

57
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,599
If so,

58
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,639
I must find out the truth.

59
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:43,639
If they die,

60
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,360
I will make sure they die knowing why.

61
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,280
Well,

62
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,759
are you going back
to Jianwei Mountain with them after this?

63
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:27,759
This day last year, right at this gate,

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,279
her face and the peach blossoms
reflected each other's glow.

65
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,480
But now her face is nowhere to be found,

66
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,000
while the peach blossoms
still smile as before.

67
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,000
Stop right there!

68
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,240
Chen Wang.

69
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,240
You've got the wrong person.

70
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,600
Even if I've got the wrong person,

71
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
how do you explain
this wrist guard you're wearing?

72
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,879
You're still alive,

73
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,560
but why didn't you come to me?

74
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,560
It's been 20 years.

75
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,560
I thought you'd been gone for 20 years!

76
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,399
The culprit was right in front of you.

77
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,600
But why couldn't you avenge it?

78
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,680
How unfilial of you, Li Yan!

79
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,759
Father.

80
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,800
Mother.

81
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,279
What exactly should I do?

82
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,600
Please tell me.

83
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,399
How do you face all this?

84
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,199
Yan, though it's
a treacherous path ahead,

85
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,439
you must overcome all obstacles
and keep moving forward.

86
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,560
Remember.

87
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,800
There will come a time
when the long winds break the waves.

88
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,040
And you shall hoist your sails high
to cross the vast sea.

89
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,199
Got it, Father.

90
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:22,800
Great.

91
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,840
There will come a time
when the long winds break the waves.

92
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,200
And you shall hoist your sails high
to cross the vast sea.

93
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,200
(What is he doing here?)

94
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,279
Li Yan.

95
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,840
Blame it on that evil father of yours.

96
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,039
He's the reason
why you live such a miserable life.

97
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,879
My brother, Li Jianwei, had no choice

98
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,120
but to kill you today.

99
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,519
He's both innocent and kind.

100
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,080
He should've stayed out of our feud.

101
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,440
Today, I came to pay respect to you.

102
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,639
I hope you'd let go of your grudge

103
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,480
and reincarnate soon.

104
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,279
(What a hypocrite.)

105
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,360
Don't you resent Li Jianwei.

106
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,440
If you still hold a grudge

107
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,399
and intend to take revenge,

108
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:49,639
just come and see me
at the Ghost Valley.

109
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,200
I'm not scared of you.

110
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,320
(He's doing this for me?)

111
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,559
(No.)

112
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,879
(He's just trying
to make himself feel better.)

113
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,039
Jianwei? It's you.

114
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,840
I didn't hear you at all.

115
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,879
You just killed him.

116
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,000
And now you're here
to pay respect to him.

117
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,720
We only live once, just as grass
and trees last but one autumn.

118
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,600
Since he's gone,

119
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,320
to me,

120
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,799
the past is in the past.

121
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,879
Indeed.

122
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:10,960
He's dead after all.

123
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,879
And you're still being a hypocrite here!

124
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,000
(You'll know)

125
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,440
(what it feels like to lose your family
sooner or later.)

126
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:26,519
You don't understand.

127
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,919
Some spend their whole life

128
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,080
fulfilling their own duties.

129
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:46,960
You should pay respect to him too.

130
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,840
Especially that young master
of the Li family.

131
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,399
That's the one you killed.

132
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,120
Well,

133
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,759
he was around our age.

134
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,919
After all,

135
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,799
what did he have to do

136
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,879
with the past generation's feud?

137
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,519
Then why did you kill them?

138
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,759
To bring justice to them.

139
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,080
Them?

140
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:29,240
Justice?

141
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,360
Jianwei.

142
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,360
Look at that plant.

143
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,759
Even though it's as fragile
as a wild goose feather,

144
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,500
and it can't withstand
the wind and rain,

145
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,480
they still stand strong.

146
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,000
Even if it scatters with the wind
across the wild hills,

147
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:54,440
it will still return next spring.

148
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,480
Justice always prevails.

149
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,440
One day,

150
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:08,399
Li Pu's crimes will be exposed!

151
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,960
(What exactly did you do, Father?)

152
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,360
Here, eat up!

153
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:40,879
Everyone, eat.

154
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,159
Come on...

155
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:42,919
Fill the cups!

156
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,080
Hey, fill the cups. Quick.

157
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,799
Drink!

158
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:46,639
Here, drink up!

159
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,679
Brothers.

160
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,080
Today, Jianwei helped us avenge it.

161
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,279
From now on, he's one of us!

162
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,399
Yes, he's now one of us!

163
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,519
Everyone, eat your fill!

164
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,440
Jianwei.

165
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:59,279
You've done us a huge favor.

166
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
- That's right.
- Absolutely.

167
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,480
I suggest

168
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:03,399
we toast to Jianwei!

169
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,840
Yes! Here, to Jianwei.

170
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Come on!

171
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,480
Cheers!

172
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,320
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

173
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,519
Drink up.

174
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,399
Here, bottoms up.

175
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,159
Fill the cup.

176
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,240
(My family was slaughtered by you all.)

177
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,690
(Yet you're here
feasting and drinking in joy.)

178

raze the Ghost Valley to the ground.)
