00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:48,439
My old friend,
please make sure Yan is safe and sound.

21
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,519
Your Highness, are you alright?

22
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,000
Yan went alone into danger.

23
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,479
If anything were to happen,

24
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,840
the last surviving bloodline
of the Li family

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,120
would be gone for good.

26
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,599
Rumor has it

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,759
twenty years ago,
the Ghost Valley was home

28
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,080
a group of ruthless killers.

29
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,759
But for some reason,

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,560
(Si Yu)
they've vanished for years.

31
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,960
Their sudden reappearance now
is nothing but strange.

32
00:02:42,112 --> 00:02:42,956
(Deputy Commissioner Qingyuan,
Commander of the Zhongyong Army)

33
00:02:42,957 --> 00:02:43,800
(at the Battle of Jianwei Mountain
20 Years Ago)

34
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,781
(Chang'an Supervision Bureau's reinvestigation
into the Chen Shan rebellion.)

35
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:45,762
(This is an imperial decree,
no mistakes allowed.)

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,599
Why would the court suddenly reopen
such an old case?

37
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,759
Have you made your decision?

38
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,199
If you wish to leave,
we'll escort you down the mountain.

39
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,319
Yes, as they say,
friends are made after a fight.

40
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,759
I was in the wrong yesterday.
I shouldn't have acted recklessly.

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,120
It was all just a misunderstanding.

42
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,990
I've asked our men
to prepare you generous gifts

43
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,360
and see you off.

44
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,639
A true man keeps his word.

45
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,120
I'm staying in the Ghost Valley.

46
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,599
Here, have a seat first.

47
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,719
Listen, there's no outsiders here.

48
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
So you need not feel shy.

49
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,360
I'll walk you out myself.
No one will stop you.

50
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,520
If nothing else, stay a few more days.

51
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,639
You may leave
once you've thought things through.

52
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,919
My mind is made up.
You don't have to persuade me.

53
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,680
Even if it means death, I won't leave.

54
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,800
Jianwei, we're all brothers here.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,039
Why not reconsider?

56
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,080
Forget about it.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,800
Jianwei.

58
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,080
We're not enemies.

59
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,280
Let's just be friends.

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,080
If you're in trouble,

61
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,159
just let me know.

62
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,520
As long as I can help,

63
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,680
I absolutely will.

64
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,520
Really?

65
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,959
Of course. I'm a man of my word.

66
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:17,959
Then I'm staying.

67
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,040
Fine, you've got guts.

68
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,560
I respect you for that.

69
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,600
Stone.

70
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,720
If you really want to stay,
take this liquor.

71
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,600
We'll be brothers from now on.

72
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:01,279
How do you find this liquor?
You like it?

73
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,639
If you do,

74
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,639
I'll gift you two more jars
next Qingming Festival.

75
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,600
Keep your stance steady.
Aim with precision.

76
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,920
Don't be discouraged, Yan.

77
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,759
The world is dangerous.
Everywhere is a battlefield.

78
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,519
Bear this in mind. Wherever you are,

79
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,160
even in desperate straits,

80
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,959
don't give up easily.

81
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,839
Why? Is this concoction for him?

82
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,079
I don't know Chen Dawang was thinking.

83
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,120
He suddenly switched out the poison.

84
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,759
Xiaoxi,
Valley Master must have his reasons.

85
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,759
Besides,
I don't think Jianwei is a bad person.

86
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,439
Yes, he's not, but I am. Huh?

87
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,000
If you hadn't wandered off back then,

88
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,920
I never would've run into that jinx.

89
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,600
Don't call him that, Xiaoxi.

90
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:55,360
Perhaps you were fated
to meet each other.

91
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:58,319
Well, I need to go now.
The concoction's getting cold.

92
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,319
Wait!

93
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,900
How about I deliver him this concoction

94
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,600
as an apology for him?

95
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,160
Well, be polite with him.

96
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:09,759
Rest assured. I'll take good care of him.

97
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,959
You may leave now.

98
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:14,959
Go ahead.

99
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,920
Li Jianwei, my father respects you
as a man of honor.

100
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,639
He's agreed to let you stay for now.

101
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,000
From today on, you belong to me.

102
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,439
This is...

103
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,360
This is the concoction
I personally prepared for you.

104
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,680
Take it now.

105
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,000
Thank you for the trouble, Young Master.

106
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,839
From this day forward,
I will serve the Young Master loyally

107
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:29,930
and obey your every order.

108
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,000
Li Jianwei, my father respects you
as a man of honor.

109
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,400
He has agreed to let you stay for now.

110
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,919
From today on, you belong to me.

111
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,840
This is the concoction
I personally prepared for you.

112
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,000
Take it now.

113
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,480
What are you staring at?
If you're scared, don't take it.

114
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,000
Of course I trust Valley Master.
It's just that...

115
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,919
What?

116
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:23,759
I may not be worthy
of your kindness, Your Master.

117
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,399
Do you want me to feed it to you?

118
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,120
Don't push your luck.

119
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,720
It's such a shame
to let this concoction go to waste.

120
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,639
Li Jianwei, you...

121
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,000
Just you wait!

122
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,320
Xiaoxi!

123
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,080
What are you doing?

124
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,919
What are you staring at?
Get back to work

125
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,039
or that'll be your ending.

126
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,399
(He's just trying to scare me
into backing down.)

127
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,399
(Although it's hard
to tell these bandits )

128
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,080
(are those men in black)

129
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,159
(based on that arrowhead alone,)

130
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,240
(they certainly can't be ruled out.)

131
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,480
(I need to find another way)

132
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,240
(to do a thorough investigation.)

133
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,360
Come on, drink! Here, bottoms up!

134
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,200
Cheers!

135
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,960
Drink it!

136
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,090
That smells so good, I'm hungrier now.

137
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,519
Alright! Cheers, bottoms up!

138
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,399
There's plenty to go around. Eat up!

139
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,720
There's more!

140
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,240
This liquor's richer
than the last batch.

141
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,290
Just the smell is intoxicating.

142
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,159
Pour the liquor!

143
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,279
Move! Don't you know your place?

144
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,519
You think you deserve a seat here?

145
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,200
Sit here, Little Walnut.

146
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,600
Stone, don't be rude to Jianwei.

147
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,000
Or I won't talk to you anymore.

148
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:20,799
Sit over there.

149
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,200
You may sit here, Jianwei.

150
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,200
Here, Mr. Chai!

151
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,519
- Take this
- It's for you.

152
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,679
Jianwei.

153
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,000
- Here.
- Have some flatbread! Fresh off the stove!

154
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,039
Stone, pass these around.

155
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,120
Mr. Chai.

156
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:40,800
Here, share them around.

157
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,600
Young Master.

158
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,360
I'll have one.

159
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,200
- Here you go.
- Got it.

160
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:45,639
Give me one too.

161
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,720
You want it?

162
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,399
Go pick it up yourself, then.

163
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,000
Come on, cheers! Bottoms up!

164
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,159
Here!

165
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,440
You've gone too far.

166
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,080
Why? Are you mad?

167
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,600
I'd rather feed it to a dog
than letting you have it.

168
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,639
I'm not talking about you. Eat up.

169
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,080
Look! That's a sky lantern!

170
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,039
