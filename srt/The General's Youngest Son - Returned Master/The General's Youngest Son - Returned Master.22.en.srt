my life!

22
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,719
It's not your fault.

23
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,319
Don't do anything foolish!

24
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,000
Xiaoxi.

25
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,800
I misunderstood you these past days.

26
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,960
You can deal with him

27
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,240
however you want.

28
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
I killed Li Yan with my own hands once.

29
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,560
Since he survived it,

30
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,120
it must be heaven's will.

31
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:54,000
I've long decided
to let go of past hatred.

32
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,159
Since you want to follow me,

33
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,560
I acknowledge him as Li Jianwei,

34
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,120
not Li Yan.

35
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,680
By Zhongyong Army law,

36
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,599
he'll be punished with 20 strikes

37
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,039
and driven off the mountain.

38
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,879
Young Master, that's too light.

39
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,159
As the saying goes,
the son must pay his father's debt.

40
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,960
We should kill him
in front of the monument

41
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,000
to bring peace
to the fallen souls of Zhongyong Army.

42
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,360
Yes, kill him!

43
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,639
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

44
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,439
My decision is final.

45
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,919
Why does Chen Weishan's son

46
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,599
look like...

47
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,120
Carry out the punishment.

Yan, I'll take you down the mountain
once you wake up.

70
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,079
From now on,

71
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,120
forget everything that happened here.

72
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,639
It's my fault
for not taking good care of you.

73
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,600
Once Yan wakes up,

74
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,319
I'll take him away.

75
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,560
Fate is cruel.

76
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,160
He and Xiaoxi were born
the same day, month, and year.

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,519
If not for Li Pu's sins,

78
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,720
they could've been sworn brothers.

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,600
Same day, month, and year?

80
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,480
You mean Wanniang and Huiniang

81
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,040
gave birth in the army at the same time?

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,639
Wanniang and Huiniang
were birth sisters.

83
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,920
Who would've known

84
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,199
life could be so unpredictable?

85
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:55,420
(20 Years Ago,
Year 7 of Yongning, Winter)

86
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,360
Alright.

87
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,040
Here.

88
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,040
Let me wipe your little feet clean.

89
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,319
Here.

90
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,240
Let me, Wanniang.

91
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,680
Here.

92
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,060
(Huiniang, Li Pu's Wife)

93
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,680
Wanniang, I feel uneasy.

94
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,120
Pu broke military rules this time.

95
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,759
Even if Brother-in-Law forgives him,

96
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,160
he'll likely face punishment
back in the capital.

97
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,079
Don't mention him.

98
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,519
You just gave birth,
yet he hadn't even asked once.

99
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,160
Even with such an urgent military matter,

100
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,276
(Wanniang, Chen Weishan's Wife)
he delayed for days.

101
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,759
Alright, enough about this.

102
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,720
Why didn't you bring the new cloak

103
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,839
you sewed for the baby?

104
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,000
I'll go get it.

105
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,439
I'll be right back.

106
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,600
Be good.

107
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,440
What's going on outside?

108
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,240
Are you alright?

109
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm fine.

110
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,679
Tell me what's happening outside.

111
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,480
Madam.

112
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,759
Li Pu has rebelled.

113
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,120
General sent me
to protect you and the child.

114
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,759
What? Li Pu?

115
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,679
No.

116
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,519
We're safe.

117
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,159
Li Pu made up his mind.

118
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,440
It's do or die for him.

119
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,159
Chen Wang, go help General.

120
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,519
Quick!

121
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840

122
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480

123
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,080
Yes!

124
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,080
Alright.

125
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,679
Here.

126
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,559
Don't cry.

127
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,559
Don't cry.

128
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,320
How could your father be so cruel?

129
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,360
We're family after all,

130
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,159
aren't we?

131
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:54,720
Be good.

132
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:55,799
Don't cry.

133
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,279
Don't cry.

134
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,440
Don't cry.

135
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,600
Sweet baby.

136
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,039
Don't cry.

137
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,600
Madam, run!

138
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,919
General!

139
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,279
My baby.

140
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,360
Madam!

141
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,960
After all that,
you still managed to fall asleep?

142
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,440
Leave the mountain once you wake up.

143
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,879
Everyone despises Li Pu to the core.

144
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,000
20 beatings won't kill you,

145
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,159
but who's to say

146
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,759
someone won't sneak in to stab you.

147
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,519
You

148
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,879
really are stubborn.

149
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,080
At first, I really wanted

150
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,639
to feed you to the wolves.

151
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,879
But you know what?

152
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,240
Since you brought back that fang,

153
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,200
you've earned my respect.

154
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,200
You're still stubborn,
even when wounded.

155
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,799
Should I call you Li Yan

156
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,639
or Li Jianwei?

157
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,879
Or will you take another name

158
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,320
and continue deceiving others?

159
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,240
