20
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,159
I'm just checking
what you're capable of.

21
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,400
In case you make a mistake

22
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,799
and drag Ghost Valley down with you.

23
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,599
Seems like you don't trust me.

24
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,519
You lousy fortune-teller.

25
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,719
Can you do this or not?

26
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,359
If you can't,

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
just give up now.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,319
I'll protect you later.

29
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,759
Shut up.

30
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,680
They mean harm.

31
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,520
Since you're here,

32
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,039
you might as well come out.

33
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,159
(They really came.)

34
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,240
You're the one I'm here for today.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,919
He's said he's here for you.

36
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,000
No, he's here for you.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,479
Yan is kind-hearted,

38
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,120
but those villains hide their abilities.

39
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,280
It's probably
not as simple as he thinks.

40
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,599
Someone was also
tailing him today in the forest.

41
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,479
I thought

42
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,360
sending him to kill

43
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,680
is a trap.

44
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,400
Si Yu.

45
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,599
Yes.

46
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,120
Head to Rong City and meet Young Master.

47
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,199
Understood.

48
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,560
Jianwei.

49
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,800
Jianwei.

50
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,879
Jianwei, are you alright?

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,879
Forget me.

52
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,199
Focus on the mission.

53
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,120
Stop talking.

54
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,319
Let me see your wound.

55
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,120
No, you keep bleeding.

56
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,319
We need to stop it.

57
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,400
Who saved us?

58
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,319
News from Ghost Valley.

59
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,240
Look.

60
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,537
(Kill Li Yan in Rong City)

61
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,319
Jianwei.

62
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,279
Jianwei!

63
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,240
Jianwei.

64
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,279
Jianwei.

65
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,199
Jianwei.

66
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,279
Are you alright?

67
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,040
Are you hurt?

68
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:49,680
Jianwei!

69
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:50,680
You...

70
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,319
You...

71
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,120
Stop talking.

72
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,120
I'll take you to Rong City.

73
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
We'll find a physician there.

74
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,560
Come on, get up.

75
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,959
(So I was the target all along.)

76
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,160
(How ridiculous.)

77
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,079
(Chen Xiaoxi, just wait.)

78
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,160
(I'll make all of Ghost Valley)

79
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,240
(pay in blood.)

80
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,160
Jianwei, hang in there.

81
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,680
(Go to hell.)

82
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,920
(Go to hell.)

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,839
Jianwei, are you alright?

84
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,680
Are you hurt?

85
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,319
This is my fault.

86
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,079
I'll get you physician now.

87
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,319
Your leg is hurt.

88
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,000
Forget me.

89
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,800
Jianwei, it's fine.

90
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,240
It's just a minor wound.

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,560
Jianwei.

92
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,199
Come on, just hang in there.

93
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,439
I told you to leave me!

94
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:16,519
Go!

95
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,439
Go!

96
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,160
Jianwei.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,839
Don't worry.

98
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,959
I won't abandon you.

99
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:23,839
Stay back.

100
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,360
Come closer and I'll kill you!

101
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,319
Calm down.

102
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,160
It's all my fault.

103
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,600
How about we find a physician?

104
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,240
A physician?

105
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,319
Ask him this.

106
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,360
If the seed has gone bad,

107
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,439
can it still be saved?

108
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:44,639
Of course.

109
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,639
If not, we'll descend the mountain
and buy new ones.

110
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,720
I'll carry it this time.

111
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,720
Alright?

112
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:52,959
Come on.

Is the physician around?

119
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,920
Come out and help!

Are you in a hurry to die

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,040
or someone at home died?

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,879
Physician, my friend is seriously hurt.

133
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,720
Save him.

134
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,199
Is he dead?

135
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,399
No? Come back tomorrow.

136
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,480
Will you save him?

137
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,839
You little brat.

138
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,519
You beg for help,

139
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,879
yet you threaten me?

140
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,600
If you kill me,

141
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,360
you can prepare his funeral.

142
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,319
Please.

143
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,079
Save him.

144
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,920
Forget it.

145
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,240
Here.

146
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,240
Get up.

147
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,639
I can see you're a loyal friend.

148
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,279
Bring him in.

149
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,519
Thank you.

150
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,639
Jianwei, get up.

151
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:44,137
(Li Residence)

152
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:58,360
Who would've expected
the victorious General Li

153
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:02,279
to meet such an end after retiring home?

154
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,360
If he had died
for the country and the people,

155
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,600
it would've been an honorable death.

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,320
Generals die after 100 battles
while warriors return after 10 years.

157
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,480
At least his soul returned home.

158
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,559
Some don't even have remains
left behind.

159
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,799
They even bear infamy forever.

160
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,960
You're kind to keep me by your side.

161
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,360
I swear to uncover the truth

162
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,879
and clear my elder's name.

163
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,120
Get up.

164
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,080
We take different paths
to the same goal.

165
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,279
No need for this.

166
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,639
How is Young Master?

167
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,080
He has arrived in Rong City

168
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,480
but was seriously injured yesterday.

169
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,200
But don't worry.

170
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,399
He's stable now.

171
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:54,159
Find a way to contact him

172
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,639
and have him come here for a meeting.

173
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,039
Since the Li family's massacre

174
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,399
is linked to Ghost Valley,

175
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,279
Chang'an Inspectorate won't sit idly by.

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,159
We'll prepare accordingly

177
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,960
and catch them in our trap.

178
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:07,399
Understood.

179
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,360
(Did he look after me all night?)

180
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,320
(This pity ruse worked.)

181
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,399
(But I almost slipped up in panic
last night.)

182
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,919
(Good thing it ended well.)

183
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,639
(Didn't expect this, did you?)

184
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,159
(The person you want to kill
is right in front of you.)

185
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,519
(Or should I kill you first?)

186
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
Jianwei, you're awake.

187
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,279
Do you want water?

188
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,080
I'll pour some for you.

189
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,039
It's a bit cold.

190
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,279
I'll get hot water for you.

191
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:03,399
No need.

192
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,519
How's your leg?

193
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,080
It's fine. Just a minor injury.

194
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,519
Don't believe me? 'll walk and show you.

195
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,440
No need.

196
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,120
Thanks for yesterday.

197
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,759
But

198
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,519
do you know
who the man at the ruined temple was?

199
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,679
Probably just some random thief.

200
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,320
He saw I had money and tried to rob me.

201
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,000
Is that so?

202
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,240
His skills match ours.

203
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,879
You sure he was just a thief?

204
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,720
Ask him yourself.

205
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,919
But

206
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,679
why did you risk your life for me?

207
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,200
I...

208
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,919
Since I've joined Ghost Valley,

209
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,840
I'll do anything for you.

210
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,679
The enemy last night was strong,

211
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,519
yet you only defended.

212
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,480
You held back.

213
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:08,639
You're acting out of ordinary.

214
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,879
We're on a mission.

215
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,360
If we go all out,

216
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:16,240
we might ruin Chen Dawang's mission.

217
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,200
I see.

218
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,720
I didn't expect

219
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,639
Rong City

220
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,720
to have such skilled thieves.

221
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Stop talking.

222
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,840
You must be hungry.

223
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,480
I've reheated the food several times.

224
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,799
Eat.
