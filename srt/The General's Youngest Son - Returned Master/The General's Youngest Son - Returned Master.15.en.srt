(Isn't this
Aunt Qing's secondary manor?)

21

(Did she save us?)

22
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,480
Chen Xiaoxi.

23
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,079
You're awake.

24
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,159
Valley Master, why are you here?

25
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:21,319
Chen Dawang, why are you here?

26
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,599
You're one to talk.

27
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,560
I sent you down the mountain to search,

28
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,960
yet you got lost yourself.

29
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,520
Please forgive him. It was an accident.

30
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,840
Jianwei, don't speak up for him.

31
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,680
How are you feeling?

32
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,919
Why care about him, not me?

33
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,039
He only has surface wounds.

34
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,280
I protected him.

35
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,319
Look at me.

36
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,840
I'm in so much pain.
My whole body hurts.

37
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,960
- Ouch.
- Brat, stop faking it.

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,680
Ouch. Let go.

39
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,960
Enough.

40
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,680
How do you two know each other?

41
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,680
Chen Dawang, not bad.

42
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,599
We're only old acquaintances.

43
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,039
Seems like you're both fine.

44
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,840
Rest for a few more days.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,159
I'll find a way

46
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,919
to break Love Lock.

47
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,159
(Strange.)

48
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,400
(Why would Aunt Qing know Chen Dawang?)

49
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,280
What now? Hurry.

50
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,800
My stomach hurts. I need the latrine.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,680
Go yourself.

52
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,039
Come on. How am I supposed to go alone?

53
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,120
Hurry.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,280
You just survived
and already need the latrine?

55
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,400
Are you hoping I die?

56
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,759
I didn't say that.
You're alive, aren't you?

57
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,520
Chen Wang.

58
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,000
All this time,

59
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,120
you knew I had many doubts,

60
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,639
but you kept avoiding them.

61
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,840
You don't trust me?

62
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,280
Yuan, I trust you.

63
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
You should trust me too.

64
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:16,839
When the time is right,
I'll tell you everything.

65
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,240
I'll hold nothing back.

66
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,800
When the time is right?

67
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,720
When will the time

68
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
be right?

69
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,720
You were gone 20 years.

70
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,399
You want me to wait another 20 years?

71
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,560
What really happened back then?

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,439
Why did you all hide in Ghost Valley
for 20 years?

73
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,399
What about the rumors
of Ghost Valley's thugs?

74
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,600
Why did Zhongyong Army rebel overnight?

75
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,639
What happened
during the battle of Jianwei Mountain?

76
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,120
How long will you hide it from me?

77
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,240
Ghost Valley

78
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,040
will no longer trouble you.

79
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,680
What's done is done.

80
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,279
These past few days

81
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,199
were more than I ever dared dream.

82
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,399
Please stop forcing me.

83
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,600
I forced you? Fine.

84
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,439
I'd rather you were dead.

85
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,000
Now on the chessboard,

86
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,920
the black and white pieces
are tangled together.

87
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,079
It's a stalemate.

88
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,079
But a stalemate
doesn't mean it's doomed.

89
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,279
A change of perspective
might revive the game.

90
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:53,000
If so, what's there to fear?

91
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,720
Should we stabilize this piece first?

92
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,720
Why not?

93
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,759
What fun is there in this?

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,199
Enough already!

95
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,639
Can you even unlock this thing?

96
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,040
I'm going to lose my mind!

97
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,720
Aunt Qing, one more game.

98
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,800
Aunt Qing, you already found the key.

99
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,959
This lock was forged by the army.

100
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,000
Though I don't know

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,560
how it ended up in Blossom Manor,

102
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,800
unlocking it isn't difficult.

103
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,680
Army?

104
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,199
If that's the case,

105
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,000
why didn't you unlock it during the day?

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,079
Yan, what are you planning now?

107
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,399
You seem to truly care about them.

108
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,560
They also treat you
with genuine sincerity.

109
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,519
Whatever happens,
I must avenge my family.

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,720
But I need to

111
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,439
understand the full story.

112
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,920
This lock mustn't be opened easily then.

113
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,079
We need to keep observing.

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,279
This round turned out
far harder than expected.

115
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,839
By the way, Aunt Qing,

116
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,720
how do you know Chen Dawang?

117
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,040
He's...

118
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,480
(The truth isn't clear yet.)

119
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,839
(If I tell him his identity now,)

120
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,959
(it will only cause more chaos.)

121
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
We met by chance in the martial world.

122
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,879
I had no idea he was the Valley Master.

123
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,279
Did you cancel the mission
because of him that day?

124
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,560
Don't worry. I won't stop you

125
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,639
if he's truly guilty.

126
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,960
Aunt Qing, one more thing.

127
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,200
Do you know about the past between
Blossom Manor's Wan Qianhong

128
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,879
and my father?

129
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,440
Wan Qianhong

130
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,159
and Li Pu?

131
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,759
Eat more.

132
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,000
You've been taking great care of us

133
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,200
these days.

134
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,799
We're not ungrateful.

135
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,840
As a junior, I offer a toast.

136
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,399
Let's toast Her Highness together.

137
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,799
Alright.

138
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,840
But last night,

139
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,440
I dreamed of an elderly god.

140
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,360
Guess

141
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,200
what he said to me in the dream?

142
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,919
What elderly god?

143
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:31,600
The elderly god guarding this Love Lock.

144
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,840
A treasure like this

145
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,120
is forged from North Sea steel

146
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,120
and is impossible to open.

147
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,720
It wouldn't be strange

148
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,279
if its spirit came to me in a dream.

149
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
So what did the elderly god say?

150
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,080
He told me

151
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,480
that the key to Love Lock

152
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:55,399
is with a fox demon.

153
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,159
And that fox demon

154
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,679
is in this courtyard.

155
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,200
If I find that fox demon,

156
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,559
I can unlock Love Lock.

157
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,159
Chen Xiaoxi, stop fooling around.

158
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,480
Aunt Qing, I almost forgot.
Here's to you.

159
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,919
Chen Xiaoxi.

160
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,840
So you're the fox demon.

161
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,399
What nonsense are you saying?

162
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,480
Chen Xiaoxi, mind your manners.

163
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
Apologize to Aunt Qing.

164
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,000
You already found the key.

165
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,360
Why didn't you take it out?

166
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,320
You must be up to something.

167
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,600
I think there must be another reason.

168
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,200
So what if there is?
So what if there isn't?

169
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,720
You old fox demon.

170
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,399
Unfilial brat, get out!

171
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,360
Chen Dawang!

172
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,919
You hit me over this fox demon?

173
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Jianwei, let's go!

174
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,000
You...

175
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,679
That brat is disobedient.
Don't take it to heart.

176
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,000
I know you did it because...

177
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,919
Forget it. We just wasted a good drink.

178
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,879
I'm done staying in this dump.

179
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,519
Who knows what she's up to?

180
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,000
Probably just like Wan Qianhong.

181
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,880
She thinks she can fool men

182
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,840
with some good food and drink.

183
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,840
How could you
slander Aunt Qing like that?

184
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
Whose side are you on?

185
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,960
Did she fool you too?

186
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,600
Or are you hiding something from me?

187
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,639
What do you mean by that?

188
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,679
Nothing. I'm just talking nonsense.

189
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,879
Why so nervous?

190
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,399
Childish.

191
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,519
Aunt Qing saved us,

192
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:03,919
and this is how you treat her?

193
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,600
That's not how a gentleman acts.

194
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,720
Gentleman?

195
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,639
Li Jianwei, you want to talk about that?

196
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,960
Fine, let me ask you.

197
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,440
Will you swear

198
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,679
that you hide nothing from me?

199
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:14,399
I...

200
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,690
You don't dare, do you?

201
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,679
I, Li Jianwei, swear

202
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,039
if I've hidden
anything from Chen Xiaoxi,

203
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,039
- I will...
- Enough.

204
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
I was just joking.

205
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,279
Why so serious?

206
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,000
