I'll have some too.

Drink up.

Come on.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,439
One strike. Two strikes.

Three strikes.

Two strikes.

One more time.

28
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:51,439
How was it?

29
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:52,560
I'll have some.

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,159
Drink up.

Four strikes.

Look,

36
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,280
you lose.

37
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,439
Drink.

38
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,719
Come on.

39
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,319
Here.

40
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,599
There's more.

41
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,360
Yes.

42
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,360
Just drink it.

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,919
Don't stop.

44
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,280
Jianwei.

45
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,879
The liquor is strong,

46
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,100
so you shouldn't drink too much.

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,360
Another round?

48
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,000
Your outfit is torn.

49
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,919
Take it off. I'll mend it for you.

50
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,080
There's no need for that.

51
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,400
Little Walnut.

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,199
Is something bothering you, Jianwei?

53
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,120
Little Walnut.

54
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,719
Don't be too nice to me.

55
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,319
Got it?

56
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,120
Not at all.

57
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,120
Forget it.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,280
You'll never understand it.

59
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,439
Anyway, you need not do so.

60
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,000
Jianwei.

61
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,520
Do you find me annoying

62
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,719
like Stone does?

63
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:11,960
Little Walnut.

64
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:13,919
Ignore him.

65
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,560
Come, let's have something to drink.

66
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,400
Let's go.

67
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,680
Valley Master.

68
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,400
Valley Master.

69
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:33,960
Valley Master.

70
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,800
What are you doing?

71
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,120
Since this is a celebration,

72
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,680
I'll spice things up with a show.

73
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,840
You're full of tricks.

74
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,280
Who's that?

75
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
Check this out, Valley Master.

76
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,639
(Li Pu)

77
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,680
- It's Li Pu.
- Li Pu.

78
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,159
It's treacherous Li Pu.

79
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,520
How come it's him?

80
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,719
What is this?

81
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,800
Take him as the target

82
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,400
and shoot him to dead.

83
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,800
Bravo!

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,919
Both of you will do it.

85
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,960
You'll have a match, won't you?

86
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,599
I'm not doing it. You two go ahead.

87
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,319
Do you want
to give it a try, Valley Master?

88
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,120
No thanks.

89
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,080
You all have fun.

90
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,080
Sure.

91
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,520
Come on.

92
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,560
Let's give it a go.

93
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,759
You go ahead. I'm not joining.

94
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,199
Go on.

95
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,600
Since I'm older, I'll go first.

96
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,839
Quick.

97
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,800
Father...

98
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,600
Nice one!

99
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,120
Spot on!

100
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,360
Great!

101
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,560
Aim for the head!

102
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
- Shoot it!
- Amazing!

103
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,079
How accurate.

104
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,480
Again.

105
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,399
Jianwei.

106
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:44,600
Jianwei.

107
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,439
You're drunk.

108
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,600
Just stay still.

109
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,480
(Father.)

110
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,360
Your hand is bleeding, you know.

111
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,040
(I will hack them to pieces)

112
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,879
Jianwei.

113
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,120
(to avenge our family.)

114
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,639
Chai!

115
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,120
Sure.

116
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,759
Let's have a duel, then.

117
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,680
Take this!

118
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,160
Do it!

119
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,600
Let's just call it a day.

120
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,390
Though Jianwei's swordsmanship
is amateurish,

121
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,160
he's young.

122
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,120
Just admit your defeat, Chai.

123
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,199
It was just a duel, Jianwei.

124
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,360
Why were you so serious about it?

125
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,319
You lose, Chai.

126
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,000
Just admit it.

127
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,920
(Li Pu)
You're getting old after all.

128
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,240
Jianwei.

129
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,519
I never thought you were
cut out for swordsmanship.

130
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,620
If there's a chance, I'll teach you
the Chen Family's Sword Skills.

131
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,439
No need.

132
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,279
What's the matter with him?

133
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,000
I guess he's drunk.

134
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,319
Guard.

135
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,079
Get rid of that scarecrow.

136
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,160
Yes, Young Master.

137
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,180
(Li Pu)

138
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,519
Jianwei!

139
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,000
Father.

140
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,160
Father.

141
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,600
Li Jianwei! Li Jianwei!

142
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,199
Where are you?

143
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,680
Jianwei!

144
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,279
Jianwei!

145
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,079
It's blood.

146
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,399
Where exactly is he?

147
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:31,519
Jianwei.

148
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,759
Jianwei!

149
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,439
Jianwei!

150
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,199
Where are you, Jianwei?

151
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,319
Jianwei!

152
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,240
Jianwei!

153
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,800
Jianwei!

154
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,399
I'm sorry, Father.

155
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,040
How useless I am.

156
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,399
I'm sorry.

157
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,720
Father.

158
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,959
I'm sorry.

159
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:02,759
Father. I'm nothing but useless.

160
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,580
♪And flames consume that soul♪

161
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:10,519
Jianwei.

162
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,199
What are you doing here?

163
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,240
Are you drunk?

164
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,399
Why are you here?

165
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,360
I was worried you were drunk.

166
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,160
And I've been looking for you.

167
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,920
Why are you here?

168
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,759
What are you doing?

169
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,959
Nothing.

170
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,440
Are you trying to bury this thing?

171
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,039
Fine.

172
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,159
Just bury it.

173
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,200
What a thing to do

174
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,360
after getting drunk.

175
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,679
But why are you

176
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:54,960
trying to bury it?

177
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,440
Do you remember what you said

178
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,720
back in Rong City?

179
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,000
Hatred should end after one's departure.

180
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,799
Since you've had your revenge,

181
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,480
why humiliate him?

182
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,159
(He actually remembered my words.)

183
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,559
Jianwei.

184
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:19,879
You're right.

185
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,559
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

186
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,279
Let's put an end to all this.

00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,140
♪Just for a moment, I let my guard melt♪

188
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,500

189
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,300
♪I'd still choose to wake with you

(At first, I found this man carefree.)

191
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,000
(But for some reason, he's sincere too.)

192
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,159
(Father, is this)

193
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
(a complicated world?)

194
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,360
What are you staring at?

195
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,440
Nothing.

196
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:36,840
Hold on.

197
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,159
Wait.

198
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,759
Stay still.

199
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,080
You look much more pleasant now.

200
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,320
I bet Jianwei was upset yesterday.

201
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,090
I'll make him some mushroom soup
that calms the mind and replenishes energy.

202
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,000
I don't think this is enough.

203
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,960
Help! Help!

204
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,280
Help...

205
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,720
No...

206
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,080
No.

207
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,919
My death won't change

208
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,720
the fact that you're all treacherous.

209
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,399
You will always be so!

210
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,559
Father!

211
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:37,399
Father!

212
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,519
Are you alright, Father? Father!

213
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,759
Run, Yan.

214
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,480
I beg of you.

215
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,080
Please spare my father.

216
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,879
Please spare us.

217
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
Stop it, Yan!

218
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,240
Father! Father!

219
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,039
They're a bunch of traitorous subjects.

220
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,679
There's no use begging him!

221
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,279
No!

222
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,919
Kill me if you can.

223
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,840
Otherwise, I will haunt you as a ghost!

224
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,159
I beg of you.

225
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,360
Let me go.

226
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,519
Jianwei.

227
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:19,399
No...

228
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:19,919
Jianwei.

229
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,559
No...

230
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,720
- No...
- Jianwei.

231
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:22,559
Father...

232
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,559
Open up, Jianwei.

233
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,600
No...

234
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:30,960
Jianwei.

235
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:31,960
Jianwei?

236
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:32,759
I beg of you.

237
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,399
Let me go.

238
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,879
No...

239
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,120
What are you talking about?

240
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,000
No!

241
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,759
You gave me such a fright!

242
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,840
What are you doing here?

243
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,480
What else could I be here for?

244
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,690
I didn't manage
to pass this to you yesterday.

245
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,759
Quick, see if it's to your liking.

246
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:52,600
What is this?

247
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,620
I noticed you haven't had
any decent outfits to wear

248
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,639
since your arrival here.

249
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,990
The one you were wearing yesterday
is broken too.

250
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,159
So I got you this new one
before coming back here.

251
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,840
Cut it out.

252
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,080
Try it on now and see if you like it.
