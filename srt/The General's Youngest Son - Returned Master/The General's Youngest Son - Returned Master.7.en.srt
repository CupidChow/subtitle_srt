00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,840
Eat up.

21
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,610
You need the nutrients.

22
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,159
(It's Aunt Qing.)

23
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,760
(She's made contact.)

24
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,359
(I need to find a way to slip away.)

25
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,760
(Chen Dawang is here.)

26
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,319
(I just managed to cover up
what happened last night.)

27
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,039
(If I leave all of a sudden,
he'll get suspicious.)

28
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,719
- The food…
- The food…

29
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,919
The food tastes awful.

30
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,400
Maybe it's been reheated
too many times.

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,159
I'll go get some food from the street.

32
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,400
Jianwei,
what were you about to say just now?

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,919
I don't really have an appetite either.

34
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,280
You go ahead.

35
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,759
All right.

36
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,719
If I find something tasty,
I'll bring some back for you.

37
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,120
Come. Take a look.

38
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,439
Valley Master.

39
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,120
Come with me.

40
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,800
Where are we going?

41
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:55,990
Should we call Jianwei along?

42
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,759
No need.

43
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,820
(Li Residence)

44
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,400
Young Master.

45
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,240
Chen Dawang,

46
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,439
if you wanted to test him, fine.

47
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,800
But did you have to hurt him?

48
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,760
How else can you test someone's heart,

49
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,599
if not through blood?

50
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,000
But he risked his life to save me,

51
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,520
and I'm plotting behind his back.

52
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,680
What kind of friend does that make me?

53
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,159
Enough.

54
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,800
He passed the test.

55
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,400
That means he's earned our trust.

56
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,400
Once it's done, he'll know the truth.

57
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,719
What matters now

58
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,080
is killing that traitor
to end the threat once and for all.

59
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,599
This time, we must leave no loose ends.

60
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,160
It's just that…

61
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,680
Just what?

62
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,240
Must we drag Jianwei into this?

63
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,680
He has no feud with Li Yan.

64
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,360
Xiaoxi,

65
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,439
when acting for the greater good,

66
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,399
you must not let sentiment
cloud your judgment.

67
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:33,120
Whether or not
he involves himself with Li Yan

68
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,439
is his own choice.

69
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,360
But…

70
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,639
No buts. Let's go.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,600
Your Grace. Young Master.

72
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,600
It is an uncanny likeness.

73
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,720
What's this?

74
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,680
Just a disguise.

75
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,360
He is a criminal awaiting execution
in the prison in Rong City.

76
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,079
Rest assured, Young Master.

77
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,160
He has already been given the drug.

78
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,160
He's at your disposal.

79
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,079
Yan, come sit and rest for a bit.

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,279
Yan, I have a gift for you.

81
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,879
A gold-threaded soft armor?

82
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,040
Father, I don't need this.

83
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,759
Take it.

84
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,040
If you're ever in danger,

85
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,279
it could save your life.

86
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,680
Thank you, Father.

87
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,199
Father,

88
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,720
you've had recurring headaches.

89
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,890
Let me massage your temples.

90
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,480
Yan.

91
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,199
Yan?

92
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,959
Aunt Qing.

93
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,120
What's wrong?

94
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,160
It's clear now.

95
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,000
They were the ones

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,800
who murdered my entire family.

97
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,160
The scheming of Ghost Valley
is far more ruthless

98
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,480
than I imagined.

99
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,519
Your Grace, our men are in position.

100
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,759
Once they show up,

101
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:26,879
we'll cut off all escape routes

102
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,360
and rain down crossbow bolts.

103
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,120
Live or die, they'll have no way out.

104
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:36,920
Aunt Qing.

105
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,519
Yan, what are you doing?

106
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,240
Get up.

107
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,800
Had you not made early preparations,

108
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,800
this ambush could never have worked.

109
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,560
I have no way to repay you.

110
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,120
I want to see for myself

111
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,759
who these villains are.

112
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,460
According to the townsfolk in Rong City,

113
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,360
the youngest son of the Li family
narrowly escaped death,

114
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,490
recovered in secret for months,

115
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,000
and only just returned home.

116
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,920
Soon, he will travel to the capital
for his appointment.

117
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,040
Time is running out.

118
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,120
Then we must act quickly

119
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,600
before anything changes.

120
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,199
Not yet.

121
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,920
Jianwei,

122
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,120
look who's here.

123
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,160
Greetings, Valley Master.

124
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,879
What brings you here?

125
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,399
Do you think
I will not handle this well?

126
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,199
No.

127
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,279
Chen Dawang.

128
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,199
Jianwei.

129
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,560
Things have gotten a little tricky,

130
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,360
and time is tight.

131
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,920
I've come to lend you a hand.

132
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,319
I heard you were injured
while saving the Young Valley Master.

133
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,319
Well?

134
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:50,720
How are you feeling?

135
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,730
Thank you, Valley Master.

136
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,680
I'm much better now.

137
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,879
With you overseeing the operation,

138
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,120
our chances are much greater.

139
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,279
We're planning to move tonight.

140
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,319
Jianwei, what do you think?

141
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,240
All right.

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,240
Go make the preparations.

143
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,240
It's time..

144
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,839
Chen Xiaoxi.

145
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,399
Jianwei, what's wrong?

146
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,120
No.

147
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,440
It's nothing.

148
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,759
Jianwei, are you not feeling well?

149
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,399
If you are, you don't need to go.

150
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,360
You must be nervous.

151
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,279
Jianwei,

152
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,720
you just need to help us scout.

153
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,240
I will handle anything dangerous.

154
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,000
Don't worry.

155
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,679
I won't let you get hurt again.

156
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,720
We've been through a lot together.

157
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,919
Do you have any wishes?

158
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,360
Why do you ask all of a sudden?

159
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,399
But now that you mention it,

160
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,279
I have quite a few.

161
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,360
I want to go beyond Mount Jianwei,
see the world,

162
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,120
visit places I've never been,

163
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,720
eat lots of good food,

164
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,200
admire beautiful women,

165
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:23,600
and find Little Walnut a good husband.

166
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,159
Honestly,

167
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,960
I could talk about my wishes for days.

168
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,320
Jianwei,

169
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,919
once this is all over,

170
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,759
I'll take you with me.

171
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,039
Let's move.

172
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,519
Chen Dawang is urging us to go.

173
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,759
Let's go, Jianwei.

174
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,960
Your Grace, they're here.

175
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,080
Your Grace, are you all right?

176
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,519
It's too quiet.

177
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,720
Something may be off.

178
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,200
Everyone, stay alert.

179
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,279
Valley Master,

180
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,879
there are silk threads at the entrance.

181
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,500
Be careful. It could be an ambush.

182
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,399
Seems they were prepared.

183
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,960
Petty tricks.

184
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,159
Dispose of Li Yan.

185
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,240
Understood.

186
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,440
Be careful, Jianwei.

187
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,879
Your Grace, the time has come.

188
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,039
Si Yu, fall back.

189
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:36,720
Si Yu,

190
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,639
this matter may run deeper
than we thought.

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,759
For now, follow the Young Master's lead,

192
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,639
and do not let his identity be exposed.

193
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,320
Understood.

194
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,559
I'll help him
complete the assassination.

195
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,759
I can take care of this.

196
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,360
Assist Jianwei. Go!

197
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:53,960
All right.

198
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:56,480
Young Master, watch out!

199
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,440
Die!

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,559
Jianwei.

201
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,720
Withdraw.

202
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:47,240
Come on.

203
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,720
Jianwei.

204
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,759
Tonight,
you've avenged our blood debt for us.

205
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,720
From now on,

206
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,000
I consider you my sworn brother.

207
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,159
Have a seat.

208
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:34,759
Good work tonight, Jianwei.

209
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,639
Here.

210
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,639
Who exactly was the man I killed?

211
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:43,000
Why did you tell me he was a bandit?

212
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,000
Truthfully,

213
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,759
he was the son
of the Protector General, Li Pu.

214
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,840
His name was Li Yan.

215
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,360
Why did he have to die?

216
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:55,759
Why?

217
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,879
Because he's the son
of that traitor Li Pu.

218
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,360
That alone is reason enough.

219
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,320
Li Pu feigned virtue,

220
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,360
persecuted the loyal,

221
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,600
and acted with cruelty.

222
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,639
That so-called "Protector General"

223
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,519
is a joke!

224
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,879
I'd tear him limb from limb if I could.

225
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,919
His Majesty conferred that title.

226
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,799
The people believe

227
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:38,480
he is loyal and brave.

228
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,279
He defeated Bailan 20 years ago.

229
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:46,360
Loyal and brave? Him?

230
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,759
He was disloyal, unfilial,

231
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,399
cruel, and unjust.

232
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,879
He fled the battlefield in disgrace,

233
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,559
and yet dares speak
of loyalty and courage?

234
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:03,120
Even so, what does that have to do
with the young man today?

235
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,799
Has he ever hurt anyone?

236
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,720
They say a father's debts

237
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,240
are paid by his son.

238
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,120
The entire Li family deserves to die.

239
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,679
