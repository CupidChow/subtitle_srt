20
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,159
You.

21
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,079
Get out of here.

22
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

23
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:52,879
Let's go.

24
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:54,879
Come.

25
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:13,719
Who are you?

26
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,719
Where am I?

27
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,879
This is Blossom Manor.

28
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,719
(Wan Qianhong, Blossom Manor)
And I'm its mistress, Wan Qianhong.

29
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,639
Wan Qianhong?

30
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,919
I don't know you.

31
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,360
Why did you capture and take me here?

32
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,680
I didn't do that.

33
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,520
I saw you wandering all alone
in the mountain,

34
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,840
so I decided to save you.

35
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,360
I'm both beautiful and kind-hearted.
And I've done you a favor.

36
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:48,159
Not only are you not saying thank you,

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,479
but you're also suspecting me.

38
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,439
Well, thank you, Madam Wan.

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,080
You haven't told me your name.

40
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,240
I'm Little Walnut.

41
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,759
Little

42
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,199
Wal...

43
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:11,919
nut?

44
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:15,280
May I go now?

45
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,560
Little Walnut.

46
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,840
It's not peaceful out there these days.

47
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,039
There's a group of bandits

48
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,479
who violate women and rob.
They're nothing but evil.

49
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,039
It's too dangerous
for you to head home alone.

50
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,360
Why don't you stay here?

51
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,840
What do you think?

52
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,840
But...

53
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,960
No but.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,280
Do you think I'll hurt you?

55
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,680
I want to go home, madam.

56
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,680
I said,

57
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,560
this is your home.

58
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,759
(This flower came
from the Blossom Manor.)

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,990
(It must have something
to do with its mistress, Wan Qianhong.)

60
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,719
(To save Little Walnut,)

61
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,719
(you two must seduce her
with your beauty.)

62
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,360
I don't think we should take it.

63
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,159
Fine.

64
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,400
This man's got a nice physique.

65
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,879
I'd love to touch it.

66
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,439
I wonder what it feels like.

67
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,000
They're looking at us.

68
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,000
They're so handsome.

69
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,560
What a coward you are.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,170
No one is going to do anything to you.

71
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
Chest up, stomach in.
Maintain strong eye contact.

72
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:29,480
Imagine you're a dashing wolf.

73
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,399
Do we really have to do this, Jianwei?

74
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,360
You weren't this bashful

75
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,319
back in the Ghost Valley.

76
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,220
Now we're dealing
with an important business,

77
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,560
but you're shy like a lady.

78
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,680
But this is the public space,
not the Ghost Valley.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,199
Besides, I'm nervous.

80
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,240
Also, why am I wearing
this more eye-catching outfit?

81
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,480
Little Walnut is your sister.

82
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,000
Naturally, you'll have to do more.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,439
But you ran away from home
because of you.

84
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,519
I didn't mean it that way.
It's just that...

85
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,600
It's alright. It was my fault after all.

86
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,279
Come, let's go meet her.

87
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,300
(Yunque Pavilion)

88
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,120
Here.

89
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,199
Please enjoy it.

90
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,839
The view by the window is gorgeous, Xi.

91
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,959
I'm not in the mood for this now.

92
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,360
Xi.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,839
You're a man.
How could you be so lovelorn?

94
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,240
In my opinion,

95
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,839
that woman is a flirtatious

96
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:52,920
liar.

97
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:54,920
You bought her freedom,

98
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,240
but she ran away
with the other man right after that.

99
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,240
It tells how cruel and unfaithful she is.

100
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,120
I have myself to blame
for loving her so deeply.

101
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,360
I was blinded by love

102
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,519
that I didn't figure out her character!

103
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,920
Longing brings no good at all.

104
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,240
Yet melancholy
may well be a kind of mad grace.

105
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,199
It's rare to come across

106
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,439
such a lovesick man like you.

107
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,839
Don't mind him, madam.

108
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,360
My friend is still tormented by love
and can't move on.

109
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,920
On the other hand,

110
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,360
you're a breathtaking beauty.

111
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,319
Of course you've stirred his heart.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,079
You may look refine,

113
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,600
but you're slick-tongued.

114
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,040
He's more honest than you.

115
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,519
Let me toast to you, mister.

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,560
I'd love to get rid
of your sorrow with this drink.

117
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,800
Thank you, madam.

118
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,120
Come home with me, mister.

119
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
Deal?

120
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,120
I adore you.

121
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,040
Why aren't you bringing me home?

122
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,920
If you say so. You're coming with us.

123
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,279
- Xi.
- Madam.

124
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,560
I've got this performance
especially for you.

125
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,959
Do you like it?

126
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,559
Come and meet your new queen!

127
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,720
My queen, are you...

128
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,080
Are you going to get rid of me already?

129
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,879
I beg of you.
Please don't do that, my queen.

130
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,559
You good-for-nothing.

131
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,960
Since you can't make me happy,

132
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,519
what's the use of having you around?

133
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,480
However...

134
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,519
I can use you as a fertilizer.

135
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:53,840
Madam!

136
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,600
Xi.

137
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,200
Madam.

138
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,039
Afraid not, my Xi.

139
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,639
We're born to live life to the fullest
and enjoy every moment.

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,440
Let's cast all our worries aside

141
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,600
and do the happiest thing
in the world together.

142
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,039
Deal?

143
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,159
Join us.

144
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,720
Hold on!

145
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,120
Madam.

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,200
Since we're doing the happiest thing

147
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,440
in the world,

148
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,000
of course we have to be left alone.

149
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,120
Besides, I'm the new queen.

150
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,960
What do they think they are
to share your love with me?

151
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,480
To my surprise, you're pretty greedy.

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,320
Fine, you all should scram.

153
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,679
Wait.

154
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,320
You'll stay.

155
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,960
Go find Little Walnut now.

156
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,200
Xi. I know both of you are friends,

157
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,279
so I have him here to keep you company.

158
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,360
However, why are you paying attention
to him instead of me?

159
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,600
Madam.

160
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,879
I'm a loyal man.

161
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,360
Since you want to get together with me,

162
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,679
naturally, he should excuse himself.

163
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
How unthoughtful of me.

164
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,360
He's nothing compared to

165
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,799
a lovesick man like you.

166
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,600
You.

167
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,039
Get out of here.

168
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,720
Didn't you hear that? Get out.

169
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,879
Play along. Don't mess up our plan.

170
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:23,480
It's only both of us now, Xi.

171
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,480
Since I've granted your wish,

172
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,120
shouldn't I have some fun now?

173
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,639
Let's have a drink first, madam.

174
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,679
Well, after this,

175
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,840
we'll play a game.

176
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,000
Could this be a maze?

177
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,679
Where exactly is Little Walnut?

178
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
Little Walnut.

179
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,759
Little Walnut.

180
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,240
I wonder why

181
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,120
our madam cares so much
about that lass.

182
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,279
I know, right?
