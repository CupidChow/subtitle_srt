00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,040
It hurts!

00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,680
Are you alright, madam?

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,120
Calm down. They mean no harm.

28
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,079
What did you say?

29
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,680
They mean no harm?

30
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,000
Are you calling me evil now?

31
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,879
Mother...

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,400
What did you call me?

33
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,560
Mother.

34
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,280
Little Walnut. Little Walnut.

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,639
Are you alright?

36
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,240
I... I didn't mean to hurt you.

37
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,080
I didn't mean to do that.

38
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,159
It's all my fault.

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,080
No! It's all their fault.

40
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,560
It's all their fault!

41
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,919
I will get rid of them.

42
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,479
I must kill them!

43
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,240
Calm down, Mother.

44
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,919
You're drunk. Are you alright?

45
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,919
You're very drunk now.
You should get some rest.

46
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,039
Jianwei. It's me.

47
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,840
You gave me a fright.

48
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,719
Instead of dying
at that crazy woman's hands,

49
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,080
you almost killed me.

50
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,159
Who told you to get so close to me, then?

51
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,080
I was just trying to...

52
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,080
Forget it. I won't argue with you.

53
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,600
Don't be dramatic.

54
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,439
I've never been to such a place.

55
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,720
I told you this was no place for me.

56
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,800
- Who's that? Let go...
- Kill you

57
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,120
and I'll be the master of this manor.

58
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,199
The queen loves me the most.

59
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,680
All of you must die!

60
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,680
You can have the queen.

61
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,120
Just take her if you want.

62
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,360
Just take her!

63
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,680
Help! Help!

64
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,000
Help!

65
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,519
- Xiaoxi!
- Help!

66
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,439
You all must die.

67
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,680
I want you to die!

68
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,879
Help!

69
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,079
- Xiaoxi! Let go!
- Little Walnut.

70
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,319
Let go!

71
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:02,800
Let go!

72
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,000
Are you alright, Jianwei? Are you hurt?

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,680
I'm alright.

74
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,839
Please get this right, Little Walnut.

75
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,879
If you had come later,
I would've been killed.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,519
Forget it.

77
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,040
How did you end up being brought here?

78
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,639
Did that old hag hurt you?

79
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,800
I'm all fine, Xiaoxi.

80
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,319
Madam Wan has been kind to me

81
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,759
because she thinks I'm her daughter.

82
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,480
Her daughter?

83
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:29,839
You?

84
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,879
We can't stay here.
Let's just talk later.

85
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,279
We should get out of here first.

86
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,480
Let's go. Quick.

87
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:40,519
Stop right there! Come back!

88
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,839
I'm going to kill you all!

89
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:49,680
My queen.

90
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,120
I want to see the queen!

91
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,800
My queen.

92
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,600
When will you come and see me, my queen?

93
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,000
Little Walnut.

94
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,680
Where are you going?

95
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,879
Don't hurt them, Mother.

96
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:30,120
We didn't mean to mess with you, madam.

97
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,800
Little Walnut's family
has been worried about her

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,120
since her sudden disappearance.

99
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,199
Well, please show some mercy

100
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,199
and let us go.

101
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,879
Does that mean
the encounter at the restaurant

102
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,319
was a plot of yours?

103
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,240
Was it, Xi?

104
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,360
That's why. We had been looking all over

105
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,519
for your filthy lair.

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,200
Thus, we came up with that last resort.

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,879
What did you say? Say that again!

108
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,759
Sure. Your filthy lair!

109
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,920
Please don't hurt them, Mother.

110
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:09,920
Get up, Little Walnut!

111
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,879
I'll stay here for you.

112
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,279
Little Walnut. Little...

113
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,879
Please spare them, Mother.

114
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,519
I beg of you.

115
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,759
Fine. I can let them go.

116
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,879
Really?

117
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,959
Be patient. I'm not done yet.

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,160
Stop wasting our time here, woman!

119
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,439
You want to settle the score, huh?

120
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,160
I haven't settled the score with you

121
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,110
after taking advantage of me.

122
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,399
Let her finish her sentence.

123
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,879
Kill a person for me.

124
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,519
Bring his body back here,
so I can make a fertilizer out of it.

125
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,959
After that,
Little Walnut can go with you.

126
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,560
Kill a person?

127
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,680
Who's it?

128
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,839
Li Pu.

129
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:15,879
Li Pu? Wasn't he the protector general?

130
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,360
Isn't he dead?

131
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:24,079
What did you go? He's dead?

132
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,439
When was that?

133
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,920
Didn't you know?
He's been dead long ago.

134
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,919
General Li and his whole family
were killed last Chinese New Year's Eve.

135
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,200
None of them made it out alive.

136
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,360
No way. That's impossible.

137
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:47,720
It's impossible. No way.

138
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,480
That's impossible.

139
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,799
Impossible.

140
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,600
No way! You're lying!

141
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,080
He promised to come back to me!

142
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,320
You must be lying to me!

143
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,320
How could he die without my permission?

144
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,799
How could he die?

145
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,679
You must be lying to me!

146
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,639
He can't die without my approval.

147
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
How could he die?

148
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,039
It turned out

149
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,200
you were that treacherous man's lover.

150
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,440
What a shame.
He never showed up before his passing.

151
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,120
You're talking nonsense!

152
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:35,039
He promised to come and see me!

153
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,240
He promised me that.

154
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,279
I've been waiting him for years.

155
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,399
She's heavily poisoned,

156
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,200
why must you keep provoking her?

157
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,279
Because she was in cahoots
with that traitor.

158
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,600
- Liar!
- You...

159
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,240
Madam Wan!

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,559
Little Walnut!

161
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:13,399
Among the flowers,
I glance back with no desire.

162
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,639
Half for the Dao, half for you.

163
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,799
Among the flowers...

164
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,639
How did she end up this way?

165
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,679
I glance back with no desire.

166
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,840
Half for the Dao, half for you.

167
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,879
How come?

168
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,679
Among the flowers,
I glance back with no desire.

169
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:56,685
Half for the Dao, half for you.

170
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,039
Mother.

171
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,159
Who are you?

172
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,799
Are you alright, Mother?

173
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,720
Little Walnut?

174
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,919
Yes, it's me.

175
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,320
Stop this, Mother. I'm scared.

176
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,279
Little Walnut. Little Walnut.

177
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,080
My daughter.

178
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:40,200
No, you're not. You're not her!

179
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,039
Where is my daughter? Where is she?

180
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,559
Why is she going berserk again?

181
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,679
I think she's lost it.

182
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,200
She's lost it?

183
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,000
If so, why don't we get rid of her now?

184
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,759
I'll end her life now.

185
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,360
Where is my daughter? Where is she?

186
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:08,799
My daughter.

187
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,720
My daughter...

188
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,000
My daughter.

189
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,399
Listen up.

190
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:25,799
I don't want you to end up like me.

191
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,320
So you can't fall in love with anyone.

192
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,639
If not, you'll get hurt.

193
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,240
Got it?

194
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,559
I really hope you could grow up

195
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,639
a healthy and happy girl.

196
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,000
Did you hear me?

197
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,559
Did you hear me?

198
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,399
Did you hear me?

199
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,360
Calm down, Mother.

200
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,440
I... I will kill him!

201
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,240
Old hag. Where's my sister?

202
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,559
Tell me now

203
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,600
or I'll your filthy lair down!

204
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,919
Among the flowers,
I glance back with no desire.

205
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,600
Half for the Dao, half for you.

206
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,519
Where exactly is my sister,

207
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,600
you crazy woman?

208
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,120
I'm not a lunatic.

209
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,360
In this world,

210
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,279
everyone is after fame and fortune.

211
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,039
They're hungry for power and ambition.

212
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,159
All of us are crazy, no?

213
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:18,039
Cut it out. Where is she?

214
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,000
I can let you have her.

215
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,919
Want to know where Little Walnut is?

216
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,919
Kill him, then.

217
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,399
Jian... Jianwei.

218
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,600
Are you really going to do as she says?

219
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,879
Fine. Do it, then.

220
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,639
However, after I die,

221
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,240
you must bring Little Walnut home safely.

222
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,279
How touching!

223
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,360
Both of you can die together, then!
