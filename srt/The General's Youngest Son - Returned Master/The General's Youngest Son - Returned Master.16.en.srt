20
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,640
I've done so much,
yet you're so defiant.

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,680
You have no brains nor brawn.
What can you achieve?

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I like it this way.

23
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,480
Enough from you.

24
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,680
And you, you're not on my side either.

25
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,640
You're all ganging up to bully me.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,200
I even took you as a brother.

27
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,200
Brat,
watch how I teach you a lesson today.

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,239
Don't take it out on me.

29
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,319
What's going on here?

30
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,760
Why are they arguing?

31
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,500
You think I can't tell?

32
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,760
They're back.
Shouldn't that be a good thing?

33
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,000
Someone, come! Her Highness is missing!

34
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,479
Where's Her Highness? What happened?

35
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,120
Last night she was upset
and didn't let me attend to her.

36
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,759
She also didn't call for me
this morning.

37
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,479
The room is already in this state
when I entered.

38
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,360
What happened in the courtyard lately?

39
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,479
I think...

40
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,719
Why did you

41
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,719
bring me here?

42
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,319
You scheming woman.

43
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,159
You've embarrassed me
in front of everyone.

44
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,360
I ought to tie you up and question you.

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,879
Does Chen Dawang know about this?

46
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,599
Aren't you afraid he'll come after you?

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,439
If he knew, I'd be doomed.

48
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,680
Who's doing the questioning here?

49
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,520
Be good. I'm asking the questions.

50
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,199
Go ahead.

51
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,919
Since you found the key,

52
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,599
why didn't you take it out?

53
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,759
Why did you approach us?

54
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't play tricks.
Just explain everything.

55
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,719
And I won't make it hard for you.

56
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,919
I led you to Little Walnut,

57
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,439
rescued both of you,

58
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,520
and took care of your injuries.

59
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,879
Yet I'm the one with ulterior motives?

60
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,919
You did do all that,

61
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,159
but who knows what your intentions are?

62
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,000
You might fool them

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,039
but not me.

64
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,319
Start talking.

65
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,759
I want to see Chen Dawang.

66
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,159
Otherwise, I have nothing to say.

67
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,800
Are you coming clean?

68
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,479
That unfilial brat.

69
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,960
He'll be the death of me.

70
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,960
Don't be mad, Valley Master.

71
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,240
There's no lasting grudge
between father and son.

72
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,120
Young Master is young and hot-tempered.

73
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,400
Once he thinks it through,
he'll apologize to you.

74
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,400
If he were half as sensible as you,

75
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,959
I'd be worry-free.

76
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,000
Something on your mind?

77
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,680
There's something I don't understand.

78
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,560
How do you know Her Highness?

79
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,319
She's just an old friend
from my youth in the capital.

80
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,519
I didn't expect to meet her here.

81
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,480
(Why did Aunt Qing say
they met in the martial world?)

82
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,079
(But Chen Dawang said
it was in the capital?)

83
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,399
Ghost Valley is no ordinary place.

84
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,800
Too much contact with officials

85
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,319
could bring unwanted trouble.

86
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,839
That's very thoughtful of you.
You're right.

87
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,759
She's from a noble family.

88
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,160
We walk different paths now.

89
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,480
I'll take my leave.

90
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,600
Jianwei.

91
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,480
What do you need?

92
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,800
You mentioned Her Highness.

93
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,480
Does that mean
you know her true identity?

94
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,480
Valley Master,

95
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,160
I once helped Her Highness

96
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,519
search for an old acquaintance.

97
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,959
An old acquaintance? Who was it?

98
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,879
She never told me.

99
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:08,720
(Aunt Qing.)

100
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:11,839
(Oh no.)

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,879
Chen Xiaoxi, what are you doing?

102
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:16,959
What's wrong?

103
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,279
I just brought this lying woman
back here

104
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,279
to question her.

105
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,680
None of you believe me.

106
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,879
Aunt Qing is a person of status.

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,199
How could you disrespect her?

108
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,639
If Valley Master finds out,

109
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,680
he'll surely be furious.

110
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,120
She's already here anyway.

111
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,319
I'll just tell him myself.

112
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:31,959
Chen Xiaoxi!

113
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,639
Jianwei.

114
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,399
It's my fault you were humiliated.

115
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:43,439
It's fine.
Xiaoxi didn't do anything to me.

116
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,160
He has his doubts.

117
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,879
We can't fully blame him.

118
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,439
But some matters

119
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,480
must be resolved.

120
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,639
Resolved?

121
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,680
Jianwei, take me to Chen Dawang. Quick.

122
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,040
You fool.

123
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,360
How could you
act so rudely and absurdly?

124
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,879
Get out of my sight!

125
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,079
I'll go in myself.

126
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,879
There are answers I must get.

127
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:49,560
Your Highness,
I apologize on behalf of my son.

128
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,600
Did you call me Your Highness

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,120
as the Valley Master of Ghost Valley

130
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,399
or as Deputy General Chen Wang
of Zhongyong Army?

131
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,560
(Deputy General Chen Wang
of Zhongyong Army?)

132
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,720
What's the difference?

133
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,720
If you're Deputy General Chen Wang,

134
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:19,959
you're the husband
who hasn't taken me as your wife.

135
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,959
It would be a small matter then.

136
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,959
I won't hold a grudge
over a junior's antics.

137
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,879
But if you're
the Valley Master of Ghost Valley,

138
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,199
abducting royalty
is a crime punishable by death.

139
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,240
Then I can only be Zhongyong Army's

140
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,000
Deputy General Chen Wang.

141
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,600
Well, my dear husband,

142
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,840
let me ask you.

143
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,120
What exactly happened 20 years ago?

144
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,399
You gave me this hairpin
before your departure.

145
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,320
I've worn it for 20 full years.

146
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,600
20 years have passed.
It's all in the past now.

147
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,320
We can't go back to the way things were.

148
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,639
Chen Wang.

149
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,679
If you won't tell me the truth today,

150
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,159
I'll die in front of you.

151
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,559
Yuan, what are you doing?

152
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,039
Put it down.

153
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,080
20 years

154
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,639
is enough for the husband
who pledged love in a peach forest

155
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,919
to abandon me.

156
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,320
It's enough for me

157
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,559
to think of him, long for him,
hate him, and mourn him day and night.

158
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,960
It's enough to scare him
from acknowledging me

159
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,720
when we finally met again!

160
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,320
Valley Master!

161
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,799
Valley Master.

162
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,000
Valley Master, urgent report.

163
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,840
What's the panic?

164
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,039
Valley Master,
soldiers have surrounded the mountain.

165
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,799
They demand we release some princess

166
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,279
within one incense stick's time.

167
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,200
Or they'll set the mountain on fire.

168
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,000
What?

169
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,480
Immediately arrange
everyone in the valley

170
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,840
to prepare for defense.

171
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,960
Don't let your guard down.

172
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,360
Yes, I'll do it right away.

173
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,279
The troops are from the inspectorate.

174
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,279
They're elite troops
and can take on ten men each.

175
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:04,120
With so few in Ghost Valley,
isn't this a hopeless fight?

176
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,039
Our men were once
Zhongyong Army soldiers

177
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,480
who can take on 100 men each.

178
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,960
So why cower

179
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,120
and hide for 20 years?

180
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,480
Our comrades
died in battle 20 years ago.

181
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,290
The general entrusted us with his child.

182
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I led the comrades who survived

183
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,480
into Jianwei Mountain to hide.

184
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,799
Only after wiping out
Ghost Valley's villains

185
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,559
did we manage to survive.

186
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,039
For 20 years,

187
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,360
not a day passed
without yearning to leave Ghost Valley

188
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,559
and reunite with our loved ones.

189
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,840
But as traitors and rebels,

190
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,679
only death was waiting for us outside.

191
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,840
Since you want to know so badly

192
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,039
what happened 20 years ago,

193
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,039
I'll tell you.

194
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,320
(What exactly happened 20 years ago?)

195
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,679
The 7th year of Yongning,

196
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,279
Zhongyong Army's General Chen Weishan
led troops by imperial order

197
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,440
to suppress Bailan.

198
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,240
After months of battle, they reached
the north of Jianwei Mountain.

199
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,320
Both suffered heavy casualties
and reached a stalemate.

200
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,720
The entire army ran out of supplies.
Reinforcements never came.

201
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,600
It was the height of winter.

202
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,399
The mountain
had only dead grass and bark.

203
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,720
We could only eat snow.

204
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,080
We held on for several days,

205
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,080
but reinforcements never arrived.

206
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,279
Only 20 days later

207
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,480
did they finally come.

208
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,799
Why only come then?

209
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,960
I read the war report.

210
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,960
The report stated
that the scoundrel Li Pu

211
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,240
led the reinforcements to suppress
Bailan and turned the tide!

212
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,000
He was named
First-rank Protector General.

213
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,399
How could I not know these?

214
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,159
But that was the greatest twist

215
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,080
and the greatest deception

216
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,960
of Jianwei Mountain's battle.
