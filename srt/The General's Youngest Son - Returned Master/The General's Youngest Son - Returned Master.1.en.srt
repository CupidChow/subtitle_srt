(The 25th year of Yongning,
Chinese New Year's Eve)

21
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:58,480
Father!

22
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,007
(Li Pu, First-rank Protector General)
My death won't change

23
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:02,840
(Li Pu, First-rank Protector General)
the fact that you're all treacherous.

24
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,040
You will always be so!

25
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,280
Father!

26
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,520
Father!

27
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,719
Father! Father!

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,680
Are you alright, Father? Father!

29
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,879
Run, Yan.

30
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,240
I beg of you.

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,120
Please spare my father.

32
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:30,840
Please spare us.

33
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,120
Stop it, Yan!

34
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,000
Father! Father!

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,599
They're a bunch of traitorous subjects.
There's no use begging him!

36
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,560
No!

37
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,840
No!

38
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,312
(One Year Later)

39
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,039
Father.

40
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,240
Father.

41
00:03:24,862 --> 00:03:28,137
(Li Jianwei, Li Yan)

42
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,360
(Father, Mother. Don't you worry.)

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,400
(I won't let them get away with it.)

44
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,437
General Li spent his life
on the battlefield.

45
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:50,270
He was a loyal subject
who had been protecting the nation.

46
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,319
After returning home with honors,
he should have enjoyed his twilight years.

47
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:55,990
But who would have thought

48
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,199
his entire household was massacred,
bodies strewn everywhere.

49
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,319
The most pitiful of all

50
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,080
was none other than
General Li's youngest son.

51
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,360
(A reading from Jianwei, uncannily accurate)
He was once an outstanding youth.

52
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,719
He was loyal to the emperor and nation?
He was a mere traitor!

53
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,393
(Jianwei Mountain)
If you ask me,

54
00:04:18,395 --> 00:04:20,199
(Young Master of Ghost Valley, Chen Xiaoxi)
he brought this upon himself.

55
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:21,639
This is retribution.

56
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,920
General Li

57
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,279
was the pillar of the nation.

58
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,920
How dare you slander him?

59
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,160
Why so worked up?

60
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,160
Are you connected to him?

61
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,600
Everyone knows General Li's family died
for the country.

62
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,879
And you dare defame him?

63
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,199
Could it be you're involved
in their massacre?

64
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,079
Where did you darned fortune-teller
come from? Scram!

65
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,839
Your face is dark,
and you look worrisome.

66
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,600
You'll soon be parted
from your loved ones.

67
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,319
And you'll have a fatal event
within ten steps.

68
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,439
Your whole clan won't survive
the next three days.

69
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,040
You darned fortune-teller.
What nonsense is this?

70
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,680
Do you even know who I am?

71
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,628
(Stone)
How dare you provoke the young master

72
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:10,480
(Stone)
of Jianwei Mountain's Ghost Valley.

73
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,639
(Ghost Valley?
I've been waiting for you.)

74
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,720
I knew it.
You're neither human nor ghost.

75
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,040
Why not take advantage
of tonight's courtesan festival in town

76
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,920
and take one home?

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,079
One, to ward off evil.

78
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,560
Two, to make some new little spirits.

79
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,480
Little spirits?

80
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,439
Interesting.

81
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,959
You brought this on yourself!

82
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,240
Young Master, Little Walnut is missing.

83
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,199
I'll let you off today.

84
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,360
Let's go.

85
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,040
Five, six, seven, eight...

86
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,720
Nine steps.

87
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,319
Who's that? Didn't you see me?

88
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,680
It's really a fatal event, Young Master.

89
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,660
How could you believe that nonsense?

90
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,560
Little Walnut loves excitement.

91
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,170
He must be at the courtesan festival.

92
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:23,959
Let's go.

93
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,560
Let's go.

94
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,639
Welcome to Huanyi Hall, everyone!

95
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Tonight is the night
of the courtesan wedding!

96
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,480
Have fun, everyone!

97
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,920
Great!

98
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,439
Sir!

99
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,439
- Enjoy yourself, sir!
- Have a good time!

100
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,399
Please, sir!

101
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,040
Get to work, ladies!

102
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,120
Sir.

103
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,439
Sir.

104
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,160
Are you here for me?

105
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,879
It's the one behind me.

106
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,240
Sir!

107
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,079
Why are you sweating so much?
Are you looking for someone?

108
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,879
Who is this handsome young man?

109
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,920
Don't be shy, sir.

110
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,040
Who are you looking for, sir?

111
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,600
Excuse me.

112
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,560
- Sir!
- Sir!

113
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,680
If it really is you,

114
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,920
I will annihilate the Ghost Valley.

115
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,600
I'll make sure all of you
die an ugly death.

116
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,040
Young Master, everything is in place.

117
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,399
Take care, Mr. Wang.

118
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,319
Did you find Little Walnut?

119
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,040
Still no luck.

120
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,759
Please come again.

121
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,360
Let's go.

122
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,959
- Here comes the auspicious hour.
- Young Master.

123
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,319
Look! The courtesan is coming out.

124
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,360
The courtesan will come out soon!

125
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:33,480
(Your face is dark,
and you look worrisome.)

126
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,040
(You'll soon be parted
from your loved ones.)

127
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,639
(And you'll have a fatal event
within ten steps.)

128
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,120
(Your whole clan won't survive
the next three days.)

129
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,800
(It's just like the saying goes,)

130
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,639
you reap what you sow.

131
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,600
Better safe than sorry.

132
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,120
Darned fortune-teller.
Fine, I'll trust you this once.

133
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,279
That's a fairy!

134
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,240
How lovely!

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,920
Do you want to see how beautiful she is?

136
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,319
Do it, Stone.

137
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,240
Yes!

138
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,920
Who... Who are you?

139
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,000
What's going on?

140
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,000
Kidnapping! The bandit's taken her away!

141
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,200
Help! Somebody!

142
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,662
(Ghost Valley)

143
00:08:36,662 --> 00:08:44,500
(Joy)

144
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,840
My beauty,
both of us are tying the knot

145
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,279
on this blessed day.

146
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,879
It's nothing but wonderful.

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,879
From now on, as long as you're willing,

148
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,639
I'll treat you sincerely.

149
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:37,320
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

150
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,159
I'll untie you, okay? Let me untie you.

151
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,879
If it weren't for protecting my clan,

152
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,519
I wouldn't have had to bring you back

153
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,360
for a wedding ceremony.

154
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,600
It's all because of
that darned fortune-teller.

155
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,399
Forget it. Let's just drop the subject.

156
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,559
If you really don't want this,

157
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,120
once the calamity is over,
I'll give you a lot of gifts

158
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,519
and send you back with a grand sedan.

159
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,159
Why is it you?

160
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,480
Darned fortune-teller.

161
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,600
Once I catch you, I'll gut you!

162
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Darned fortune-teller.
You have nowhere to run!

163
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,080
(This man is definitely dangerous.)

164
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,159
(I must find a way to uncover
the truth behind Ghost Valley soon.)

165
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,559
You're exactly who I was waiting for.

166
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,320
Do you want to predict

167
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,440
if you'll have a fatal event today?

168
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,559
Speak. Who exactly are you?

169
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,559
Why did you mess with me?

170
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,279
Speak now

171
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,600
or I'll carve you up, slice by slice!

172
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,320
Come here.

173
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,039
Closer.

174
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,039
You want to play, huh?

175
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,000
Fine, I'll entertain you, then.

176
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,440
(This triple-barbed arrow...)

177
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,799
(It's exactly the same
as what those men in black used.)

178
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,879
(Could it really be them?)

179
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:26,000
If you've got guts, fight me one-on-one.

180
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,879
You're despicable and shameless.

181
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,559
What did you say?

182
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,480
Fine, I'll show you
how despicable I can be.

183
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,159
Revenge...

184
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,399
What did you say?

185
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,399
I won't let you get away with this.

186
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,720
You're overestimating yourself.

187
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,320
Young Master!

188
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,200
My head...

189
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,360
Young Master,
it must be your migraine acting up.

190
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,759
Let's get out of here.

191
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:35,480
You dare set foot in Ghost Valley, huh?
You're just courting death!

192
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:39,559
Stone, dump him in the back mountain
and feed him to the wolves.

193
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:40,960
Remember.

194
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,200
Don't let Valley Master find out.

195
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,159
Yes, Young Master.
