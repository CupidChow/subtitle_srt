=Episode 17=

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,159
The report stated

21
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,079
that the scoundrel Li Pu
led reinforcements

22
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,159
to suppress Bailan and turned the tide!

23
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,879
He was named
First-rank Protector General.

24
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,799
But that was the greatest twist

25
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,640
and the greatest deception

26
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,560
of the Jianwei Mountain battle.

27
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,000
Li Pu delayed the war.
He's punishable by law.

28
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,080
General spared his young son,

29
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,120
yet he repaid kindness with betrayal,

30
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:15,360
accusing General of treason.

31
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,400
While we were exhausted from battle,

32
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,280
he slaughtered Zhongyong Army.

33
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,520
One day the winds will break the waves,

34
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,719
and we shall sail through the vast sea.

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,759
Father, I've kept it in mind.

36
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,759
Yan, a true man walks the world

37
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,520
upright, with honesty and dignity.

38
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,080
Have a clear conscience
to Heaven and Earth.

39
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:43,080
You must remember my words.

40
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,360
Later I found out,

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,960
Li Pu led a rebellion

42
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,319
and killed Zhongyong Army

43
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,199
that same night.

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,199
Li Pu was First-rank Protector General.

45
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,560
Even His Majesty called him
the country's pillar.

46
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,759
Your words alone

47
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,400
can't convince anyone.

48
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,639
I knew it.

49
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,840
Yuan, even you don't believe me.

50
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,039
It's not that I don't.

51
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,759
This matter is serious and far-reaching.

52
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,199
I will investigate it fully.

53
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,879
If what you say is true,

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,439
I will report to His Majesty

55
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,159
and clear your names.

56
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,759
But if any of it was a lie...

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,240
I, Chen Wang, hereby swear

58
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,560
that if any part is untrue,

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I shall die by Heaven's thunder

60
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,919
and never to be reborn.

61
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:42,400
Alright, I will remember your words.

62
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,319
Have you seen Jianwei?

63
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,199
I can't find him.

64
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,990
Chai said the mountain
is heavily surrounded by troops.

65
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,680
Did that boy...

66
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Oh no. We'll talk later.

67
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,000
Yuan.

68
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:04,840
No!

69
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,800
Where...

70
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,199
Where's everyone?

71
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,840
Inspectorate's troops.

72
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,959
Si Yu.

73
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,160
Darn it, he lied.

74
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,839
My father wasn't like that!

75
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,180
(Ghost Valley)

76
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,839
Yan.

77
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,959
Aunt Qing, you're stopping me?

78
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,399
Yan, stay calm.

79
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,360
Aunt Qing.

80
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,319
Have you forgotten your promise?

81
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,560
Yan.

82
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,439
Ghost Valley is mysterious

83
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,279
and never interact
with the outside world.

84
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,160
How confident are you?

85
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,800
A blood debt must be repaid.

86
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,160
Since I'll endure this for revenge,

87
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,560
I must go
even if grave danger lies ahead.

88
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,319
But you...

89
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,759
Aunt Qing, I've made my mind.

90
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,319
Very well.

91
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,560
Perhaps the Li family isn't doomed.

92
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,759
Or I wouldn't
have been able to save you.

93
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,879
It must be Heaven's will.

94
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,639
Your mother was like a sister to me.

95
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,319
I'll do all I can to help you.

96
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,759
Do you know that this matter
is riddled with doubts?

97
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,879
I fear you'll make a grave mistake.

98
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,600
They killed my family
and shamed my father.

99
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:58,680
If I don't get revenge,

100
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,190
I'm unworthy
of being a son of the Li family.

101
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,240
I beg you

102
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,519
to give me some time.

103
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,720
Let me confirm the truth first.

104
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,040
What's there to confirm?

105
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,040
You believe his venomous words?

106
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,199
You believe
that my father was a traitor?

107
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,079
You trust those vile men?

108
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,519
An old, ill-fated bond

109
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,560
made you lose all judgment.

110
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,920
Are you deaf and blind?

111
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,680
What Chen Wang said sounds shocking.

112
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,839
But on second thought,
it's not out of the question.

113
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,720
Battle of Jianwei Mountain
had many questionable aspects.

114
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,720
The court is reopening the case.

115
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,839
I ask that you delay your revenge.

116
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,800
Let me investigate the truth.

117
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,920
If he falsely accused Li Pu,

118
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,720
I hereby swear

119
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,680
that I won't show favoritism.

120
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,279
Since I was young, Father taught me

121
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,120
to be just, loyal, and patriotic.

122
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,519
He fought for the country all his life,

123
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,680
yet is suffering such a slander.

124
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:02,319
It all boils down to my incompetence.

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,319
Even if I die tonight,

126
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,040
I must charge up Jianwei Mountain!

127
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,360
Yan, if you insist on going

128
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,759
before we find out the truth,

129
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,319
you'll have to kill me first.

130
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't think I won't!

131
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,279
Now that you know everything,

132
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,079
I don't need to hide anymore.

133
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,240
Go tell Chen Dawang.

134
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:22,920
I won't blame you.

135
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,319
Jianwei.

136
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,800
I never planned to tell Valley Master.

137
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,679
I know you have your reasons.

138
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,759
I just hope you'll let go of hatred

139
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,759
and think more about yourself.

140
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,360
Myself?

141
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,639
I've long lost who I am.

142
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,279
But you still have us.

143
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,639
You?

144
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,639
You're all my enemies!

145
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:57,639
Enemies!

146
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,120
As a son,

147
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,240
I couldn't kill my enemies.

148
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,279
How should I live with that?

149
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,919
Jianwei.

150
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,080
I want you all to be safe.

151
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,279
I don't want harm to come to anyone.

152
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,080
If you must seek revenge,

153
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,039
take my life.

154
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:30,960
Jianwei.

155
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,279
Where were you?
I've been looking all over for you!

156
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:38,559
Little Walnut,
what did you say you'd give him?

157
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,559
Nothing, Xiaoxi.

158
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,480
I said I'd give him some of the herbs

159
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,080
I prepared for you.

160
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,240
Really?

161
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,879
Alright, Xiaoxi.

162
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,360
You should worry about yourself first.

163
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,519
You caused a huge mess this time.

164
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,600
Valley Master must be furious.

165
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,159
You're so reckless!

166
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,679
You kidnapped someone

167
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,960
and risked everyone's lives.

168
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,960
Do you realize

169
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,279
you nearly destroyed Ghost Valley?

170
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
So what?

171
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,600
If they want to charge up the mountain,

172
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,480
we'll just fight them off!

173
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,120
You...

174
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,440
Do you know your limits?

175
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:06,440
Don't think your petty skills

176
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,679
make you invincible!

177
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,840
Should Chai shield you?

178
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,200
Or should Uncle Hua take the arrows?

179
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,240
Don't underestimate.

180
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,159
Do you think they risk their lives

181
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,840
just to humor you?

182
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,360
Today, I'll beat the life out of you!

183
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,600
Jianwei, what are you doing?

184
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,360
I failed to stop him in time.

185
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,440
I'm guilty too.

186
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,240
I ask to be punished with Young Master.

187
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,840
Jianwei,
this has nothing to do with you!

188
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,240
Valley Master is an honorable man.

189
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,279
I must follow your example.

190
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,840
Jianwei, leave.

191
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:46,679
Leave!

192
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,039
Jianwei.

193
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,840
Brat.

194
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,559
Do you know who suffered for you?

195
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,720
For Jianwei's sake,

196
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,720
go to the wordless monument

197
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,120
and kneel for three days.

198
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,840
That moment,

199
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:14,080
why did I feel sorry for his punishment?

200
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,480
Yesterday you scolded me.

201
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,480
What? Are you suddenly guilty today

202
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,840
that you kneel with me?

203
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,120
I really can't tell

204
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,840
which one is the real you.

205
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,360
What are you doing?

206
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,799
I'm checking if you're the same person.

207
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,159
Why so defensive?

208
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,120
How childish.

209
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,200
(Aunt Qing.)

210
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,120
(Since the enemy
used love to trick you to stop me,)

211
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,039
(I must find another way)

212
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,120
(to drive you down the mountain.)

213
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,000
(Only then can I carry out my plan.)

214
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:02,960
Jianwei.

215
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,679
Li Jianwei.

216
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,399
Why were you spacing out?

217
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:10,600
No, maybe I knelt too long.

218
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,240
You lack my experience.

219
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,519
Here.

220
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,159
Come on, take a walk.

221
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:17,960
Kneel again later.

222
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,519
It's fine. Chen Dawang won't notice.

223
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,200
Jianwei, are you hungry?

224
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,840
Good thing I came prepared.

225
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,360
You always had migraines.

226
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,840
Put this on.

227
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,000
I knew you still cared about me.

228
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,279
But no need, I can handle it.

229
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,240
Be good. Put it on.

230
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:35,000
Look! A shooting star.

231
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,559
Why are you spacing out?

232
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,639
Make a wish.

233
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,279
(Father, Mother.)

234
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,840
(What really happened 20 years ago?)

235
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,679
(What should I do now?)

236
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,799
What did you wish for?

237
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,399
It won't come true if I tell you.

238
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,200
But it's about you.

239
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,120
Do you remember

240
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,919
our promise at Blossom Manor?

241
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,799
I'll teach you Li Family's Spear Skills

242
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,639
if we make it out of here.

243
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,240
I'll teach you
Chen Family's Sword Skills.

244
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,879
Too bad we don't have any weapons here.

245
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,960
Who says we don't?

246
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,919
Use bamboo as a spear
and a twig as a blade.

247
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,600
In martial arts,

248
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,639
form doesn't matter.

249
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,639
Exactly.

(Chen Xiaoxi,
though you treated me sincerely,)

259
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,679
(it's a pity
we're destined to walk different paths.)

260
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,320
