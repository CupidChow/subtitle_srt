Send this
to Chang'an Inspectorate immediately.

22
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes, Your Highness.

23
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,680
Young Master
has infiltrated Ghost Valley,

24
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,120
but there's been no further action.

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,560
Yan probably

26
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,799
hasn't confirmed their relationship

27
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,000
with the man in black.

28
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,879
I must find a way to help him.

29
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,640
I'm tired. Have some tea and rest first.

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,759
Gentlemen, what would you like to drink?

31
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,759
Long...

32
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:15,360
Long what? Who said you could talk?

33
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,599
Boss, take his order.

34
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:21,680
Good job.
You know your place. You have potential.

35
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,599
You decide.

36
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,039
Understood, coming right up.
Please wait.

37
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,800
Li Jianwei, you didn't leave
when I told you to.

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,280
You caused me to get soaked in the rain

39
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,479
and lose a silver tael.

40
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:34,280
I'll make sure you pay for this.

41
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,560
What?
Didn't you call yourself a good seed?

42
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,599
Regretting it now?

43
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,280
Ridiculous. I never regret what I do.

44
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,280
Here it is. West Lake Longjing.

45
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,039
Here.

46
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,639
- Life itself

47
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:53,520
- Please enjoy...

Soldiers rest in graves.

50
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,639
- If gods protect, their stories remain.
- If gods protect, their stories remain.

51
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,240
(That rhyme... Could it be him?)

52
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,919
What a huge cockroach.

53
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:30,719
Where is it?

54
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,159
(The shepherd boy rides a yellow ox.
His song echoes through the woods.)

55
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,199
(Just as he's about to catch a cicada,
he suddenly stops and falls silent.)

56
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,599
(If that rhyme was Aunt Qing's doing,)

57
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,479
(she must be helping me test them.)

58
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,360
(But Chen Xiaoxi's reaction)

59
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,240
(seemed indifferent.)

60
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,439
(Could I...)

61
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,279
(have made a mistake?)

62
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,199
Wait!

63
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,040
Come here.

64
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,439
Young Master.

65
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,519
I saw everything. Why hide it?

66
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,120
You're being sneaky.
What's in your hand?

67
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,759
A sky lantern.

68
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,079
Who keeps releasing these?

69
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,199
Heroes become dust.
Soldiers rest in graves.

70
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,079
If gods protect, their stories remain.

71
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,079
What?

72
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,000
You like the nursery rhyme in the day?

73
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,600
(Does he know what it means?)

74
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,959
It's just street talk.

75
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,360
Hardly elegant.

76
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,120
How pretentious.

77
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,600
Let me warn you.

78
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,319
Just because you came with me

79
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,199
doesn't mean you're one of us.

80
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,279
If you have bad intentions,

81
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,279
I'll make you wish you were dead.

82
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,639
You're kind,

83
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,879
yet you're always scowling.

84
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,759
I mean no harm to others.

85
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,519
Except you.

86
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,439
Why?

87
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,560
You're like a fish.

88
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,000
I have no idea where you're from.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,680
So I'm the fish, and you're the knife?

90
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,000
Even killing someone's entire family
is justified?

91
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,000
You... Don't make baseless accusations.

92
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm just saying. No need to get mad.

93
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,079
(Could he know
about last year's incident?)

94
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,920
(No, I must be overthinking.)

95
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,480
(He really didn't understand the rhyme?)

96
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,560
(Did I misjudge him?)

97
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,079
Don't even think about my grilled fish.

98
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,839
An honest man won't take charity.

99
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,240
You and your moral lectures.

100
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,360
Eat it.

101
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,680
I'm being generous today.

102
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,360
Look! A shooting star.

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,680
Why are you just standing there?
Make a wish!

104
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,560
(I must avenge my family with blood.)

105
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:28,079
(Father, Mother,
I will kill our enemies myself)

106
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,240
(to bring peace to your souls.)

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,600
Arrogant and attention-seeking!

108
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,879
I don't think you see me as your father.

109
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,279
Have you ever done
anything I asked right?

110
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,519
Stop faking kindness.

111
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,959
You say it's for everyone's good.

112
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,639
Why won't you go yourself?

113
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,639
You keep hiding in the valley.
Why play hero?

114
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,519
Valley Master, Young Master meant well

115
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,639
with the rice seeds.

116
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:06,920
Jianwei, no need to help this brat.

117
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,720
He's been stubborn since he was a child.

118
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,319
All he ever does is ruin things.

119
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,639
If I have important business,

120
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,920
how can I trust him to handle it?

121
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,079
Young Master helps the weak.
He's a good man.

122
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,800
Jianwei,
no need to persuade that old man.

123
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,560
He won't listen.

124
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,160
You unfilial son, kneel properly!

125
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,120
Jianwei's more capable than you.

126
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,439
I better send him instead.

127
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,120
What do you need?

128
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,399
It's simple. Just kill someone.

129
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,360
Kill?

130
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,480
Valley Master, I...

131
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,039
Chen Dawang, you think you're better?

132
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,120
It's just killing one man.

133
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,399
I'll do it now.

134
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,240
Stop right there.

135
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,320
You unfilial brat.

136
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,039
Stay put.

137
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,279
Don't go anywhere!

138
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,759
Jianwei.

139
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,960
What were you about to say?

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,240
Who do you want to kill?

141
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,919
A petty horse thief.

142
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,720
He killed one of us three years ago.

143
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,519
He's hard to trace.

144
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,759
He's been said
to be seen in Rong City lately.

145
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,360
(Rong City?)

146
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,279
Jianwei.

147
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,360
You've been in Ghost Valley
for some time now.

148
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,279
How have I treated you?

149
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,759
You took me in.

150
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,159
You're my savior.

151
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:28,799
Good.

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,480
Don't let me down then.

153
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,759
Please enjoy.

154
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,039
You fool.

155
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:40,840
Bring that bowl here.

156
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,440
Found something?

157
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,519
Bring a few more.

158
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,240
These people are strange.

159
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,360
They live in seclusion,

160
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,960
yet they're tight-lipped about the past.

161
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,840
How did they react to the nursery rhyme?

162
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,360
They acted as usual,

163
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,919
but

164
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
they want me to go to Rong City
to kill someone.

165
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,480
Who?

166
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,440
They didn't say.

167
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:12,200
They only mentioned a horse thief.

168
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,039
Do you believe them?

169
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,320
I'm just going along with them.

170
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,799
Are you following me?

171
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,440
I'm just checking
what you're capable of.

172
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,679
In case you make a mistake

173
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,080
and drag Ghost Valley down with you.

174
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,919
