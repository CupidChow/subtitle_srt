20
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,799
Look! A sky lantern.

21
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,760
- A sky lantern.
- A sky lantern.

22
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,640
(Oh no. It’s a message from Aunt Qing.)

23
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,840
(They mustn't find out about it.)

24
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,680
It's getting warmer.

25
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,560
If the lantern falls in the woods,

26
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,599
it might cause a wildfire.

27
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,680
Better shoot it down quickly.

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,680
You're overreacting.

29
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,640
Xiaoxi, Jianwei has a point.

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,879
We'd better shoot it down.

31
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:06,959
Just in case.

32
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,319
I'll do it.

33
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,360
Who do you think you are?

34
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,159
You don't call the shots
in my territory.

35
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,080
Get lost.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,919
Over there, Young Master!

37
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,960
Show us what you can do!

38
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,560
Young Master, that way!

39
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,319
Aim carefully and shoot!

40
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,400
- Brilliant!
- Great aim!

41
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,120
Great!

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,520
Impressive!

43
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,719
Come on, let's continue drinking!

44
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,719
- Bottoms up.
- Here.

45
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,319
Li Jianwei,
sky lanterns can cause fires.

46
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,080
It's dangerous
if it falls in the forest.

47
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,759
Go to the forest alone

48
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,919
and retrieve it for me.

49
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,960
Xiaoxi, don't.

50
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:59,680
There are wolves in the mountain.
Sending him there alone

51
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,039
will kill him.

52
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,240
Exactly.

53
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,879
I want him to go into the wolf pack

54
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,800
to retrieve the sky lantern.

55
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,400
Li Jianwei, you need to prove yourself

56
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,840
if you want to stay.

57
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,639
Young Master is right.

58
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,080
I think this pretty boy

59
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,639
is likely too scared to go.

60
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,080
This is nothing.

61
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,960
Back then, Valley Master led us

62
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,439
to fight wolves for days

63
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,960
to claim this land.

64
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,120
To Valley Master!

65
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,319
- Here! To Valley Master!
- Here!

66
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,599
- Here. Drink up!
- Drink up!

67
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,919
Jianwei, no pressure.

68
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,080
Eat. Dig in.

69
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,960
Valley Master took care of us
all these years.

70
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,879
Valley Master, in that case,

71
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,080
I, Li Jianwei, must go.

72
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,520
Xiaoxi is a grown man now.

73
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,759
Jianwei.

74
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,240
Be careful.

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,599
He's got nerve.
Not bad. He's really going.

76
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,199
That place is full of wolves.

77
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,399
- Yes.
- Why is he not back yet?

78
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,920
He's been gone so long.

79
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,240
Maybe he's dead.

80
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,439
Serves him right.

81
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,360
Xiaoxi, don't say that.

82
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,399
I wonder how he's doing.

83
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,920
Maybe he got eaten.

84
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,160
Let's eat.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,319
Come on, drink.

86
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,759
- Here.
- Come on.

87
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,560
He's back.

88
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,279
Jianwei!

89
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,480
How was it?

90
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,360
Sit down!

91
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,279
How was it, Jianwei?

92
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,399
Young Master, catch!

93
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:02,759
Here, fill the glass.

94
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,560
This is a wolf fang.

95
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,480
- A wolf fang?
- A wolf fang?

96
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,439
He actually brought one back.

97
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,120
- Is it the alpha wolf's fang?
- Yes.

98
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,319
It's really a wolf fang.

99
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,639
Jianwei's a real man.

100
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,959
He's good.

101
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,800
- Yes, he's good.
- Yes.

102
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
(The yearning to pick flowers in spring
drifts down the path.)

103
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,199
(The breeze
keeps the clouds from rising.)

104
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,439
(Riding the wind, I soar skyward.)

105
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,240
(Blossoms in Chang'an
carry news of peace.)

106
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,319
Unnecessary.

107
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,879
Just run if you run into wolves,

108
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,319
we won't make fun of you.

109
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,600
- Yes.
- That's right.

110
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,439
He's a real man.

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,199
Young Master

112
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,920
only wanted to test my abilities.

113
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,600
I meant to kill them,

114
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,360
but I remembered
what Little Walnut told me.

115
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:11,879
Young Master took her from a wolf pack.

116
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,959
You know a lot. So what?

117
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,319
That pack may have raised her.

118
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,839
Since I've taken the fang,

119
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,879
why take its life too?

120
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,639
Excuses. You're just lucky today.

121
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,040
You're good, bold,

122
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
and kind.

123
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,639
Xiaoxi, fill Jianwei's glass.

124
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,439
Chen Xiaoxi!

125
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,759
Come on, drink up!

126
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,759
- Drink up.
- Here.

127
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,839
Have some more.

128
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,199
There's meat too.

129
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,279
Stone.

130
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,360
It's better to eat it like this.

131
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,720
Yes, chow down on the meat.

132
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,079
Hold this.

133
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,839
A toast to you.

134
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,399
Li Jianwei.

135
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,839
- Wake up.
- Jianwei.

136
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,399
- Li Jianwei, wake up!
- Jianwei!

137
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,519
Wake up. Hurry.

138
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,000
Well? When will he wake?

139
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,240
I'll brew more medicine for him.

140
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,680
Come with me.

141
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,120
What do you think of him?

142
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,000
He's quite bold.

143
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,360
But Father, I don't understand

144
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,679
why you suddenly change your mind

145
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,519
and let him stay?

146
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
What if he means harm?

147
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,399
Won't we be inviting danger?

148
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,320
He's no petty criminal.

149
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,600
Anyone who escapes a wolf pack

150
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,919
must know how to fight.

151
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,399
He also reads people well
and handles situations with tact.

152
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,279
Let him live for now.

153
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:56,679
Know yourself and your enemy,
and you'll never lose.

154
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,679
Remember, never let your guard down.

155
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,159
No wonder I gave him such a hard time,

156
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,159
yet he endured it all.

157
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,320
Clever indeed.

158
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,720
Tell everyone to keep their mouths shut.

159
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,440
Let the past stay in the past.

160
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,440
(The past?)

161
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,919
(What past?)

162
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,519
Didn't that whole family die last year?

163
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,159
Someone survived.
Valley Master knows that too.

164
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:41,720
No wonder
he sent Young Master to handle it.

165
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,840
You can't hide things forever.

166
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,120
(They're saying someone
from my family survived.)

167
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,399
(No.)

168
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,440
(There's no way they know I survived.)

169
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,240
Valley affairs are being discussed.
Outsiders stay out!

170
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,720
- Get out!
- I...

171
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,200
Go.

172
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,759
This affects our survival.
No time to lose.

173
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
Xiaoxi, go down with Stone.

174
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,639
Make sure it's done right.

175
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,679
No mistakes allowed.

176
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:10,759
Rest assured.

177
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,559
(Something's indeed fishy.)

178
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,440
(These scoundrels are hiding
something about Ghost Valley.)

179
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,559
(Why live in seclusion here?)

180
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,600
(Also,)

181
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,759
(what's with that triple-barbed arrow?)

182
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,480
What a small world for enemies.

183
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,879
Young Master, why not take him with us?

184
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,120
We'll have one more helper.

185
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,720
You're right.

186
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:49,919
Li Jianwei.

187
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,679
Follow me down the mountain
to handle a serious business.

188
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,240
No.

189
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,840
Don't reject kindness
and ask for trouble.

190
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,759
So what?

191
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,799
You have no choice.

192
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,399
Are you selling or not?

193
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,399
What? Trying to scare me?

194
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,399
Come on. Strike right here.

195
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,919
Let me tell you peasants.

196
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,320
Get lost if you can't afford it!

197
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,590
Is this
what you call "serious business"?

198
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,440
Don't get in the way of my business!

199
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,320
Yes, it's maddening.

200
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,879
This is no ordinary place.
Don't be rash.

201
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,279
That's more like it.

202
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,159
Pay up if you want it. Right?

203
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,480
Not a single coin less.

204
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,320
Business is built on honesty.

205
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,960
Raising prices on the spot is dishonest.

206
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,279
Say that again, punk. Again!

207
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,039
Let him go!

208
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,559
How dare you touch my man?

209
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,480
I'll burn this shop down.

210
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
Try it.

211
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,679
These are just crop seeds.

212
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:55,360
If you can't afford it,
I'll donate it to you.

213
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,960
Are you leaving? Get lost!

214
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,279
I'm not doing business with you!

215
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,120
Leave!

216
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,799
I'm not doing business with you!

217
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,840
- Go!
- Let's go.

(Zhou Agricultural Seeds)

219
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,759
Leave!

220
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,000
You're wasting grain.
Aren't you afraid of heaven's wrath?

221
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:13,559
Heaven's wrath?

222
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:14,639
Listen here.

223
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,440
I rather feed the crop seeds to pigs

224
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,080
than selling to you peasants.

225
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,639
You, come here.

226
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,279
How many times have I told you

227
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,159
to get rid of that old hag?

228
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:27,639
Alright.

229
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:29,720
If she comes here again...
If I see her again,

230
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,679
you're fired!

231
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,200
Leave! Get lost!

232
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,200
Get lost!

233
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,039
Leave! All of you!

234
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,159
One day

235
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,759
I'll burn this place to the ground!

236
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,279
