00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,319
The Ghost Valley
has always been mysterious,

21
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,200
never interacting
with the outside world.

22
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,960
(Princess Qingyuan, Deputy Commissioner)
How confident are you?

23
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:48,159
(of Chang'an Supervision Bureau)
How confident are you?

24
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,920
I must avenge it.

25
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,319
Since I've willingly accepted
this painful exchange,

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,640
I'll do it
no matter how dangerous it is.

27
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,120
But you...

28
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,039
I've made up my mind, Aunt Qing.

29
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:13,919
Fine.

30
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,080
Perhaps your family is meant to survive.

31
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,280
Otherwise, I wouldn't
have been able to save you.

32
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,080
Maybe it's Heaven's will.

33
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,240
Your mother and I
were as close as sisters.

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,840
I will surely lend you a hand.

35
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,350
(Ghost Valley)

36
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,000
You're awake.

37
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,840
(Little Walnut)
Don't worry, it's just superficial wounds.

38
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,759
I've applied
a special Ghost Valley remedy

39
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,560
on them.

40
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,439
You should get well soon.

41
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,360
Thank you for saving my life, Miss.

42
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,240
Oh, right. I'm Little Walnut.

43
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,960
What's your name?

44
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,680
Li Jianwei.

45
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,439
Li Jianwei? What a coincidence.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,360
It's the same name as the mountain.

47
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,520
Could it be you're the one
my brother brought up the mountain?

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,319
But I heard it was a courtesan.

49
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,080
You're his sister?

50
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,680
But we're not blood-related.

51
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,520
My brother found me

52
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,000
in a wolf pack when I was little.

53
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,560
No wonder you two

54
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,560
are so different.

55
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,319
This place isn't safe.

56
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,759
You should leave now.

57
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,800
Follow the stream upstream,
and you'll get out of the mountain.

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,800
Here are some fresh clothes. Go now.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,759
Go on!

60
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,759
Thank you.

61
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:01,150
(Jianwei Mountain, Ghost Valley)

62
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,960
- Greetings, Valley Master.
- Greetings, Valley Master.

63
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,159
Greetings, Valley Master.

64
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,560
Stop rushing me, Stone.
I'm having a soak here.

65
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,680
(Darn it. It's him again.)

66
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,439
Get me some cotton.

67
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,839
This herbal salve
made by Little Walnut stinks.

68
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,079
(Maybe I should seize this chance)

69
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,639
(and end your miserable life.)

70
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,920
Did you hear me?

71
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,759
Are you deaf? Hand it to me.

72
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,480
(Still acting cocky
at death's door, huh?)

73
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Give me a massage.

74
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,560
(Let's see how long you can stay smug.)

75
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,759
If you ask me,

76
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,800
that darned fortune teller
brought it on himself.

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,040
He had it coming.

78
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,000
Stone, once the sun rises,

79
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,480
we'll head to the back mountain
and check on it.

80
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
However, by then,

81
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,879
the wolves probably
won't leave even bones behind.

82
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,000
(This is intolerable!)

83
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,680
Let's see

84
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,160
which of us wins today.

85
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,240
You darned fortune teller.
How dare you ambush me?

86
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,959
Shut up!

87
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,120
Stone!

88
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,079
- Young Master!
- Stay back!

89
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,279
Let go of our young master, sir!

90
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,680
From the looks of it,

91
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,720
you're not doing much better.

92
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,720
You're despicable and shameless!

93
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,959
Same to you. You'd better behave.

94
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,959
Move. Take me to your valley master.

95
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,199
In your dreams!

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,480
No! I'll take you to him, sir!

97
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,639
(Chen Dawang, Valley Master)
One is responsible for his own actions.

98
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,639
Since Young Master caused all this,

99
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,839
he should deal with it on his own.

100
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,199
Did you hear that?

101
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,480
There's no use holding me hostage.

102
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,959
I suggest you surrender immediately.

103
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,160
I'll even spare you an ugly death.

104
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,839
If so, I'll drag you down with me.

105
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,920
Xiaoxi.

106
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,600
Valley Master.

107
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,199
So you're the one who asked to see me?

108
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
This is our valley master.

109
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,120
State your conditions.

110
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,160
Stay out of this, Chen Dawang.

111
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,800
Worst case, I'll die with him.

112
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,959
I'll get rid of you now!

113
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,319
Hold on. If you let my son go,

114
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,160
you have my word.

115
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,279
I won't harm you at all.

116
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,319
You're all cut from the same cloth.
Why should I trust you?

117
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,040
A real man stands by his word.

118
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,560
I will never break my promise.

119
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,879
Everyone, fall back.

120
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,000
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

121
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,600
I hope you keep your word.

122
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,000
Of course.

123
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,879
All's fair in war.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Such despicable behavior.

125
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,680
I'll kill you!

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,879
No, Xiaoxi!

127
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,079
No!

128
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,360
A gentleman is both honest and upright.
I always mean what I say.

129
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,920
I never kill the innocent.

130
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,240
Even if you must die,

131
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,639
you'll die knowing the reason.

132
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,519
Kneel!

133
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,800
You carry yourself with confidence,
and you have a striking appearance.

134
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,759
Since you managed
to infiltrate the Ghost Valley,

135
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,720
you must be here with a motive.

136
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,519
So let's not beat around the bush.

137
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,399
(I'm outnumbered,
and they're rather skilled.)

138
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,039
(So I must not act rashly.)

139
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,240
(After all, avenging my family
is above all else, including my own life.)

140
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,000
I am Li Jianwei.
I trained in martial arts as a child.

141
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,919
But my parents died of illness.

142
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,230
Since then, I've survived
reading fortunes and studying feng shui.

143
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,440
This darned fortune-teller
is full of tricks.

144
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,879
Don't believe a word he says.

145
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,080
Every word I said is true.
I'm not lying at all.

146
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,240
Then what do you want?

147
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:57,039
I saw that Mount Jianwei
is encircled by water like a jade belt.

148
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,320
It must be a treasure trove
teeming with talent.

149
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,440
So I had no choice
but to come seize it.

150
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,799
Seize it?

151
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,360
You must be mistaken.

152
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,679
We're just rough men living in the wild.

153
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:13,559
These poor mountains and harsh rivers
are no treasure trove.

154
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,919
There's no place for you here.

155
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,799
I respect you as a real man.

156
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,759
You'll leave the mountain
tomorrow morning.

157
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,120
You're being foolish, Chen Dawang!

158
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,320
We absolutely cannot let him leave!

159
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,120
And what if I insist on staying?

160
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,360
Then you'll meet your demise here.

161
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:37,960
Mount Jianwei will definitely
have a place for you, then.

162
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,320
You brat. You've always been a slacker.

163
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,600
Not only did you sneak down the mountain,

164
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:52,600
but you also dared kidnapped a stranger!

165
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,039
Do you admit your mistake?

166
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,039
Foster Father, I admit my mistake,
but I'm not going to yield!

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,759
I got tricked by him out of carelessness,

168
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,200
but nothing serious happened.

169
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,150
That means
you still don't understand your mistake.

170
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:09,039
We live in seclusion,

171
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,279
rarely interacting
with the outside world.

172
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,120
Yet you caused such a commotion.

173
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,230
If so, you shouldn't have stopped me
from getting rid of him.

174
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,799
Instead, why are you letting him go?

175
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:20,440
This man's origins are unclear.
And he's been acting suspiciously.

176
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,919
If we want to uncover his motives,

177
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,519
we must play along and let him leave.

178
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,120
It's just a test

179
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,440
to gauge his sincerity
and resolve to stay.

180
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,440
And what if he really does leave?

181
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,519
Then I'll make sure
he dies a swift death.

182
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,399
The Ghost Valley's secret

183
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,840
must never be revealed.

184
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,919
Is that so?
I thought you'd lost your edge.

185
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,120
Kneel!

186
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,039
How many times have I told you?

187
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,759
When trouble comes,
stay calm and think it through.

188
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,200
You're always acting recklessly.

189
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,799
If you ever make a grave mistake,

190
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,200
how will you answer
