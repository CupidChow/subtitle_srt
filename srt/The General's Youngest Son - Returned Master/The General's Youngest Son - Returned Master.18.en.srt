00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,919
Yes, Young Master.

30
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,120
What are you doing?

31
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,520
Nothing.

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,280
You're not going to bury this, are you?

(Li Pu)
You once said

34
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:53,520
grudges should end with death.

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,360
Now that you've had revenge,

36
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,000
why continue disgracing him?

37
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,599
Prepare to die!

38
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,520
Why must you be so extreme?

39
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,719
To seek justice for them.

40
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,479
Them?

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,800
Justice?

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,319
Li Jianwei.

44
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,159
You're a lousy fortune-teller.

45
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,719
How do you know
Li Family's Spear Skills?

46
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,639
Why did you kill Li Yan?

47
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,599
How do you know
the unfathomable Aunt Qing?

48
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,240
We'll be out soon.

49
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,520
Li Yan.

50
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,159
Are you here for my life?

51
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:13,960
(Isn't this)

52
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,800
(the martial artist from Rong City
who protected Li Yan?)

53
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,199
(Why is she here?)

54
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,680
Your Highness.

55
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,399
Any findings from your mountain trip?

56
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,759
This is Ghost Valley's map
from Chen Wang.

57
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,959
Just in case we need it.

60
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,759
Time is running out for us.

61
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,000
But is there any progress
on Young Master's end?

62
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,560
The Li family massacre seems simple,

63
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,110
but it's related

64
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,759
to the Battle of Jianwei Mountain
20 years ago.

65
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,920
You mean the Zhongyong Army case?

66
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,560
My elders were framed.

67
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,560
It's unclear now,
but it's very suspicious.

68
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,879
This case is indeed complicated.

69
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,279
I've had doubts for some time.

70
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,879
During the trap at Rong City,
I fought them

71
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,319
and found their skills

72
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,319
is identical to my father's.

73
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,439
Both army style.

74
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,680
However...

75
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,800
Your Highness, our intention

76
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,279
is to help Young Master seek revenge.

77
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,560
(Trap Rong City...)

78
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,439
(Help him seek revenge...)

79
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:25,920
Who's there?

80
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,399
The emperor titled him
Protector General.

81
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,959
Everyone praised his loyalty.

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,800
He crushed Bailan 20 years ago.

83
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,279
Yes.

84
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,160
They're already dead.

85
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,000
Why still act all noble?

Nothing.

108
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,199
I just didn't notice we walked so far.

109
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,199
I remember you got drunk once,

110
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,879
grabbed a scarecrow and ran

111
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,720
in front of everyone.

112

114
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,399
I drank too much that day.

115
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,160
Seems like
you can't hold your liquor too well.

116
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,319
You need training.

that scarecrow around here.

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,480

dig it up and take a look?

123
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:53,799
It's pointless.

And you

129
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,879
never really understood me either.

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,279
