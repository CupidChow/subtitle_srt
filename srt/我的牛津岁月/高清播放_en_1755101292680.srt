1
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,250
<i>I didn't travel 10,000 miles</i>

2
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,750
<i>to spend my first morning in England</i>

3
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,710
<i>talking to some wise-ass chick
from Weehawken, New Jersey.</i>

4
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,870
Look here! The building...

5
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,750
Ignore him. Not him. This!

6
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,580
Look at the building behind...

7
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,630
That's where she's going to study!

8
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,960
Bill Clinton went to Oxford.

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,170
Mmm!

10
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,460
And she already has a job lined up
at Goldman Sachs when she finishes.

11
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,460
Oxford graduates earn 25% more
than other graduates.

12
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,790
It'd be easier
to Google Oxford on your phone, Mom.

13
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,000
Mmm! There she is!

14
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,420
- We're going to miss you, Anna.
- I'll be home before you know it.

15
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,710
Oh, imagine.

16
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,000
Beautiful England.

17
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,790
<i>Although I do hear it rains a lot.</i>

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,290
<i>Give away...</i>

19
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,420
<i>The poet Henry David Thoreau
took himself to the woods</i>

20
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,630
<i>to, as he put it, "live deliberately."</i>

21
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,620
<i>Inspired by the idea
of living a planned life,</i>

22
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,250
<i>I studied hard, graduated summa cum laude,</i>

23
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,710
<i>and secured a Wall Street job,
which I deferred,</i>

24
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,210
<i>so I could take a year for myself,</i>

25
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,620
<i>studying Victorian poetry
at the University of Oxford.</i>

26
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,500
<i>A year to live my dream.</i>

27
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,460
<i>Everything was going exactly to plan.</i>

28
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,750
<i>Until it wasn't.</i>

29
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,210
<i>Anything you want, make it happen</i>

30
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,210
<i>Do what you have to</i>

31
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,380
<i>Anything you want, make it happen</i>...

32
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,670
Okay.

33
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,630
<i>Ooh, just imagine...</i>

34
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,080
Your beauty will fade,
as will my interest.

35
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,500
Hi.

36
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,040
- Um, I'm Anna de la Vega.
- Who the bloody hell's that?

37
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,120
An American.

38
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,330
Wonderful face. Shocking shoes.

39
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,000
Bellend!

40
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,670
Whoa, raining, is it?

41
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,080
Not exactly.

42
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,670
Hi. Um...

43
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,370
I would like to order
some fish and chips, please.

44
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,370
Haddock?

45
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,710
A duck? Uh...

46
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,120
No. Fish.

47
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,210
Yeah, haddock. Or cod. Or saveloy.

48
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,670
I'm not... I, uh... I...

49
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,920
Just... Fish and chips?

50
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,000
- Large?
- Large! Yes!

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,130
- 8.50, five minutes.
- Great.

52
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,420
Jamie, this is not
the finest dining in Oxford.

53
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,710
Well, it's top three. Hello, mate.

54
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,420
Can I get two large cod, mushy peas,
pickled onions, and some chips, please?

55
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,920
Chips?

56
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,750
Should you be having those?

57
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,210
Oh my God, you're so right. Moment
on the lips, lifetime on the hips, right?

58
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,580
Uh, can we make that
two extra-large chips, please?

59
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,750
Ignore the lady. She has yet to learn
how to live deliberately.

60
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,420
It's not me telling you
that you can't have--

61
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,250
What are you doing?

62
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,830
Oh my God, are you hiding?

63
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,210
No. I'm battling an unruly shoelace.

64
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,710
You're hiding from Jessica Borne!

65
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,210
Honestly, it is a wonder
you can get out of the house

66
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,960
with all the women you leave in your wake.

67
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,620
She's gone now, anyway.
She probably recognized your car.

68
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,080
Yeah, probably. One of the pitfalls
of owning a rare car. It's like a beacon.

69
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,460
That's where Bond went wrong.
Should have driven a Ford Focus.

70
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh my God. You!

71
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,960
Me?

72
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,330
Yeah, you're the bellend.
You drenched me with your car.

73
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,290
Oh. Oh!

74
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,420
Oh... Oh?

75
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,420
Well, I'm... Shit!

76
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,920
Fish and chips for you, love.

77
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,880
I really... I really am sorry.

78
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,580
Genuinely.

79
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,580
Yeah, me too.

80
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,120
- Hey!
- No. No!

81
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,130
He's in here!

82
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,040
Hiding from you.

83
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,380
No, no, no, no.

84
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,750
- Uh...
- Jessica, darling.

85
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,540
- Hello.
- All right? I was... Something...

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Welcome

87
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,500
to the University of Oxford,

88
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,460
<i>an institution which has been here
for hundreds of years,</i>

89
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,540
<i>and which in each and every one
of those years</i>

90
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,460
<i>has welcomed a new group of young people.</i>

91
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,210
<i>Great leaders, great scientific minds,
literary visionaries</i>

92
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,670
have all passed through
these doors before you.

93
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,500
You will forget parties you attended here,

94
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,710
and you will forget friends you made here,

95
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:00,880
but you will never forget the learning
and the studying you did here.

96
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,920
Your time here is precious.

97
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,540
It will disappear in a blink.

98
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,580
Seize it.

99
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,580
- It's okay. you're on time.
- Oh!

100
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,040
Right, yeah. I was just... I...

101
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,710
I was at the... the thing with the...

102
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,790
- I'm Maggie Timbs.
- Hi, I'm Anna de la Vega.

103
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,830
- Are you American?
- I am, yes. From Queens, New York.

104
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,870
Good morning. I have arrived.

105
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,080
Charlie! How was your summer?

106
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,710
Pfft. Loveless.

107
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,040
I was stalking that Adonis rower
with bedroom eyes and pecs as hard as--

108
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,250
This is Anna.

109
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,080
- Ah. Hello, new girl.
- We've actually met.

110
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,580
Your neighbor?
You said I had shocking shoes.

111
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,250
Surprised a charmer like you
could remain loveless all summer.

112
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,960
- Loveless, darling, not sexless.
- Ah.

113
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,830
And that wonderful smile
more than makes up for those shoes.

114
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,960
Hello, hello, hello, all.

115
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,170
Oh my God, it's Professor Styan.
She's my hero.

116
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,710
She's the reason I came here.

117
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,330
Terrible news, I'm afraid.

118
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,290
I've been named head of graduate studies,

119
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:33,000
which means I'm far too important to be
teaching you lot, this term at least.

120
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,870
My cover is more than able. In fact, he's
my annoyingly brilliant DPhil student.

121
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,460
I'll do the marking. He'll do
the teaching. Best of both worlds for me.

122
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,120
It's not exploiting youth labor.

123
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,750
He actually wants to teach. His lookout.

124
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:51,370
So, um... yeah.
I guess I'll see you around, guys.

125
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,120
Over to you, Jamie.

126
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,210
Uh, thank you. Uh... Hello.

127
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,170
Oh my God, you have got to be kidding me.

128
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,040
Okay, now that is
a serious bit of crumpet.

129
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,000
So, as this is my first class,

130
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,420
I thought that I would set the tone
by offering you

131
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,830
a bribe.

132
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,750
It's a

133
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,880
massive cake.

134
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:18,960
So...

135
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,960
Help yourselves.

136
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,000
Ah, didn't need the cake. I'd eat him.

137
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah.

138
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:30,170
Five years ago,
I sat right where you are now.

139
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,920
Professor Styan walked in,
and I thought to myself,

140
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,130
"So this is the woman who's going to
bore me to tears for the next few months."

141
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,500
Um...

142
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,000
Hello.

143
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,250
It's you.

144
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,210
Hi.

145
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,630
Hi.

146
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:53,380
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
we have a student here all the way from...

147
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,880
- New York.
- New York, New York. Welcome, welcome.

148
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,420
I notice you don't have any cake.
We have to make you feel at home.

149
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,960
And they do say that everything

150
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,960
is bigger in New York.

151
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,500
Actually, that's Texas.

152
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,130
Either way.

153
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,080
- I don't really want the cake.
- Don't want the cake?

154
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,040
- No.
- Fine. Yeah.

155
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,540
It's just that Mrs. Mackenzie crafted it
in our very own college kitchen,

156
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,710
so it's basically an insult
to the college,

157
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,120
everyone here, and all of Oxford--

158
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,750
- I'm going to eat it.
- I'm not gonna force you to eat it.

159
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,290
- It's slightly unusual--
- I want it.

160
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,960
- I know you do, but--
- I insist.

161
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,750
Mmm.

162
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,250
It's delicious.

163
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,250
Good. So, poetry.

164
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,040
I liked poetry, but, I mean,
Victorian poetry, that's for my dad.

165
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,120
Stale old men in top hats
banging on about the glory of foreign wars

166
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,750
might not be the most exciting thing
in the world, but

167
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,870
never in my wildest dreams

168
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,080
did I expect to find
in the work of the Victorians

169
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,170
such... despair,

170
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,830
such terror, such beauty,

171
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,710
wisdom, lust.

172
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,330
If you don't mind,

173
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,830
I would love it if you read us this poem.

174
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,210
It was written by an American,

175
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:30,880
so I think we'd all like it
if we heard it in the original cadence.

176
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,000
<i>"My candle burns at both ends</i>

177
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,380
<i>It will not last the night</i>

178
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,130
<i>But, ah, my foes, and, oh, my friends</i>

179
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,460
<i>It gives a lovely light"</i>

180
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,330
Thank you.

181
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,670
That was Edna St. Vincent Millay.

182
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,460
There are many different
interpretations of those words,

183
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,670
but here's my tuppence worth.

184
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:02,870
I believe that what she is saying is that
a well-lived life might come at a price,

185
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,630
but bugger me
if it's not worth every penny.

186
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,960
Nothing is permanent.

187
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,080
Our passions, our loves,
or indeed our lives

188
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,670
might indeed be fleeting,

189
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:19,130
but if, while we have the chance,
we embrace them fully,

190
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,750
then we can say that we have truly lived.

191
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:27,370
Poetry... Poetry can be taught,
but, really, it should be tried.

192
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,000
It should be tested.
It should be engaged with.

193
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,040
Take it on. Allow it to change your life.

194
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,330
And so, in that vein, I will endeavor
to teach you but one thing in my class.

195
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,790
Can anyone guess what it might be?

196
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,630
To eat cake?

197
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,630
Every chance you get.

198
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,380
Uh, ping them in an email to me,
and we can, uh, schedule a tute.

199
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,290
Yeah. So...

200
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,500
Uh, can I have a word?

201
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,580
So you're my American MA scholar.

202
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,630
And you're not the professor
I came to see.

203
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,040
Uh, no, but, uh, I'm only covering
for Professor Styan

204
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,670
when she can't be bothered.

205
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,170
She's very lazy, actually.
Sorry to disappoint.

206
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,000
I am disappointed.

207
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,870
- So, the other day...
- Hmm.

208
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,040
Um...

209
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,670
- I don't normally hide in chip shops.
- And drench people with puddles.

210
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,880
Terrible mistake.

211
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,370
Truly, I... I had absolutely no intention

212
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,540
of starting an impromptu
wet T-shirt competition.

213
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,500
But if I did, then you'd win.

214
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,370
Shouldn't be discussing
wet T-shirt competitions.

215
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,500
Never been to one.

216
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,920
Obviously.

217
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,130
Um... Once...

218
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,960
I'm actually very mature.

219
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,670
Oh, well, that is very reassuring.

220
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:11,170
- So am I.
- Congratulations,<i>Professor</i> Davenport.

221
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,670
- Your first class.
- Uh, would you like some cake?

222
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,250
No, of course not. When was the last time
you saw me eat cake?

223
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,580
My birthday?

224
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,210
Anna!

225
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,830
Hey.

226
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,040
Flirting with the hot teacher
on the first day?

227
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,210
- What? No! I, uh--
- Oh, no, I love it.

228
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,710
Have you got a bike?

229
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,620
I have not.

230
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,750
You can't be in Oxford
and not have a bike.

231
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,630
Right, get on. I know a man.

232
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,120
- Is it safe?
- Oh, I wouldn't have thought so.

233
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,460
It's not.

234
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,460
I think I'll... I'll follow you.

235
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,380
Well, I hope you're quick.

236
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Good luck.

237
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,710
Oh. Maggie!

238
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,870
Coming!

239
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,370
Mother of God!

240
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,330
Oh God, not again.

241
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,750
Oh, my...

242
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,580
Hello, Tom. Everything all right?

243
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,460
Dropped a bloody copy of Hargreaves'
medical ailments on my metatarsal.

244
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,210
Ouch. The irony.

245
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,870
Well, this is Anna. She's from America.

246
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,580
Anna, which are we destined to be?
Friends or lovers?

247
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,370
- Friends.
- Absolutely sure?

248
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,830
- Positive.
- 100%?

249
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,040
- Friends.
- Wow. Cold.

250
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,580
The best ones
are always the cruelest. Right?

251
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,460
- Not always.
- Come in.

252
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,420
- Hey, have you got that book I lent--
- No!

253
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,460
Wow.

254
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,500
Here she is.

255
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,370
The Duchess.

256
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,210
Okay. Wow. She is so... so British.

257
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:01,580
- Which is... a good thing?
- Oh, yeah.

258
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,420
If it's British you're after, then I have
the perfect evening of entertainment.

259
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,460
<i>Welcome to</i> Naked Attraction<i>,</i>

260
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,920
<i>the dating show
that likes to let it all hang out.</i>

261
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,170
It's funny. It's classic. So subversive.

262
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:16,040
She's right. You know,
<i>Naked Attraction</i> is subversive.

263
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,460
Oh, no, I meant "A Man's Requirements"
by Elizabeth Barrett Browning.

264
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,000
Listen.

265
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,920
<i>"Thus, if thou wilt prove me, Dear
Woman's love no fable</i>

266
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,580
<i>I will love thee half a year
As a man is able"</i>

267
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,960
Uh... How is that subversive?

268
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,460
She calls out
the arrested development man whore

269
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,500
in the 1800s.

270
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,830
It's brilliant.
It's perfect for Professor Davenport.

271
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,830
I'm gonna go send it.

272
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,880
My God, she's keen. She's left
before they revealed the penises.

273
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,580
Oh, there they are.

274
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,790
- I would like you to leave.
- Fine!

275
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,170
You'd better be there. Do you hear me?

276
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,250
- Sorry. Um... I can come back.
- No.

277
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,920
No, come in. Take a seat.

278
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,750
What did you think of your piece?

279
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,500
I...

280
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,250
I think I made some good insights,
observations, and analyses.

281
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,460
What did you think of my work?

282
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,750
Work? That's exactly what it felt like.

283
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:08,580
In 3,000 words, you managed to explore
the suffragettes, the birth of feminism,

284
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,250
Salem witch hunts.

285
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,130
It's an extraordinary accomplishment.
You did everything except the assignment.

286
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,920
Okay, well, um...

287
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,330
I will go work on it some more.

288
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,750
Wait, no, no. Um...

289
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,830
I'm so sorry.

290
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,830
Um... Let's start again, please.
I'm so sorry.

291
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,960
Weird morning.

292
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,790
Out of all the poems in the book,
why did you... choose this one?

293
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,460
Because I think
it speaks to a truth about men.

294
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,580
You think that men are only capable
of loving a woman for six months?

295
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,120
Some men, yes.

296
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,960
But what if they love deeply

297
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,580
for that time?

298
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,380
Do you think that things
are only meaningful if they last forever?

299
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,790
Of course.

300
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,330
Well, I think that you picked this poem

301
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,370
because you think
that it speaks to something about me,

302
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,670
which is disappointing,

303
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,500
because I wanted to know
something about you.

304
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,040
I want you to pick a different poem.
The first one... that speaks to you.

305
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,040
- You have one?
- Mmm.

306
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,630
Great.

307
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,540
<i>"Ah, love, let us be true to one another</i>

308
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,500
<i>For the world which seems to lie before us
Like a land of dreams</i>

309
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,170
<i>So various, so beautiful, so new"</i>

310
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,330
<i>"Hath really neither joy
Nor love, nor light"</i>

311
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,830
<i>"Nor certitude, nor peace</i>

312
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,130
<i>Nor help for pain</i>

313
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,920
<i>And we are here as on a darkling plain"</i>

314
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,120
<i>"Swept with confused alarms
Of struggle and flight"</i>

315
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,710
<i>"Where ignorant armies clash by night"</i>

316
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Now, quick, without thinking,
what is Matthew Arnold saying?

317
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,210
I think that the reality of life
is that it's hard.

318
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,630
But at least we have each other.

319
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,670
I'm impressed.

320
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:50,790
You found hope
in the single most pessimistic poem

321
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,170
of the Victorian era.

322
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,000
Well. now you know something about me.

323
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,420
- I just got a call from your Dad--
- Oh my God!

324
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,750
- No, it was totally my fault.
- I'm so sorry.

325
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,870
- Uh...
- Um...

326
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,040
- Hi, Cecelia.
- Hi.

327
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,870
- We're just... finishing.
- Uh... Yep.

328
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,710
- Thank you. Thank<i>you</i>. Um...
- Yes. Thank you. Yes.

329
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,880
- I'll see you in class. Sorry.
- Yeah.

330
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,790
Anna.

331
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,580
It has been brought to our attention
that you've never been to a pub.

332
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,540
True.

333
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,080
Disgraceful. Put some shoes on
and follow us immediately.

334
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,750
Ooh, no, not those ones.

335
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,710
Pubs are like churches.

336
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,670
Except we consider them sacred
and attend them religiously.

337
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,960
To our new friend Anna,

338
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,040
who's come 3,408 miles
for a 929-year-old education.

339
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,960
Cheers.

340
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,500
- Cheers! Yeah!
- Down the hatch! Whoo!

341
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,500
Oh God, this thing is bloody itchy. Hold.

342
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,580
Yeah, all right. You haven't...

343
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,620
Just can't...
you just can't get the purchase.

344
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,670
This is your first time wearing a jumper?

345
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,210
Do we need to talk about Tom?

346
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,290
- You're so nearly there.
- Do you fancy him?

347
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,420
No, but you do.

348
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,960
Oh, I know.
I think he's the dog's bollocks.

349
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,750
You think he's the dog's balls?

350
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,460
Oh! Oh, no, no, it's a good thing.

351
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,170
Hmm.

352
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,170
Hello, all.

353
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,670
Everyone's super excited to have you
in Oxford. You're such a novelty.

354
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,620
Let me introduce you
to some eligible bachelors.

355
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,830
I'm assuming you're single.

356
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,920
Come, come.

357
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,960
Oxford boys have got brilliant minds.

358
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,920
- You misunderstand me.
- No, I understand you perfectly.

359
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,290
You're saying
that all Americans are stupid.

360
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:42,620
No, no! You're, um... blunt, naive,

361
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,170
which I happen to find endearing.

362
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,380
And about what exactly
are we so painfully naive?

363
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,040
Little things.

364
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,540
Geography, world history,

365
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,580
your gun culture,

366
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:59,210
your impact on other countries,
your willful celebration of ignorance.

367
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,920
Yeah, you're pissed, Ian. Go home.

368
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,670
And your absolute inability
to understand irony and sarcasm.

369
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,210
Oh yeah. No, that's fair.

370
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,630
Perhaps you could teach me about irony.

371
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,830
I'm sure you're a great teacher.

372
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,000
I actually am.

373
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,830
I probably could help you.

374
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,580
Hey, Mags, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

375
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,540
The loo.

376
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,210
- The loo.
- Mugged you off there, mate.

377
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,290
Hey, Miss Mexico.

378
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,790
Miss Diversity Quota.

379
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:40,960
Do you have something to say to me?

380
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,920
We all know
you're here to make up the numbers.

381
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,790
And I will forgive you for taking
the place of someone far more deserving

382
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,750
if you buy me a drink.

383
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,460
Hmm.

384
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,630
How about you share mine?

385
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,420
Oh my...

386
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,710
Hey, Mags, um, I'm gonna go.

387
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,380
- Don't go... Oh!
- This is not my kind of place.

388
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,130
Mate. Don't.

389
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,920
I don't need rescuing, thank you.

390
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,580
No, of course, you're incredibly scary,
but to be clear, I was rescuing him.

391
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,790
Can I walk you home?

392
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,920
I'm pretty sure I can cope
with the mean streets of Oxford.

393
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,290
Oh, you'd be surprised.

394
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,500
It's the gargoyles, actually.
They're especially vicious at night.

395
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,920
They eat Americans.

396
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,710
Well, what if I scare them away
by asking blunt questions?

397
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:43,580
Oh yeah, that would work. Big time.
That's kryptonite for the British.

398
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,330
Even the gargoyles.

399
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,670
I wouldn't wanna drag you away
from your harem of girls back there.

400
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:55,210
Well, if harem girls are anything,
it's patient.

401
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,670
Shall we?

402
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,630
At least my first time in a British pub
will be memorable.

403
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,960
That was your first time in a British pub?

404
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,460
Unacceptable.

405
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,210
So, Anna, why did you choose Oxford?

406
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,380
I have a library fetish.

407
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,750
Okay.

408
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,580
I just love being surrounded by books.

409
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,710
I just think there's no better smell
in the world than the smell of old books.

410
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,290
When I was ten,
I read all the Philip Pullman novels, and

411
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,670
the story of a young girl

412
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:43,080
rushing across this magical
and ancient city stuck with me,

413
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,080
and I decided that somehow, some way,

414
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,540
I would sit among those dusty old books
and first editions.

415
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,670
Sorry, you started planning
to come here when you were ten?

416
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,870
Ten and three quarters, actually.

417
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,790
Oh, fine, then. Great.

418
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,170
My parents always told me
that I could do anything,

419
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:03,580
so it just never even crossed my mind
that I shouldn't try.

420
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,460
They must be really proud of you.

421
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,000
They're even prouder of the fact

422
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,330
that I already have a job
as a financial analyst

423
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,250
at Goldman Sachs when I get back.

424
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,830
Uh, what...

425
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,500
As a layman, what does an analyst do?

426
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,870
It's primarily research.
Digging into companies, their accounts,

427
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,460
and compiling that information
into reports for corporate clients.

428
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,080
That sounds riveting.

429
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,460
Well, not everyone can afford
a vintage car on a teacher's salary.

430
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,920
It's funny,
I've got it in the back of my head.

431
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,250
I was wondering what happened
to that ten-year-old dreamer.

432
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,000
She found a new dream.

433
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,580
To make enough money
not to have to worry about money.

434
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,670
Mo... money can't solve all problems.

435
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,170
Is literally something
only rich people say.

436
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:54,420
There's no safety net for me, you know,
so it's college, Oxford, Goldman, period.

437
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,710
- Got it all planned out.
- I mean, you have to, don't you think?

438
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,830
If you wanna live deliberately.

439
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:08,380
I think that life has a way
of derailing even the best-laid plans.

440
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,870
Really?

441
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,620
And I'm also of the opinion

442
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,330
that the best bits of life
are often the messiest.

443
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,080
So how did you get here without a plan?

444
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,880
No, wait, let me guess.

445
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Prep school,

446
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,960
private tutors,

447
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,710
Eton, Oxford.

448
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,460
- How did you know that I needed a tutor?
- I said "tutors."

449
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:33,750
It's karaoke all night,
so let's get singing!

450
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,210
<i>Oh, baby, baby</i>

451
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:39,130
<i>How was I supposed to know...</i>

452
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,880
- You think you can do better<i>?
- That somethin' wasn't right here?</i>

453
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,420
I'm almost certain
I could do better than that, yeah.

454
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,750
You sing, Professor Davenport?

455
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,460
Well, I was in a band.

456
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,750
<i>- Now you're out of sight...</i>
- Bacteria Overflow.

457
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,670
<i>Show me...</i>

458
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:57,580
We gigged twice, so it's, uh...
it's a pretty big deal.

459
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,000
Over here, anyway, you know.

460
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Does that mean that if I buy you a drink
that makes me a groupie?

461
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,830
<i>- To know now, oh, because...</i>
- Yes, I think it does.

462
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:08,170
- Two drinks coming up.
<i>- My loneliness is killin' me</i>

463
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,790
<i>And I</i>

464
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,500
<i>I must confess, I still believe</i>

465
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,420
<i>Still believe</i>

466
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,290
<i>Hit me, baby, one more time</i>

467
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,210
All right, that was pretty terrible.

468
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,460
Hey. Thank you.

469
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,540
Next up, singing Coldplay's "Yellow,"

470
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,130
Jamie Davenport!

471
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,750
- What?
- Where are you, Jamie?

472
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,750
Sorry. Sorry, Anna. What have you done?

473
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,620
I just booked your third gig.

474
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,290
- Jamie there?
- Anna, the other two were when I was 12.

475
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,080
- Are you Jamie?
- You've had plenty of time to practice.

476
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,330
Anna, I was a bass player.

477
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,420
Well, then, good luck.

478
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,620
Where are you, Jamie?

479
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,370
Jamie! Jamie!

480
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,210
- No, Anna. Anna, seriously. Seriously...
- Jamie! Jamie!

481
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,040
- Please, please. Look...
- Jamie! Jamie!

482
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:56,130
Jamie! Jamie! Jamie!

483
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,580
Don't be shy!

484
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,210
<i>Look at the stars</i>

485
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,670
<i>See how they shine for you</i>

486
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,000
<i>And everything that you do</i>

487
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,170
<i>Yeah, they were all yellow</i>

488
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,210
<i>Uh, came along</i>

489
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,420
<i>I wrote a song for you</i>

490
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,920
<i>And ev... all the things you do...</i>

491
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,710
<i>Yeah, and it was called "Yellow"</i>

492
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,330
<i>So then...</i>

493
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,290
- No.
- Have you heard this song before?

494
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:48,330
<i>So then I took my turn</i>

495
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:53,000
<i>Oh, what a thing to have done</i>

496
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,580
<i>And it was all yellow</i>

497
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,960
<i>Your skin</i>

498
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,000
<i>Oh, yeah, your skin and bones</i>

499
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,120
<i>Turn into</i>

500
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,580
<i>Somethin' beautiful</i>

501
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,290
<i>Yeah, you know</i>

502
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,250
<i>You know I love you so</i>

503
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,380
<i>You know I love you... you so...</i>

504
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,750
Oh!

505
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,080
Oh, wow.

506
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,920
Oy, oy.

507
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,870
See, I'm of the opinion that
you should never regret things you do.

508
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,330
You should only regret
the things that you don't do.

509
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,750
Right, but you must regret that karaoke.

510
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:49,040
Sorry, the only thing that I regret is
not following up with a Céline Dion. Now.

511
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:53,960
It is tradition here that after karaoke,
you have to eat.

512
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:59,460
I'm about to introduce you
to a true Oxford institution.

513
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,960
Is that an elephant's leg?

514
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,670
Here you go.

515
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,580
Thank you.

516
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,580
Yes, boss?

517
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,710
Okay, who's next?

518
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,670
Trust me.

519
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,960
Some rice?

520
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,210
Mmm.

521
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,710
That's good.

522
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,580
That's really good.

523
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,540
My friend.

524
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,790
Cheers, Dimitri. Aah!

525
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,920
- It's really good.
- I know.

526
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,920
Okay, your turn.

527
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,580
Right. Um, the master at work.

528
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,870
- Here we go.
- Ready?

529
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,830
Uh-huh.

530
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,540
Mmm.

531
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,330
Mmm.

532
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,540
Oh no.

533
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,620
- Oh my God, I need a napkin.
- No, you don't!

534
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,290
- Yes, I do.
- Resist.

535
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,330
This is the messy bit.

536
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,420
Come on.

537
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,040
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm...

538
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,290
It's so good.

539
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,420
- It's<i>so</i> good, right?
- Mmm!

540
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:28,710
Well, I definitely did not have
bad karaoke and kebabs

541
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,540
on my Oxford wish list,

542
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,380
but, um...

543
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,380
I had a really great time.

544
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,460
So would you

545
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:12,380
care to come up for some tea and crumpet?

546
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,580
Better not.

547
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,420
Good night, Anna.

548
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,580
I mean, you've humiliated yourself,
but now you need to move on.

549
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,170
And we've all been there.

550
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:48,000
- Have you?
- God, no. It's an expression.

551
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,330
Well, Jamie Davenport
may have turned you down,

552
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,540
but you certainly
won't be short of attention in that.

553
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,620
It was either this or Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

554
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,830
- Sexy '60s Ruth Bader?
- No.

555
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,670
Oh. Well, you know, this is... is perfect.

556
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:06,330
It's American. It's powerful.

557
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,670
It's going to knock their socks off.

558
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:11,540
Thank you. And you look great as Dracula.

559
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,210
Dracula? Anthony Bridgerton. Honestly.

560
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,250
<i>- Tell me, tell me...</i>
- Whoo!

561
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,330
<i>Oh, come on, tell me</i>

562
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,710
<i>Now, oh, come on, tell me...</i>

563
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,960
Hiya. Hi.

564
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,920
- So it's not a costume party?
<i>- If you wanna say somethin</i>'<i>...</i>

565
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,750
Hello, Wonder Woman.
I could do with saving from that bloke.

566
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,290
Ah, not your type?

567
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:37,250
Seriously, I didn't come out
to talk about molecular biology.

568
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,250
Can I get you a drink?
If it's okay with Lord Bridgerton.

569
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,790
Oh, you absolutely have my permission.

570
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,250
Just, I don't understand
how this is Halloween.

571
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,750
I mean, does anyone make any effort
in this country at all?

572
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,040
Well, I mean, excuse me.

573
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,670
Oh, not you. You look wonderfully weird.

574
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:01,210
And you, you look like
the slutty savior of the human race.

575
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,830
You said it, Anthony.

576
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:06,040
Well, I wouldn't mind if you gave me
a ride in your invisible plane.

577
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,500
- What?
- Uh, an invisible plane.

578
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,170
Uh, Wonder Woman,
she... she has an invisible plane.

579
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:15,210
You... you can't see it.
It's an invisible plane.

580
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,750
Right.

581
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,380
Yeah. Yeah.

582
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,080
Hey, do you wanna dance?

583
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,920
Wheels up.

584
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,920
<i>When we get high on my break time</i>

585
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,880
<i>And we're just--</i>

586
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,830
Big mistake is leaning too far back
on the pull,

587
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,420
'cause it ruins the coordination,

588
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,420
and it happens all the time
to guys that are top-heavy.

589
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,790
Wow.

590
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,460
- Is the, uh... race coming up soon?
- No!

591
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,210
I wouldn't be out if it was.

592
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,960
You can lose a race
by the smallest of margins.

593
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,670
Hmm.

594
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,040
- You okay?
- Mmm.

595
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,460
Come here.

596
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,130
I'm hungry.

597
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,250
What's so funny?

598
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,130
Oh my God. Are you serious?

599
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,420
No, I... I couldn't eat that.

600
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,040
It would be like putting diesel
in a Rolls-Royce

601
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,080
instead of premium unleaded.

602
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,370
Ah.

603
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,500
- You're right.
- Yeah?

604
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,830
I don't know what I was thinking.

605
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,250
Good night.

606
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,080
- Night, Dimitri.
- Good night.

607
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:17,170
Also, Wilde was a massive fan of Keats.

608
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,870
He hated that his... his love letters
were being sold for profit.

609
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,790
<i>"That small and sickly eyes
May glare and gloat"</i>

610
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,670
That's us for today. Thank you, guys.

611
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,580
Right, I need to return my costume.

612
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,830
Jack the Ripper?

613
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,040
No. Anna, are you coming?

614
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,580
Anna, do you have a minute?

615
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,330
If you have time, there's
something that I'd like to show you.

616
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,380
I think it's quite special.

617
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,170
You didn't think I'd been to the Bodleian?

618
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,000
It was, like, the second thing on my list.

619
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,130
- After?
- Fish and chips.

620
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:09,880
But have you been
to the library within the library?

621
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,790
Welcome to Duke Humfrey's Library.

622
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,750
No, they're alarmed.

623
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:37,040
Hello, Laura.

624
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,960
I put it out for you, Jamie.

625
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,920
Thank you.

626
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,630
Thanks.

627
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,040
Behold the inner sanctum.

628
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,960
- It's Millay.
- Mm-hmm.

629
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:15,630
First edition.

630
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,330
Oh!

631
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,000
- It smells so good.
- Mm-hmm.

632
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,040
Wow.

633
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,830
So I saw you at the club last night.

634
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,710
Oh yeah?

635
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,620
I was gonna say hello,
but I think you left.

636
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:40,170
Couldn't find you
or the meathead rower you were with.

637
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,420
Hmm.

638
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,420
Well, we left together.

639
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,630
You must have missed that,
being so busy with Cecelia.

640
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,790
- How many copies were printed?
- Go straight home?

641
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,750
No.

642
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,460
Gotcha.

643
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,750
The crumpet, then?

644
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,580
No.

645
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,500
- We went to Dimitri's.
- What...

646
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,540
Sh!

647
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:08,250
...most people don't know
is that 126 copies were printed.

648
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,880
Dimitri's is our place.

649
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,380
Ours?

650
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,710
As in me and you?

651
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,170
When was this printed,

652
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,710
Professor?

653
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,670
It's, um...

654
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,580
it's, um...

655
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,330
Nine...

656
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,080
Nineteen, um...

657
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,710
1917.

658
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,380
Yeah.

659
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,830
1917.

660
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,080
- Thank you, Laura. I just have to run.
- It's a great book.

661
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,960
Where are we going?

662
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,250
Just... somewhere.

663
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,830
Yours?

664
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,330
No.

665
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,000
It's too far.

666
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,830
How long will it take you
to put the top up?

667
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,580
- So, thanks for the ride...
- Mmm.

668
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,540
...home.

669
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,380
...for a year, in college...

670
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:57,000
Not to be blunt,
but this is just fun, right?

671
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,960
Oh yeah.

672
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,420
- Fun.
- Fun.

673
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,540
- Fun.
- Fun.

674
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,960
- So fun.
- So fun.

675
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,040
Well, fun's all I've got to give,
so enjoy it while it lasts.

676
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,290
Mind if I sit?

677
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:23,960
Sure.

678
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,960
It's funny. We're famous for it,

679
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,250
but I'm sure it's only tourists and
my grandmother that take afternoon tea.

680
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,870
Word is, you and Jamie are quite the item.

681
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,750
Well, I wouldn't say we're an item.
We're just... having fun.

682
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,630
Yes, that's what he's good at.

683
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,790
But the question is, are you?

684
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:47,870
Look, I know we like to think of ourselves
as modern women,

685
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,630
but when it comes down to it,
it's hard not to get emotionally involved.

686
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,620
Trust me, Anna.

687
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,130
It's not worth the pain.

688
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,210
Enjoy your tea.

689
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:09,710
- We agreed we're just having fun.
- Mm-hmm.

690
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:12,790
Oh, fun, that's great. How fun!

691
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,460
You have got to stop saying "fun."

692
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,750
But it is so fun.

693
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,250
And I suppose, because you're leaving,
you have a built-in end.

694
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,750
Exactly. It'll probably only last,
like, a month or two.

695
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,670
Hmm.

696
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:25,290
Okay, guess which one
looks just like my ex.

697
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,880
<i>Oh, I do</i>

698
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,710
<i>Everything I dreamed about
Is comin' on</i>

699
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:40,460
<i>Trade it for a moment in the sun</i>

700
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,870
<i>All that other noise
Is just a waste of time</i>

701
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,120
<i>You're the only music on my mind</i>

702
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:53,080
<i>I don't need money
I don't need to be cool</i>

703
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:58,250
<i>I'll trade it for
A moment in the sun with you</i>

704
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,170
- Anna.
- Oh, no. You go first.

705
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,870
Anna, it would be my privilege.

706
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,080
<i>Winter, spring</i>

707
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,040
<i>Summer, fall</i>

708
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,750
<i>A moment's fine
But I wanna feel them all</i>

709
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,500
<i>- Oh
- Ooh, ooh</i>

710
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,500
<i>- I wanna feel them all
- Ooh, ooh</i>...

711
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,870
<i>Ding dong! Merrily on high</i>

712
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,210
<i>Everything I dreamed about
Is comin' on</i>

713
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:28,370
<i>Trade it for a moment in the sun</i>

714
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:32,250
<i>All that other noise
Is just a waste of time</i>...

715
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:36,710
<i>You're the only music on my mind</i>

716
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:40,250
<i>I don't need money
I don't need to be cool</i>...

717
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:43,540
Oh, look, they're going to a ball.
I wanna go to a ball.

718
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,500
<i>- ...in the sun
- Ooh, ooh</i>...

719
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,670
<i>With you...</i>

720
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,210
No, I'm not...

721
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:55,370
750 years to celebrate,
and you don't wanna go?

722
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,790
- Uh-huh.
- You're a bore.

723
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,960
No, Anna, believe me,
it is the balls that are a bore.

724
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,960
I will take you
literally anywhere else. Anywhere.

725
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,830
- Anywhere?
- Uh-huh.

726
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:05,040
How about your place?

727
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,210
There are these killer vines
at the moment.

728
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:08,750
- Sure.
- They're sort of like...

729
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,250
Oh, wow.

730
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,040
<i>...a moment in the sun</i>

731
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,370
<i>All that other noise
Is just a waste of time</i>

732
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:22,210
<i>You're the only music on my mind</i>

733
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:26,170
<i>I don't need money
I don't need to be cool</i>

734
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:31,330
<i>I'll trade it for
A moment in the sun with you</i>...

735
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:39,420
<i>Anna! Are you doing your reading
for Goldman Sachs?</i>

736
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,500
Mm-hmm.

737
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,580
<i>Don't get distracted, huh?</i>

738
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,620
<i>Your future is too important.</i>

739
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:47,460
<i>- Ooh, ooh
- I wanna feel them all</i>...

740
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,250
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

741
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:53,210
<i>I don't need money
I don't need to be cool</i>

742
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:58,380
<i>I'll trade it for
A moment in the sun with you</i>...

743
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,630
There's other people as well from...

744
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,960
Ooh!

745
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:08,960
I just... I still can't stop
gaping at everything like a tourist.

746
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:13,750
It's just incredible
that Shelley and Tolkien and Wilde

747
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,750
all wandered through these gardens.

748
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:19,880
It's just we don't have this back home.
This... history.

749
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,580
- Yeah, but you've got other things.
- Uh-huh.

750
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:25,130
Baseball.

751
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:27,830
Really big cars.

752
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:31,330
No, if you like this,

753
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,540
then you absolutely have to go
on a grand tour around Europe

754
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,830
before you leave.

755
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:36,750
A grand tour?

756
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,120
Yeah, like Byron.
You've gotta start in Paris.

757
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,830
- Mmm.
- Get drunk by the Seine, of course.

758
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:41,790
Of course.

759
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:46,380
And then I'd go to Venice
and spend the whole night on a gondola.

760
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,710
And then I'd go to Greece
and I'd visit the Temple of Poseidon.

761
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:52,130
It's high on a promontory
above the Aegean Sea.

762
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,540
And then I'd sit down on a

763
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:00,920
glorious beach to, as Tennyson said,

764
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:04,130
watch "sunset and evening star."

765
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:07,290
Sounds like someone else has a plan.

766
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,460
Yeah, I think I might.

767
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,250
And you must...

768
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:16,250
you must go
to the red-light district in Amsterdam.

769
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,120
I'm not that kind of girl.

770
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,420
No, there's a

771
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,540
church there.

772
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:22,960
Our Lord in the Attic.

773
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:27,500
This hidden door
leads you to this sanctuary.

774
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:31,790
It's...

775
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:32,960
It's so beautiful.

776
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:34,920
Take your breath away.

777
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,460
We could go together.

778
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:44,920
- Together?
- Hmm.

779
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,750
I don't know, Professor.
That sounds rather serious.

780
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,830
I'm only looking for fun.

781
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,080
I go back to New York soon.

782
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:00,880
Yes, you do.

783
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,750
Well, maybe instead of a grand tour,
we could do a small tour.

784
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:09,920
Round my place.

785
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,290
Your place?

786
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,540
- You have a place?
- I do.

787
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:17,500
Wow.

788
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:21,000
God, it's been so long,
I assumed you lived in that car.

789
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,420
Don't judge me.
I'm still gettin' settled in.

790
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,080
I only moved out of college a year ago.

791
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,080
My, uh... aunt left me the house.

792
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:38,370
I say left. She's not dead.

793
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:42,000
She, um... just couldn't be bothered
with the renovation

794
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,580
and, of course, moved to Croatia.

795
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,420
Did you build these toy cars?

796
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,830
They're model cars. Um...

797
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:53,630
But yes, when I was a kid, with my dad.
And my brother, Eddie.

798
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,000
It's a lot harder than it looks.

799
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:59,330
We'd spend days on each one,
the three of us.

800
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,500
Hours into the night.

801
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,630
And then, when I got older,
we started working on real cars.

802
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,790
Like the Jaguar?

803
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:09,750
Yeah, that...

804
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:18,830
That was the last thing that we did
before Eddie died.

805
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,370
- Oh my God, I'm so sorry--
- It's funny.

806
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:24,580
Every person in your family
plays a certain role, right?

807
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,330
And after he was gone,
I realized that I didn't just lose

808
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:28,960
my brother.

809
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,380
I lost my whole way
of communicating with my father.

810
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,080
- Have you spoken to him about it?
- No.

811
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:41,120
No. We're Englishmen, Anna.
We don't talk about our feelings.

812
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:42,040
Right.

813
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,830
In fact, that might be the first time

814
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:46,420
I've told anyone
I'm not speaking to my dad.

815
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:50,130
- How did your brother die?
- Let's continue with the tour!

816
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:54,460
You haven't seen the bedroom yet.
Best view ever.

817
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:00,460
And, oh, please be careful.
I've just had the carpets done.

818
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:16,000
Good morning.

819
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,330
Going somewhere?

820
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,000
Yes, I forgot I had this thing.

821
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:28,170
Styan bestowed
another responsibility upon me.

822
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:29,130
Oh.

823
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:32,080
Well, in a way,
I, too, am a responsibility

824
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,080
that Styan bestowed upon you.

825
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:38,290
Sorry.

826
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,500
Uh, Maggie texted about the Boat Race
next weekend.

827
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,080
You gonna come down with us?

828
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,290
I'm so sorry, what was that?

829
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,790
The, uh... the Boat Race next weekend.

830
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,960
Are you coming?

831
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:58,420
Uh, no, I don't think I can.

832
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:01,040
I'm gonna be really busy
over the next few weeks.

833
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,000
I have to really focus
on my doctoral thesis.

834
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:07,000
Right. Of course.

835
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,420
I'm gonna go get dressed.

836
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,080
Yes, great. Thank you.

837
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,880
- Oxford!
- Whoo-hoo!

838
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,460
<i>So kind</i>

839
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:34,120
<i>So long, dance on</i>

840
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:37,380
<i>She's gone, dance on...</i>

841
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,580
Whoo! Whoo!

842
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:55,460
<i>Dance on...</i>

843
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,830
Row faster!

844
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:00,170
Sink 'em, Oxford! Sink 'em, Oxford!

845
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,750
Is he coming?

846
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:16,210
No, he can't. He's studying.
I haven't seen him all week.

847
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:17,830
I'm sure he'd be here if he could.

848
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:20,710
His thesis is important. I get it.

849
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:24,210
- Laura! Hey.
- Hey! Nice turnout.

850
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:26,250
Yeah, it seems like everyone is here.

851
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,870
Except Jamie.

852
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,960
Although you must be sick of seeing him
all the time in the library every day.

853
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,790
Oh, no. I haven't seen Jamie in weeks.

854
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:41,960
I'm gonna try and get a pint
in that scrum. You guys want anything?

855
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,460
- No, I'm good. Thanks.
- Okay.

856
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,580
It was probably
an innocent misunderstanding.

857
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,920
Jamie is not the type to sleep around.

858
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,460
Okay, you knew that he was a player.

859
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:59,210
You declared you wanted casual.
This is basically what you asked for.

860
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:01,120
Cecelia warned me to stay away.

861
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:05,250
Warned you like, "Hope you're doing okay,"
or, "Back off or else"?

862
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,670
Oh, balls. It was "back off or else."

863
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:10,750
Is she here?

864
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:12,540
Looking for me?

865
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:15,540
Hello, Ridley. Uh, did Cecelia
not come with you guys today?

866
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:18,170
No, this past week, she decided
to hunker down and do some work.

867
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:20,870
But missing the Boat Race?
Should be sent down.

868
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,040
The ladies won
by the exact yardage I bet on. 152.

869
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,620
I've just won 500 quid.

870
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:28,750
- Oh my God!
- The beers are on me.

871
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:31,500
- Come on.
- To the bar!

872
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,960
Right. What's everyone having?

873
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:37,000
Listen, if he wants to see other people,
I'm fine with that.

874
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,250
- Sure you are.
- But I won't be lied to.

875
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,290
- No.
- No.

876
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:43,630
No. Bollocks.
Go knock his bloody door down.

877
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:46,290
- I know the code.
- Even better. Let yourself in.

878
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,250
Yeah!

879
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:50,540
Bollocks to this.

880
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:52,330
- Bo... bollocks? Bollocks.
- Yeah.

881
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:53,750
Bollocks to this!

882
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:27,170
Jamie?

883
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:30,500
I'm gonna get a coffee.

884
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:32,330
Do you want one?

885
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:35,080
You must be exhausted.

886
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:41,170
Oh my God.

887
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:42,790
No. Anna, wait. Anna--

888
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:51,380
- What is this?
- Get out.

889
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,250
- Jamie, are--
- Get... out!

890
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:53,250
Eddie had cancer.

891
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,080
And they tried everything.

892
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,370
Every... treatment.

893
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,750
Every clinical trial.

894
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,880
And in the end, he just wanted it to stop.

895
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:08,710
'Cause the time it had earned him
was just spent in hospital in pain.

896
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:12,420
You don't live longer.
You just die slower.

897
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,580
Um... My father,

898
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:17,920
so bent on never losing himself,

899
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,080
he couldn't understand why someone else
wouldn't fight until the end.

900
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,330
But there are some things that you just...

901
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:27,210
You can't fight.
Like your own body when it turns on you.

902
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:33,170
It's just I...

903
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,750
I don't understand
how you've been dealing with all of this.

904
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,630
Well, I've had Cecelia,

905
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:42,330
who was Eddie's girlfriend.

906
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:46,250
And she was with him
through all of it. Um...

907
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,250
We're basically family now.

908
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,130
And how's your mom coping?

909
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:55,460
Yeah, not great, but, um... she's a champ.

910
00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:00,540
Uh... never makes it about herself,
unlike my father.

911
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,670
Even when Eddie was... was dying, he, um...

912
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:08,210
All he could do was push him.
We fought over it then, and, um...

913
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:09,790
things were said.

914
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,080
Um...

915
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:13,960
Anyway, uh...

916
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:16,330
now I'm in the same situation.

917
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:17,920
It's genetic.

918
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,500
What you saw was my final treatment.

919
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,580
So maybe it buys me time,
maybe it doesn't.

920
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:27,830
But either way,
I won't submit myself to any more.

921
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:34,250
And... my father
simply can't respect that choice.

922
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:54,080
Mmm!

923
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,630
I think this would be my death-row meal.

924
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,960
What about you?

925
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,040
How is any of this funny?

926
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:13,500
It's funny because

927
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:18,120
the two people in this city
who most needed a casual relationship

928
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:19,290
ended up here.

929
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:27,380
Don't waste the short time
you have left in Oxford on me.

930
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,460
I saw what happened to Cecelia with Eddie.

931
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:35,880
I'm not putting you through that.

932
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:40,960
We said we'd have fun, and we have.

933
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,460
Loads of it.

934
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:48,080
But my illness isn't fun, so it ends now.

935
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:51,920
With a kebab.

936
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:07,040
Just because something is fleeting
doesn't mean it's not meaningful.

937
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:14,000
I can't pretend to understand
what you're going through,

938
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,380
but I know
that you don't have to do it alone.

939
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:21,330
This is the messiness of life,

940
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,040
and as an annoyingly brilliant man
once told me...

941
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,630
these are the best bits.

942
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,710
- Whoa!
- Oi-oi!

943
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,460
Nothing's changed.

944
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:10,920
Keep having fun.

945
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,080
Yeah.

946
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,080
- We'll keep having fun.
- Mmm.

947
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:19,580
Aah!

948
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:21,580
No, no, no, no, no, no!

949
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,580
- Oh, Professor Styan.
- Mm-hmm?

950
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:36,120
Sorry, you're on the committee

951
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:40,120
for the septicentennial and fifty ball,
aren't you?

952
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:41,290
I am.

953
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:43,830
I'm also aware
of your contempt for all things...

954
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:45,000
What was it?

955
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,920
Gaudy, naff, and classless
dressed as high taste?

956
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,670
Yes. Uh, that does
sound like me, doesn't it?

957
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,540
Um, but...

958
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,210
I just had a few questions about
the kind of grip that you do on the--

959
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:06,500
Wh...

960
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,580
Excuse me!

961
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,830
Oh my God! Oh my God!

962
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:12,380
Wait, we're all going?

963
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:28,960
- Hey.
- Mm-hmm?

964
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,420
I'm right by your side.

965
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:32,080
Okay.

966
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:39,790
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, darling.

967
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:42,370
- You look exquisite.
- Thank you.

968
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:45,250
I'm gonna get drunk
and go on a fucking Ferris wheel.

969
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:50,330
I would like you to meet my friend, Anna.

970
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:54,000
Yes, I heard rumors that my son
was dating a very pretty American girl.

971
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,290
Yes, I heard them, too, sir,
but I didn't let that stop me.

972
01:01:57,290 --> 01:02:00,290
Excuse me. Might we have
a quick word, Lady Davenport?

973
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,460
Oh, yes, of course.

974
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:03,920
Sorry, such a bore.

975
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,130
Jamie, if we could, um... perhaps just...

976
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:14,710
<i>There's something about it...</i>

977
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,790
So which are we destined to be, friends

978
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:30,580
or lovers?

979
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,500
Neither.

980
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:34,670
- Tom!
- There was a third option.

981
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:38,670
- Hey. Anna, you look absolutely...
<i>- Can't tell you what makes it perfect</i>

982
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:43,250
<i>You're the cure for the hurt...</i>

983
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:44,790
Stunning, isn't she?

984
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:48,380
It's a shame it takes a dress and heels
for a guy to notice.

985
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,920
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

986
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,370
What? Oh, you thought
I was looking at Maggie like that!

987
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:56,380
Can you imagine?
No, no, Maggie and I, we're just

988
01:02:57,790 --> 01:02:58,620
friends.

989
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:01,580
Best way to be, mate.
Don't get involved, don't get hurt.

990
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:07,710
<i>Bring it back, sing it back</i>

991
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:11,290
<i>Bring it back, sing it back to me</i>

992
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:15,420
<i>Bring it back, sing it back</i>

993
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,960
<i>Bring it back, sing it back to me</i>

994
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,460
<i>When you are ready, I will surrender</i>

995
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:26,080
<i>Take me and do as you wish</i>

996
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:30,670
<i>Have what you want
Your way's always the best way</i>...

997
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:32,210
Hello, Anna.

998
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:37,460
- Can I tempt you with a drink?
<i>- I succumbed to this passive sensation</i>

999
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,330
<i>Peacefully falling away...</i>

1000
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:41,920
Sure. I'd like that.

1001
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,750
<i>I am a zombie
Your wish will command me</i>

1002
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:49,040
So my mom
came from Argentina with nothing,

1003
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:51,540
and my dad's a Cuban émigré.

1004
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:54,500
Now their daughter's
taking a master's at Oxford

1005
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,040
and is soon to start at Goldman.

1006
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,620
You've done your research.

1007
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:01,670
Yeah, well, Jamie might not talk to me,

1008
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:03,710
but thankfully,
he still talks to his mother.

1009
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,000
I have to be
totally transparent with you, Anna.

1010
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,420
I want the best possible
medical treatment for Jamie,

1011
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:13,040
but... but he has to fight.

1012
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:17,250
Currently not speaking to me, so...
...I can't give him the details.

1013
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:20,620
Jamie saw what happened with Eddie,

1014
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:23,750
so I... think
he knows about the treatment, sir.

1015
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,710
Mmm... not all of them. I mean, how can he?

1016
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:28,710
What he and Eddie have is incredibly rare.

1017
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:32,040
I've been talking to people,

1018
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:36,170
making donations, sponsoring research.

1019
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:41,000
I can't imagine how hard this is for you.

1020
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,290
Jamie thinks he knows best, but

1021
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:45,500
he doesn't.

1022
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,040
He looks healthy, but, um... he's not.

1023
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:53,420
He needs to return to our home
for more treatment, and, uh...

1024
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,920
I expect you to help us convince him.

1025
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:02,330
I'm so glad
we've reached this understanding.

1026
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:13,540
Jamie said that words were exchanged
when Edward died.

1027
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:17,500
What did you say to him?

1028
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,630
You dare to judge me?

1029
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:28,380
Have you watched someone you love
more than your own life die?

1030
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,830
You have no idea
what it's like to lose a child,

1031
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:36,920
knowing you may soon lose another.

1032
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:49,040
<i>Everybody dance</i>

1033
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,920
<i>Do-do-do-do, clap your hands</i>

1034
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,580
<i>Clap your hands</i>

1035
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:56,290
<i>Everybody dance</i>...

1036
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:58,040
What have you done now?

1037
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,500
You've not signed me up
to sing with the band, have you?

1038
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:03,170
- I was just talking to your dad.
- Mm-hmm?

1039
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,580
Jamie, you need to work this out.

1040
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:10,830
Anna. I know that you have your life
perfectly planned out.

1041
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:15,540
Don't need to try and fix mine.
Some things are just broken.

1042
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:17,830
Okay, as your friend, I think he--

1043
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:20,330
Do you want a drink? I do.

1044
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,170
Excuse me.

1045
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:31,080
No. I mean, I used to love football,
and I was good at it too.

1046
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,710
If it hadn't been
for the homophobic locker room chat.

1047
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:36,580
I mean, honestly, they'd call me
Bender Like Beckham,

1048
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:38,290
Cristiano Ronald-ooh,

1049
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:41,620
and Sabrina the Queen Age Bitch,
which had nothing to do with football.

1050
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:44,170
You should play
with the college gay football society.

1051
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:45,330
The guys are great.

1052
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:46,830
I would... I would love that.

1053
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:50,880
And after a match,
maybe we could get dinner, watch a movie?

1054
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:53,380
Wh... Uh, me?

1055
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:55,580
No.

1056
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:56,790
No, I just, uh...

1057
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:59,330
Uh... I will be straight back.
I'm just gonna...

1058
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,670
Oh my God.
I mean, I've never been so insulted.

1059
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:09,040
A ten-minute chat
and he's ready to take me up the aisle.

1060
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:12,170
Do I look like the kind of guy
that's ready to commit?

1061
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:14,250
I don't know who on earth you are.

1062
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:17,580
Yeah, I'm not so sure myself.

1063
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:21,080
<i>Don't know who you think
That you're confusin'</i>

1064
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:24,960
<i>I be like, "Ooh, it's amusin'"</i>

1065
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,080
<i>You think I'm gonna fall for an illu...</i>

1066
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,420
Cecelia. Hi.

1067
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:35,960
Jamie told me...

1068
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:38,580
Whew.

1069
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,420
It was like watching a car crash
in slow motion.

1070
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,500
He was so brave, but it... it...

1071
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:51,960
completely ruined me.

1072
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:56,960
And there's no getting over it.

1073
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,790
I go out,
I flirt with the occasional guy, but

1074
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:03,330
that's it.

1075
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:06,710
<i>Tryna make me yours for life
Takin' me for a ride</i>...

1076
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:08,870
I shall be a spinster forever, I suppose.

1077
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,540
<i>Think you play your cards right</i>

1078
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:14,120
<i>Don't you know
I could do this dance all night?</i>

1079
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:15,540
<i>- Ooh
- Ooh</i>

1080
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,250
<i>What you doin'?</i>

1081
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:21,620
<i>Don't know who you think
That you're confusin'</i>

1082
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:25,580
<i>I be like, "Ooh, it's amusin'"</i>

1083
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:28,420
<i>You think
I'm gonna fall for an illusion</i>...

1084
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:31,170
- What is it, Tom?
- I was wondering if I could have a quick...

1085
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:32,250
Just gonna...

1086
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:33,670
Yeah, just gonna grab...

1087
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:35,080
<i>- Dance all night...</i>
- Uh...

1088
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,920
<i>Dance all night</i>...

1089
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:38,130
Are we having a dance?

1090
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:42,120
- You... you know I can't dance, so...
- What is it? I had a good thing going.

1091
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:44,120
Yes, I mean, but that's just it, isn't it?

1092
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:48,670
Um... because, I mean,
you're off dancing with tattooed... Tony,

1093
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:51,380
when perhaps you and I could be, you know...

1094
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:54,880
I can teach you to unicycle.

1095
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,500
- Tom, are you chatting me up?
- Yes, yes, I am.

1096
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:06,920
Somethin' to say?

1097
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:08,920
I'm really sorry.

1098
01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:11,830
- I didn't mean to be a--
- Bellend?

1099
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:13,580
It's okay.

1100
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:17,170
You Englishmen find it hard
to talk about your emotions.

1101
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:18,420
Do you want to dance?

1102
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,130
<i>La, la, la-la-la</i>

1103
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:22,290
<i>- La, la, la</i>...
- Like that?

1104
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:24,250
<i>La, la, la-la-la</i>

1105
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:26,040
<i>La, la, la</i>

1106
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,790
<i>- La, la, la-la-la...</i>
- No.

1107
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:31,000
- Much worse than that.
<i>- I just can't get you out of my head</i>

1108
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,710
<i>Boy, your lovin' is all I think about</i>

1109
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:38,040
<i>I just can't get you out of my head</i>

1110
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:41,330
<i>I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch</i>

1111
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:43,210
<i>Oh, I feel the rush</i>

1112
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:45,580
<i>It's so good, it's so good</i>

1113
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:48,830
<i>I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch</i>

1114
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:50,710
<i>Oh, I feel the rush</i>

1115
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:52,710
<i>It's so good, it's so good</i>

1116
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:58,120
<i>So good when we slow gravity, so good</i>

1117
01:09:58,130 --> 01:10:00,710
<i>It's so good, it's so good</i>

1118
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:02,920
- I love your mom.
- Uh-huh.

1119
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:07,540
She gave me her number, and she told me
to call her for a chin-wag,

1120
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:12,250
which Maggie said isn't jaw surgery,
but a friendly conversation.

1121
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,830
Can you unzip me, please?

1122
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:18,040
Yes, absolutely. I'm just feel... ing...

1123
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:22,630
Jamie!

1124
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:24,750
Jamie! Jam...

1125
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:31,080
Do you like those flowers?

1126
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:35,380
They're fake.

1127
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:37,290
It's a secret.

1128
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,170
On the plus side,

1129
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:42,420
at least I didn't turn into a pumpkin
until after the ball, huh?

1130
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:46,040
Can you exist without your irony?

1131
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:47,630
No.

1132
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,330
Anna, I'm fine. It was overexertion.

1133
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:56,370
I'm probably a little bit better
than you are.

1134
01:10:56,380 --> 01:11:00,000
We can maybe get one of these nurses
to slip you something for your hangover.

1135
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,880
- Here we go. This should help.
- Thanks.

1136
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,210
Jamie, you'll need something
a bit stronger.

1137
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:06,750
Whiskey?

1138
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:10,620
I've recently been drinking rather a lot
of Buckfast. Have you heard of that?

1139
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:11,710
Oh, really? Have you?
Yes.

1140
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:14,500
Just wondering, maybe a bit of that
with some mezcal thrown in.

1141
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,630
I think... I think I might have a latte.

1142
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:37,370
<i>Professor Styan's asked me
to step in once again, apologies,</i>

1143
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:40,670
<i>to discuss Tennyson's "Crossing the Bar,"</i>

1144
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:45,460
arguably one of the greatest poems
about life and death ever written.

1145
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:49,290
<i>And he's comparing death
to setting out to sea.</i>

1146
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:54,960
All he wants in his final moments
is to hear the gentle tolling of a bell

1147
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,500
and then to be swallowed up by darkness.

1148
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,580
And rather than being afraid of death,
he is embracing it.

1149
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:02,250
<i>And I say, why the hell not?</i>

1150
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:04,880
<i>Because it's the end of everything.</i>

1151
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:08,170
<i>It's the end of... of all the things
that you should have done.</i>

1152
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,460
Yes... uh, but,

1153
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:16,620
maybe, Maggie, it is not the length
of time that you spend on Earth.

1154
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:18,290
Maybe it's what you do with it.

1155
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:25,170
Well, I hope to be in a bar when I die.

1156
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:29,580
Not in a sad way.
In, like, a... In, like, a fun way.

1157
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:32,580
No, but I, like... So if I'm, like, laughing
and I fall off my chair.

1158
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:34,620
But not because I've had too much to...

1159
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:36,920
I may have had, like, one drink,
maybe two, like?

1160
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:40,250
But a fun drink, like, with a straw.
Piña colada, something like that.

1161
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:42,330
And my boyfriend, he's there.
He loves that.

1162
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:44,170
He kisses me on the cheek,
like, um, tenderly,

1163
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:46,540
but enough to say
we're still interested in each other.

1164
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:49,250
At that point,
I'm doing a lot of philanthropy,

1165
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:51,120
and I think people can tell.

1166
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:53,000
There's a twinkle in my eyes
that says I care.

1167
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,580
So when I die,
there's a big loss to the charity sector.

1168
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:57,920
People are obviously upset.

1169
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,580
You know, a great beauty lost from Oxford.

1170
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:03,870
But then, obvi-- But I do still die,
but it's, like, the right time.

1171
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,170
But, yes, it's in a bar.

1172
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:09,420
So Tennyson's bar is a sandbar.

1173
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:11,380
Um...

1174
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:14,420
<i>Anna!</i>

1175
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:15,920
Mom, what are you doing up?

1176
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,620
<i>I just finished the night shift.</i>

1177
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:20,210
<i>It's overtime.
You know I cannot say no to that.</i>

1178
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:21,620
<i>Anyway, because I'm up,</i>

1179
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:23,330
I get to talk to you.

1180
01:13:23,330 --> 01:13:25,210
<i>You're back so soon!</i>

1181
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:28,120
I know. It's gone so fast.

1182
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:30,580
<i>Oh, no, it's been too long.</i>

1183
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:33,170
<i>I saw Stephen Delgado's mother.</i>

1184
01:13:33,170 --> 01:13:34,460
Oh, how is he?

1185
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:36,250
<i>He's making six figures already.</i>

1186
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:43,210
Anna, I have something
I really need to discuss with you.

1187
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:45,040
Yes?

1188
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:48,250
- Your birthday. It's next weekend.
- Oh my God. Jamie!

1189
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:52,920
So which should it be?
Are we gonna get drunk by the Seine,

1190
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:56,460
or are we gonna go swimming
in the Aegean, or both?

1191
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:01,250
We can do anything.
Go anywhere that your heart desires.

1192
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,460
- Go anywhere?
- Anywhere.

1193
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:06,210
- And do anything?
- Anything.

1194
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:11,630
- Whoo-hoo!
- Jesus Christ, look at the road!

1195
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:18,830
Je... You can wipe that smug smile
right off your face.

1196
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:20,580
Slow down.

1197
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:23,500
Slow down, we're turning! Oh my God!

1198
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:29,080
Anna, I have restored this car once.
Please, please, please be careful.

1199
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:30,790
Oh, come on, this is so much fun!

1200
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:32,210
Please focus on the road.

1201
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:35,080
I feel like I'm Elizabeth Bennett
on the road to Pemberley.

1202
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,540
It takes her, like, an hour
just to get past the grounds.

1203
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:39,630
Then all of a sudden
they turn a corner and...

1204
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:42,000
Oh my God!

1205
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:47,710
You grew up here?

1206
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:49,630
Yes.

1207
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:52,500
- Here?
- Yes.

1208
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,920
- This place?
- Yes.

1209
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:56,670
Huh.

1210
01:14:58,460 --> 01:14:59,330
What a shithole.

1211
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:03,170
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1212
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:10,830
Whoo-hoo!

1213
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:19,790
- Oh, you're here!
- Hello.

1214
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:22,960
Oh, Anna, you get more beautiful
each time I see you.

1215
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,170
- Oh!
- Keep this up and we shan't be friends.

1216
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:26,870
How are you?

1217
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,790
She's in Anglophile ecstasy.

1218
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:30,670
Hello, darling.

1219
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,080
Your father's just finishing some reading.

1220
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:38,290
Come, let me show you
where Elizabeth imprisoned Mary.

1221
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:39,500
- No...
- Yes.

1222
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,580
- No!
- Yes.

1223
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:50,170
Well, if he ever gets
too big for his boots,

1224
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:52,710
remind him that
his grandfather seven times removed

1225
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:54,580
was groom of the stool,

1226
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:56,920
meaning he wiped the king's arse.

1227
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:01,620
Hi. I was just learning about
your grandfather seven times removed.

1228
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:04,330
Okay, right, so she tells this story
like it's a really bad thing,

1229
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:06,000
but Lord Norris was very powerful.

1230
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,210
He had the ear of the king.

1231
01:16:07,210 --> 01:16:08,540
And not just the ear.

1232
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:12,460
Come, let me show you the tapestry room.
Lead on, my dear.

1233
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,540
Surprise!

1234
01:16:19,290 --> 01:16:21,040
- No, you didn't.
- I'm afraid I did.

1235
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:24,250
Surprise!

1236
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,540
Jamie, I don't like surprises.

1237
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:30,540
Oh, my mistake. I'll just cancel
the birthday and send ev--

1238
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:38,210
Should we... um...

1239
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:41,670
- Right.
- Yes. Yes!

1240
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:44,540
Surprise?

1241
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:47,330
- Yes!
- Yay!

1242
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:48,580
- Hi!
- Hi!

1243
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:51,460
To Anna!

1244
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:54,330
- Yay!
- Ooh!

1245
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:56,370
Charlie, you're actually
quite good at this.

1246
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:58,830
I was the captain
of my school croquet team.

1247
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,120
We lost every game.

1248
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:04,370
Right, who's next?
Is it the birthday girl, you say?

1249
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:05,920
Yes!

1250
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:07,620
You know, I've never played.

1251
01:17:07,630 --> 01:17:09,620
Oh, really?
It's a good job that you've got a list

1252
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:11,460
of things you've never done
that you're doing.

1253
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,080
Actually, I don't have the list anymore.

1254
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,040
Completed it?

1255
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,750
No, just... taking each day as it comes.

1256
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:20,620
- I like it.
- Mmm.

1257
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:22,460
Right, okay, so...

1258
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:23,750
- Just bend over?
- Yeah.

1259
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:25,750
Oh my God, get a room.

1260
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:28,460
We have a room.
Queen Elizabeth slept in it.

1261
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:30,880
Oooh!

1262
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,210
- Aww.
- Ah, okay.

1263
01:17:33,210 --> 01:17:34,830
So actually, in croquet

1264
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:35,830
that's terrible.

1265
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:37,870
I think I just have a bad teacher.

1266
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,710
Really? Wow, okay. Seems a bit harsh.

1267
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:40,960
Uh, next?

1268
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,580
Oh, actually, is one bottle enough?

1269
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:52,000
- Charlie.
- Mm-hmm.

1270
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,290
- Mmm.
- I'll get another one.

1271
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:55,130
- Okay.
- Back in a sec.

1272
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,960
- Oh, sorry. No, please. You...
- Sorry. After you.

1273
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,960
- I'll just take this up.
- We're having beef Wellington.

1274
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:09,290
Yeah. This is for outside.

1275
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:13,000
Jamie, might we have a word?

1276
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:14,880
Must we?

1277
01:18:15,630 --> 01:18:16,500
Today?

1278
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:19,670
Fine.

1279
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:39,580
Ah...

1280
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:47,170
- I'll get the broom.
- Leave it. Luke can clean it up.

1281
01:18:47,170 --> 01:18:49,250
- It's not necessary.
- I said leave it!

1282
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:54,170
Will you listen to me?

1283
01:18:55,290 --> 01:18:56,290
Just for once.

1284
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:02,370
Now, I spoke with Dr. Patel,
and he said there's a new drug--

1285
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:05,040
No more drugs. I told you, I'm done.

1286
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,460
- You have to keep fighting!
- God, you just don't get it!

1287
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:12,790
I don't wanna spend
the time that I have left in a hospital.

1288
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:17,000
I wanna spend it in Oxford, doing
what I love with the people that I love.

1289
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,380
I won't accept it.

1290
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:21,250
I can't just watch you...

1291
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:24,380
Your brother at least tried.

1292
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:26,670
Yes.

1293
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:28,080
Yeah.

1294
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:30,460
Edward never put a foot wrong
in your eyes.

1295
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:33,290
- I... I never favored him.
- You know what you said?

1296
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,000
I know what you said.

1297
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:37,710
I was a mess.

1298
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:41,000
I was grieving my son.

1299
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,460
My brother!

1300
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:44,790
James.

1301
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,000
Please.

1302
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:51,500
I'm just trying to keep you alive.

1303
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:57,210
It's not your decision to make.

1304
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:13,500
Jamie?

1305
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:16,000
Jamie?

1306
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,130
How's the birthday going?

1307
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:42,130
There's still time for things to improve.

1308
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:46,250
- Or get worse.
- Ever the optimist.

1309
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,960
It's a shit situation, isn't it?

1310
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:53,000
It is.

1311
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:55,620
I mean, it could be less shitty

1312
01:20:55,630 --> 01:20:58,500
if the atmosphere between
a certain two people improved.

1313
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,830
Oh my God, I agree.
Tom and Maggie kiss way too much.

1314
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:03,040
It's unsettling.

1315
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:08,330
You know, you have to do what I want.
It's my birthday month.

1316
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:09,290
Month?

1317
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:12,210
You're such an American.

1318
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:14,420
Yeah.

1319
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:16,000
And as an American,

1320
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,380
can I be blunt?

1321
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:21,960
I assume that you're about to be.

1322
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:25,250
Did Eddie die here?

1323
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,500
Uh, yes, he did.

1324
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,420
You said that Eddie
played a role in your lives.

1325
01:21:35,710 --> 01:21:37,960
Why can't his memory play that same role?

1326
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:41,170
You don't understand.

1327
01:21:42,710 --> 01:21:43,540
Of course.

1328
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:45,830
I'm not from here.

1329
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:53,500
I'm gonna go inside.
I have some things to do.

1330
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:16,580
Can I help you?

1331
01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:19,580
- Brought you a present.
- Oh.

1332
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:21,580
Thank you.

1333
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:23,330
There was no need.

1334
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:24,750
Of course.

1335
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:26,960
I'll see you at dinner.

1336
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:57,630
Right. Mine next.

1337
01:22:58,290 --> 01:23:00,330
Stop!

1338
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:04,080
Predictable, but you can never have
too many pairs of good shoes.

1339
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,880
I will think of you every time
I wear them. Which will be a lot.

1340
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,870
The plan is to make you miss us
so terribly that you have to come back.

1341
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:12,830
- Mmm.
- Oh.

1342
01:23:12,830 --> 01:23:15,710
Have you considered not leaving?

1343
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:18,330
College, Oxford, Goldman.

1344
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:21,210
That was always the plan.

1345
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:25,870
Okay, well, Vera Wang
planned on being a figure skater.

1346
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,960
Giorgio Armani trained as a doctor.

1347
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:30,960
And Victoria Beckham wanted to be

1348
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:31,920
a singer.

1349
01:23:33,330 --> 01:23:34,210
Meow!

1350
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:36,040
Right, who is left? Ooh, Tom.

1351
01:23:38,670 --> 01:23:42,420
- Did not know we were to bring gifts.
- It's her birthday party, Tom!

1352
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:44,830
Right, you have to sing her a song
instead. Come on.

1353
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:50,580
Right. Um...

1354
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:51,750
Oh, beautiful...

1355
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:54,330
Antonia told me that Jamie and Eddie

1356
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:58,670
used to steal
their dad's handmade shoes to wear.

1357
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:02,830
Apparently...

1358
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:05,960
Apparently, William knew
they were doing it, but he was

1359
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:08,580
secretly proud that they liked his style.

1360
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:13,210
I wish I could have met Eddie.

1361
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:15,540
Eddie would have really liked you.

1362
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,130
- Yeah.
- Just don't crowd me.

1363
01:24:22,130 --> 01:24:23,460
Do you ever regret it?

1364
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,040
- D?
- Yes, that's it.

1365
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,130
Cecelia!

1366
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,670
Do you play? We need some help.

1367
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:31,000
I do. I'm coming.

1368
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
- That was a bit shit.
- Really.

1369
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,630
- Yeah.
- I don't have it.

1370
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:40,830
I could never regret it.

1371
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:43,620
One chord...

1372
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:46,040
- Actually...
- Right, what are we playing?

1373
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:48,210
- Can you...
- Oh yeah. Okay.

1374
01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:50,330
Okay.

1375
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:59,210
<i>We could have been anything
That we wanted to be</i>

1376
01:24:59,210 --> 01:25:02,170
<i>And that decision was ours...</i>

1377
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:04,500
Yes!

1378
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,790
<i>It's been decided</i>

1379
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:10,370
<i>- We're weaker divided...</i>
- <i>Ooh, high!</i>

1380
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:13,750
<i>Let friendship double up our power!</i>

1381
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:23,880
Excuse me.

1382
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:27,130
Anna?

1383
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:32,080
How dare you?

1384
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,670
- Jamie?
- William?

1385
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:36,080
Come on! I really don't--

1386
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,960
- What? No... There! Ooh! Aah...
- Ooh! Whoa!

1387
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:40,040
- Hey! Hey!
- Ha-ha! Ha-ha!

1388
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:41,000
Oh.

1389
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:42,920
- I'm so sorry.
- Ah.

1390
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,960
I missed your present opening. We, um...

1391
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,000
We just, um...

1392
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:47,790
- We got talking.
- Ah...

1393
01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:49,460
- It led to drinking.
- Yes.

1394
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:51,210
And then we... we finished it.

1395
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:52,870
- Ah, yes. Look.
- Ah.

1396
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,330
- Hah!
- I mean...

1397
01:25:54,330 --> 01:25:56,460
Um...

1398
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,370
So where are the wheels, then?

1399
01:25:58,380 --> 01:25:59,670
- Um...
- Ah...

1400
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:01,920
- Where are the wheels? Your...
- I think...

1401
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,380
I think it might have been
your department, the wheels.

1402
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:08,790
- You can, yes.
- I think you'd love Taipei!

1403
01:26:11,710 --> 01:26:12,710
- No way!
- Yes.

1404
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:15,170
I do not believe you.

1405
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:19,540
I'd, uh... I'd like to raise a toast.

1406
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:21,000
To Anna.

1407
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,620
- Happy birthday.
- Mmm.

1408
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:28,960
Thank you for combining
Keats, cars, and Eddie

1409
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:31,500
to make this evening happen.

1410
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,250
- Cheers!
- Cheers! Wahey!

1411
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:35,250
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

1412
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:37,920
And, uh...

1413
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:40,330
to Jamie.

1414
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,290
My... son.

1415
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,670
My boy.

1416
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:49,250
The love

1417
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,210
of my life.

1418
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:55,880
I, uh...

1419
01:26:57,330 --> 01:26:59,670
I would... I... I want to, uh...

1420
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:02,380
I...

1421
01:27:05,710 --> 01:27:06,710
I'm so sorry.

1422
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:13,370
Uh... uh...

1423
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:16,500
- Yes! Uh, yes, yes, yes. To... to Jamie.
- To Jamie.

1424
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:20,080
Cheers. Now, I'd like
to assume the role of Anna's guardian

1425
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:23,130
and ask you, Master Davenport,

1426
01:27:23,710 --> 01:27:26,120
what, sir, are your intentions?

1427
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:27,830
- Oh!
- Mmm.

1428
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:29,620
Because, let's be honest,
you were a shagger.

1429
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:30,580
Oh!

1430
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:34,250
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You... No. Sorry.
Your mum knows that. Hopefully.

1431
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:36,290
- Of course I knew that.
- Yes. Absolutely.

1432
01:27:36,290 --> 01:27:38,370
Serious, like, more bangs
than Bonfire Night.

1433
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:41,580
Would shag anything that wasn't
running for a bus. Sometimes that was.

1434
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:45,170
But you seem to have settled down.

1435
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:48,210
However, I want assurances that

1436
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:50,210
Anna won't find herself alone in

1437
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:52,670
six months' time.

1438
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:08,580
Um...

1439
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,420
So... Sorry. What's funny?

1440
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:20,080
Charlie, I'm so sorry to disappoint you,

1441
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:24,040
but if there is one thing
that is absolutely certain,

1442
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:27,460
it's that I will be leaving Anna.

1443
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:36,710
I have one more year of med school,
and I am gonna keep studying for you.

1444
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:39,710
Curing incurable diseases
cannot be that hard.

1445
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:43,170
It might be a bit late for me, Tom,
but I really appreciate the thought.

1446
01:28:43,170 --> 01:28:45,290
Hey, where are
we taking this party to next?

1447
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:46,750
We are taking you to bed.

1448
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:49,460
You only want one thing,
and from now on, I won't put out.

1449
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:51,080
- 'Cause I deserve more!
- Thank you.

1450
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:52,580
- Come on.
- Amazing.

1451
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,000
- Sleep well, Ceci.
- Night, night, darling.

1452
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,170
- See you in the morning.
- See you. Night.

1453
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:00,330
Um...

1454
01:29:00,330 --> 01:29:03,210
Dad and I might
take another crack at the car,

1455
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,170
if that's okay?

1456
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:06,920
No.

1457
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:08,670
No?

1458
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:19,880
Thank you.

1459
01:29:20,630 --> 01:29:21,830
I love you too.

1460
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,830
- Where were we?
- Right. You.

1461
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:38,870
- The car!
- And no more messing around.

1462
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,000
- No more messing around.
- Because you were the reason...

1463
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,170
<i>Happy birthday, Anna!</i>

1464
01:30:05,170 --> 01:30:07,580
Feliz cumpleaños, mi niña.

1465
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:10,330
<i>Only two more weeks
until you're back,</i> mi amor.

1466
01:30:10,830 --> 01:30:11,750
Yeah.

1467
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:14,580
<i>What's wrong?</i>

1468
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:18,790
<i>Okay,</i> necesita hablar conmigo.
Salte, salte.

1469
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:23,830
<i>Okay.</i>

1470
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:25,540
<i>He's gone.</i>

1471
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:27,420
<i>Tell me everything.</i>

1472
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:30,670
I don't know, Mom. I...

1473
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:34,170
I don't even know how... how to...

1474
01:30:35,290 --> 01:30:36,290
I just... I...

1475
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:41,580
I don't want the same things
that I thought I wanted.

1476
01:30:43,290 --> 01:30:48,130
And I know that I can't afford
to make the wrong choice, but...

1477
01:30:52,130 --> 01:30:53,420
I'm staying here.

1478
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:54,380
What?

1479
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:57,750
What? No! No, no!

1480
01:30:57,750 --> 01:31:00,920
Why? No, Anna! No. Why are you
throwing your future away like this?

1481
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,130
<i>No! No!</i>

1482
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:11,830
See, I knew this would happen.

1483
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:15,500
- You did?
- Yes, of course!

1484
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,870
Because you're a... a dreamer, Anna!

1485
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,580
I'm sorry, Mom. I just...

1486
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:22,290
I can't leave.

1487
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:37,130
You never know if a choice you make

1488
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:40,630
is right or wrong until you make it.

1489
01:31:41,630 --> 01:31:43,250
And even then...

1490
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:47,790
But what matters is that

1491
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:49,580
they are yours

1492
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:51,500
to make.

1493
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,580
I don't wanna let you down.

1494
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:57,960
Oh!

1495
01:31:58,630 --> 01:31:59,500
Anna.

1496
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:03,170
I always told you you could do anything.

1497
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:08,580
And I didn't just mean
you are capable of anything.

1498
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,290
I also meant we are here for you,

1499
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,790
no matter what you choose to do.

1500
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:21,750
Well, it's not perfect, but we--

1501
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:25,290
Thank you, Mom.

1502
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,540
I will tell them tomorrow that

1503
01:32:29,330 --> 01:32:30,790
I am not taking the job.

1504
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,460
I love you.

1505
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:35,540
<i>- Te quiero.
-</i> Te quiero.

1506
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:36,460
Bye.

1507
01:32:37,290 --> 01:32:38,460
You're not staying.

1508
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:40,920
- Jamie.
- No, Anna.

1509
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:43,460
Have you spoken to Cecelia?
There's no future here.

1510
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:46,830
Well, there's no future guaranteed
anywhere, but here, there's you.

1511
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:48,670
We agreed, right?

1512
01:32:48,670 --> 01:32:51,380
Yes, I know. Fun, but...

1513
01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:53,920
God! We've moved beyond that, haven't we?

1514
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:56,170
You can't stay, Anna. I won't let you.

1515
01:32:56,790 --> 01:32:59,880
- You're being ridiculous.
- Stop telling me what I am!

1516
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:04,330
God, you seem to think
that I'm yours to mold to your ideals,

1517
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:05,580
but I'm not, Jamie.

1518
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:06,750
Yes, I know that you're not,

1519
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:10,380
because I would never let you make
such a bloody stupid decision.

1520
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:15,880
What are you doing?

1521
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:18,540
Now where... where are you going? Where...

1522
01:33:20,330 --> 01:33:21,960
There's a million rooms in this house.

1523
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:24,080
I'm sure I can find
another place to sleep.

1524
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:56,210
- Very happily...
- Bye. Yes, of course.

1525
01:33:56,210 --> 01:33:58,380
- Darling, stay...
- Thank you.

1526
01:33:59,290 --> 01:34:01,000
Best of luck back in America.

1527
01:35:19,330 --> 01:35:20,580
Okay, big smile.

1528
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:24,960
- It's a video, guys.
- That's embarrassing.

1529
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,540
- Oh, Tom.
- No, but it's good.

1530
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:27,750
Where is Cecelia?

1531
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:31,920
- It always gets this...
- Yeah.

1532
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:36,500
I think I have a date tonight.

1533
01:35:37,790 --> 01:35:39,040
Oh my God!

1534
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:43,920
Oh! You can double-date with me and Tom!

1535
01:35:48,210 --> 01:35:49,790
- I would love to.
- Oh, great.

1536
01:35:49,790 --> 01:35:52,080
Anna, do you wanna make it
a triple date tonight?

1537
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,170
Uh, no.

1538
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:54,670
No.

1539
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:56,880
You still haven't spoken to him?

1540
01:35:57,790 --> 01:36:01,500
I mean, this is insane. You can't just
go back to New York after everything.

1541
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,210
He made it clear
he didn't want me to stay.

1542
01:36:04,210 --> 01:36:07,040
He is in love with you
and doesn't know what he's talking about.

1543
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,250
Mmm.

1544
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:11,080
<i>Half-light, half-shadow
Let my spirit sleep</i>

1545
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:13,500
<i>They never learned to love
Who never knew to weep</i>

1546
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:18,750
Tennyson.

1547
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:22,380
Well, I've been listening. They don't
give out degrees here for nothing.

1548
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:27,000
Right. Time to start drinking.
Who's in for Pimm's? Pimm's?

1549
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,920
Sorry, can't.
Uh, going to see Oxford United.

1550
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:31,210
A football match?

1551
01:36:31,210 --> 01:36:33,420
It's a date. See you all later.

1552
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:37,960
So, unicycle to the pub?

1553
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:40,040
No. Come on, Tom. Come on, Anna!

1554
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:42,170
Yay!

1555
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,080
Hi.

1556
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:54,790
- Hello, Laura.
- Sorry.

1557
01:36:55,460 --> 01:36:58,120
A student asked me
to set this book for them. Is that okay?

1558
01:36:58,130 --> 01:36:59,040
Yes, of course.

1559
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:28,330
It reads differently now.

1560
01:37:31,630 --> 01:37:33,080
I realized that

1561
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:35,670
I had it all wrong.

1562
01:37:37,670 --> 01:37:41,460
As you so politely tried to tell me
that first night we went out,

1563
01:37:42,670 --> 01:37:46,580
that what Thoreau meant
by living deliberately

1564
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:49,790
wasn't planning everything, but...

1565
01:37:50,710 --> 01:37:54,250
but being definite
about every small moment.

1566
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:59,290
Because a succession of moments
is really all we have.

1567
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:04,040
And I want mine to be with you.

1568
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:08,040
However many we have left.

1569
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:15,710
You know Thoreau was basically having
a mental breakdown when he wrote that?

1570
01:38:15,710 --> 01:38:17,210
I have learned that, yes.

1571
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:26,420
Anna, I want this more than anything.

1572
01:38:27,130 --> 01:38:28,420
But this is madness.

1573
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:32,250
I...

1574
01:38:32,830 --> 01:38:34,330
I fear that you'll regret it.

1575
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:39,170
Well, I'm of the opinion that you should
never regret the things you do.

1576
01:38:40,630 --> 01:38:43,130
You should only regret
the things you don't do.

1577
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:49,920
- Do you want me to sing?
- Definitely.

1578
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:52,460
You still owe me that Céline Dion.

1579
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:53,460
Yeah.

1580
01:38:57,710 --> 01:39:00,040
<i>Here we go again</i>

1581
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:03,750
<i>Everything is fine</i>

1582
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:07,130
<i>I guess we could pretend</i>

1583
01:39:07,710 --> 01:39:10,630
<i>We didn't cross a line</i>

1584
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:14,080
<i>But ever since that day</i>

1585
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,790
<i>Everything has changed</i>

1586
01:39:18,330 --> 01:39:21,000
<i>The way I write your name</i>

1587
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:24,710
<i>The cursive letter A</i>

1588
01:39:25,330 --> 01:39:27,960
<i>Whenever it may be</i>

1589
01:39:28,670 --> 01:39:31,370
<i>That you go on your way</i>

1590
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:35,080
<i>If you really wanna leave</i>

1591
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:38,750
<i>I'll never make you stay</i>

1592
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:41,920
<i>Whatever you decide</i>

1593
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:45,670
<i>I will understand</i>

1594
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:48,920
<i>And it will all be fine</i>

1595
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:53,290
<i>Just go back to being friends</i>

1596
01:39:53,290 --> 01:39:56,920
<i>And love is a kaleidoscope</i>

1597
01:39:56,920 --> 01:40:00,330
<i>How it works I'll never know</i>

1598
01:40:00,330 --> 01:40:03,500
<i>And even all the change</i>

1599
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,130
<i>Is somehow all the same</i>

1600
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:11,540
<i>Turnin' to the left and right</i>

1601
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:14,790
<i>Colors shinin' in your eye</i>

1602
01:40:14,790 --> 01:40:17,880
<i>And even upside down</i>

1603
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:21,960
<i>It's beautiful somehow</i>

1604
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:25,420
<i>- Every color of the rainbow...</i>
- Jamie.

1605
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:28,920
<i>- Don't be afraid to hold it close...</i>
- Jamie? Jamie!

1606
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:32,420
<i>- It's never just a shape alone...</i>
- Jamie! Jamie!

1607
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:33,420
Jamie?

1608
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:37,290
- Jamie!
<i>- Love is a</i>

1609
01:40:37,290 --> 01:40:41,790
<i>- Kaleidoscope</i>
- God damn it.

1610
01:40:41,790 --> 01:40:42,880
Oh my God.

1611
01:40:43,420 --> 01:40:45,920
Okay. Hey, hey. I'm right here.

1612
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:47,670
I'm right here. I'm right here.

1613
01:40:48,170 --> 01:40:49,040
I'm right here.

1614
01:40:58,790 --> 01:41:00,500
Well, it's about bloody time!

1615
01:41:03,670 --> 01:41:05,960
I'm... I'm sorry, Ashvin. Uh...

1616
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:07,420
How is he?

1617
01:41:08,130 --> 01:41:09,920
It's not the result we were hoping for.

1618
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:15,750
He's fighting
a critical case of pneumonia.

1619
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:19,460
The cancer has severely weakened
his immune system.

1620
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:24,880
This would be a good time for us
to discuss treatment moving forward.

1621
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:32,630
No. That's up to Jamie.

1622
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:36,170
I think he'd prefer
to let nature take its course,

1623
01:41:36,170 --> 01:41:39,130
and, uh... and we should respect that.

1624
01:41:45,170 --> 01:41:46,250
Thank you.

1625
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:49,040
Now that you've stayed,
you have time to go on your grand tour.

1626
01:42:53,830 --> 01:42:55,170
We should go together.

1627
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,170
First stop,

1628
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:04,460
Amsterdam.

1629
01:43:06,330 --> 01:43:08,670
<i>In the heart of the red-light district.</i>

1630
01:43:09,330 --> 01:43:10,830
I'm not that kind of boy.

1631
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,500
<i>There's this church.</i>

1632
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,420
<i>A hidden door leads you to a sanctuary.</i>

1633
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,170
<i>It's so beautiful.</i>

1634
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:25,080
<i>It would take your breath away.</i>

1635
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:45,170
<i>And to Paris.</i>

1636
01:43:48,750 --> 01:43:50,580
<i>We'll get drunk by the Seine.</i>

1637
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:09,290
Beautiful, isn't it?

1638
01:44:14,830 --> 01:44:16,040
<i>And Venice.</i>

1639
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:28,040
<i>Spend a night on a gondola.</i>

1640
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:37,000
Thank you very much.

1641
01:44:38,130 --> 01:44:40,330
<i>And we'd go to the Temple of Poseidon.</i>

1642
01:44:41,830 --> 01:44:43,170
<i>High up on a promontory.</i>

1643
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:49,540
<i>And swim in the Aegean Sea.</i>

1644
01:45:05,580 --> 01:45:07,420
<i>And we would live deliberately.</i>

1645
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:12,540
<i>Sucking out all the marrow of life.</i>

1646
01:45:20,830 --> 01:45:22,750
<i>No matter how messy it gets.</i>

1647
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:48,130
Poetry can be taught.

1648
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,920
But, really, it should be lived.

1649
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:54,830
Tried, tested, engaged with.

1650
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:57,380
Let it in and

1651
01:46:58,580 --> 01:47:00,130
allow it to change your life.

1652
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:05,330
So, as this is my first class...

1653
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,460
I'd like to begin by offering you a bribe.

1654
01:47:45,630 --> 01:47:47,210
<i>We've been through low</i>

1655
01:47:47,830 --> 01:47:50,830
<i>Been through sunshine
Been through snow</i>

1656
01:47:52,790 --> 01:47:58,040
<i>All the colors of the weather</i>

1657
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:01,420
<i>We've been through high</i>

1658
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,040
<i>Every corner of the sky</i>

1659
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:11,880
<i>And still we're holdin' on together</i>

1660
01:48:13,540 --> 01:48:16,960
<i>You got all my love</i>

1661
01:48:18,830 --> 01:48:22,960
<i>Whether it rains or pours</i>

1662
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:26,170
<i>I'm all yours</i>

1663
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:31,040
<i>You've got all my love</i>

1664
01:48:32,670 --> 01:48:36,370
<i>Whether it rains</i>

1665
01:48:36,380 --> 01:48:40,130
<i>It remains</i>

1666
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:45,130
<i>You've got all my love</i>

1667
01:49:02,130 --> 01:49:03,920
<i>Until I die</i>

1668
01:49:04,540 --> 01:49:07,710
<i>Let me hold you if you cry</i>

1669
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:14,380
<i>Be my one, two, three, forever</i>

1670
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,630
<i>'Cause you got all my love</i>

1671
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:25,210
<i>Whether it rains or pours</i>

1672
01:49:25,710 --> 01:49:28,710
<i>I'm all yours</i>

1673
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:33,710
<i>You've got all my love</i>

1674
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:39,210
<i>Whether it rains</i>

1675
01:49:39,210 --> 01:49:43,170
<i>It remains</i>

1676
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:47,790
<i>You've got all my love</i>

1677
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:09,380
<i>La-la, la-la, la, lay</i>

1678
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:15,170
<i>Whether it rains or pours</i>

1679
01:50:15,170 --> 01:50:18,500
<i>I'm all yours</i>

1680
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:23,170
<i>La-la, la-la, la, lay</i>

1681
01:50:25,380 --> 01:50:29,040
<i>That's all</i>

1682
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:32,080
<i>All I can say</i>
