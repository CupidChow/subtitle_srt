1
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,249
<i>I didn't travel 10,000 miles</i>

2
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,749
<i>to spend my first morning in England</i>

3
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,708
<i>talking to some wise-ass chick
from Weehawken, New Jersey.</i>

4
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,874
Look here! The building...

5
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,749
Ignore him. Not him. This!

6
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,583
Look at the building behind...

7
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,625
That's where she's going to study!

8
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,957
Bill Clinton went to Oxford.

9
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,165
Mmm!

10
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:58,458
And she already has a job lined up
at Goldman Sachs when she finishes.

11
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:06,458
Oxford graduates earn 25% more
than other graduates.

12
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,790
It'd be easier
to Google Oxford on your phone, Mom.

13
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:12,000
Mmm! There she is!

14
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:16,416
- We're going to miss you, Anna.
- I'll be home before you know it.

15
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:19,708
Oh, imagine.

16
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,000
Beautiful England.

17
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,791
<i>Although I do hear it rains a lot.</i>

18
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:35,291
<i>Give away...</i>

19
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:39,415
<i>The poet Henry David Thoreau
took himself to the woods</i>

20
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,625
<i>to, as he put it, "live deliberately."</i>

21
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:46,624
<i>Inspired by the idea
of living a planned life,</i>

22
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:50,249
<i>I studied hard, graduated summa cum laude,</i>

23
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,707
<i>and secured a Wall Street job,
which I deferred,</i>

24
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:56,207
<i>so I could take a year for myself,</i>

25
00:01:56,208 --> 00:02:00,624
<i>studying Victorian poetry
at the University of Oxford.</i>

26
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,500
<i>A year to live my dream.</i>

27
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,458
<i>Everything was going exactly to plan.</i>

28
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,750
<i>Until it wasn't.</i>

29
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,208
<i>Anything you want, make it happen</i>

30
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,208
<i>Do what you have to</i>

31
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,375
<i>Anything you want, make it happen</i>...

32
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,666
Okay.

33
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,625
<i>Ooh, just imagine...</i>

34
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,083
Your beauty will fade,
as will my interest.

35
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:36,499
Hi.

36
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,040
- Um, I'm Anna de la Vega.
- Who the bloody hell's that?

37
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,124
An American.

38
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,333
Wonderful face. Shocking shoes.

39
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,000
Bellend!

40
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,665
Whoa, raining, is it?

41
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,083
Not exactly.

42
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,666
Hi. Um...

43
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,374
I would like to order
some fish and chips, please.

44
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,374
Haddock?

45
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,707
A duck? Uh...

46
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,124
No. Fish.

47
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,207
Yeah, haddock. Or cod. Or saveloy.

48
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,666
I'm not... I, uh... I...

49
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,915
Just... Fish and chips?

50
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,999
- Large?
- Large! Yes!

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,125
- 8.50, five minutes.
- Great.

52
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,415
Jamie, this is not
the finest dining in Oxford.

53
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,707
Well, it's top three. Hello, mate.

54
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:50,416
Can I get two large cod, mushy peas,
pickled onions, and some chips, please?

55
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:51,916
Chips?

56
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,749
Should you be having those?

57
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,208
Oh my God, you're so right. Moment
on the lips, lifetime on the hips, right?

58
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,582
Uh, can we make that
two extra-large chips, please?

59
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:04,750
Ignore the lady. She has yet to learn
how to live deliberately.

60
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,416
It's not me telling you
that you can't have--

61
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,250
What are you doing?

62
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,832
Oh my God, are you hiding?

63
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:16,207
No. I'm battling an unruly shoelace.

64
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,707
You're hiding from Jessica Borne!

65
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,207
Honestly, it is a wonder
you can get out of the house

66
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,958
with all the women you leave in your wake.

67
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,624
She's gone now, anyway.
She probably recognized your car.

68
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:32,082
Yeah, probably. One of the pitfalls
of owning a rare car. It's like a beacon.

69
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,458
That's where Bond went wrong.
Should have driven a Ford Focus.

70
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh my God. You!

71
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:41,957
Me?

72
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:45,332
Yeah, you're the bellend.
You drenched me with your car.

73
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,291
Oh. Oh!

74
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,416
Oh... Oh?

75
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,416
Well, I'm... Shit!

76
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,916
Fish and chips for you, love.

77
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,875
I really... I really am sorry.

78
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:03,582
Genuinely.

79
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,583
Yeah, me too.

80
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,124
- Hey!
- No. No!

81
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,125
He's in here!

82
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,041
Hiding from you.

83
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,375
No, no, no, no.

84
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,749
- Uh...
- Jessica, darling.

85
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,541
- Hello.
- All right? I was... Something...

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Welcome

87
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,499
to the University of Oxford,

88
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,458
<i>an institution which has been here
for hundreds of years,</i>

89
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,540
<i>and which in each and every one
of those years</i>

90
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,458
<i>has welcomed a new group of young people.</i>

91
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:56,207
<i>Great leaders, great scientific minds,
literary visionaries</i>

92
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,666
have all passed through
these doors before you.

93
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,499
You will forget parties you attended here,

94
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,707
and you will forget friends you made here,

95
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:10,875
but you will never forget the learning
and the studying you did here.

96
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,915
Your time here is precious.

97
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,541
It will disappear in a blink.

98
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:18,583
Seize it.

99
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,582
- It's okay. you're on time.
- Oh!

100
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,040
Right, yeah. I was just... I...

101
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,707
I was at the... the thing with the...

102
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,791
- I'm Maggie Timbs.
- Hi, I'm Anna de la Vega.

103
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,832
- Are you American?
- I am, yes. From Queens, New York.

104
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,874
Good morning. I have arrived.

105
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,082
Charlie! How was your summer?

106
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,707
Pfft. Loveless.

107
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:11,040
I was stalking that Adonis rower
with bedroom eyes and pecs as hard as--

108
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,250
This is Anna.

109
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,083
- Ah. Hello, new girl.
- We've actually met.

110
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,583
Your neighbor?
You said I had shocking shoes.

111
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,249
Surprised a charmer like you
could remain loveless all summer.

112
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,957
- Loveless, darling, not sexless.
- Ah.

113
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,832
And that wonderful smile
more than makes up for those shoes.

114
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,957
Hello, hello, hello, all.

115
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:33,166
Oh my God, it's Professor Styan.
She's my hero.

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,707
She's the reason I came here.

117
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,332
Terrible news, I'm afraid.

118
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,290
I've been named head of graduate studies,

119
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:43,000
which means I'm far too important to be
teaching you lot, this term at least.

120
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:47,874
My cover is more than able. In fact, he's
my annoyingly brilliant DPhil student.

121
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,458
I'll do the marking. He'll do
the teaching. Best of both worlds for me.

122
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,124
It's not exploiting youth labor.

123
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,750
He actually wants to teach. His lookout.

124
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:01,374
So, um... yeah.
I guess I'll see you around, guys.

125
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,124
Over to you, Jamie.

126
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,208
Uh, thank you. Uh... Hello.

127
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,165
Oh my God, you have got to be kidding me.

128
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,040
Okay, now that is
a serious bit of crumpet.

129
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,999
So, as this is my first class,

130
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,416
I thought that I would set the tone
by offering you

131
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:17,833
a bribe.

132
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,750
It's a

133
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,875
massive cake.

134
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:28,958
So...

135
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:30,957
Help yourselves.

136
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,000
Ah, didn't need the cake. I'd eat him.

137
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah.

138
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:40,165
Five years ago,
I sat right where you are now.

139
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,915
Professor Styan walked in,
and I thought to myself,

140
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:47,125
"So this is the woman who's going to
bore me to tears for the next few months."

141
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,500
Um...

142
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:50,999
Hello.

143
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,250
It's you.

144
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,208
Hi.

145
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:55,625
Hi.

146
00:09:56,666 --> 00:10:03,375
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
we have a student here all the way from...

147
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,875
- New York.
- New York, New York. Welcome, welcome.

148
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,416
I notice you don't have any cake.
We have to make you feel at home.

149
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,958
And they do say that everything

150
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,958
is bigger in New York.

151
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,499
Actually, that's Texas.

152
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,125
Either way.

153
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,082
- I don't really want the cake.
- Don't want the cake?

154
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,040
- No.
- Fine. Yeah.

155
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:33,540
It's just that Mrs. Mackenzie crafted it
in our very own college kitchen,

156
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,707
so it's basically an insult
to the college,

157
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,124
everyone here, and all of Oxford--

158
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,749
- I'm going to eat it.
- I'm not gonna force you to eat it.

159
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,290
- It's slightly unusual--
- I want it.

160
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,958
- I know you do, but--
- I insist.

161
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:55,750
Mmm.

162
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,250
It's delicious.

163
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,249
Good. So, poetry.

164
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,040
I liked poetry, but, I mean,
Victorian poetry, that's for my dad.

165
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,124
Stale old men in top hats
banging on about the glory of foreign wars

166
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:14,750
might not be the most exciting thing
in the world, but

167
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,874
never in my wildest dreams

168
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,083
did I expect to find
in the work of the Victorians

169
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,165
such... despair,

170
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,832
such terror, such beauty,

171
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,708
wisdom, lust.

172
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,332
If you don't mind,

173
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,832
I would love it if you read us this poem.

174
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,207
It was written by an American,

175
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:40,875
so I think we'd all like it
if we heard it in the original cadence.

176
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,000
<i>"My candle burns at both ends</i>

177
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,375
<i>It will not last the night</i>

178
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:55,125
<i>But, ah, my foes, and, oh, my friends</i>

179
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,458
<i>It gives a lovely light"</i>

180
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,333
Thank you.

181
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,665
That was Edna St. Vincent Millay.

182
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,457
There are many different
interpretations of those words,

183
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,665
but here's my tuppence worth.

184
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:12,874
I believe that what she is saying is that
a well-lived life might come at a price,

185
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,625
but bugger me
if it's not worth every penny.

186
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,957
Nothing is permanent.

187
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:21,082
Our passions, our loves,
or indeed our lives

188
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,665
might indeed be fleeting,

189
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:29,125
but if, while we have the chance,
we embrace them fully,

190
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,749
then we can say that we have truly lived.

191
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:37,374
Poetry... Poetry can be taught,
but, really, it should be tried.

192
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,999
It should be tested.
It should be engaged with.

193
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,041
Take it on. Allow it to change your life.

194
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:50,333
And so, in that vein, I will endeavor
to teach you but one thing in my class.

195
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,791
Can anyone guess what it might be?

196
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,625
To eat cake?

197
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,625
Every chance you get.

198
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:09,375
Uh, ping them in an email to me,
and we can, uh, schedule a tute.

199
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,290
Yeah. So...

200
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,500
Uh, can I have a word?

201
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,583
So you're my American MA scholar.

202
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,625
And you're not the professor
I came to see.

203
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,040
Uh, no, but, uh, I'm only covering
for Professor Styan

204
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,665
when she can't be bothered.

205
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,166
She's very lazy, actually.
Sorry to disappoint.

206
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,000
I am disappointed.

207
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,874
- So, the other day...
- Hmm.

208
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,040
Um...

209
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:46,666
- I don't normally hide in chip shops.
- And drench people with puddles.

210
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,875
Terrible mistake.

211
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,374
Truly, I... I had absolutely no intention

212
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:55,541
of starting an impromptu
wet T-shirt competition.

213
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,500
But if I did, then you'd win.

214
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,374
Shouldn't be discussing
wet T-shirt competitions.

215
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,500
Never been to one.

216
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:04,916
Obviously.

217
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,125
Um... Once...

218
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,958
I'm actually very mature.

219
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,666
Oh, well, that is very reassuring.

220
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,165
- So am I.
- Congratulations,<i>Professor</i> Davenport.

221
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,666
- Your first class.
- Uh, would you like some cake?

222
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,249
No, of course not. When was the last time
you saw me eat cake?

223
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,583
My birthday?

224
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,208
Anna!

225
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:39,832
Hey.

226
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,040
Flirting with the hot teacher
on the first day?

227
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,207
- What? No! I, uh--
- Oh, no, I love it.

228
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,707
Have you got a bike?

229
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,624
I have not.

230
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,749
You can't be in Oxford
and not have a bike.

231
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,625
Right, get on. I know a man.

232
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,124
- Is it safe?
- Oh, I wouldn't have thought so.

233
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,458
It's not.

234
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,457
I think I'll... I'll follow you.

235
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,375
Well, I hope you're quick.

236
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Good luck.

237
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,708
Oh. Maggie!

238
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,874
Coming!

239
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,374
Mother of God!

240
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,332
Oh God, not again.

241
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,750
Oh, my...

242
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,582
Hello, Tom. Everything all right?

243
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,457
Dropped a bloody copy of Hargreaves'
medical ailments on my metatarsal.

244
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,208
Ouch. The irony.

245
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,874
Well, this is Anna. She's from America.

246
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,583
Anna, which are we destined to be?
Friends or lovers?

247
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,374
- Friends.
- Absolutely sure?

248
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,832
- Positive.
- 100%?

249
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,041
- Friends.
- Wow. Cold.

250
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,582
The best ones
are always the cruelest. Right?

251
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,458
- Not always.
- Come in.

252
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,416
- Hey, have you got that book I lent--
- No!

253
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,457
Wow.

254
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,500
Here she is.

255
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,374
The Duchess.

256
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:08,207
Okay. Wow. She is so... so British.

257
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,582
- Which is... a good thing?
- Oh, yeah.

258
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:15,415
If it's British you're after, then I have
the perfect evening of entertainment.

259
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,457
<i>Welcome to</i> Naked Attraction<i>,</i>

260
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,915
<i>the dating show
that likes to let it all hang out.</i>

261
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:23,165
It's funny. It's classic. So subversive.

262
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,040
She's right. You know,
<i>Naked Attraction</i> is subversive.

263
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:29,458
Oh, no, I meant "A Man's Requirements"
by Elizabeth Barrett Browning.

264
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:30,999
Listen.

265
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,916
<i>"Thus, if thou wilt prove me, Dear
Woman's love no fable</i>

266
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:39,583
<i>I will love thee half a year
As a man is able"</i>

267
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,957
Uh... How is that subversive?

268
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,457
She calls out
the arrested development man whore

269
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,500
in the 1800s.

270
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,833
It's brilliant.
It's perfect for Professor Davenport.

271
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,833
I'm gonna go send it.

272
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,875
My God, she's keen. She's left
before they revealed the penises.

273
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,583
Oh, there they are.

274
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,791
- I would like you to leave.
- Fine!

275
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,166
You'd better be there. Do you hear me?

276
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,250
- Sorry. Um... I can come back.
- No.

277
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,916
No, come in. Take a seat.

278
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,750
What did you think of your piece?

279
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,500
I...

280
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,250
I think I made some good insights,
observations, and analyses.

281
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,458
What did you think of my work?

282
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,750
Work? That's exactly what it felt like.

283
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:18,583
In 3,000 words, you managed to explore
the suffragettes, the birth of feminism,

284
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,249
Salem witch hunts.

285
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,125
It's an extraordinary accomplishment.
You did everything except the assignment.

286
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,916
Okay, well, um...

287
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,333
I will go work on it some more.

288
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,750
Wait, no, no. Um...

289
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:36,833
I'm so sorry.

290
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,833
Um... Let's start again, please.
I'm so sorry.

291
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:45,958
Weird morning.

292
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,791
Out of all the poems in the book,
why did you... choose this one?

293
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,458
Because I think
it speaks to a truth about men.

294
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,583
You think that men are only capable
of loving a woman for six months?

295
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,124
Some men, yes.

296
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,958
But what if they love deeply

297
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:09,582
for that time?

298
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:14,375
Do you think that things
are only meaningful if they last forever?

299
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:15,791
Of course.

300
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,332
Well, I think that you picked this poem

301
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,374
because you think
that it speaks to something about me,

302
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,665
which is disappointing,

303
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,500
because I wanted to know
something about you.

304
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:33,041
I want you to pick a different poem.
The first one... that speaks to you.

305
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,041
- You have one?
- Mmm.

306
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,625
Great.

307
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:11,541
<i>"Ah, love, let us be true to one another</i>

308
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:16,500
<i>For the world which seems to lie before us
Like a land of dreams</i>

309
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,166
<i>So various, so beautiful, so new"</i>

310
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,333
<i>"Hath really neither joy
Nor love, nor light"</i>

311
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,833
<i>"Nor certitude, nor peace</i>

312
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,125
<i>Nor help for pain</i>

313
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,915
<i>And we are here as on a darkling plain"</i>

314
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:37,124
<i>"Swept with confused alarms
Of struggle and flight"</i>

315
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,708
<i>"Where ignorant armies clash by night"</i>

316
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Now, quick, without thinking,
what is Matthew Arnold saying?

317
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:50,208
I think that the reality of life
is that it's hard.

318
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,625
But at least we have each other.

319
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:56,665
I'm impressed.

320
00:20:56,666 --> 00:21:00,790
You found hope
in the single most pessimistic poem

321
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,166
of the Victorian era.

322
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,000
Well. now you know something about me.

323
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,415
- I just got a call from your Dad--
- Oh my God!

324
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,749
- No, it was totally my fault.
- I'm so sorry.

325
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,874
- Uh...
- Um...

326
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,040
- Hi, Cecelia.
- Hi.

327
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,874
- We're just... finishing.
- Uh... Yep.

328
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,708
- Thank you. Thank<i>you</i>. Um...
- Yes. Thank you. Yes.

329
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,875
- I'll see you in class. Sorry.
- Yeah.

330
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:27,791
Anna.

331
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,582
It has been brought to our attention
that you've never been to a pub.

332
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,540
True.

333
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,083
Disgraceful. Put some shoes on
and follow us immediately.

334
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,750
Ooh, no, not those ones.

335
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,707
Pubs are like churches.

336
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,666
Except we consider them sacred
and attend them religiously.

337
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,957
To our new friend Anna,

338
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:55,040
who's come 3,408 miles
for a 929-year-old education.

339
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:55,958
Cheers.

340
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,500
- Cheers! Yeah!
- Down the hatch! Whoo!

341
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:03,499
Oh God, this thing is bloody itchy. Hold.

342
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,583
Yeah, all right. You haven't...

343
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,624
Just can't...
you just can't get the purchase.

344
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,665
This is your first time wearing a jumper?

345
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,207
Do we need to talk about Tom?

346
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,290
- You're so nearly there.
- Do you fancy him?

347
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,416
No, but you do.

348
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,957
Oh, I know.
I think he's the dog's bollocks.

349
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,749
You think he's the dog's balls?

350
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,458
Oh! Oh, no, no, it's a good thing.

351
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,166
Hmm.

352
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,166
Hello, all.

353
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:30,666
Everyone's super excited to have you
in Oxford. You're such a novelty.

354
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,624
Let me introduce you
to some eligible bachelors.

355
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:34,833
I'm assuming you're single.

356
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:36,916
Come, come.

357
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,957
Oxford boys have got brilliant minds.

358
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,915
- You misunderstand me.
- No, I understand you perfectly.

359
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:47,290
You're saying
that all Americans are stupid.

360
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:52,624
No, no! You're, um... blunt, naive,

361
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:55,165
which I happen to find endearing.

362
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:58,375
And about what exactly
are we so painfully naive?

363
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:00,040
Little things.

364
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:02,541
Geography, world history,

365
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,582
your gun culture,

366
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:09,207
your impact on other countries,
your willful celebration of ignorance.

367
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:10,915
Yeah, you're pissed, Ian. Go home.

368
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:15,665
And your absolute inability
to understand irony and sarcasm.

369
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,208
Oh yeah. No, that's fair.

370
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,625
Perhaps you could teach me about irony.

371
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,832
I'm sure you're a great teacher.

372
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,000
I actually am.

373
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,833
I probably could help you.

374
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,582
Hey, Mags, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

375
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:32,541
The loo.

376
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:36,208
- The loo.
- Mugged you off there, mate.

377
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,291
Hey, Miss Mexico.

378
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,791
Miss Diversity Quota.

379
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:50,958
Do you have something to say to me?

380
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,915
We all know
you're here to make up the numbers.

381
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:57,791
And I will forgive you for taking
the place of someone far more deserving

382
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,750
if you buy me a drink.

383
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:01,458
Hmm.

384
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,625
How about you share mine?

385
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,416
Oh my...

386
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:11,707
Hey, Mags, um, I'm gonna go.

387
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:14,375
- Don't go... Oh!
- This is not my kind of place.

388
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,125
Mate. Don't.

389
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,916
I don't need rescuing, thank you.

390
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:34,583
No, of course, you're incredibly scary,
but to be clear, I was rescuing him.

391
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:36,791
Can I walk you home?

392
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,915
I'm pretty sure I can cope
with the mean streets of Oxford.

393
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,291
Oh, you'd be surprised.

394
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:44,500
It's the gargoyles, actually.
They're especially vicious at night.

395
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,915
They eat Americans.

396
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:49,707
Well, what if I scare them away
by asking blunt questions?

397
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:53,583
Oh yeah, that would work. Big time.
That's kryptonite for the British.

398
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:55,333
Even the gargoyles.

399
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,665
I wouldn't wanna drag you away
from your harem of girls back there.

400
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:05,208
Well, if harem girls are anything,
it's patient.

401
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:11,666
Shall we?

402
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:18,625
At least my first time in a British pub
will be memorable.

403
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,958
That was your first time in a British pub?

404
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:25,458
Unacceptable.

405
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:30,207
So, Anna, why did you choose Oxford?

406
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:32,375
I have a library fetish.

407
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:35,749
Okay.

408
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,582
I just love being surrounded by books.

409
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:41,708
I just think there's no better smell
in the world than the smell of old books.

410
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,291
When I was ten,
I read all the Philip Pullman novels, and

411
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,665
the story of a young girl

412
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:53,082
rushing across this magical
and ancient city stuck with me,

413
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:56,082
and I decided that somehow, some way,

414
00:25:56,083 --> 00:26:00,541
I would sit among those dusty old books
and first editions.

415
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,665
Sorry, you started planning
to come here when you were ten?

416
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,874
Ten and three quarters, actually.

417
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,790
Oh, fine, then. Great.

418
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:10,165
My parents always told me
that I could do anything,

419
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:13,583
so it just never even crossed my mind
that I shouldn't try.

420
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:16,457
They must be really proud of you.

421
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:17,999
They're even prouder of the fact

422
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,332
that I already have a job
as a financial analyst

423
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,250
at Goldman Sachs when I get back.

424
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:23,832
Uh, what...

425
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,499
As a layman, what does an analyst do?

426
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,874
It's primarily research.
Digging into companies, their accounts,

427
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:33,458
and compiling that information
into reports for corporate clients.

428
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:37,082
That sounds riveting.

429
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:41,458
Well, not everyone can afford
a vintage car on a teacher's salary.

430
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:43,915
It's funny,
I've got it in the back of my head.

431
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:46,249
I was wondering what happened
to that ten-year-old dreamer.

432
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,000
She found a new dream.

433
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,583
To make enough money
not to have to worry about money.

434
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,665
Mo... money can't solve all problems.

435
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:57,166
Is literally something
only rich people say.

436
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:04,415
There's no safety net for me, you know,
so it's college, Oxford, Goldman, period.

437
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:07,708
- Got it all planned out.
- I mean, you have to, don't you think?

438
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,833
If you wanna live deliberately.

439
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:18,375
I think that life has a way
of derailing even the best-laid plans.

440
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:19,874
Really?

441
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:21,624
And I'm also of the opinion

442
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:25,333
that the best bits of life
are often the messiest.

443
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:29,083
So how did you get here without a plan?

444
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:30,875
No, wait, let me guess.

445
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,500
Prep school,

446
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:33,957
private tutors,

447
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:35,708
Eton, Oxford.

448
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:39,458
- How did you know that I needed a tutor?
- I said "tutors."

449
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:43,749
It's karaoke all night,
so let's get singing!

450
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,208
<i>Oh, baby, baby</i>

451
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:49,125
<i>How was I supposed to know...</i>

452
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,875
- You think you can do better<i>?
- That somethin' wasn't right here?</i>

453
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:57,415
I'm almost certain
I could do better than that, yeah.

454
00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:59,749
You sing, Professor Davenport?

455
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,457
Well, I was in a band.

456
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:03,749
<i>- Now you're out of sight...</i>
- Bacteria Overflow.

457
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,665
<i>Show me...</i>

458
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:07,582
We gigged twice, so it's, uh...
it's a pretty big deal.

459
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:08,999
Over here, anyway, you know.

460
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,999
Does that mean that if I buy you a drink
that makes me a groupie?

461
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,832
<i>- To know now, oh, because...</i>
- Yes, I think it does.

462
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:18,165
- Two drinks coming up.
<i>- My loneliness is killin' me</i>

463
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,790
<i>And I</i>

464
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:23,499
<i>I must confess, I still believe</i>

465
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,415
<i>Still believe</i>

466
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:27,291
<i>Hit me, baby, one more time</i>

467
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,207
All right, that was pretty terrible.

468
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,457
Hey. Thank you.

469
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:34,540
Next up, singing Coldplay's "Yellow,"

470
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:38,125
Jamie Davenport!

471
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:40,749
- What?
- Where are you, Jamie?

472
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,749
Sorry. Sorry, Anna. What have you done?

473
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,624
I just booked your third gig.

474
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:47,290
- Jamie there?
- Anna, the other two were when I was 12.

475
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:50,082
- Are you Jamie?
- You've had plenty of time to practice.

476
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:51,332
Anna, I was a bass player.

477
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:52,415
Well, then, good luck.

478
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:53,624
Where are you, Jamie?

479
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:56,374
Jamie! Jamie!

480
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:59,207
- No, Anna. Anna, seriously. Seriously...
- Jamie! Jamie!

481
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:01,040
- Please, please. Look...
- Jamie! Jamie!

482
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:06,125
Jamie! Jamie! Jamie!

483
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:10,583
Don't be shy!

484
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,208
<i>Look at the stars</i>

485
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:24,666
<i>See how they shine for you</i>

486
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:30,000
<i>And everything that you do</i>

487
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,166
<i>Yeah, they were all yellow</i>

488
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:37,208
<i>Uh, came along</i>

489
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:41,416
<i>I wrote a song for you</i>

490
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:46,916
<i>And ev... all the things you do...</i>

491
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:50,708
<i>Yeah, and it was called "Yellow"</i>

492
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:52,332
<i>So then...</i>

493
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,290
- No.
- Have you heard this song before?

494
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:58,333
<i>So then I took my turn</i>

495
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:03,000
<i>Oh, what a thing to have done</i>

496
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:07,583
<i>And it was all yellow</i>

497
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:15,957
<i>Your skin</i>

498
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:19,000
<i>Oh, yeah, your skin and bones</i>

499
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:22,124
<i>Turn into</i>

500
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:24,583
<i>Somethin' beautiful</i>

501
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:27,290
<i>Yeah, you know</i>

502
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:30,250
<i>You know I love you so</i>

503
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,375
<i>You know I love you... you so...</i>

504
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,750
Oh!

505
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:44,083
Oh, wow.

506
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:45,916
Oy, oy.

507
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:49,874
See, I'm of the opinion that
you should never regret things you do.

508
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:52,332
You should only regret
the things that you don't do.

509
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,749
Right, but you must regret that karaoke.

510
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:59,041
Sorry, the only thing that I regret is
not following up with a Céline Dion. Now.

511
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:03,958
It is tradition here that after karaoke,
you have to eat.

512
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:09,458
I'm about to introduce you
to a true Oxford institution.

513
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,958
Is that an elephant's leg?

514
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,666
Here you go.

515
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:24,582
Thank you.

516
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:25,583
Yes, boss?

517
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:27,707
Okay, who's next?

518
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:28,666
Trust me.

519
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,958
Some rice?

520
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:36,208
Mmm.

521
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:45,708
That's good.

522
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:47,583
That's really good.

523
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:50,540
My friend.

524
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,791
Cheers, Dimitri. Aah!

525
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:54,916
- It's really good.
- I know.

526
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,915
Okay, your turn.

527
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:02,583
Right. Um, the master at work.

528
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:04,874
- Here we go.
- Ready?

529
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:05,833
Uh-huh.

530
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,541
Mmm.

531
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:10,333
Mmm.

532
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:12,540
Oh no.

533
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:14,624
- Oh my God, I need a napkin.
- No, you don't!

534
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:16,291
- Yes, I do.
- Resist.

535
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,333
This is the messy bit.

536
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:22,416
Come on.

537
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:25,041
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm...

538
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:30,290
It's so good.

539
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:31,416
- It's<i>so</i> good, right?
- Mmm!

540
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:38,707
Well, I definitely did not have
bad karaoke and kebabs

541
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:40,541
on my Oxford wish list,

542
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,375
but, um...

543
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:45,375
I had a really great time.

544
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,458
So would you

545
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:22,375
care to come up for some tea and crumpet?

546
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:32,583
Better not.

547
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:39,416
Good night, Anna.

548
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:53,582
I mean, you've humiliated yourself,
but now you need to move on.

549
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:55,166
And we've all been there.

550
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:58,000
- Have you?
- God, no. It's an expression.

551
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,332
Well, Jamie Davenport
may have turned you down,

552
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:05,540
but you certainly
won't be short of attention in that.

553
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:07,624
It was either this or Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

554
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:10,833
- Sexy '60s Ruth Bader?
- No.

555
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:13,665
Oh. Well, you know, this is... is perfect.

556
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:16,332
It's American. It's powerful.

557
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,665
It's going to knock their socks off.

558
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:21,540
Thank you. And you look great as Dracula.

559
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:24,208
Dracula? Anthony Bridgerton. Honestly.

560
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:28,249
<i>- Tell me, tell me...</i>
- Whoo!

561
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,333
<i>Oh, come on, tell me</i>

562
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,707
<i>Now, oh, come on, tell me...</i>

563
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:34,958
Hiya. Hi.

564
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,915
- So it's not a costume party?
<i>- If you wanna say somethin</i>'<i>...</i>

565
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:41,750
Hello, Wonder Woman.
I could do with saving from that bloke.

566
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:44,290
Ah, not your type?

567
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:47,249
Seriously, I didn't come out
to talk about molecular biology.

568
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,249
Can I get you a drink?
If it's okay with Lord Bridgerton.

569
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,791
Oh, you absolutely have my permission.

570
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:59,249
Just, I don't understand
how this is Halloween.

571
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,749
I mean, does anyone make any effort
in this country at all?

572
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,040
Well, I mean, excuse me.

573
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:06,665
Oh, not you. You look wonderfully weird.

574
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:11,207
And you, you look like
the slutty savior of the human race.

575
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:12,832
You said it, Anthony.

576
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:16,041
Well, I wouldn't mind if you gave me
a ride in your invisible plane.

577
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:19,499
- What?
- Uh, an invisible plane.

578
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,165
Uh, Wonder Woman,
she... she has an invisible plane.

579
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:25,208
You... you can't see it.
It's an invisible plane.

580
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:26,750
Right.

581
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,375
Yeah. Yeah.

582
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,083
Hey, do you wanna dance?

583
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,916
Wheels up.

584
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:41,915
<i>When we get high on my break time</i>

585
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:42,875
<i>And we're just--</i>

586
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:24,832
Big mistake is leaning too far back
on the pull,

587
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,415
'cause it ruins the coordination,

588
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:29,416
and it happens all the time
to guys that are top-heavy.

589
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:30,791
Wow.

590
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:34,457
- Is the, uh... race coming up soon?
- No!

591
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,208
I wouldn't be out if it was.

592
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,958
You can lose a race
by the smallest of margins.

593
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:40,666
Hmm.

594
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:44,041
- You okay?
- Mmm.

595
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:50,458
Come here.

596
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:52,125
I'm hungry.

597
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:01,250
What's so funny?

598
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:04,125
Oh my God. Are you serious?

599
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,415
No, I... I couldn't eat that.

600
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:09,040
It would be like putting diesel
in a Rolls-Royce

601
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:11,083
instead of premium unleaded.

602
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:13,374
Ah.

603
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:14,499
- You're right.
- Yeah?

604
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,833
I don't know what I was thinking.

605
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:18,250
Good night.

606
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,083
- Night, Dimitri.
- Good night.

607
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:27,165
Also, Wilde was a massive fan of Keats.

608
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:29,874
He hated that his... his love letters
were being sold for profit.

609
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:34,790
<i>"That small and sickly eyes
May glare and gloat"</i>

610
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:36,666
That's us for today. Thank you, guys.

611
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:39,582
Right, I need to return my costume.

612
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:40,832
Jack the Ripper?

613
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:43,041
No. Anna, are you coming?

614
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,583
Anna, do you have a minute?

615
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:56,333
If you have time, there's
something that I'd like to show you.

616
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:00,375
I think it's quite special.

617
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:11,165
You didn't think I'd been to the Bodleian?

618
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:12,999
It was, like, the second thing on my list.

619
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,125
- After?
- Fish and chips.

620
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:19,875
But have you been
to the library within the library?

621
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:32,791
Welcome to Duke Humfrey's Library.

622
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:42,750
No, they're alarmed.

623
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:47,041
Hello, Laura.

624
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:48,957
I put it out for you, Jamie.

625
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:49,916
Thank you.

626
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:52,625
Thanks.

627
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:58,041
Behold the inner sanctum.

628
00:39:20,416 --> 00:39:21,958
- It's Millay.
- Mm-hmm.

629
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,625
First edition.

630
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,333
Oh!

631
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:36,000
- It smells so good.
- Mm-hmm.

632
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,041
Wow.

633
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:41,833
So I saw you at the club last night.

634
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:43,708
Oh yeah?

635
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,624
I was gonna say hello,
but I think you left.

636
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:50,166
Couldn't find you
or the meathead rower you were with.

637
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:52,416
Hmm.

638
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:55,416
Well, we left together.

639
00:39:55,916 --> 00:39:58,625
You must have missed that,
being so busy with Cecelia.

640
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:01,790
- How many copies were printed?
- Go straight home?

641
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:02,750
No.

642
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:04,458
Gotcha.

643
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:07,750
The crumpet, then?

644
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:09,583
No.

645
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:12,499
- We went to Dimitri's.
- What...

646
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,540
Sh!

647
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:18,250
...most people don't know
is that 126 copies were printed.

648
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,875
Dimitri's is our place.

649
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,375
Ours?

650
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:26,708
As in me and you?

651
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:36,166
When was this printed,

652
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:38,707
Professor?

653
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:39,666
It's, um...

654
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,583
it's, um...

655
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,333
Nine...

656
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:46,083
Nineteen, um...

657
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,708
1917.

658
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:51,375
Yeah.

659
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:52,833
1917.

660
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:11,083
- Thank you, Laura. I just have to run.
- It's a great book.

661
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,957
Where are we going?

662
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:27,250
Just... somewhere.

663
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,833
Yours?

664
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:39,333
No.

665
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:41,000
It's too far.

666
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:45,833
How long will it take you
to put the top up?

667
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:56,582
- So, thanks for the ride...
- Mmm.

668
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:57,541
...home.

669
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:02,375
...for a year, in college...

670
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:06,999
Not to be blunt,
but this is just fun, right?

671
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,958
Oh yeah.

672
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:09,416
- Fun.
- Fun.

673
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:11,540
- Fun.
- Fun.

674
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:12,958
- So fun.
- So fun.

675
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,041
Well, fun's all I've got to give,
so enjoy it while it lasts.

676
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:31,291
Mind if I sit?

677
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:33,958
Sure.

678
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:36,957
It's funny. We're famous for it,

679
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:40,250
but I'm sure it's only tourists and
my grandmother that take afternoon tea.

680
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:45,874
Word is, you and Jamie are quite the item.

681
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:49,749
Well, I wouldn't say we're an item.
We're just... having fun.

682
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,625
Yes, that's what he's good at.

683
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:53,791
But the question is, are you?

684
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:57,874
Look, I know we like to think of ourselves
as modern women,

685
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:01,625
but when it comes down to it,
it's hard not to get emotionally involved.

686
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,624
Trust me, Anna.

687
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,125
It's not worth the pain.

688
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:10,208
Enjoy your tea.

689
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:19,707
- We agreed we're just having fun.
- Mm-hmm.

690
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:22,790
Oh, fun, that's great. How fun!

691
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:24,457
You have got to stop saying "fun."

692
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:25,749
But it is so fun.

693
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,249
And I suppose, because you're leaving,
you have a built-in end.

694
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:31,749
Exactly. It'll probably only last,
like, a month or two.

695
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:32,666
Hmm.

696
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:35,291
Okay, guess which one
looks just like my ex.

697
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,875
<i>Oh, I do</i>

698
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:46,707
<i>Everything I dreamed about
Is comin' on</i>

699
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:50,458
<i>Trade it for a moment in the sun</i>

700
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:54,874
<i>All that other noise
Is just a waste of time</i>

701
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:59,124
<i>You're the only music on my mind</i>

702
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:03,082
<i>I don't need money
I don't need to be cool</i>

703
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:08,250
<i>I'll trade it for
A moment in the sun with you</i>

704
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,165
- Anna.
- Oh, no. You go first.

705
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:15,874
Anna, it would be my privilege.

706
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:18,082
<i>Winter, spring</i>

707
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:20,040
<i>Summer, fall</i>

708
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:23,749
<i>A moment's fine
But I wanna feel them all</i>

709
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,499
<i>- Oh
- Ooh, ooh</i>

710
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,499
<i>- I wanna feel them all
- Ooh, ooh</i>...

711
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,874
<i>Ding dong! Merrily on high</i>

712
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:34,207
<i>Everything I dreamed about
Is comin' on</i>

713
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:38,374
<i>Trade it for a moment in the sun</i>

714
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:42,249
<i>All that other noise
Is just a waste of time</i>...

715
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:46,707
<i>You're the only music on my mind</i>

716
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:50,249
<i>I don't need money
I don't need to be cool</i>...

717
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,540
Oh, look, they're going to a ball.
I wanna go to a ball.

718
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:55,500
<i>- ...in the sun
- Ooh, ooh</i>...

719
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,666
<i>With you...</i>

720
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:02,207
No, I'm not...

721
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:05,374
750 years to celebrate,
and you don't wanna go?

722
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:06,790
- Uh-huh.
- You're a bore.

723
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:08,957
No, Anna, believe me,
it is the balls that are a bore.

724
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:11,958
I will take you
literally anywhere else. Anywhere.

725
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:13,832
- Anywhere?
- Uh-huh.

726
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:15,040
How about your place?

727
00:45:15,041 --> 00:45:17,207
There are these killer vines
at the moment.

728
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:18,750
- Sure.
- They're sort of like...

729
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:21,249
Oh, wow.

730
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:24,040
<i>...a moment in the sun</i>

731
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:28,374
<i>All that other noise
Is just a waste of time</i>

732
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:32,207
<i>You're the only music on my mind</i>

733
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:36,165
<i>I don't need money
I don't need to be cool</i>

734
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:41,333
<i>I'll trade it for
A moment in the sun with you</i>...

735
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:49,415
<i>Anna! Are you doing your reading
for Goldman Sachs?</i>

736
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:50,499
Mm-hmm.

737
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,582
<i>Don't get distracted, huh?</i>

738
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,624
<i>Your future is too important.</i>

739
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:57,457
<i>- Ooh, ooh
- I wanna feel them all</i>...

740
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:59,249
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

741
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:03,207
<i>I don't need money
I don't need to be cool</i>

742
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:08,375
<i>I'll trade it for
A moment in the sun with you</i>...

743
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:11,625
There's other people as well from...

744
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:13,958
Ooh!

745
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:18,958
I just... I still can't stop
gaping at everything like a tourist.

746
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:23,749
It's just incredible
that Shelley and Tolkien and Wilde

747
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,749
all wandered through these gardens.

748
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:29,875
It's just we don't have this back home.
This... history.

749
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:33,583
- Yeah, but you've got other things.
- Uh-huh.

750
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,125
Baseball.

751
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:37,833
Really big cars.

752
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:41,332
No, if you like this,

753
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:44,540
then you absolutely have to go
on a grand tour around Europe

754
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:45,832
before you leave.

755
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:46,749
A grand tour?

756
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:49,124
Yeah, like Byron.
You've gotta start in Paris.

757
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:50,832
- Mmm.
- Get drunk by the Seine, of course.

758
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:51,791
Of course.

759
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:56,375
And then I'd go to Venice
and spend the whole night on a gondola.

760
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:59,707
And then I'd go to Greece
and I'd visit the Temple of Poseidon.

761
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:02,125
It's high on a promontory
above the Aegean Sea.

762
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:06,541
And then I'd sit down on a

763
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:10,916
glorious beach to, as Tennyson said,

764
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:14,125
watch "sunset and evening star."

765
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,291
Sounds like someone else has a plan.

766
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:19,458
Yeah, I think I might.

767
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:22,250
And you must...

768
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:26,250
you must go
to the red-light district in Amsterdam.

769
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,124
I'm not that kind of girl.

770
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:29,416
No, there's a

771
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:31,540
church there.

772
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:32,958
Our Lord in the Attic.

773
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:37,500
This hidden door
leads you to this sanctuary.

774
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:41,790
It's...

775
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:42,958
It's so beautiful.

776
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:44,916
Take your breath away.

777
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:51,458
We could go together.

778
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:54,916
- Together?
- Hmm.

779
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:59,750
I don't know, Professor.
That sounds rather serious.

780
00:48:00,416 --> 00:48:01,833
I'm only looking for fun.

781
00:48:04,416 --> 00:48:06,083
I go back to New York soon.

782
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:10,875
Yes, you do.

783
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:16,750
Well, maybe instead of a grand tour,
we could do a small tour.

784
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:19,916
Round my place.

785
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:22,291
Your place?

786
00:48:23,541 --> 00:48:25,541
- You have a place?
- I do.

787
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:27,500
Wow.

788
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:31,000
God, it's been so long,
I assumed you lived in that car.

789
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:39,416
Don't judge me.
I'm still gettin' settled in.

790
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:43,083
I only moved out of college a year ago.

791
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:46,083
My, uh... aunt left me the house.

792
00:48:46,708 --> 00:48:48,374
I say left. She's not dead.

793
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:51,999
She, um... just couldn't be bothered
with the renovation

794
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,582
and, of course, moved to Croatia.

795
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:56,416
Did you build these toy cars?

796
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,833
They're model cars. Um...

797
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:03,625
But yes, when I was a kid, with my dad.
And my brother, Eddie.

798
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,000
It's a lot harder than it looks.

799
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:09,333
We'd spend days on each one,
the three of us.

800
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:12,500
Hours into the night.

801
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,625
And then, when I got older,
we started working on real cars.

802
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:18,790
Like the Jaguar?

803
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:19,750
Yeah, that...

804
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:28,833
That was the last thing that we did
before Eddie died.

805
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:31,374
- Oh my God, I'm so sorry--
- It's funny.

806
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:34,582
Every person in your family
plays a certain role, right?

807
00:49:34,583 --> 00:49:37,333
And after he was gone,
I realized that I didn't just lose

808
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:38,957
my brother.

809
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:43,375
I lost my whole way
of communicating with my father.

810
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:48,082
- Have you spoken to him about it?
- No.

811
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:51,124
No. We're Englishmen, Anna.
We don't talk about our feelings.

812
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:52,040
Right.

813
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:53,832
In fact, that might be the first time

814
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:56,416
I've told anyone
I'm not speaking to my dad.

815
00:49:57,583 --> 00:50:00,125
- How did your brother die?
- Let's continue with the tour!

816
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:04,458
You haven't seen the bedroom yet.
Best view ever.

817
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:10,458
And, oh, please be careful.
I've just had the carpets done.

818
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:26,000
Good morning.

819
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:30,333
Going somewhere?

820
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,000
Yes, I forgot I had this thing.

821
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:38,165
Styan bestowed
another responsibility upon me.

822
00:50:38,166 --> 00:50:39,125
Oh.

823
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:42,082
Well, in a way,
I, too, am a responsibility

824
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:44,083
that Styan bestowed upon you.

825
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:48,291
Sorry.

826
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:53,500
Uh, Maggie texted about the Boat Race
next weekend.

827
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,083
You gonna come down with us?

828
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,291
I'm so sorry, what was that?

829
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:00,791
The, uh... the Boat Race next weekend.

830
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:03,958
Are you coming?

831
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:08,415
Uh, no, I don't think I can.

832
00:51:08,416 --> 00:51:11,040
I'm gonna be really busy
over the next few weeks.

833
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:14,000
I have to really focus
on my doctoral thesis.

834
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:17,000
Right. Of course.

835
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:21,416
I'm gonna go get dressed.

836
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,083
Yes, great. Thank you.

837
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,875
- Oxford!
- Whoo-hoo!

838
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:40,457
<i>So kind</i>

839
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:44,124
<i>So long, dance on</i>

840
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:47,375
<i>She's gone, dance on...</i>

841
00:52:01,583 --> 00:52:03,583
Whoo! Whoo!

842
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:05,458
<i>Dance on...</i>

843
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:07,832
Row faster!

844
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,166
Sink 'em, Oxford! Sink 'em, Oxford!

845
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:22,750
Is he coming?

846
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:26,207
No, he can't. He's studying.
I haven't seen him all week.

847
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:27,833
I'm sure he'd be here if he could.

848
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:30,707
His thesis is important. I get it.

849
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:34,207
- Laura! Hey.
- Hey! Nice turnout.

850
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:36,249
Yeah, it seems like everyone is here.

851
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,874
Except Jamie.

852
00:52:37,875 --> 00:52:41,957
Although you must be sick of seeing him
all the time in the library every day.

853
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,791
Oh, no. I haven't seen Jamie in weeks.

854
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,958
I'm gonna try and get a pint
in that scrum. You guys want anything?

855
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:54,458
- No, I'm good. Thanks.
- Okay.

856
00:52:58,291 --> 00:53:00,582
It was probably
an innocent misunderstanding.

857
00:53:00,583 --> 00:53:02,916
Jamie is not the type to sleep around.

858
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,457
Okay, you knew that he was a player.

859
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:09,207
You declared you wanted casual.
This is basically what you asked for.

860
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:11,124
Cecelia warned me to stay away.

861
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:15,250
Warned you like, "Hope you're doing okay,"
or, "Back off or else"?

862
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:18,666
Oh, balls. It was "back off or else."

863
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:20,750
Is she here?

864
00:53:21,541 --> 00:53:22,540
Looking for me?

865
00:53:22,541 --> 00:53:25,540
Hello, Ridley. Uh, did Cecelia
not come with you guys today?

866
00:53:25,541 --> 00:53:28,165
No, this past week, she decided
to hunker down and do some work.

867
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:30,874
But missing the Boat Race?
Should be sent down.

868
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:35,040
The ladies won
by the exact yardage I bet on. 152.

869
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:36,624
I've just won 500 quid.

870
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:38,750
- Oh my God!
- The beers are on me.

871
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:41,499
- Come on.
- To the bar!

872
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,958
Right. What's everyone having?

873
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:46,999
Listen, if he wants to see other people,
I'm fine with that.

874
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,249
- Sure you are.
- But I won't be lied to.

875
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:51,290
- No.
- No.

876
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:53,625
No. Bollocks.
Go knock his bloody door down.

877
00:53:54,208 --> 00:53:56,290
- I know the code.
- Even better. Let yourself in.

878
00:53:56,291 --> 00:53:57,250
Yeah!

879
00:53:58,833 --> 00:54:00,540
Bollocks to this.

880
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:02,332
- Bo... bollocks? Bollocks.
- Yeah.

881
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:03,750
Bollocks to this!

882
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,166
Jamie?

883
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:40,500
I'm gonna get a coffee.

884
00:54:41,291 --> 00:54:42,333
Do you want one?

885
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:45,083
You must be exhausted.

886
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:51,165
Oh my God.

887
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:52,791
No. Anna, wait. Anna--

888
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:01,375
- What is this?
- Get out.

889
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:04,250
- Jamie, are--
- Get... out!

890
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:03,250
Eddie had cancer.

891
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:07,082
And they tried everything.

892
00:56:07,083 --> 00:56:09,374
Every... treatment.

893
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:10,750
Every clinical trial.

894
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:13,875
And in the end, he just wanted it to stop.

895
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:18,708
'Cause the time it had earned him
was just spent in hospital in pain.

896
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:22,416
You don't live longer.
You just die slower.

897
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,583
Um... My father,

898
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,915
so bent on never losing himself,

899
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:31,082
he couldn't understand why someone else
wouldn't fight until the end.

900
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:33,333
But there are some things that you just...

901
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:37,208
You can't fight.
Like your own body when it turns on you.

902
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:43,166
It's just I...

903
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,749
I don't understand
how you've been dealing with all of this.

904
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:49,625
Well, I've had Cecelia,

905
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:52,333
who was Eddie's girlfriend.

906
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:56,250
And she was with him
through all of it. Um...

907
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:58,250
We're basically family now.

908
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,125
And how's your mom coping?

909
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:05,458
Yeah, not great, but, um... she's a champ.

910
00:57:06,375 --> 00:57:10,541
Uh... never makes it about herself,
unlike my father.

911
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:13,666
Even when Eddie was... was dying, he, um...

912
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:18,208
All he could do was push him.
We fought over it then, and, um...

913
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:19,791
things were said.

914
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:22,083
Um...

915
00:57:22,916 --> 00:57:23,958
Anyway, uh...

916
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:26,332
now I'm in the same situation.

917
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:27,916
It's genetic.

918
00:57:28,541 --> 00:57:30,499
What you saw was my final treatment.

919
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,583
So maybe it buys me time,
maybe it doesn't.

920
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:37,833
But either way,
I won't submit myself to any more.

921
00:57:38,916 --> 00:57:44,250
And... my father
simply can't respect that choice.

922
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:04,083
Mmm!

923
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:07,625
I think this would be my death-row meal.

924
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:10,958
What about you?

925
00:58:15,541 --> 00:58:17,041
How is any of this funny?

926
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:23,500
It's funny because

927
00:58:24,541 --> 00:58:28,124
the two people in this city
who most needed a casual relationship

928
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:29,291
ended up here.

929
00:58:34,583 --> 00:58:37,375
Don't waste the short time
you have left in Oxford on me.

930
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:42,458
I saw what happened to Cecelia with Eddie.

931
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:45,875
I'm not putting you through that.

932
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:50,958
We said we'd have fun, and we have.

933
00:58:52,416 --> 00:58:53,458
Loads of it.

934
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:58,083
But my illness isn't fun, so it ends now.

935
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:01,916
With a kebab.

936
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:17,041
Just because something is fleeting
doesn't mean it's not meaningful.

937
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:23,999
I can't pretend to understand
what you're going through,

938
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,375
but I know
that you don't have to do it alone.

939
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:31,333
This is the messiness of life,

940
00:59:31,916 --> 00:59:35,041
and as an annoyingly brilliant man
once told me...

941
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:39,625
these are the best bits.

942
00:59:53,833 --> 00:59:55,708
- Whoa!
- Oi-oi!

943
01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:18,457
Nothing's changed.

944
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:20,916
Keep having fun.

945
01:00:22,208 --> 01:00:23,083
Yeah.

946
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:26,083
- We'll keep having fun.
- Mmm.

947
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,582
Aah!

948
01:00:29,583 --> 01:00:31,583
No, no, no, no, no, no!

949
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:43,583
- Oh, Professor Styan.
- Mm-hmm?

950
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,124
Sorry, you're on the committee

951
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:50,124
for the septicentennial and fifty ball,
aren't you?

952
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:51,290
I am.

953
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:53,832
I'm also aware
of your contempt for all things...

954
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:54,999
What was it?

955
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,915
Gaudy, naff, and classless
dressed as high taste?

956
01:00:57,916 --> 01:01:00,666
Yes. Uh, that does
sound like me, doesn't it?

957
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:02,541
Um, but...

958
01:01:11,916 --> 01:01:15,207
I just had a few questions about
the kind of grip that you do on the--

959
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:16,499
Wh...

960
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,583
Excuse me!

961
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,832
Oh my God! Oh my God!

962
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:22,375
Wait, we're all going?

963
01:01:37,666 --> 01:01:38,957
- Hey.
- Mm-hmm?

964
01:01:38,958 --> 01:01:40,416
I'm right by your side.

965
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:42,083
Okay.

966
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:49,790
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, darling.

967
01:01:49,791 --> 01:01:52,374
- You look exquisite.
- Thank you.

968
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:55,250
I'm gonna get drunk
and go on a fucking Ferris wheel.

969
01:01:56,333 --> 01:02:00,332
I would like you to meet my friend, Anna.

970
01:02:00,333 --> 01:02:03,999
Yes, I heard rumors that my son
was dating a very pretty American girl.

971
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,290
Yes, I heard them, too, sir,
but I didn't let that stop me.

972
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:10,290
Excuse me. Might we have
a quick word, Lady Davenport?

973
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:11,458
Oh, yes, of course.

974
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:13,916
Sorry, such a bore.

975
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:20,125
Jamie, if we could, um... perhaps just...

976
01:02:22,208 --> 01:02:24,708
<i>There's something about it...</i>

977
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:38,791
So which are we destined to be, friends

978
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:40,582
or lovers?

979
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:41,500
Neither.

980
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:44,666
- Tom!
- There was a third option.

981
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:48,666
- Hey. Anna, you look absolutely...
<i>- Can't tell you what makes it perfect</i>

982
01:02:49,666 --> 01:02:53,249
<i>You're the cure for the hurt...</i>

983
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,791
Stunning, isn't she?

984
01:02:55,416 --> 01:02:58,375
It's a shame it takes a dress and heels
for a guy to notice.

985
01:02:59,000 --> 01:02:59,915
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

986
01:02:59,916 --> 01:03:03,374
What? Oh, you thought
I was looking at Maggie like that!

987
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:06,375
Can you imagine?
No, no, Maggie and I, we're just

988
01:03:07,791 --> 01:03:08,624
friends.

989
01:03:08,625 --> 01:03:11,583
Best way to be, mate.
Don't get involved, don't get hurt.

990
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:17,708
<i>Bring it back, sing it back</i>

991
01:03:18,291 --> 01:03:21,291
<i>Bring it back, sing it back to me</i>

992
01:03:22,125 --> 01:03:25,416
<i>Bring it back, sing it back</i>

993
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:28,957
<i>Bring it back, sing it back to me</i>

994
01:03:28,958 --> 01:03:32,457
<i>When you are ready, I will surrender</i>

995
01:03:32,458 --> 01:03:36,083
<i>Take me and do as you wish</i>

996
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:40,666
<i>Have what you want
Your way's always the best way</i>...

997
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:42,208
Hello, Anna.

998
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:47,458
- Can I tempt you with a drink?
<i>- I succumbed to this passive sensation</i>

999
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:50,332
<i>Peacefully falling away...</i>

1000
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:51,915
Sure. I'd like that.

1001
01:03:51,916 --> 01:03:55,749
<i>I am a zombie
Your wish will command me</i>

1002
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:59,040
So my mom
came from Argentina with nothing,

1003
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:01,541
and my dad's a Cuban émigré.

1004
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:04,499
Now their daughter's
taking a master's at Oxford

1005
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,040
and is soon to start at Goldman.

1006
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:08,624
You've done your research.

1007
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:11,665
Yeah, well, Jamie might not talk to me,

1008
01:04:11,666 --> 01:04:13,708
but thankfully,
he still talks to his mother.

1009
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:18,000
I have to be
totally transparent with you, Anna.

1010
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,415
I want the best possible
medical treatment for Jamie,

1011
01:04:21,416 --> 01:04:23,040
but... but he has to fight.

1012
01:04:23,041 --> 01:04:27,250
Currently not speaking to me, so...
...I can't give him the details.

1013
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:30,624
Jamie saw what happened with Eddie,

1014
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:33,749
so I... think
he knows about the treatment, sir.

1015
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,708
Mmm... not all of them. I mean, how can he?

1016
01:04:36,291 --> 01:04:38,708
What he and Eddie have is incredibly rare.

1017
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:42,041
I've been talking to people,

1018
01:04:42,916 --> 01:04:46,166
making donations, sponsoring research.

1019
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:50,999
I can't imagine how hard this is for you.

1020
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,291
Jamie thinks he knows best, but

1021
01:04:54,583 --> 01:04:55,500
he doesn't.

1022
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,041
He looks healthy, but, um... he's not.

1023
01:05:00,041 --> 01:05:03,416
He needs to return to our home
for more treatment, and, uh...

1024
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,916
I expect you to help us convince him.

1025
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:12,333
I'm so glad
we've reached this understanding.

1026
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:23,541
Jamie said that words were exchanged
when Edward died.

1027
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:27,500
What did you say to him?

1028
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:30,625
You dare to judge me?

1029
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:38,375
Have you watched someone you love
more than your own life die?

1030
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:44,832
You have no idea
what it's like to lose a child,

1031
01:05:44,833 --> 01:05:46,916
knowing you may soon lose another.

1032
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,040
<i>Everybody dance</i>

1033
01:05:59,041 --> 01:06:00,915
<i>Do-do-do-do, clap your hands</i>

1034
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:02,583
<i>Clap your hands</i>

1035
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:06,290
<i>Everybody dance</i>...

1036
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:08,040
What have you done now?

1037
01:06:08,041 --> 01:06:10,499
You've not signed me up
to sing with the band, have you?

1038
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:13,166
- I was just talking to your dad.
- Mm-hmm?

1039
01:06:14,541 --> 01:06:16,582
Jamie, you need to work this out.

1040
01:06:16,583 --> 01:06:20,833
Anna. I know that you have your life
perfectly planned out.

1041
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:25,541
Don't need to try and fix mine.
Some things are just broken.

1042
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:27,832
Okay, as your friend, I think he--

1043
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:30,333
Do you want a drink? I do.

1044
01:06:34,041 --> 01:06:35,166
Excuse me.

1045
01:06:37,625 --> 01:06:41,082
No. I mean, I used to love football,
and I was good at it too.

1046
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:43,707
If it hadn't been
for the homophobic locker room chat.

1047
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:46,582
I mean, honestly, they'd call me
Bender Like Beckham,

1048
01:06:46,583 --> 01:06:48,290
Cristiano Ronald-ooh,

1049
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:51,624
and Sabrina the Queen Age Bitch,
which had nothing to do with football.

1050
01:06:51,625 --> 01:06:54,165
You should play
with the college gay football society.

1051
01:06:54,166 --> 01:06:55,332
The guys are great.

1052
01:06:55,333 --> 01:06:56,832
I would... I would love that.

1053
01:06:56,833 --> 01:07:00,875
And after a match,
maybe we could get dinner, watch a movie?

1054
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:03,375
Wh... Uh, me?

1055
01:07:04,583 --> 01:07:05,582
No.

1056
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:06,790
No, I just, uh...

1057
01:07:06,791 --> 01:07:09,333
Uh... I will be straight back.
I'm just gonna...

1058
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:16,665
Oh my God.
I mean, I've never been so insulted.

1059
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:19,040
A ten-minute chat
and he's ready to take me up the aisle.

1060
01:07:19,041 --> 01:07:22,165
Do I look like the kind of guy
that's ready to commit?

1061
01:07:22,166 --> 01:07:24,250
I don't know who on earth you are.

1062
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,582
Yeah, I'm not so sure myself.

1063
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:31,082
<i>Don't know who you think
That you're confusin'</i>

1064
01:07:31,083 --> 01:07:34,957
<i>I be like, "Ooh, it's amusin'"</i>

1065
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:39,082
<i>You think I'm gonna fall for an illu...</i>

1066
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:40,416
Cecelia. Hi.

1067
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:45,958
Jamie told me...

1068
01:07:47,416 --> 01:07:48,583
Whew.

1069
01:07:49,916 --> 01:07:52,416
It was like watching a car crash
in slow motion.

1070
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,500
He was so brave, but it... it...

1071
01:08:00,333 --> 01:08:01,958
completely ruined me.

1072
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:06,957
And there's no getting over it.

1073
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:10,791
I go out,
I flirt with the occasional guy, but

1074
01:08:12,291 --> 01:08:13,333
that's it.

1075
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:16,707
<i>Tryna make me yours for life
Takin' me for a ride</i>...

1076
01:08:16,708 --> 01:08:18,874
I shall be a spinster forever, I suppose.

1077
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:20,541
<i>Think you play your cards right</i>

1078
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:24,124
<i>Don't you know
I could do this dance all night?</i>

1079
01:08:24,125 --> 01:08:25,541
<i>- Ooh
- Ooh</i>

1080
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:28,249
<i>What you doin'?</i>

1081
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:31,624
<i>Don't know who you think
That you're confusin'</i>

1082
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:35,582
<i>I be like, "Ooh, it's amusin'"</i>

1083
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:38,415
<i>You think
I'm gonna fall for an illusion</i>...

1084
01:08:38,416 --> 01:08:41,165
- What is it, Tom?
- I was wondering if I could have a quick...

1085
01:08:41,166 --> 01:08:42,249
Just gonna...

1086
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,665
Yeah, just gonna grab...

1087
01:08:43,666 --> 01:08:45,082
<i>- Dance all night...</i>
- Uh...

1088
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:46,915
<i>Dance all night</i>...

1089
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:48,125
Are we having a dance?

1090
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:52,124
- You... you know I can't dance, so...
- What is it? I had a good thing going.

1091
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:54,124
Yes, I mean, but that's just it, isn't it?

1092
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:58,665
Um... because, I mean,
you're off dancing with tattooed... Tony,

1093
01:08:58,666 --> 01:09:01,375
when perhaps you and I could be, you know...

1094
01:09:03,166 --> 01:09:04,875
I can teach you to unicycle.

1095
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:09,500
- Tom, are you chatting me up?
- Yes, yes, I am.

1096
01:09:15,916 --> 01:09:16,916
Somethin' to say?

1097
01:09:17,916 --> 01:09:18,916
I'm really sorry.

1098
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:21,833
- I didn't mean to be a--
- Bellend?

1099
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:23,583
It's okay.

1100
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:27,165
You Englishmen find it hard
to talk about your emotions.

1101
01:09:27,166 --> 01:09:28,415
Do you want to dance?

1102
01:09:28,416 --> 01:09:30,125
<i>La, la, la-la-la</i>

1103
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:32,290
<i>- La, la, la</i>...
- Like that?

1104
01:09:32,291 --> 01:09:34,249
<i>La, la, la-la-la</i>

1105
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:36,040
<i>La, la, la</i>

1106
01:09:36,041 --> 01:09:37,790
<i>- La, la, la-la-la...</i>
- No.

1107
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:40,999
- Much worse than that.
<i>- I just can't get you out of my head</i>

1108
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,707
<i>Boy, your lovin' is all I think about</i>

1109
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:48,040
<i>I just can't get you out of my head</i>

1110
01:09:48,041 --> 01:09:51,332
<i>I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch</i>

1111
01:09:51,333 --> 01:09:53,207
<i>Oh, I feel the rush</i>

1112
01:09:53,208 --> 01:09:55,582
<i>It's so good, it's so good</i>

1113
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:58,832
<i>I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch</i>

1114
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:00,707
<i>Oh, I feel the rush</i>

1115
01:10:00,708 --> 01:10:02,707
<i>It's so good, it's so good</i>

1116
01:10:02,708 --> 01:10:08,124
<i>So good when we slow gravity, so good</i>

1117
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:10,708
<i>It's so good, it's so good</i>

1118
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:12,915
- I love your mom.
- Uh-huh.

1119
01:10:12,916 --> 01:10:17,540
She gave me her number, and she told me
to call her for a chin-wag,

1120
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:22,249
which Maggie said isn't jaw surgery,
but a friendly conversation.

1121
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:23,833
Can you unzip me, please?

1122
01:10:24,708 --> 01:10:28,041
Yes, absolutely. I'm just feel... ing...

1123
01:10:31,791 --> 01:10:32,625
Jamie!

1124
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:34,750
Jamie! Jam...

1125
01:10:39,708 --> 01:10:41,083
Do you like those flowers?

1126
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:45,375
They're fake.

1127
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:47,291
It's a secret.

1128
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:49,165
On the plus side,

1129
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:52,416
at least I didn't turn into a pumpkin
until after the ball, huh?

1130
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,041
Can you exist without your irony?

1131
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:57,625
No.

1132
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,332
Anna, I'm fine. It was overexertion.

1133
01:11:02,333 --> 01:11:06,374
I'm probably a little bit better
than you are.

1134
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:09,999
We can maybe get one of these nurses
to slip you something for your hangover.

1135
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,875
- Here we go. This should help.
- Thanks.

1136
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:15,208
Jamie, you'll need something
a bit stronger.

1137
01:11:15,791 --> 01:11:16,749
Whiskey?

1138
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:20,624
I've recently been drinking rather a lot
of Buckfast. Have you heard of that?

1139
01:11:20,625 --> 01:11:21,707
Oh, really? Have you?
Yes.

1140
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:24,499
Just wondering, maybe a bit of that
with some mezcal thrown in.

1141
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,625
I think... I think I might have a latte.

1142
01:11:44,416 --> 01:11:47,374
<i>Professor Styan's asked me
to step in once again, apologies,</i>

1143
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:50,665
<i>to discuss Tennyson's "Crossing the Bar,"</i>

1144
01:11:50,666 --> 01:11:55,457
arguably one of the greatest poems
about life and death ever written.

1145
01:11:55,458 --> 01:11:59,290
<i>And he's comparing death
to setting out to sea.</i>

1146
01:11:59,291 --> 01:12:04,957
All he wants in his final moments
is to hear the gentle tolling of a bell

1147
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:07,499
and then to be swallowed up by darkness.

1148
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,582
And rather than being afraid of death,
he is embracing it.

1149
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:12,250
<i>And I say, why the hell not?</i>

1150
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:14,875
<i>Because it's the end of everything.</i>

1151
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:18,166
<i>It's the end of... of all the things
that you should have done.</i>

1152
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:21,458
Yes... uh, but,

1153
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:26,624
maybe, Maggie, it is not the length
of time that you spend on Earth.

1154
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:28,291
Maybe it's what you do with it.

1155
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:35,166
Well, I hope to be in a bar when I die.

1156
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:39,582
Not in a sad way.
In, like, a... In, like, a fun way.

1157
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:42,582
No, but I, like... So if I'm, like, laughing
and I fall off my chair.

1158
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:44,624
But not because I've had too much to...

1159
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:46,915
I may have had, like, one drink,
maybe two, like?

1160
01:12:46,916 --> 01:12:50,249
But a fun drink, like, with a straw.
Piña colada, something like that.

1161
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:52,332
And my boyfriend, he's there.
He loves that.

1162
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:54,165
He kisses me on the cheek,
like, um, tenderly,

1163
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:56,540
but enough to say
we're still interested in each other.

1164
01:12:56,541 --> 01:12:59,249
At that point,
I'm doing a lot of philanthropy,

1165
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:01,124
and I think people can tell.

1166
01:13:01,125 --> 01:13:02,999
There's a twinkle in my eyes
that says I care.

1167
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,582
So when I die,
there's a big loss to the charity sector.

1168
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:07,915
People are obviously upset.

1169
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:10,582
You know, a great beauty lost from Oxford.

1170
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:13,874
But then, obvi-- But I do still die,
but it's, like, the right time.

1171
01:13:13,875 --> 01:13:15,166
But, yes, it's in a bar.

1172
01:13:16,541 --> 01:13:19,416
So Tennyson's bar is a sandbar.

1173
01:13:20,458 --> 01:13:21,375
Um...

1174
01:13:23,416 --> 01:13:24,415
<i>Anna!</i>

1175
01:13:24,416 --> 01:13:25,915
Mom, what are you doing up?

1176
01:13:25,916 --> 01:13:27,624
<i>I just finished the night shift.</i>

1177
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:30,207
<i>It's overtime.
You know I cannot say no to that.</i>

1178
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:31,624
<i>Anyway, because I'm up,</i>

1179
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:33,332
I get to talk to you.

1180
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:35,207
<i>You're back so soon!</i>

1181
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:38,124
I know. It's gone so fast.

1182
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:40,583
<i>Oh, no, it's been too long.</i>

1183
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,165
<i>I saw Stephen Delgado's mother.</i>

1184
01:13:43,166 --> 01:13:44,457
Oh, how is he?

1185
01:13:44,458 --> 01:13:46,250
<i>He's making six figures already.</i>

1186
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:53,208
Anna, I have something
I really need to discuss with you.

1187
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:55,041
Yes?

1188
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:58,249
- Your birthday. It's next weekend.
- Oh my God. Jamie!

1189
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:02,915
So which should it be?
Are we gonna get drunk by the Seine,

1190
01:14:02,916 --> 01:14:06,458
or are we gonna go swimming
in the Aegean, or both?

1191
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:11,250
We can do anything.
Go anywhere that your heart desires.

1192
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:13,458
- Go anywhere?
- Anywhere.

1193
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,208
- And do anything?
- Anything.

1194
01:14:18,916 --> 01:14:21,625
- Whoo-hoo!
- Jesus Christ, look at the road!

1195
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:28,833
Je... You can wipe that smug smile
right off your face.

1196
01:14:29,708 --> 01:14:30,582
Slow down.

1197
01:14:30,583 --> 01:14:33,500
Slow down, we're turning! Oh my God!

1198
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:39,082
Anna, I have restored this car once.
Please, please, please be careful.

1199
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:40,790
Oh, come on, this is so much fun!

1200
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:42,207
Please focus on the road.

1201
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:45,082
I feel like I'm Elizabeth Bennett
on the road to Pemberley.

1202
01:14:45,083 --> 01:14:47,540
It takes her, like, an hour
just to get past the grounds.

1203
01:14:47,541 --> 01:14:49,625
Then all of a sudden
they turn a corner and...

1204
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:52,000
Oh my God!

1205
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:57,708
You grew up here?

1206
01:14:58,750 --> 01:14:59,625
Yes.

1207
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,499
- Here?
- Yes.

1208
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,916
- This place?
- Yes.

1209
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:06,666
Huh.

1210
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:09,333
What a shithole.

1211
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:13,166
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1212
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:20,833
Whoo-hoo!

1213
01:15:28,125 --> 01:15:29,791
- Oh, you're here!
- Hello.

1214
01:15:30,666 --> 01:15:32,957
Oh, Anna, you get more beautiful
each time I see you.

1215
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:35,165
- Oh!
- Keep this up and we shan't be friends.

1216
01:15:35,166 --> 01:15:36,874
How are you?

1217
01:15:36,875 --> 01:15:38,790
She's in Anglophile ecstasy.

1218
01:15:38,791 --> 01:15:40,666
Hello, darling.

1219
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,083
Your father's just finishing some reading.

1220
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:48,290
Come, let me show you
where Elizabeth imprisoned Mary.

1221
01:15:48,291 --> 01:15:49,499
- No...
- Yes.

1222
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,583
- No!
- Yes.

1223
01:15:58,375 --> 01:16:00,165
Well, if he ever gets
too big for his boots,

1224
01:16:00,166 --> 01:16:02,707
remind him that
his grandfather seven times removed

1225
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:04,582
was groom of the stool,

1226
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:06,916
meaning he wiped the king's arse.

1227
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:11,624
Hi. I was just learning about
your grandfather seven times removed.

1228
01:16:11,625 --> 01:16:14,332
Okay, right, so she tells this story
like it's a really bad thing,

1229
01:16:14,333 --> 01:16:15,999
but Lord Norris was very powerful.

1230
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,207
He had the ear of the king.

1231
01:16:17,208 --> 01:16:18,541
And not just the ear.

1232
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:22,458
Come, let me show you the tapestry room.
Lead on, my dear.

1233
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:28,541
Surprise!

1234
01:16:29,291 --> 01:16:31,041
- No, you didn't.
- I'm afraid I did.

1235
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:34,250
Surprise!

1236
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:36,540
Jamie, I don't like surprises.

1237
01:16:36,541 --> 01:16:40,541
Oh, my mistake. I'll just cancel
the birthday and send ev--

1238
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:48,208
Should we... um...

1239
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:51,666
- Right.
- Yes. Yes!

1240
01:16:52,625 --> 01:16:54,540
Surprise?

1241
01:16:54,541 --> 01:16:57,332
- Yes!
- Yay!

1242
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:58,582
- Hi!
- Hi!

1243
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:01,458
To Anna!

1244
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:04,332
- Yay!
- Ooh!

1245
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:06,374
Charlie, you're actually
quite good at this.

1246
01:17:06,375 --> 01:17:08,833
I was the captain
of my school croquet team.

1247
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,124
We lost every game.

1248
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:14,374
Right, who's next?
Is it the birthday girl, you say?

1249
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:15,916
Yes!

1250
01:17:16,416 --> 01:17:17,624
You know, I've never played.

1251
01:17:17,625 --> 01:17:19,624
Oh, really?
It's a good job that you've got a list

1252
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:21,457
of things you've never done
that you're doing.

1253
01:17:21,458 --> 01:17:23,083
Actually, I don't have the list anymore.

1254
01:17:23,916 --> 01:17:25,040
Completed it?

1255
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:27,750
No, just... taking each day as it comes.

1256
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:30,624
- I like it.
- Mmm.

1257
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:32,457
Right, okay, so...

1258
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:33,749
- Just bend over?
- Yeah.

1259
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:35,749
Oh my God, get a room.

1260
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:38,458
We have a room.
Queen Elizabeth slept in it.

1261
01:17:38,583 --> 01:17:40,875
Oooh!

1262
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:43,207
- Aww.
- Ah, okay.

1263
01:17:43,208 --> 01:17:44,832
So actually, in croquet

1264
01:17:44,833 --> 01:17:45,832
that's terrible.

1265
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:47,874
I think I just have a bad teacher.

1266
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:49,707
Really? Wow, okay. Seems a bit harsh.

1267
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:50,958
Uh, next?

1268
01:17:57,875 --> 01:17:59,583
Oh, actually, is one bottle enough?

1269
01:18:00,416 --> 01:18:01,999
- Charlie.
- Mm-hmm.

1270
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,290
- Mmm.
- I'll get another one.

1271
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:05,125
- Okay.
- Back in a sec.

1272
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:12,958
- Oh, sorry. No, please. You...
- Sorry. After you.

1273
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,958
- I'll just take this up.
- We're having beef Wellington.

1274
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:19,291
Yeah. This is for outside.

1275
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:23,000
Jamie, might we have a word?

1276
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:24,875
Must we?

1277
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:26,500
Today?

1278
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:29,666
Fine.

1279
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,583
Ah...

1280
01:18:54,916 --> 01:18:57,165
- I'll get the broom.
- Leave it. Luke can clean it up.

1281
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:59,250
- It's not necessary.
- I said leave it!

1282
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:04,166
Will you listen to me?

1283
01:19:05,291 --> 01:19:06,291
Just for once.

1284
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:12,374
Now, I spoke with Dr. Patel,
and he said there's a new drug--

1285
01:19:12,375 --> 01:19:15,040
No more drugs. I told you, I'm done.

1286
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:18,458
- You have to keep fighting!
- God, you just don't get it!

1287
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:22,790
I don't wanna spend
the time that I have left in a hospital.

1288
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:26,999
I wanna spend it in Oxford, doing
what I love with the people that I love.

1289
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,375
I won't accept it.

1290
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:31,250
I can't just watch you...

1291
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:34,375
Your brother at least tried.

1292
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:36,666
Yes.

1293
01:19:37,208 --> 01:19:38,083
Yeah.

1294
01:19:38,708 --> 01:19:40,458
Edward never put a foot wrong
in your eyes.

1295
01:19:41,125 --> 01:19:43,291
- I... I never favored him.
- You know what you said?

1296
01:19:43,958 --> 01:19:45,000
I know what you said.

1297
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:47,708
I was a mess.

1298
01:19:49,166 --> 01:19:50,999
I was grieving my son.

1299
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,458
My brother!

1300
01:19:53,916 --> 01:19:54,791
James.

1301
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:57,000
Please.

1302
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:01,500
I'm just trying to keep you alive.

1303
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:07,208
It's not your decision to make.

1304
01:20:22,625 --> 01:20:23,500
Jamie?

1305
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:26,000
Jamie?

1306
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:49,125
How's the birthday going?

1307
01:20:50,041 --> 01:20:52,125
There's still time for things to improve.

1308
01:20:53,541 --> 01:20:56,250
- Or get worse.
- Ever the optimist.

1309
01:20:59,041 --> 01:21:00,957
It's a shit situation, isn't it?

1310
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:03,000
It is.

1311
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:05,624
I mean, it could be less shitty

1312
01:21:05,625 --> 01:21:08,499
if the atmosphere between
a certain two people improved.

1313
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:11,832
Oh my God, I agree.
Tom and Maggie kiss way too much.

1314
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:13,041
It's unsettling.

1315
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:18,332
You know, you have to do what I want.
It's my birthday month.

1316
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:19,291
Month?

1317
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:22,208
You're such an American.

1318
01:21:23,541 --> 01:21:24,415
Yeah.

1319
01:21:24,416 --> 01:21:26,000
And as an American,

1320
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,375
can I be blunt?

1321
01:21:29,583 --> 01:21:31,958
I assume that you're about to be.

1322
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,250
Did Eddie die here?

1323
01:21:39,083 --> 01:21:40,500
Uh, yes, he did.

1324
01:21:41,875 --> 01:21:44,416
You said that Eddie
played a role in your lives.

1325
01:21:45,708 --> 01:21:47,958
Why can't his memory play that same role?

1326
01:21:49,625 --> 01:21:51,166
You don't understand.

1327
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:53,541
Of course.

1328
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:55,833
I'm not from here.

1329
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:03,500
I'm gonna go inside.
I have some things to do.

1330
01:22:25,458 --> 01:22:26,583
Can I help you?

1331
01:22:27,291 --> 01:22:29,583
- Brought you a present.
- Oh.

1332
01:22:30,666 --> 01:22:31,583
Thank you.

1333
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:33,333
There was no need.

1334
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:34,750
Of course.

1335
01:22:35,833 --> 01:22:36,958
I'll see you at dinner.

1336
01:23:06,041 --> 01:23:07,625
Right. Mine next.

1337
01:23:08,291 --> 01:23:10,332
Stop!

1338
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:14,082
Predictable, but you can never have
too many pairs of good shoes.

1339
01:23:14,083 --> 01:23:17,875
I will think of you every time
I wear them. Which will be a lot.

1340
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:21,874
The plan is to make you miss us
so terribly that you have to come back.

1341
01:23:21,875 --> 01:23:22,832
- Mmm.
- Oh.

1342
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:25,708
Have you considered not leaving?

1343
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:28,333
College, Oxford, Goldman.

1344
01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:31,207
That was always the plan.

1345
01:23:31,208 --> 01:23:35,874
Okay, well, Vera Wang
planned on being a figure skater.

1346
01:23:35,875 --> 01:23:37,957
Giorgio Armani trained as a doctor.

1347
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:40,957
And Victoria Beckham wanted to be

1348
01:23:40,958 --> 01:23:41,916
a singer.

1349
01:23:43,333 --> 01:23:44,207
Meow!

1350
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:46,041
Right, who is left? Ooh, Tom.

1351
01:23:48,666 --> 01:23:52,415
- Did not know we were to bring gifts.
- It's her birthday party, Tom!

1352
01:23:52,416 --> 01:23:54,833
Right, you have to sing her a song
instead. Come on.

1353
01:23:58,916 --> 01:24:00,582
Right. Um...

1354
01:24:00,583 --> 01:24:01,749
Oh, beautiful...

1355
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:04,333
Antonia told me that Jamie and Eddie

1356
01:24:05,416 --> 01:24:08,666
used to steal
their dad's handmade shoes to wear.

1357
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,832
Apparently...

1358
01:24:12,833 --> 01:24:15,957
Apparently, William knew
they were doing it, but he was

1359
01:24:15,958 --> 01:24:18,583
secretly proud that they liked his style.

1360
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:23,208
I wish I could have met Eddie.

1361
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:25,541
Eddie would have really liked you.

1362
01:24:26,916 --> 01:24:29,125
- Yeah.
- Just don't crowd me.

1363
01:24:32,125 --> 01:24:33,458
Do you ever regret it?

1364
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:36,040
- D?
- Yes, that's it.

1365
01:24:36,041 --> 01:24:37,125
Cecelia!

1366
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:39,665
Do you play? We need some help.

1367
01:24:39,666 --> 01:24:40,999
I do. I'm coming.

1368
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,999
- That was a bit shit.
- Really.

1369
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,625
- Yeah.
- I don't have it.

1370
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:50,833
I could never regret it.

1371
01:24:52,041 --> 01:24:53,624
One chord...

1372
01:24:53,625 --> 01:24:56,040
- Actually...
- Right, what are we playing?

1373
01:24:56,041 --> 01:24:58,207
- Can you...
- Oh yeah. Okay.

1374
01:24:58,208 --> 01:25:00,333
Okay.

1375
01:25:04,041 --> 01:25:09,207
<i>We could have been anything
That we wanted to be</i>

1376
01:25:09,208 --> 01:25:12,165
<i>And that decision was ours...</i>

1377
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:14,500
Yes!

1378
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,790
<i>It's been decided</i>

1379
01:25:16,791 --> 01:25:20,374
<i>- We're weaker divided...</i>
- <i>Ooh, high!</i>

1380
01:25:20,375 --> 01:25:23,750
<i>Let friendship double up our power!</i>

1381
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:33,875
Excuse me.

1382
01:25:36,208 --> 01:25:37,125
Anna?

1383
01:25:40,708 --> 01:25:42,082
How dare you?

1384
01:25:42,083 --> 01:25:43,666
- Jamie?
- William?

1385
01:25:44,708 --> 01:25:46,082
Come on! I really don't--

1386
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:47,957
- What? No... There! Ooh! Aah...
- Ooh! Whoa!

1387
01:25:47,958 --> 01:25:50,040
- Hey! Hey!
- Ha-ha! Ha-ha!

1388
01:25:50,041 --> 01:25:51,000
Oh.

1389
01:25:51,583 --> 01:25:52,915
- I'm so sorry.
- Ah.

1390
01:25:52,916 --> 01:25:54,957
I missed your present opening. We, um...

1391
01:25:54,958 --> 01:25:56,000
We just, um...

1392
01:25:56,541 --> 01:25:57,790
- We got talking.
- Ah...

1393
01:25:57,791 --> 01:25:59,458
- It led to drinking.
- Yes.

1394
01:25:59,958 --> 01:26:01,207
And then we... we finished it.

1395
01:26:01,208 --> 01:26:02,874
- Ah, yes. Look.
- Ah.

1396
01:26:02,875 --> 01:26:04,332
- Hah!
- I mean...

1397
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:06,458
Um...

1398
01:26:06,958 --> 01:26:08,374
So where are the wheels, then?

1399
01:26:08,375 --> 01:26:09,665
- Um...
- Ah...

1400
01:26:09,666 --> 01:26:11,915
- Where are the wheels? Your...
- I think...

1401
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:14,375
I think it might have been
your department, the wheels.

1402
01:26:16,166 --> 01:26:18,791
- You can, yes.
- I think you'd love Taipei!

1403
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:22,707
- No way!
- Yes.

1404
01:26:22,708 --> 01:26:25,166
I do not believe you.

1405
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:29,541
I'd, uh... I'd like to raise a toast.

1406
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:31,000
To Anna.

1407
01:26:32,041 --> 01:26:33,624
- Happy birthday.
- Mmm.

1408
01:26:33,625 --> 01:26:38,958
Thank you for combining
Keats, cars, and Eddie

1409
01:26:39,625 --> 01:26:41,499
to make this evening happen.

1410
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,249
- Cheers!
- Cheers! Wahey!

1411
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:45,250
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

1412
01:26:46,583 --> 01:26:47,916
And, uh...

1413
01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:50,333
to Jamie.

1414
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,291
My... son.

1415
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:56,666
My boy.

1416
01:26:57,833 --> 01:26:59,250
The love

1417
01:27:00,083 --> 01:27:01,208
of my life.

1418
01:27:04,416 --> 01:27:05,875
I, uh...

1419
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:09,666
I would... I... I want to, uh...

1420
01:27:11,208 --> 01:27:12,375
I...

1421
01:27:15,708 --> 01:27:16,708
I'm so sorry.

1422
01:27:21,666 --> 01:27:23,374
Uh... uh...

1423
01:27:23,375 --> 01:27:26,499
- Yes! Uh, yes, yes, yes. To... to Jamie.
- To Jamie.

1424
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:30,083
Cheers. Now, I'd like
to assume the role of Anna's guardian

1425
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:33,125
and ask you, Master Davenport,

1426
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:36,124
what, sir, are your intentions?

1427
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:37,832
- Oh!
- Mmm.

1428
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:39,624
Because, let's be honest,
you were a shagger.

1429
01:27:39,625 --> 01:27:40,582
Oh!

1430
01:27:40,583 --> 01:27:44,249
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You... No. Sorry.
Your mum knows that. Hopefully.

1431
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:46,290
- Of course I knew that.
- Yes. Absolutely.

1432
01:27:46,291 --> 01:27:48,374
Serious, like, more bangs
than Bonfire Night.

1433
01:27:48,375 --> 01:27:51,582
Would shag anything that wasn't
running for a bus. Sometimes that was.

1434
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:55,165
But you seem to have settled down.

1435
01:27:55,166 --> 01:27:58,207
However, I want assurances that

1436
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:00,208
Anna won't find herself alone in

1437
01:28:01,291 --> 01:28:02,666
six months' time.

1438
01:28:17,416 --> 01:28:18,583
Um...

1439
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:27,416
So... Sorry. What's funny?

1440
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:30,082
Charlie, I'm so sorry to disappoint you,

1441
01:28:30,083 --> 01:28:34,040
but if there is one thing
that is absolutely certain,

1442
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:37,458
it's that I will be leaving Anna.

1443
01:28:43,291 --> 01:28:46,707
I have one more year of med school,
and I am gonna keep studying for you.

1444
01:28:46,708 --> 01:28:49,707
Curing incurable diseases
cannot be that hard.

1445
01:28:49,708 --> 01:28:53,165
It might be a bit late for me, Tom,
but I really appreciate the thought.

1446
01:28:53,166 --> 01:28:55,290
Hey, where are
we taking this party to next?

1447
01:28:55,291 --> 01:28:56,749
We are taking you to bed.

1448
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:59,457
You only want one thing,
and from now on, I won't put out.

1449
01:28:59,458 --> 01:29:01,082
- 'Cause I deserve more!
- Thank you.

1450
01:29:01,083 --> 01:29:02,583
- Come on.
- Amazing.

1451
01:29:04,083 --> 01:29:06,000
- Sleep well, Ceci.
- Night, night, darling.

1452
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,166
- See you in the morning.
- See you. Night.

1453
01:29:09,458 --> 01:29:10,332
Um...

1454
01:29:10,333 --> 01:29:13,208
Dad and I might
take another crack at the car,

1455
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:15,166
if that's okay?

1456
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:16,916
No.

1457
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:18,666
No?

1458
01:29:28,708 --> 01:29:29,875
Thank you.

1459
01:29:30,625 --> 01:29:31,833
I love you too.

1460
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,832
- Where were we?
- Right. You.

1461
01:29:46,833 --> 01:29:48,874
- The car!
- And no more messing around.

1462
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:51,000
- No more messing around.
- Because you were the reason...

1463
01:30:13,083 --> 01:30:15,165
<i>Happy birthday, Anna!</i>

1464
01:30:15,166 --> 01:30:17,582
Feliz cumpleaños, mi niña.

1465
01:30:17,583 --> 01:30:20,333
<i>Only two more weeks
until you're back,</i> mi amor.

1466
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:21,750
Yeah.

1467
01:30:23,583 --> 01:30:24,583
<i>What's wrong?</i>

1468
01:30:25,875 --> 01:30:28,791
<i>Okay,</i> necesita hablar conmigo.
Salte, salte.

1469
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:33,833
<i>Okay.</i>

1470
01:30:34,666 --> 01:30:35,541
<i>He's gone.</i>

1471
01:30:36,291 --> 01:30:37,416
<i>Tell me everything.</i>

1472
01:30:38,375 --> 01:30:40,666
I don't know, Mom. I...

1473
01:30:42,416 --> 01:30:44,166
I don't even know how... how to...

1474
01:30:45,291 --> 01:30:46,291
I just... I...

1475
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:51,583
I don't want the same things
that I thought I wanted.

1476
01:30:53,291 --> 01:30:58,125
And I know that I can't afford
to make the wrong choice, but...

1477
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:03,415
I'm staying here.

1478
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:04,375
What?

1479
01:31:05,166 --> 01:31:07,749
What? No! No, no!

1480
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:10,916
Why? No, Anna! No. Why are you
throwing your future away like this?

1481
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,125
<i>No! No!</i>

1482
01:31:20,416 --> 01:31:21,833
See, I knew this would happen.

1483
01:31:23,416 --> 01:31:25,499
- You did?
- Yes, of course!

1484
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,874
Because you're a... a dreamer, Anna!

1485
01:31:27,875 --> 01:31:29,583
I'm sorry, Mom. I just...

1486
01:31:31,083 --> 01:31:32,291
I can't leave.

1487
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:47,125
You never know if a choice you make

1488
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:50,625
is right or wrong until you make it.

1489
01:31:51,625 --> 01:31:53,250
And even then...

1490
01:31:56,291 --> 01:31:57,791
But what matters is that

1491
01:31:58,583 --> 01:31:59,583
they are yours

1492
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:01,500
to make.

1493
01:32:04,958 --> 01:32:06,583
I don't wanna let you down.

1494
01:32:07,083 --> 01:32:07,958
Oh!

1495
01:32:08,625 --> 01:32:09,500
Anna.

1496
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:13,166
I always told you you could do anything.

1497
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:18,583
And I didn't just mean
you are capable of anything.

1498
01:32:19,916 --> 01:32:22,291
I also meant we are here for you,

1499
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,791
no matter what you choose to do.

1500
01:32:29,541 --> 01:32:31,750
Well, it's not perfect, but we--

1501
01:32:34,041 --> 01:32:35,291
Thank you, Mom.

1502
01:32:37,041 --> 01:32:38,541
I will tell them tomorrow that

1503
01:32:39,333 --> 01:32:40,791
I am not taking the job.

1504
01:32:43,041 --> 01:32:44,457
I love you.

1505
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:45,540
<i>- Te quiero.
-</i> Te quiero.

1506
01:32:45,541 --> 01:32:46,458
Bye.

1507
01:32:47,291 --> 01:32:48,458
You're not staying.

1508
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:50,915
- Jamie.
- No, Anna.

1509
01:32:50,916 --> 01:32:53,457
Have you spoken to Cecelia?
There's no future here.

1510
01:32:53,458 --> 01:32:56,832
Well, there's no future guaranteed
anywhere, but here, there's you.

1511
01:32:56,833 --> 01:32:58,665
We agreed, right?

1512
01:32:58,666 --> 01:33:01,375
Yes, I know. Fun, but...

1513
01:33:02,125 --> 01:33:03,915
God! We've moved beyond that, haven't we?

1514
01:33:03,916 --> 01:33:06,166
You can't stay, Anna. I won't let you.

1515
01:33:06,791 --> 01:33:09,875
- You're being ridiculous.
- Stop telling me what I am!

1516
01:33:10,583 --> 01:33:14,332
God, you seem to think
that I'm yours to mold to your ideals,

1517
01:33:14,333 --> 01:33:15,582
but I'm not, Jamie.

1518
01:33:15,583 --> 01:33:16,749
Yes, I know that you're not,

1519
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:20,375
because I would never let you make
such a bloody stupid decision.

1520
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:25,875
What are you doing?

1521
01:33:26,916 --> 01:33:28,541
Now where... where are you going? Where...

1522
01:33:30,333 --> 01:33:31,957
There's a million rooms in this house.

1523
01:33:31,958 --> 01:33:34,083
I'm sure I can find
another place to sleep.

1524
01:34:04,041 --> 01:34:06,207
- Very happily...
- Bye. Yes, of course.

1525
01:34:06,208 --> 01:34:08,375
- Darling, stay...
- Thank you.

1526
01:34:09,291 --> 01:34:11,000
Best of luck back in America.

1527
01:35:29,333 --> 01:35:30,583
Okay, big smile.

1528
01:35:33,333 --> 01:35:34,957
- It's a video, guys.
- That's embarrassing.

1529
01:35:34,958 --> 01:35:36,540
- Oh, Tom.
- No, but it's good.

1530
01:35:36,541 --> 01:35:37,750
Where is Cecelia?

1531
01:35:40,458 --> 01:35:41,916
- It always gets this...
- Yeah.

1532
01:35:44,916 --> 01:35:46,500
I think I have a date tonight.

1533
01:35:47,791 --> 01:35:49,041
Oh my God!

1534
01:35:51,708 --> 01:35:53,916
Oh! You can double-date with me and Tom!

1535
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:59,790
- I would love to.
- Oh, great.

1536
01:35:59,791 --> 01:36:02,082
Anna, do you wanna make it
a triple date tonight?

1537
01:36:02,083 --> 01:36:03,166
Uh, no.

1538
01:36:03,791 --> 01:36:04,666
No.

1539
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:06,875
You still haven't spoken to him?

1540
01:36:07,791 --> 01:36:11,500
I mean, this is insane. You can't just
go back to New York after everything.

1541
01:36:12,083 --> 01:36:14,207
He made it clear
he didn't want me to stay.

1542
01:36:14,208 --> 01:36:17,040
He is in love with you
and doesn't know what he's talking about.

1543
01:36:17,041 --> 01:36:18,249
Mmm.

1544
01:36:18,250 --> 01:36:21,082
<i>Half-light, half-shadow
Let my spirit sleep</i>

1545
01:36:21,083 --> 01:36:23,500
<i>They never learned to love
Who never knew to weep</i>

1546
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:28,750
Tennyson.

1547
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:32,375
Well, I've been listening. They don't
give out degrees here for nothing.

1548
01:36:33,375 --> 01:36:36,999
Right. Time to start drinking.
Who's in for Pimm's? Pimm's?

1549
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,915
Sorry, can't.
Uh, going to see Oxford United.

1550
01:36:39,916 --> 01:36:41,207
A football match?

1551
01:36:41,208 --> 01:36:43,416
It's a date. See you all later.

1552
01:36:46,291 --> 01:36:47,957
So, unicycle to the pub?

1553
01:36:47,958 --> 01:36:50,040
No. Come on, Tom. Come on, Anna!

1554
01:36:50,041 --> 01:36:52,166
Yay!

1555
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,082
Hi.

1556
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:04,791
- Hello, Laura.
- Sorry.

1557
01:37:05,458 --> 01:37:08,124
A student asked me
to set this book for them. Is that okay?

1558
01:37:08,125 --> 01:37:09,041
Yes, of course.

1559
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:38,333
It reads differently now.

1560
01:37:41,625 --> 01:37:43,083
I realized that

1561
01:37:44,458 --> 01:37:45,666
I had it all wrong.

1562
01:37:47,666 --> 01:37:51,458
As you so politely tried to tell me
that first night we went out,

1563
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:56,583
that what Thoreau meant
by living deliberately

1564
01:37:57,583 --> 01:37:59,791
wasn't planning everything, but...

1565
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:04,250
but being definite
about every small moment.

1566
01:38:06,375 --> 01:38:09,291
Because a succession of moments
is really all we have.

1567
01:38:11,958 --> 01:38:14,041
And I want mine to be with you.

1568
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,041
However many we have left.

1569
01:38:22,583 --> 01:38:25,707
You know Thoreau was basically having
a mental breakdown when he wrote that?

1570
01:38:25,708 --> 01:38:27,208
I have learned that, yes.

1571
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,416
Anna, I want this more than anything.

1572
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:38,416
But this is madness.

1573
01:38:41,333 --> 01:38:42,250
I...

1574
01:38:42,833 --> 01:38:44,333
I fear that you'll regret it.

1575
01:38:45,416 --> 01:38:49,166
Well, I'm of the opinion that you should
never regret the things you do.

1576
01:38:50,625 --> 01:38:53,125
You should only regret
the things you don't do.

1577
01:38:58,041 --> 01:38:59,916
- Do you want me to sing?
- Definitely.

1578
01:39:00,791 --> 01:39:02,457
You still owe me that Céline Dion.

1579
01:39:02,458 --> 01:39:03,458
Yeah.

1580
01:39:07,708 --> 01:39:10,041
<i>Here we go again</i>

1581
01:39:11,166 --> 01:39:13,750
<i>Everything is fine</i>

1582
01:39:14,375 --> 01:39:17,125
<i>I guess we could pretend</i>

1583
01:39:17,708 --> 01:39:20,625
<i>We didn't cross a line</i>

1584
01:39:21,375 --> 01:39:24,083
<i>But ever since that day</i>

1585
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,791
<i>Everything has changed</i>

1586
01:39:28,333 --> 01:39:31,000
<i>The way I write your name</i>

1587
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:34,708
<i>The cursive letter A</i>

1588
01:39:35,333 --> 01:39:37,958
<i>Whenever it may be</i>

1589
01:39:38,666 --> 01:39:41,374
<i>That you go on your way</i>

1590
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:45,083
<i>If you really wanna leave</i>

1591
01:39:45,833 --> 01:39:48,749
<i>I'll never make you stay</i>

1592
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:51,916
<i>Whatever you decide</i>

1593
01:39:52,875 --> 01:39:55,666
<i>I will understand</i>

1594
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:58,915
<i>And it will all be fine</i>

1595
01:39:58,916 --> 01:40:03,290
<i>Just go back to being friends</i>

1596
01:40:03,291 --> 01:40:06,915
<i>And love is a kaleidoscope</i>

1597
01:40:06,916 --> 01:40:10,332
<i>How it works I'll never know</i>

1598
01:40:10,333 --> 01:40:13,500
<i>And even all the change</i>

1599
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,125
<i>Is somehow all the same</i>

1600
01:40:17,916 --> 01:40:21,540
<i>Turnin' to the left and right</i>

1601
01:40:21,541 --> 01:40:24,790
<i>Colors shinin' in your eye</i>

1602
01:40:24,791 --> 01:40:27,875
<i>And even upside down</i>

1603
01:40:28,375 --> 01:40:31,957
<i>It's beautiful somehow</i>

1604
01:40:31,958 --> 01:40:35,415
<i>- Every color of the rainbow...</i>
- Jamie.

1605
01:40:35,416 --> 01:40:38,915
<i>- Don't be afraid to hold it close...</i>
- Jamie? Jamie!

1606
01:40:38,916 --> 01:40:42,415
<i>- It's never just a shape alone...</i>
- Jamie! Jamie!

1607
01:40:42,416 --> 01:40:43,416
Jamie?

1608
01:40:44,041 --> 01:40:47,290
- Jamie!
<i>- Love is a</i>

1609
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:51,790
<i>- Kaleidoscope</i>
- God damn it.

1610
01:40:51,791 --> 01:40:52,875
Oh my God.

1611
01:40:53,416 --> 01:40:55,915
Okay. Hey, hey. I'm right here.

1612
01:40:55,916 --> 01:40:57,666
I'm right here. I'm right here.

1613
01:40:58,166 --> 01:40:59,041
I'm right here.

1614
01:41:08,791 --> 01:41:10,500
Well, it's about bloody time!

1615
01:41:13,666 --> 01:41:15,958
I'm... I'm sorry, Ashvin. Uh...

1616
01:41:16,583 --> 01:41:17,416
How is he?

1617
01:41:18,125 --> 01:41:19,916
It's not the result we were hoping for.

1618
01:41:23,416 --> 01:41:25,750
He's fighting
a critical case of pneumonia.

1619
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:29,458
The cancer has severely weakened
his immune system.

1620
01:41:30,833 --> 01:41:34,875
This would be a good time for us
to discuss treatment moving forward.

1621
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:42,625
No. That's up to Jamie.

1622
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:46,165
I think he'd prefer
to let nature take its course,

1623
01:41:46,166 --> 01:41:49,125
and, uh... and we should respect that.

1624
01:41:55,166 --> 01:41:56,250
Thank you.

1625
01:42:55,875 --> 01:42:59,041
Now that you've stayed,
you have time to go on your grand tour.

1626
01:43:03,833 --> 01:43:05,166
We should go together.

1627
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,166
First stop,

1628
01:43:13,583 --> 01:43:14,458
Amsterdam.

1629
01:43:16,333 --> 01:43:18,666
<i>In the heart of the red-light district.</i>

1630
01:43:19,333 --> 01:43:20,833
I'm not that kind of boy.

1631
01:43:23,916 --> 01:43:25,500
<i>There's this church.</i>

1632
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,416
<i>A hidden door leads you to a sanctuary.</i>

1633
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,166
<i>It's so beautiful.</i>

1634
01:43:33,458 --> 01:43:35,083
<i>It would take your breath away.</i>

1635
01:43:53,916 --> 01:43:55,166
<i>And to Paris.</i>

1636
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:00,583
<i>We'll get drunk by the Seine.</i>

1637
01:44:17,958 --> 01:44:19,291
Beautiful, isn't it?

1638
01:44:24,833 --> 01:44:26,041
<i>And Venice.</i>

1639
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:38,041
<i>Spend a night on a gondola.</i>

1640
01:44:45,583 --> 01:44:47,000
Thank you very much.

1641
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:50,333
<i>And we'd go to the Temple of Poseidon.</i>

1642
01:44:51,833 --> 01:44:53,166
<i>High up on a promontory.</i>

1643
01:44:57,583 --> 01:44:59,541
<i>And swim in the Aegean Sea.</i>

1644
01:45:15,583 --> 01:45:17,416
<i>And we would live deliberately.</i>

1645
01:45:19,916 --> 01:45:22,541
<i>Sucking out all the marrow of life.</i>

1646
01:45:30,833 --> 01:45:32,750
<i>No matter how messy it gets.</i>

1647
01:46:56,375 --> 01:46:58,125
Poetry can be taught.

1648
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,916
But, really, it should be lived.

1649
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:04,833
Tried, tested, engaged with.

1650
01:47:06,041 --> 01:47:07,375
Let it in and

1651
01:47:08,583 --> 01:47:10,125
allow it to change your life.

1652
01:47:12,791 --> 01:47:15,333
So, as this is my first class...

1653
01:47:20,083 --> 01:47:22,458
I'd like to begin by offering you a bribe.

1654
01:47:55,625 --> 01:47:57,208
<i>We've been through low</i>

1655
01:47:57,833 --> 01:48:00,833
<i>Been through sunshine
Been through snow</i>

1656
01:48:02,791 --> 01:48:08,041
<i>All the colors of the weather</i>

1657
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:11,416
<i>We've been through high</i>

1658
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,041
<i>Every corner of the sky</i>

1659
01:48:16,458 --> 01:48:21,875
<i>And still we're holdin' on together</i>

1660
01:48:23,541 --> 01:48:26,958
<i>You got all my love</i>

1661
01:48:28,833 --> 01:48:32,957
<i>Whether it rains or pours</i>

1662
01:48:32,958 --> 01:48:36,166
<i>I'm all yours</i>

1663
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:41,041
<i>You've got all my love</i>

1664
01:48:42,666 --> 01:48:46,374
<i>Whether it rains</i>

1665
01:48:46,375 --> 01:48:50,125
<i>It remains</i>

1666
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:55,125
<i>You've got all my love</i>

1667
01:49:12,125 --> 01:49:13,916
<i>Until I die</i>

1668
01:49:14,541 --> 01:49:17,708
<i>Let me hold you if you cry</i>

1669
01:49:19,375 --> 01:49:24,375
<i>Be my one, two, three, forever</i>

1670
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,625
<i>'Cause you got all my love</i>

1671
01:49:31,458 --> 01:49:35,208
<i>Whether it rains or pours</i>

1672
01:49:35,708 --> 01:49:38,708
<i>I'm all yours</i>

1673
01:49:40,125 --> 01:49:43,708
<i>You've got all my love</i>

1674
01:49:45,375 --> 01:49:49,207
<i>Whether it rains</i>

1675
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:53,166
<i>It remains</i>

1676
01:49:54,083 --> 01:49:57,791
<i>You've got all my love</i>

1677
01:50:15,875 --> 01:50:19,375
<i>La-la, la-la, la, lay</i>

1678
01:50:21,041 --> 01:50:25,165
<i>Whether it rains or pours</i>

1679
01:50:25,166 --> 01:50:28,500
<i>I'm all yours</i>

1680
01:50:29,583 --> 01:50:33,166
<i>La-la, la-la, la, lay</i>

1681
01:50:35,375 --> 01:50:39,040
<i>That's all</i>

1682
01:50:39,041 --> 01:50:42,083
<i>All I can say</i>
