What's his job?

14
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,780
According to what Hua Qingzhi said,

15
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,140
he's not in charge of anything.

16
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,460
He only does research

17

The elixir of life?

Hua Qingzhi doesn't know what it is exactly.

20
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,860
Anyway,

21
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,110
it's something related to alchemy and medicine.

He didn't mention

anything about alchemy.

27

Hua Qingzhi said that

28
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,130
Lord of Spring and Lady of Autumn
disagree with each other a lot.

29
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,730
Lord of Spring once said that

30
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,180
what Lady of Autumn does

31
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,180
is unimportant,

32
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,300
but he aims for the bigger picture.

33
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,110
The bigger picture?

34
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,420
Hua Qingzhi worked for Lady of Autumn.

35
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,380
He despised Lord of Spring,

36
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,890
but I think

37
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,890
Lord of Spring can't be this simple.

38
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,400
He is a lord in Four Season Clan.

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,540
He can't be someone

41

alchemy or immortality.

42
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,900
It seems that Four Season Clan
is way more complicated

43

00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,130
I don't get it.

354
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,620
Hua Qingzhi killed Agent Han.

355
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,580
I want him dead as well.

356
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,060
The Services was established
by officials who were in favor of torture.

357
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,100
The only aim was to carry out surveillance

358
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,250
and then frame people up.

359
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,060
So when I took charge of the Services,

360
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,300
I made a rule.

361
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,020
We don't take things personally

362
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,880
or get innocent people involved.

363
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,620
This is the difference

364
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,750
between us and those cruel officials.

365
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:47,770
Yes.

366
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,750
Are you sure it's Xuanwu's Pearl?

367
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,410
Absolutely sure.

368
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,020
The Xuanwu's Pearl from the Ke Tribe

369
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,420
is a tribute to the Court.

370
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,830
It's a contraband item.

371
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,700
Private trading is prohibited.

372
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,980
Four Season Clan spent their money,

373
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,650
sacrificed their spies,

374
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,710
and risked revealing their location

375
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,810
only for this.

376
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,700
The greater good they talked about

377
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,620
must have something to do with this.

378
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,260
Niter is needed when making ice,

379
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,940
medicine, flame sticks,

380
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,330
as well as elixirs.

381
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,570
If it's for ice,

382
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,350
mirabilite also works.

383
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,700
They don't need such high purity.

384
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,340
So,

385
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,180
the other three items

386
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,260
are all possible.

387
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,800
This means that

388
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,900
what Four Season Clan needs

389
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,100
is one of them.

390
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,500
We have to narrow it down.

391
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,130
That's why you are here.

392
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,130
We need to go through them one by one.

393
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,500
Recently,

394
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,220
an old Taoist master came to Luoyang.

395
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,420
He gives lectures on Taoism

396
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,380
every day at Liubai Building.

397
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,180
It is said that

398
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,980
he is a professional in alchemy.

399
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,020
You also know him.

400
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,540
Me?

401
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,460
Who is he?

402
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,420
Lord Liu.

403
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,940
Liu Ran's father.

404
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,830
We'll leave this to you.

405
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,510
I'll check the pharmacies.

406
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,860
I'll work on flame sticks.

407
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,660
See you later.

408
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,020
Don't forget. He is at Liubai Building.

409
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,660
Liu Ran.

410
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,060
Can you go to Liubai Building with me?

411
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,780
Of course.

412
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,420
The weather is great.

413
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,820
It's a nice day for a walk.

414
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,460
Hongyi,

415
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,980
what are we going to do there?

416
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,440
I want to meet your father.

417
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,620
My father?

418
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,570
I spent all of my money

419
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,860
on all these precious ingredients

420
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,890
and finally made this Origin Elixir.

421
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,340
I'm not bragging about this,

422
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,580
but this elixir

423
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,410
is priceless.

424
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,610
If the only focus

425
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,100
is the quality of ingredients,

426
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,860
you won't achieve much in alchemy.

427
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,530
[Liu Shi, Master of the Liu Family]

428
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,670
The timing and temperature

429
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,500
-is more important when making elixirs.
-Father.

430
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,570
Liu Ran.

431
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,250
My lord.

432
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,610
Liu Ran,

433
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,980
I asked the cook

434
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,420
to prepare some desserts you like.

435
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,940
Have some later and see if you like them.

436
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,000
Thank you, father.

437
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,340
I'm here today

438
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,380
for some advice.

439
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,590
My daughter, how's it going recently?

440
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,620
Don't worry.

441
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,980
Hongyi is taking care of me.

442
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,310
Everything is alright.

443
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,050
My lord,

444
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,500
I'm here

445
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,760
for advice on alchemy.

446
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,420
Although Lord Liu
has been practicing Taoism for years,

447
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:43,860
he knows little about alchemy.

448
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,810
I have no idea what alchemy is.

449
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,950
I remember that since I was little,

450
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,750
all the noble people in Luoyang

451
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,970
have been craving elixirs
made by the Liu family.

452
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,580
Your father just said that

453
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,660
timing and temperature

454
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,140
are more important than ingredients.

455
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,620
If other people hear this,

456
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,860
they will laugh at him.

457
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,100
What Lord Liu said

458
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,620
makes sense to me.

459
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,920
As far as I know,

460
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,250
there are hundreds of

461
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,470
existing formulas.

462
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,740
The ingredients are more or less the same,

463
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,500
such as lead, mercury, sulfur,

464
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,370
and cinnabar.

465
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,540
With the same ingredients,

466
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,540
people still make

467
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,790
different elixirs.

468
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,460
Because

469
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,460
the timing and temperature are different.

470
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,170
This is what

471
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,780
my assistants need to care about.

472
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,620
I know nothing about alchemy,

473
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,700
but I guess it's similar

474
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,690
to cooking.

475
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
An excellent cook

476
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,410
can make

477
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,140
great food

478
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,090
using low-quality ingredients.

479
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,770
With the wrong temperature or timing,

480
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,230
even the best ingredients

481
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,060
will turn into trash.

482
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,980
Well said!

483
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,700
Who are you?

484
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,480
This is my son-in-law,

485
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,220
the second son of the Baili Family,

486
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,330
Baili Hongyi.

487
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,290
How can an outsider tell me what to do?

488
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,170
My lord,

489
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,220
thanks for inviting me today.

490
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,570
I'm afraid I have to leave now.

491
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,250
It is Xuanwu's Pearl, indeed.

492
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,060
Ordinary people

493
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,060
won't have access

494
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,140
to any Xuanwu's Pearl this pure!

495
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,790
It should be a tribute to the Court.

496
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,930
Where else

497
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:45,660
can you find it

498
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,860
apart from the Court?

499
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,810
Many elixirs need Xuanwu's Pearl
to enhance their efficacy,

500
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,010
including Nine Turns Golden Elixir,

501
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,660
Lead-mercury Immortality Elixir,

502
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,300
and Golden Cinnabar Elixir.

503
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,530
Give me some time.

504
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,580
They kept a close eye

505
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,460
on their goods.

506
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,980
Apart from exchanging food or medicine,

507
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,620
they hardly

508
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,080
did business with others.

509
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,860
It seemed that they need to arrive

510
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,820
before a certain date.

511
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,980
So they had set off

512
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,490
before the storm ended.

513
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,550
Not long ago,

514
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,210
a caravan came to Luoyang

515
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,330
and smuggled this.

516
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,370
Maybe they heard something.

517
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,020
During my stay in Luoyang,

518
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,080
I visited some friends and heard that

519
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,620
the Taoist Tiantong in Yuncui Temple

520
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,530
was making the elixir of life.

521
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,620
What he needed

522
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,570
was the purest Xuanwu's Pearl.

523
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,530
Yuncui Temple?

524
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,420
I've been there before.
