If I don't read these archives,

348
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,820
how can I outdo the Interior Guard Services

What a noble cause.

351

Leave after you finish eating, alright?

520
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,700
Yes.

521
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:35,820
Back then

522
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,860
when you were an official at the Unwelcome Well,

523
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,870
you let me go once.

524
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,830
You also took care of me for the past few years.

525
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,500
Even though I am poor,

526
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,500
at least I know to be grateful.

527
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,500
Well…

528
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,790
Since you're in a tight situation now,

529
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,650
why don't you crash here tonight?

530
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,300
I can go anywhere.

531
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,540
Right.

532
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,990
Yao has always

533
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,180
kept a room for you.

534
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,980
It's just that you don't care...

535
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,910
If you ask me,

536
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,820
you should join me in scamming people.

537
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,740
I'll take care of you.

538
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,140
We will earn money together

539
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,260
and eat together.

540
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,260
Just don't

541
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,340
commit anymore murders, okay?

542
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,820
Join you in scamming others?

543
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,680
Selling fake wine to scam people?

544
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,900
What are you saying?

545
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,340
What fake wine?

546
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,070
I just think that the restaurents

547
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,270
are charging too much

548
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,420
for the wine they sell.

549
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,620
So I'm giving them a little punishment.

550
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,140
Protecting the citizens. Bringing justice.

551
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,500
Whatever. Sit down.

552
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,260
I'm here to ask you something.

553
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,180
What?

554
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,380
Your ancestors were

555
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,660
Tang's waterway distributors of Mount Lian , right?

556
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,830
You must have in-depth knowledge

557
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,160
of the capital's waterway distribution.

558
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,110
You've come to the right person.

559
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,310
Back then.

560
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,230
The prestigious carpenter, Yuwen Kai,

561
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,230
oversaw the whole project

562
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,850
and drafted a water-way map.

563
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,270
That map included

564
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,180
the flow and directions of

565
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:03,200
the capital's three rivers and seventeen streams.

566
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,740
However, it's a shame.

567
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,940
The map went missing a long time ago.

568
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,870
Fine.

569
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,180
I have one here.

570
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,950
The copper for the Heaven project

571
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,860
is transported from Mount Lian

572
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,520
to the capital via waterways.

573
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:28,750
Tell me.

574
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,540
Where along the waterway

575
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,420
would it be easiest to pull off a heist?

576
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,350
A heist?

577
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:52,950
Officer.

578
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,280
These lads are new.

579
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,050
They can't wait to start work.

580
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,470
Open the door!

581
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,360
Thank you, master.

582
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:04,980
Keep up!

583
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,700
Master, the people are here.

584
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,680
All of you here!

585
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,940
Move the stones!

586
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,940
The rest of you

587
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:22,980
carry the timber over there!

588
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,400
Move! Work diligently!

589
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,340
What are you looking at?

590
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,180
Go quickly!

591
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,260
Bingzhu.

592
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,260
What did I owe you

593
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,860
-in my past life?
-You two, go quickly!

594
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,670
Why am I

595
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,840
doing this for you?

596
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,110
That guy was pretty strong.

597
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,980
Why is it so long?

598
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,820
Don't break that.

599
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,420
Be careful.

600
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,310
Alright.

601
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,360
Come.

602
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,540
Move this over there.

603
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,600
Those two corners.

604
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,790
Are you in charge of the copper?

605
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,710
You are?

606
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,420
I was sent by the higher-ups.

607
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,220
to oversee the project.

608
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,030
Sir.

609
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,830
Keep it down.

610
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,740
Let me ask you.

611
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,660
When will the next batch of copper

612
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,390
be transported to the capital?

613
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,820
This...

614
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,980
I see you've encountered some problems.

615
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,980
If the whole project

616
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,380
was delayed because of the copper,

617
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,230
then you would punished severely

618
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,690
for angering the empress.

619
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,020
I wouldn't dare.

620
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,739
The higher-ups have been

621
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:16,780
telling us to go faster for the past month.

622
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,739
Don't worry, sir.

623
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:18,780
The latest batch of copper

624
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,780
will be arriving at midnight today.

625
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,620
However,

626
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,380
the last few batches of copper

627
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,380
lack pureness.

628
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:27,949
Therefore production has been

629
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:28,860
reduced.

630
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,780
This is not our fault.

631
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,139
Whose ships are in charge of the transport?

632
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,350
Chuiliu Corporation from the Baili Family.

633
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,659
Chuiliu Corporation?

634
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,030
Bingzhu.

635
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,900
Bingzhu?

636
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,060
Bingzhu?

637
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,420
Bingzhu?

638
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:48,940
Keep it down.

639
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,380
Let me tell you something.

640
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,980
I'll drink some water first.

641
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,420
I was shocked.

642
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,940
You didn't see it.

643
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,540
Even though the building called Heaven
is only half-way done,

644
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,740
it looks phenomenal.

645
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,740
It is remarkable.

646
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,940
And... What other adjectives are there?

647
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,100
It's extraordinary!

648
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,030
Get to the point.

649
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,260
Right.

650
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,340
I found out about transport ship

651
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,860
that's transporting copper from Mount Lian .

652
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,520
The Chuiliu Corporation from the Baili Family.

653
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,580
Not only that,

654
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,380
the people at the smelter told me

655
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,660
that the purity of this batch of copper

656
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,340
was not as before.

657
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,990
I knew something's wrong with the copper.

658
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,080
What can go wrong with copper?

659
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,470
When will the ship from Mount Lian

660
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,730
arrive at the capital?

661
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,420
Midnight tonight.

662
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,620
Where would it be best to make a move?

663
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,420
You have come to the right person.

664
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,260
The capital

665
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,260
is surrounded by rivers and streams.

666
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,380
The waterway leads to six other rivers.

667
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,260
But there are only three

668
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,860
that connect to the Yihe River.

669
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,500
One of the rivers is too long,

670
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,500
too risky.

671
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,180
Another is too calm.

672
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,940
Where is the last one?

673
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,340
Dragon Gate.

674
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,860
Bingzhu?

675
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,860
You... You really want to

676
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,190
rob the quarry?

677
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,680
You can't do that. Bingzhu.

678
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,980
Robbing the government's quarry

679
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,180
is a capital offense.

680
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,220
You'll be beheaded.

681
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,310
Furthermore,

682
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,120
you need to pass by the gate to Dragon Gate.

683
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,070
Your wanted posters

684
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:39,860
are still all over the place.

685
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,120
The guards will be checking everything.

686
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,500
Fine. If you really want to die,

687
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,630
don't drag me along.

688
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,840
[Imperial Medical Bureau]

689
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,880
My mother was terribly sick that day.

690
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,140
I couldn't leave her.

691
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,780
I hope you'll forgive me

00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,830

[Ren He Fang]

Be diligent.

696
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,040
Check everything.

697
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,420
Hold it!

698
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,540
Officer.

699
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,620
What do you have here?

700
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,220
Officer.

701
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,870
It's wine from the Western Province.

702
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,860
This much much wine?

703
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,100
Where are you bringing this to?

704
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,580
Some ministers

705
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,940
are throwing a hunting party outside the city.

706
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,860
They want us to send some wine over

707
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,940
to liven up the party.

708
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,260
These ministers really how to enjoy themselves.

709
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,700
Hunting and partying.

710
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,980
Poor us.

711
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,580
Doing all the grunt work.

712
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,220
It is indeed unfair.

713
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,220
Open it.

714
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,550
Officer.

715
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,140
If I open it,

716
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,580
the wine will lose its fragrance.

717
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,380
It'll be hard for me to sell them.

718
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,040
At least you're smart.

719
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,380
Let them pass!

720
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,590
Thank you, officer.

721
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,820
Let's go!

722
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,950
Be diligent.

Yes sir!

Are you alright?

727
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,060
In order to send you out here,

728
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,920
I prepared three barrels of wine.

729
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,820
Leave the cart. We will take the horses.

730
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,000
But they cost me a fortune.

731
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,020
How unfortunate!

732
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,200
Compensate me for the wine!

733
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,160
Over there.

It's not too late to turn back.

741
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,500
You're robbing the government's quarry.

742
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,590

743

Quick! Hurry up!

Make sure they are secured!

It's fishy. It's fishy.
