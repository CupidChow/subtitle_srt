00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,360
her arthritis came back.

143
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,200
I sent her to the clinic this morning.

144
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,320
What did the doctor say?

145
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,840
It's a chronic condition. She needs to rest.

146
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,080
Don't worry.

147
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,050
The syrup is not crystallized yet.

148
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,420
These Qiongguo candies

149
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,400
must've been freshly made.

150

151
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,730
I've got some that are ready to eat.

152

I'll pack some for you.

153
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,700
I meant to ask...

154
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,650
-I can assure you...
-Do you know...

155
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,360
I bet the candies taste bitter.

156
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,920
Mother used to tell me over and over again

157
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,780
that you need to fully toast the sesame seeds

158
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,720
before putting them in the syrup.

159
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,400
Otherwise, the candy will taste bitter.

160
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,480
It's bitter, indeed.

161
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,409
Your mother is getting old.

162
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:59,420
She's forgotten about

163
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,050
toasting sesame seeds.

164
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,890
Try it.

165
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,440
You'd better rate it 'Satisfactory'

166
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,080
to cheer my mother up.

167
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,530
When I first met him,

168
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,010
he rated a lamb soup shop

169
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,960
'Satisfactory.'

170
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,800
He's the top gourmand in the capital.

171
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,010
He has to live up to the reputation.

172
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,240
You can ask any questions.

173
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,720
Officer Wang is on our side.

174
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,110
You can be candid.

175
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,760
This Qiongguo candy is a tad bitter, indeed.

176
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,570
Right. Have a seat.

00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:28,410
Please.

179
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,240
I think he wanted to get back together with me.

180
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,559
It must've been hard

181
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,240
for him to come here.

182
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,799
However, I kept thinking about my uncle

183
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,000
and my father-in-law.

184
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,010
I don't know how to face him.

185
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,640
Therefore, I didn't meet him.

186
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,160
Siyue,

187
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,720
do you think I made a mistake?

188
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,890
Of course, not.

189
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,970
This case is complicated.

190
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,320
You didn't do anything wrong.

191
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,360
Stop blaming yourself!

192
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,940
Maybe you should invite him over

193
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,920
and explain everything.

194
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,720
Then, perhaps you'll work things out.

195
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,650
He's gone out since morning.

196
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,730
I don't know where to find him.

197
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,500
Perhaps, he's just gone for a walk

198
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,480
and will come back soon.

199
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,210
Shen Fei is with him. Don't worry.

200
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,200
Shen Fei?

201
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,080
But Shen Fei wasn't with him

202
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,920
when he went out this morning.

203
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,130
Siyue,

204
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:21,980
will anything

205
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,000
happen to him?

206
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,730
Don't worry just yet!

207
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,640
I'll send someone to find out.

208
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,240
An arsenal?

209
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,220
You didn't know?

210
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,120
Why would I know?

211
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,290
Where is it?

212
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,400
Who built it?

213
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,080
How is that even possible?

214
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,700
If someone did

215
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,120
build an arsenal in the Unwelcome Well,

216
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,570
then, the situation would be out of our hands.

217
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,840
If that's the case,

218
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,200
the only option is to report to the authorities.

219
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,400
Stop!

220
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,850
You can't do that.

221
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,840
You didn't know. You're not an accomplice.

222
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,170
I am not thinking about myself.

223
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,050
If there is an arsenal here,

224
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:13,930
and they carry out an investigation,

225
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,680
the Unwelcome Well will be ruined forever.

226
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,000
The authorities will sort things out.

227
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:18,800
Don't you worry!

228
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:27,680
Gao Bingzhu,

229
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,260
I think the two of us

230
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,120
should deal with it.

231
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,900
Don't you ever forget

232
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,680
that you used to be one of us!

233
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,600
If you go to the authorities,

234
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,680
all the folks in the Unwelcome Well

235
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,480
will die.

236
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,580
If I don't go,

237
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,080
it'll lead to disastrous chaos.

238
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,610
If someone did

239
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,760
build an arsenal here...

240
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,200
Let me reiterate.

241
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,880
It will be out of our hands.

242
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,320
Let's go.

243
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,600
Don't just look!

244
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,400
Take him inside.

245
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:12,960
Ma'am,

246
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,080
[Sui Xin, Interior Guard]

247
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,060
the wanted poster

248
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,680
is done.

249
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,760
Please take a look.

250
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,130
Go find out

251
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,160
where Baili Hongyi is now.

252
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,200
Yes, ma'am.

253
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,110
[Wanted]

254
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,440
Yuan Fei?

255
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,240
He's always around my uncle.

256
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,940
He's awfully mysterious

257
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,730
and quiet.

258
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,850
I've always found him strange.

259
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,040
Since your uncle died,

260
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,320
he's been at large.

261
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,120
We're going to apprehend him.

262
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,600
What do you know

263
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,730
about this person?

264
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,160
He is...

265
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,560
My uncle

266
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,880
gave him a house.

267
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,130
A house?

268
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,520
Rope!

269
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,400
Here.

270
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,880
Baili Hongyi is stubborn.

271
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,320
We'll put up an act to shut him up

272
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,880
in case he suspects me in the future.

273
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,160
Bingzhu, I thought you were...

274
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,210
What's done is done.

275
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,200
We can't run away from it.

276
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,960
We can only count on ourselves

277
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,200
to deal with the arsenal.

278
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,120
I'll do as you say.

279
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,420
In fact, I've already

280
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,160
found the arsenal.

281
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,160
It's near Kunjia Rocks.

282
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,880
However, it's heavily guarded.

283
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,400
We need to find another way in.

284
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,330
Okay.

285
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,880
There are tunnels for jade mining in that area.

286
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,640
We can go in through them.

287
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,160
Let's go.

288
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:22,760
Okay.

289
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:44,480
Search!

290
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,560
Ma'am,

291
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,400
it's empty.

292
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,920
We found a secret chamber.

293
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,760
Careful, Bingzhu.

294
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:31,720
Bingzhu,

295
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,040
will we make it?

296
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,600
Why don't we go back for reinforcements?

297
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,520
No need.

298
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,200
It'll make us an easier target.

299
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,200
Let's go.

300
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,280
What's wrong?

301
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:43,720
The walls are caving in.

302
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,400
People died due to the cave-in

303
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,760
at Kunjia Rocks last year.

304
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,400
This is the only tunnel left.

305
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,480
What? Scared?

306
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,680
If the walls did cave in,

307
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,050
we wouldn't be able to run away.

308
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,040
There's no point being scared.

309
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,720
The Unwelcome Well is formed with ancient rocks.

310
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,360
There had never been a cave-in.

311
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,120
How come it suddenly happened last year?

312
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,160
Do you think

313
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,360
it has something to do with the arsenal?

314
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,280
Maybe.

315
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,320
This way.

316
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,080
Bingzhu.

317
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,640
Bingzhu, we're almost there.

318
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,360
Bingzhu,

319
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,680
on second thought,

320
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,960
this is very dangerous.

321
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,240
Are we putting ourselves at risk

322
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,440
going in there unprepared?

323
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,030
Let's go back

324
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,400
and make a plan, shall we?

325
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,200
No, time is tight.

326
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,840
There's no time for plans.

327
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,400
Let's go and find out.

328
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,440
Bingzhu,

329
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,400
what's behind the arsenal

330
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,520
must be complicated.

331
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,520
Besides, you're a wanted man.

332
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,240
Just stay out of it!

333
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,000
Your mother...

334
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,600
Have you thought about her?

335
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,280
She's old and weak.

336
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,960
You need to take care of her.

337
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:18,860
She might be okay without me,

338
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,080
but she can't live without you.

339
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,040
Leave this to me.

340
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,520
I swear to you on my life

341
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,320
that I will keep the Unwelcome Well safe.

342
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,120
Just do as I say.

343
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:36,640
Go back.

344
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,760
But the copper used by the arsenal

345
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:43,930
is most likely

346
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,760
smuggled by Liu Xiang from the Copper Mine.

347
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,280
It means the Four Season Clan is involved.

348
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,680
You know that

349
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,400
I've been looking for the Clan for five years.

350
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,600
Only by finding the Clan

351
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,610
will I be able to find the murderer

352
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,680
and avenge Xiaowu's death.

353
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,070
I can't miss this opportunity.

354
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,200
I'll go first.

355
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,200
If anything happens...

356
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:08,720
Dengcheng,

357
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,800
our top priority is to stay alive.

358
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,840
At least one of us

359
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,440
should go out alive.

360
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,040
Come.

361
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,010
Other than this chamber,

362
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:42,860
the scrolls and documents in other rooms

363
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,720
have all been moved away.

364
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,560
It's likely that Yuan Fei has been killed.

365
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:47,560
Killed?

366
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:56,910
If he was killed,

367
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,200
none of these would be left here.

368
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,560
But if he wanted to run away,

369
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,590
he would pack some valuables.

370
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,000
What do you mean?

371
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,040
Even though Liu Xiang is dead,

372
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,280
Yuan Fei must still have other missions.

373
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:10,640
Send my order.

374
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,880
Search the entire city.

375
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes, ma'am.

376
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,200
Forgive me, Bingzhu.

377
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,079
I'll make up for my wrongdoings in the future.

378
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,230
You can yell at me or beat me!

379
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,240
I'll even kneel to you.

380
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,240
However, you need to do as I say today.

381
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,600
Keep yourself alive!

382
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:29,840
Wang Dengcheng!

383
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,200
It's you who betrayed the Unwelcome Well.

384
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,400
Have you no conscience at all?

385
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,240
Bingzhu,

386
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,280
the arsenal is right beneath the Unwelcome Well.

387
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,350
If you go to the authorities,

388
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,880
all the folks here will be killed.

389
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:41,640
Understood?

390
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,160
Are you threatening me?

391
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,440
I'm talking sense into you.

392
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,040
For the sake of the Unwelcome Well,

393
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,200
your only option is to work with me.

394
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,450
Don't you want all your friends

395
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,320
to leave the Unwelcome Well?

396
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,080
This is the best opportunity.

397
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,640
What opportunity?

398
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,920
Colluding with outsiders

399
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,840
and bringing chaos to the Unwelcome Well?

400
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,120
Bingzhu,

401
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,280
you led us to fight with our lives

402
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,960
and guard the capital back then.

403
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,120
Look where that got you!

404
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,400
You're not welcomed by the Unwelcome Well.

405
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,580
There are wanted posters of you

406
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,320
all over the capital.

407
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,450
I am the only one

408
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,840
that still cares about your life.

409
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,610
I think of you as my brother.

410
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,560
Will I ever harm you?

411
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,210
Still, I can't watch you

412
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,000
drag the Unwelcome Well down into the abyss.

413
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,130
I still need to avenge

414
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,360
the death of Xiaowu and others.

415
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,600
Bingzhu, listen to me!

416
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,360
I know

417
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,660
you've always wanted

418
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,560
to catch the murderer.

419
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,400
I promise you.

420
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,560
Join me in the Clan,

421
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,650
and I will bring

422
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,480
the murderer to you.

423
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,960
You and I,

424
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,640
let's avenge Xiaowu together.

425
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,090
What do you say?

426
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:43,870
My lord.

427
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,320
My lord.

428
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,750
My lord.

429
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,600
Weren't there two people?

430
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,480
We've sent people to catch the other one.

431
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,880
I just talked him into joining the Clan.

432
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,130
[Song Liang, Minister of War]

433
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,400
Gao Bingzhu.

434
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,120
Lord Song.

435
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,600
Someone!

436
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,400
Tie him up!

437
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,560
It was you!

438
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,320
Surprised?

439
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,200
Indeed.

440
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,880
Sir, a secret letter for you.

441
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,000
Copper was found at the Liu Mansion.

442
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,390
Please, sir, come to the Liu Mansion

443
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,710
and get details from the Ministry of War.

444
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,480
Prepare a carriage.

445
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,040
I'm going to the Liu Mansion.

446
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,680
It was you that found out about Riverside Resort.

447
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,080
It was also you

448
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,920
that found out about the arsenal
 under the Unwelcome Well.

449
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,000
I didn't expect you to be this capable.

450
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,530
I admire someone like you.

451
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,670
I am mortified.

452
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,030
I did all this

453
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,280
only for revenge.

454
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,280
Revenge...

455
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,400
I can help you with that.

456
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,360
Rest assured.

457
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,120
I've learned about

458
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,470
what you've been through.

459
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,640
It's just that you are now

460
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,120
blinded by hatred.

461
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,720
Yet, you don't even know

462
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,040
where the hatred came from.

463
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,600
Let me tell you something.

464
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,920
Your enemy

465
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,850
is the evil Empress

466
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,040
who's caused all the injustice.

467
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,720
Don't you want to

468
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,680
fight your way to the Empress

469
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,440
and confront her on behalf of

470
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,200
your deceased friends?

471
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,430
They're all citizens of the capital.

472
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,080
Why are the lives of the Well officers

473
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,360
worth nothing to her?

474
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,800
Lord Song, what are you saying?

475
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,960
You were a lowborn

476
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,440
with no one to support you,

477
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,440
and yet you've been fighting against the Clan.

478
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,830
How courageous you are!

479
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,360
I admire that.

480
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,630
Therefore, I want to tell you that

481
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,120
we are about to

482
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,440
achieve the greater good.

483
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,800
As long as

484
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,430
you're willing to join the Clan

485
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,360
and help me along the way,

486
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,200
you'll have all the fortune

487
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,920
in the great capital.

488
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,150
Lord Song,

489
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,960
is it so easy for you

490
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,960
to achieve the greater good?

491
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,120
The Empress spies on us
 via the Intelligence Services

492
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,560
and commits misdeeds
 via the Interior Guard Services.

493
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,120
The former is now shattered.

494
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,760
Once we destroy the Interior Guard Services,

495
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,840
I can then send out an army

496
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,590
to kill the Empress.

497
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,910
Destroying the Interior Guard Services?

498
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,760
I think that by now,

499
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:08,930
the interior guards

500
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,600
are about to lose their leader.

501
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:36,910
What are you doing here?

502
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,790
Come back! Stay inside.

503
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,120
Sir, the message from Lord Song

504
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,430
has been sent to the Interior Guard Services.

505
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,050
This is the only route

506
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,720
for Wu Youjue to get to the Liu Mansion.

507
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,560
For the greater good,

508
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,430
we've got to kill him today.

509
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,160
Yes, sir.

510
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,600
Are you still mulling?

511
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,320
I only told you all this

512
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,950
because I think you can be of use.

513
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,030
If you don't want to listen,

514
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,440
then...

515
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:25,940
I don't see the need

516
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,110
to waste my time with you.

517
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,800
Since the Clan has made plans

518
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,550
to destroy the Interior Guard Services,

519
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,370
I don't think

520
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,870
they will be able to turn the tides.

521
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,990
I do have a request, though.

522
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,210
Since you know

523
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,420
I've been looking for

524
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,830
the murderer with the halberd,

525
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,950
I'd like to ask you to hand him over

526
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,880
at my disposal.

527
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,950
I suppose

528
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,560
you'll do this for me, right?

529
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,280
Okay.

530
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,280
One shall let go of the trifles
 for the greater good

531
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,230
and focus on the big picture.

532
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,450
As long as you help me

533
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,640
achieve the greater good,

534
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,440
I'll leave that murderer at your disposal.

535
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,920
Deal.

536
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,600
Deal.

537
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,000
I, Gao Bingzhu,

538
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,590
will be at your service from now on, my lord,

539
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,510
and achieve the greater good with you.

540
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,320
Mix the best copper from Mount Lian Copper Mine

541
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,110
with liquid iron,

542
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,000
and you'll get

543
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,070
incredibly sharp blades.

544
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,760
Be it the Dragon Force

545
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,120
or the Phoenix Force,

546
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,150
neither of them has weapons

547
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,160
as great as what I have here.

548
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,680
I'll use these blades

549
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,910
to kill that evil Empress,
 who murdered her son and husband,

550
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,990
and made people's life miserable.

551
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,590
Today, I will bring her to justice.

552
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,350
Kill them!

553
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,890
-Kill them!
-Charge!

554
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,920
-Kill them!
-Charge!

555
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,680
-Kill them!
-Charge!

556
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:46,960
My lord!

557
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:47,600
My lord!

558
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,280
Leave!

559
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,480
Why are you so late?

560
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,170
Weren't you worried

561
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,160
that I didn't get your hint?

562
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,990
Greetings, Baili Hongyi.

563
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,000
Your name precedes you.

564
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,360
Where is my mother?

565
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,550
She's out.

566
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,790
Due to recent sudden weather change,

567
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,200
her arthritis came back.

568
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,040
I sent her to the clinic this morning.

569
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,630
The Qiongguo candies are freshly made.

570
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,730
How could she be sent

571
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,720
to the clinic in the morning?

572
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,120
The syrup is not crystallized yet.

573
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,310
These candies

574
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,680
must've been freshly made.

575
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,550
If you like those,

576
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,800
I've got some that are ready to eat.

577
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,670
I'll pack some for you.

578
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,990
Mother used to tell me over and over again

579
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,050
that you need to fully toast the sesame seeds

580
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:29,750
before putting them in the syrup.

581
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,200
It's bitter.

582
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,730
Your mother is getting old.

583
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,200
Gao Bingzhu never complains about food.

584
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:38,640
Here.

585
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,160
Try it.

586
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,560
You'd better rate it 'Satisfactory'

587
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,350
to cheer my mother up.

588
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,640
It doesn't taste bitter at all.

589
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,630
When I first met him,

590
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,200
he rated a lamb soup shop

591
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,240
'Satisfactory.'

592
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:56,770
Gao Bingzhu knows

593
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,960
that I've never rated any lamb soup.

594
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,680
You can ask any questions.

595
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,160
Officer Wang is on our side.

596
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,280
You can be candid.

597
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,630
He said all the wrong things

598
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:05,650
to remind me

599
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,560
that Wang Dengcheng is suspicious.

600
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,960
This Qiongguo candy is a tad bitter, indeed.

601
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,310
You can't go to the authorities.

602
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,520
You didn't know.

603
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:13,760
You're not an accomplice.

604
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,240
I am not thinking about myself.

605
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,930
If there is an arsenal here,

606
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:17,810
and they carry out an investigation,

607
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,600
the Unwelcome Well will be ruined forever.

608
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,060
If I don't go,

609
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,470
it'll lead to disastrous chaos.

610
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,580
Gao Bingzhu

611
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,680
didn't want me to go to the authorities.

612
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,160
He's giving me hints.

613
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:29,790
Let's go.

614
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,240
In fact, I've already found the arsenal.

615
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,240
It's near Kunjia Rocks.

616
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,150
It's the Workmen's knot.

617
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,830
Workmen's knot?

618
00:27:59,180 --> 00:27:59,520
Yes.

619
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,950
I invented this knot.

620
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,200
Gao Bingzhu saw it once.

621
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,030
I'm surprised he learned how to do it.

622
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,800
He knew you could untie it,

623
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,730
so he tied a Workmen's knot

624
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,560
so that you could get out.

625
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,520
Gao Bingzhu did all this

626
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,680
to deceive Wang Dengcheng.

627
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,280
He was suspicious of Wang Dengcheng.

628
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,240
Wang Dengcheng?

629
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,680
Is he linked with whoever's behind all this?

630
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,550
I suspect

631
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,800
it's someone from the Ministry of War.

632
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,000
Ministry of War?

633
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,750
I think Liu Xiang stole copper

634
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,230
from the Copper Mine to make weapons.

635
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,440
I could only take a glance.

636
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,350
I didn't see them clearly,

637
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,690
but the weapons they made

638
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,240
were similar to those at the Ministry of War.

639
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,350
I think they're using the same molds.

640
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,640
Someone that commands an army

641
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,200
and can make use of these weapons...

642
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,360
-Song Liang.
-Song Liang.

643
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,680
If that's true,

644
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,870
I'm afraid he's planning a coup.

645
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:47,880
I need a favor.

646
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:48,870
What?

647
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,520
Don't bring chaos to the Unwelcome Well.

648
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,080
My lord.

649
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:25,640
Over here.

650
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,330
Shoot!

651
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,530
Go!

652
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,860
It's a trap! Retreat!

653
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,610
Ma'am.

654
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:33,770
Where is Sir Wu?

655
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,170
Ministry of War sent a message,

656
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,530
saying they've found copper

657
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,490
inside the Liu Mansion.

658
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,930
He's about to go there and check.

659
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:40,690
Oh, no!

660
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,290
Brother!

661
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,970
Song Liang is suspicious.

662
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,700
Don't move!

663
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,380
Don't move! Stay down!

664
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,090
Gao Bingzhu!

665
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,690
Come here!

666
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,250
Get Song Liang!

667
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:49,520
It's okay.

668
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:49,950
Go!

669
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:50,410
That way.

670
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,090
Stop!

671
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,370
Song Liang,

672
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,580
you're bound to lose.

673
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,650
What's the point of fighting us?

674
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,409
Fighting?

675
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,449
I've fought wars all my life.

676
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,290
I'm not afraid of losing.

677
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,610
We're about to achieve the greater good.

678
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,250
I'll die without regrets.

679
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,020
You evil Empress!

680
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,889
Listen up!

681
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,730
I'll wait for you in hell!

682
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,370
Baili Hongyi!

683
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,260
Baili Yan, the Minister of Works,

684
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,940
had always been dedicated and selfless.

685
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,290
Why did you kill him?

686
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,530
He chose the wrong side

687
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,170
and insisted on serving the evil Empress.

688
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,409
He got in our way to the greater good,

689
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,050
so he had to die.

690
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,550
I don't care about the evil Empress

691
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,090
or the greater good.

692
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,130
I just want to know

693
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,120
why you killed

694
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,970
my father

695
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,090
just for your own good.

696
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,890
Your father?

697
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,450
Your father was nothing

698
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,450
but a tiny slug to me.

699
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,330
He got in the way,

700
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,090
so I killed him.

701
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:12,850
Baili Hongyi,

702
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:14,450
put down the knife.

703
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,610
Do you have the guts to kill me now?

704
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,210
Kill me.

705
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,450
Kill me to avenge the death of your father.

706
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,010
Do it, I dare you!

707
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,490
I dare you!

708
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,090
Come on, kill me!

709
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,050
Do it! Come on!
