00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,940
This case has been declared as

525
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,100
Baili Yan's corruption.

526
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,090
With such declaration,

527
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,340
the Intelligence Services is innocently involved.

528
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,740
Not exactly innocently.

529
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,070
We did have our faults.

530
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,860
The empress holding us responsible is sensible.

531
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,720
It's just that…

532
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,070
I'm still worrying about that matter.

533
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,340
Whether it's the informer and his daughter being killed,

534
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,820
or the copper being swapped,

535
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,080
those people have a way

536
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,030
to avoid the Intelligence Services' watching eyes.

537
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,980
What you mean is…

538
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,230
The Intelligence Services

539
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,140
does have a spy.

540
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,340
I'm just doing based on the signals given.

541
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,270
Then what about this token?

542
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,560
This is given by my boss

543
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,110
for the purpose of trading.

544
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,500
Gao Bingzhu?

545
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,310
You're not dead?

546
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,620
I thought that night…

547
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:45,940
I've been looking for you.

548
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,600
Do you know?

549
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,860
You've been looking for me,

550
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,460
or you've been out scamming?

551
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,420
You heartless man.

552
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,460
I was even looking for you.

553
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,700
Fine. As long as you're not dead.

554
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,510
What are you doing with this wooden talisman?

555
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,040
You recognize this talisman?

556
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,180
Isn't this the talisman for trading

557
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,310
at the black market?

558
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,090
The black market?

559
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,840
Right. This is the one.

560
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,060
The black market

561
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,060
has a variety of expensive goods,

562
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,980
so their trade is done cautiously.

563
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,140
This wooden talisman is small and unique.

564
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,200
Even if it's found,

565
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,880
you can say it's an accessory.

566
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,130
The patterns on the talisman

567
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,940
looks like coming from the Chuiliu Corporation.

568
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,380
Chuiliu Corporation again.

569
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,490
Looks like I have to go there again.

570
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,620
You are a wanted man.

571
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,620
Don't wander around, can you?

572
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,370
When you go alone,

573
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,440
please be careful.

574
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,140
Your beautiful long hair

575
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
is more vibrant than a young lady's.

576
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,420
Such beauty...

577
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,280
makes people jealous.

578
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,580
The way I see it,

579
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,780
your face looks prettier than before.

580
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,060
Words from your mouth

581
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:26,020
have always been music to my ears.

582
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,420
Your Majesty.

583
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,020
Your Majesty.

584
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,980
This is from Duke of Mount Wind.

585
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,580
A copper mirror from Persia.

586
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,580
It's made of pure copper.

It's clear as day.

589
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,100
Duke of Mount Wind usually

590
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,320
saves all the good things to himself.

591
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,180
At such moment,

592
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,180
he's finally willing to take it out.

594
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,240

595

Her Majesty does not want to see you.

596
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,940
Please go back.

600
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,300
Hello?

there?

Where is it?

There's nobody here.

606

Why aren't there anyone here?

Nothing.

No...

Is this a place you should be?

Go.

627
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,960
I'm worried that I'll be involved in.

What hair oil do you use?

00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,080
Osmanthus oil.

633
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,300
Every year during Osmanthus season,

634
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,300

639
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,719
Why are you asking about this?

640
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:10,340
I'm looking for a person

641

who uses this type of oil.

642
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,659
I know this tulip oil.

643
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,469
But this oil is very costly,

644
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,020
so usually the shops won't have them.

645
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,300
Normally the buyers will make their order

646
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,940
and it will be sent to them when the stock arrives.

647
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,780
Do you know

648

Quick, say.

655
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:53,340
There is something wrong with Chuiliu Corporation.

656
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,400
Their cashier said

657
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,260
their person-in-charge is called Zhang Silang.

658
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,190
They do trades on assassinations.

Where is that Zhang Silang now?

00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,860
Chuiliu Corporation caused some trouble.

00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,020
Their business was affected.

Zhang Silang

665
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:11,940
felt down

666
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,380
and did not return home.

667
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,820
He stays in his private mansion outside the city,

668
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,350
seeking sexual pleasures.

669
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,180
Private mansion?

670
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,560
Where is it?

671
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,140
My lady.

672
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,740
Isn't this a bit inappropriate?

673
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,140
Don't worry, shop owner.

674
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,700

If you still don't trust us,

682
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,300
I'll buy all the goods

683

in your shop, alright?

684
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,780
Please don't joke with me.

685
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,530
If I run out of stock,

686
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,900
my shop may not be able to

687
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,430
survive in South of the capital city anymore.

688
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,100
I found it.

689
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,740
Buyers for Persia's tulip oil

690
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,060
are all loaded families.

691

Only this is sent to a brothel.

692
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,740
I believe it's Lady Zhai.

693
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,190
Let's go together then.

694
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:07,990
Lady Liu Ran.

695
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,710
Where are you going?

696
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,620
Didn't you say to go to the brothel?

697
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,660
Let's go together.

698

Lady Liu Ran.

699
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,460
This kind of place

700
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,940
is not suitable for you.

701
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,140
Why not?

702
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:21,340
Why not?

703
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:28,660
[South of the Capital City: Red Silk House]

704
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,700
Come in, mister.

705
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,500
Safe journey.

00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,150
Where are you going?

710
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,260
Stay here and accompany us.

711
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,890
Come in, mister.

712
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,780
Mister.

713
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,610
Go away.

714
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,660
Mister. Are you waiting for me?

715
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,180
You look so handsome.

716
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,100
I'm here today only for Lady Zhai.

717
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,340
Lady Zhai is out accompanying a guest today.

718
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,100
Why don't you

719
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,300
see if I'm alright?

720
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:13,830
Shen Fei.

721
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:14,790
Shen Fei.

722
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,620
Let's go. We'll go out first.

723
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,060
Don't go.

724
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:21,820
Mister.

725
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,500
-Mister, don't go.

726
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,460
-Play with us for a while.
-Ladies...

727
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,060
Ladies...

728
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,220
Hongyi.

729
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,150
Have you found the person you want?

730
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,180
Lady Liu Ran..

731
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,860
Did Hongyi

732
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,260
do anything inside?

733
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:00,820
No.

734
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,740
Did he get to ask

735
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,940
what he wanted to ask?

736
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,520
Not yet.

737
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,420
Wait for a while.

738
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,020
There'll surely be results.

739
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,440
Let me tell you.

740
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,260
People in this kind of place

741
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,890
are only looking for benefits.

742
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,550
If they don't talk when asked,

743
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,900
they might when bribed.
