as a monk,

6
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,600
so he will surely disguise himself.

7

00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,740
Do you know him?

181
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,470
Does he have

182
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,470
any friends here?

183
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,950
He was an accountant.

184
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,270
It was a decent job.

185
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,710
How could he be associated

186
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,840
with people like us?

187
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,710
However, he did have a drinking buddy at the mine.

188
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,240
The person is called Aisou.

189
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,450
Do you know where he is now?

190
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,270
He always lodged

191
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,550
at Lin Zhong's place

192
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,430
but he died in an accident

193
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,400
not long ago.

194
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,080
Then, Lin Zhong and his daughter

195
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,280
disappeared as well.

196
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,030
My lord,

197
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,190
we traveled from Mount Lian

198
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,320
to expose misdeeds.

199
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,840
Also, have you noticed

200
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,380
anything unusual

201
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,660
around the copper mine recently?

202
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,220
Unusual?

203
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,610
It's a small place.

204
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,660
Nothing is a secret.

205
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,870
I didn't notice anything unusual.

206
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,030
Thank you.

207
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,600
Madam,

208
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,210
we found him.

209
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,000
What's going on?

210
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,160
What happened?

211
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,990
The first house across the bridge.

212
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:57,990
It should be this one.

Yes, my lord.

217
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,110
Search thoroughly!

218
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,200
Yes, my lord.

219
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,010
Back off!

220
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,830
Move aside!

221
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,110
Out of the way!

222

226
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,430
Stand aside!

227
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,450
Sorry for that.

Open it!

Help me.

Let go of her.

Stay back!

253
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,220
Is it still hurting, Hongyi?

254
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,330
I wanted to look for clues in the house.

255
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,540
Suddenly,

256
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,260
he attacked me

257
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,060
for no reason.

258
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,260
I was terrified.

259
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,980
Luckily, you showed up.

260
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,210
Is it still painful?

261
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,530
I'm fine.

Yes.

He is a nut everyone knows here.

279
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,310
He wanders around every day

280
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,830
for some trash and food.

281
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,980

some food.

283
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,319
Turns out he's been staying here.

284
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,550
No wonder I haven't seen him recently.

285
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:11,990
Does he hurt people?

286
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,310
Hurting people?

287
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,890
No. He is crazy

288
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,040
but very timid.

289
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,319
He never hurts people.

290
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,960
If that's the case,

291
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,540
why did he try to hurt you?

292
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,340
Go get him!

293

in your operation.

300
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:58,820
He ran away.

301
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,260
Does it count

302
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,100
as misconduct of the interior guards?

303
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,210
Misconduct or not,

304
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,910
it's none of your business.

305
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,500

309
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,780
I...

310
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,320
I touched this one.

311
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,860
He asked me

312
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,700
to get him out of town

313
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,170
or he would kill me.

314
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,780
I was terrified.

315
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,580
Get her treated first.

316
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,240
Yes, madam.

317

Madam,

318
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,020
what should we do now?

319
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,410
You go back to the Services

320
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,530
and report what happened today

321
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,460
to Sir Wu.

322
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,500
How about you?

323
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,220
We might've overlooked some clues

324
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,480
at the house of Ruo'an.

325
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,580
I'll go have a look.

326
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,680

331
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,460
It's okay.

332
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,220
What's wrong with him?

333
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,900
Keep it safe.

334
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,500
It's fine.

335
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,340
Keep it safe.

336
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,070

340
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,020
They sound weird.

341
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,740
They aren't like

342

part of an article or a poem.

343
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,420
The words indicate

the geographical features of the capital.

345
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,960
If it hadn't been damaged,

346
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,900
It could have shown valuable information

347
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,900
that would attract many craftsmen.

348
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,020
It's such a good item.

349

Why does he have it?

350

Could it be given by Lin Zhong?

I'm not sure.

352

The words on it

353
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,900
could mean

354
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,160
a huge secret, though.

355
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,620

356
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,150
Alright.

357
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:54,990
Keep it safe.

358
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,160
Keep it safe.

359
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,660
Keep it safe.

He is such

361
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,450
a poor man.

Shen Fei.

363
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:06,820
Yes.

364
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,030
Take out some money.

365
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:10,870
There you go.

366
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,500
Please get him

367
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,820
some clothes

368
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,930
and food.

369
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,740
Please take good care of him.

370
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,580
Thank you.

371
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,380
Crazy,

372
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,130
we've got money.

373
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,470
I'll buy you some food.

374
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,180
The copper mine

00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,240

376
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,220
Lin and his daughter

377
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,820

So, the secret they were trying

379
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,750
to tell me in the capital

381
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,500
with the copper mine.

382
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,670
Then, what were they going to tell you?

383
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,140
Shen Fei, set off for the capital.

384
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:53,870
Yes, my lord.

385
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,220
Madam,

386
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:22,970
Madam,

387
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:36,970
It's been a long day.

388
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:37,970
Go have some rest.

389
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,400
Yes, madam.

390
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,030
Why are you here?

391
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,250
I came over to see

392
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,710
if I could find more clues.

393
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,530
The place is watched by my Services.

394
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,330
Shouldn't you

395
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,140
let me know

396
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,340
before you come over?

397
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,380
I was in a hurry.

398
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,290
I didn't have time

399
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,460
to do so.

400
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,980
Pardon me, madam.

401
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,840
Don't you need to report to your Services
that Ruo'an ran away?

402
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,340
It's fine.

403
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,710
They will find out eventually.

404
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,300
I thought you would change

405
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,940
after you joined the Intelligence Services.

406
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,900
I was wrong.

407
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,660
You're still a lone wolf.

408
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,810
I'm one of them now.

409
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,670
Lord Chu will teach me what to do

410
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,610
if I make mistakes.

411
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,340
Gao Bingzhu,

in your eyes,

413
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,250
I'm useless, right?

414
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,400
I understand

415
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,240

as soon as possible.

418
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,310
You were willing to join
the Intelligence Services at all costs.

419
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,240
I'd been looking for you those days

420
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,430
but I knew nothing

421
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,200
about you joining

422
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,230
the Services.

423
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,770
We've been through so much together.

424
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,250
Gao Bingzhu,

425
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,710
have you ever thought about

426
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,510
how I feel?

427
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:01,990
Seems that they haven't got time

Between noon to evening on the 7th.

432
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,860
Baili Hongyi is in danger.

433
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:06,990
My lord,

434
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:07,830
a person over there

435
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,870
seems to be robbed.

436
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,930
I'll go have a look.

437
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,480
He still has a pulse.

438
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,510
My lord!

439
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,790
Hongyi, careful!

440
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,560
Careful!

Run!

Leave them alone.

446
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,480
I remember the words

on the scroll.

-How did you know I am here?
-It's fine.

I'm fine.

Scales are like snow
while the fish is like jade.

You know what?

455
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,190
Fish tastes the best

I prefer delicious food to beautiful women.

Make yourself at home.

Have some rice wine.

It can warm up your stomach.

476

What a surprise!

Over these days,

What on earth is on the scroll?

487

the missing copper from Mount Lian

wasn't used to make weapons.

490

Dragons and snakes slither around?

531
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,870
transferred to us

532
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,800
if you trust me.

533
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,190
You are so thoughtful,

534
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,840
Youjue.

535
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,870
No wonder Her Majesty

536
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,350
handed the Services to you.

537
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,110
Frankly,

538
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,520
I'm here

539
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,750
to help you secure

540
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,050
a higher position.

541
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,970
Stop making fun of me, Your Highness.

542
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,220
Just let me know

543
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,950
how I can be of help.

544
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,990
Her Majesty will appoint

545
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,100
a new Minister of War in a few days.

546
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,230
When it's time,

547
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,890
I'll strongly recommend you.

548
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,390
Don't forget about me

549
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,890
after you get the position.

550
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,860
Thank you, Your Highness.

551
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,420
Have some wine.

552
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,150
Siyue, tell me!

553
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,310
Who on earth

554
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,520
were those villains?

555
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,620
They could be robbers.

556
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,160
Don't lie to me.

557
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,110
Robbers dare not rob carriages

558
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,670
on main roads.

559
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,870
They only went for killing

560
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:38,070
instead of money.

561
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,190
You and Gao Bingzhu traveled

562
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,440
all the way from the capital to save us.

563
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,110
It can't just be for

564
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,320
some robbers.

565
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,350
Smart girl.

566
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,310
It's complicated, though.

567
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,430
I'll explain it to you

568
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,230
after we get back to the capital.

569
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,410
Have some rest.

570
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,150
What happened to him?

571
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,750
He...

572
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,440
He joined the Intelligence Services.

573
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,670
Then, he must have a plan.

574
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:38,590
Yeah.

575
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,400
He cut off every connection

576
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,989
to go there.

577
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,909
There must be

578
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,790
things that intrigue him.

579
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,390
By the way,

580
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,590
what did they

581
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,670
rob from you?

582
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,760
A parchment scroll.

583
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,070
Specifically,

584
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,470
two lines.

585
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:10,670
Two lines?

586
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,670
Dragons and snakes slither around.

587
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,710
Mountains overlook the crowd.

588
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,960
Dragons and snakes slither around.

589
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,470
Mountains overlook the crowd.

590
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,880
You think they wanted to kill you

591
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,160
because of the lines,

592
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,310
don't you?

593
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,200
So, maybe Lin Zhong and his daughter

594
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:37,670
wanted to find you in the capital

595
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,130
because of the lines, too.

596
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,760
I thought so, too.

597
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,720
These lines might be the secret

598
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,510
that Lin Zhong wanted to tell me.

599
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,310
That's why he had a fallback plan

600
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,150
and gave the scroll

601
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,470
to a crazy old man.

602
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,880
However, Lin Zhong and his daughter are dead now.

603
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,960
I can't be sure.

604
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,930
If your guess was right,

605
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,320
you could be in danger

606
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,710
after you come back to the capital.

607
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,310
I know.

608
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,270
Even so,

609
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:01,630
I will go back.

610
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,470
My father was killed

611
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,670
by Four Season Clan.

612
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,040
I've been looking for them.

613
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,120
If they send people

614
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,780
to kill me,

615
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,160
I can take it as a chance

616
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,170
to find out who's behind all this.

617
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,710
You want to use yourself as the bait.

618
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,600
It's alright.

619
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,070
You can risk your life,

620
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,050
but what about Liu Ran?

621
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,690
Who'll take care of her?

622
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,590
Lamb soup.

623
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,950
Hot lamb soup.

624
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:52,950
Lamb soup.

625
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,430
Sir, would you like some lamb soup?

626
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,610
