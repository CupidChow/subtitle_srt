Even though our family

521
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,520
is well known in He Luo,

522
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,130
but things are unpredictable.

523
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,180
Countless senior ministers

Our family is in a very precarious position.

526

Thus every step you take,

every stair that you climb,

528
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,500
you have to be careful.

529

Once you say something wrong,

530
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,780
the Baili family

531
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,860

If a single piece is defective,

534
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,480
then everything will be out of order.

535
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,170
Just like your elder brother, Kuan Ren.

536
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,450

537

and got what he deserved.

538
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,740
It's a lesson for us to learn.

539

I don't want to befriend the Liu family.

540

Hongyi,

703
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,900
I'm so glad that you came.

704
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,420
I knew

705
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,940
you'll change your mind.

706
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,100
Baili Hongyi doesn't seem happy with

707
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,900
this marriage

708
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:57,990
I don't know.

709
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,200
I haven't seen him.

710
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,380
Did he not come?

711
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,300
It's good that he's not here.

712
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,670
But since we know

713
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,000
he's around this area,

714
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,340
where else would he go

715
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,600
aside from this place?

716
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,580
Stop eating. Let's look for him.

717
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,620
Madam Wu.

718
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,140

720
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,460
I'll be back soon.

721
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,740

we grew up together.

724

I'm sure that you like me too.

725
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,020
I'm here today,

726
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,980

728
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:44,860
Siyue, you're here.

00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:45,740
Liu Ran.

730
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,190
Why didn't you tell me earlier

731
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,620
that you were coming?

732
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,530
I almost couldn't recognise you

733
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,900
in that dress.

734
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,940
Today is your big day,

735
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,660
of course I can't be casual.

736
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,100
Hongyi,

737
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,760

740
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,060
Siyue.

741
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,330
This is my husband, Baili Hongyi.

743
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:14,830

744
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,700
Princess Yongchuan is here.

745
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,700
Alright.

746
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:18,830
Let's go.

747
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,910
I'll go with you.

748
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,420
Madam Wu, hold on.

749
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,090
I have something to ask Madam Wu.

750
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,260
You can go first,

751
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,390
I'll meet you later.

752
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,110
Alright.

753
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,100
Madam Wu,

754
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,020
how's the investigation on the informer?

755
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,020
How did you know about

756
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,260
the informer?

757
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,790
They came and met me.

758
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,000
What did they tell?

759
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,020
They said

760
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,920
they were from Mount Lian .

761
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,460
Not long after that,

762
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,060
a mysterious man told me that

763
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,830
they were already dead.

764
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,220
A mysterious man?

765
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,140
The criminal who killed the informer

766
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,450
has been murdered in the Grand Court.

767
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,880

Was it this person?

770
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,330
Yes, it's him.

771
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,790

and Interior Guard Services before he fled.

774
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,460
He's very dangerous.

775
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,740
Also, I received news that

776
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,540

777
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,860

778
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,080
Baili Mansion?

779
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,770
Gao Bingzhu is investigating the informer.

780
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,770
The informer comes from Mount Lian .

781
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,550
Mount Lian Copper Mine...

782
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:35,620
My father...

783
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,360
What did you do?

784
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:01,810
Father.

785
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,140
Father.

786
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,780
Gao Bingzhu.

787
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,540
I didn't kill him.

788
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,380
Follow me to the Interior Guard Services.

789
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,340
Father.

790
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,540
Father.

791
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:16,980
I'll say it one more time.

792
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,310
Follow me to the Interior Guard Services.

793
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,450
Why did you kill my father?

794
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,910
Why did you kill my father?

795
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:30,860
Baili Hongyi!

796
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,320
Gao Bingzhu, let go of him!

797
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,660
If you don't want him to die,

798
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,590
don't come over.

799
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,630
Even if he dies,

800
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,690
you'll not escape.

801
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,780
I didn't kill him.

802
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,220
Then why are you here?

803
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,100
Gao Bingzhu!

804
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,880
You're a wanted criminal.

805
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,810
Please don't commit another mistake.

806
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:44,870
Let go of him first.

807
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,380
If you want to know

808
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,580
how your father died,

809
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,850
then listen to me.

810
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:49,820
Why should I trust you?

811
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,280
Because

812
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,540
I can kill you right away.

813
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,270
Let go of him!

814
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,420
What do you want to do?

815
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,880
Prepare a horse for me.

816
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,990
You come with me.

817
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,420
I've brought you out.

818
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,060
Where are you bringing me to?

819
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,820
You should tell me what you have promised me.

820
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,280
Why did you kill my father?

821
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,820
Let me tell you again,

822
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,220
I did not kill him.

823
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:36,770
Then why

824
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,460
were you in my father's room?

825
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,710
This has nothing to do with you.

826
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:42,980
Tell me.

827
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,310
I won't let you go until you tell me.

828
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,750
Why did the informer look for you?

829
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,500
Who killed the informer?

830
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,300
Who killed your father?

831
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,270
You should investigate this.

832
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,490
Let go of me!

833
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:44,980
No! Explain what you mean!
