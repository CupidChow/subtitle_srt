What's that?

31
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:53,750
Shen Fei,

32
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,940
I've to meet Duke of Mount Wind tomorrow.

33
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,000
Duke of Mount Wind?

34
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,140
But I have to think of

35
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,000
a valid reason.

36
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,460
Miss Liu Ran is Duke of Mount Wind's

37
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,060
niece.

38
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,140
Logically,

39
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,930
after both of you get married,

40
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,060
you should both together

41
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,260
go back and visit him.

42
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,740
If Hongyi wants to

43
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,970
meet Duke of Mount Wind,

44
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,260
you could have just gone back with Miss Liu.

45
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,120
That'd be fine.

46
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,380
I always think that

47
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,660
there's something strange with Lord Baili's incident,

48
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,190
it turns out that Liu Xiang is the mastermind.

49
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,980
There's no evidence yet.

50
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,460
If he's the murderer,

51
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,590
then he's my target.

52
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,180
We can cooperate.

53
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,740
Liu Xiang

54
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,980
secretly exchanged Mount Lian's copper ore,

55
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,380
I'm sure he has the relevant account books.

56
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,740
Based on my understanding,

57
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,100
on the sixth day of every month,

58
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,230
he'll go to worship.

59
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,140
On the tenth day,

60
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,420
he'll go to Zhoushan and have Chan training with eminent monks.

61
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,340
On the fifteenth day,

62
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,100
he'll go to Zhoushan to have Chan training with eminent monks.

63

Tomorrow is the tenth day,

64
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,420
he'll bring

65
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,350
all his subordinates to Zhoushan.

66
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,180
The mansion will be empty at that time,

67
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,820
we can go and search for the account books.

68
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,420
It'd be the best time to do so.

69

You want to sneak into the Liu Mansion?

70
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,380
He has a lot of subordinates.

If you go,

72

00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,310
Your father and I

176
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,820
are best friends,

177
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,710
we have known each other for a long time.

178
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,060
Last month, your father was sitting

179
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,270
at the same place where you are sitting now.

180
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,930
It feels like just yesterday.

181
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:08,670
Hongyi,

182
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,700
now that you are married,

183
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,360
you're the master of a family.

184
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,700
You should not behave

185
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,000
perversely like how you were before.

186
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,440
Wait until your three years of mourning period is over,

187
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,460
I'll help you

188
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,230
get a job in the royal court.

189
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:33,920
Hongyi,

190
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,780
don't look directly into Uncle,

191
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,640
it's a bit rude.

192
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,360
Hongyi.

193
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,710
Since you mentioned my father,

194
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,780
I'm curious...

195
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,430
if my father were still alive,

196
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,580
and if he sat here,

197
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,600
Duke of Mount Wind,

198
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,160
did you have anything to tell him?

199
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:26,760
Hongyi.

200
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,030
Hongyi.

201
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,260
Uncle,

202
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,260
Hongyi never drinks alcohol.

203
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,700
I'll drink a toast to you.

204
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,140
I toast this to my father.

205
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,340
Uncle.

206
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,620
I'll go and clean up for a while.

207
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,500
I'll go with you.

208
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:05,960
No need.

209
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,620
Hongyi.

210
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:09,900
Hongyi.

211
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,620
Uncle.

212
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,700
Did you get it?

213
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,700
I thought you would not...

214
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,830
I have promised you,

215
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,300
it'll not be changed.

216
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,590
Stand there.

217
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,260
I've never seen you in the mansion,

218
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:57,920
who are you?

219
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,680
This is Hongyi from the Baili family.

220
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,340
You're Baili Hongyi.

221
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,480
Please forgive me, Baili Hongyi.

222
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,980
Outsiders are prohibited from walking around in the mansion.

223
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,310
I can't even take a look?

224
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,660
Or am I an outsider?

225
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,690
This is not just a map.

226
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,010
This is the detailed version

227
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,020
of the building plan of the Liu Mansion.

228
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,420
Where did you get it from?

229
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,980
It's unrelated to the case,

230
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,240
you don't have to know.

231
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,310
Follow him.

232
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:01,970
-Yes.
-Yes.

233
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,660
An ordinary person will not get

234
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,720
the building plan.

235
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,460
Tell me,

236
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,980
where did you get it from?

237
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,710
You don't have to care about it.

238
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,099
If I don't know

239
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,579
the source of this building plan,

240
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,380
how could I believe if it's real?

241
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,420
I asked for it from the Intelligence Services.

242
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,890
The Intelligence Services?

243
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,460
The Intelligence Services have the responsibility to monitor everything.

244
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,900
They are everywhere and they know everything.

245
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,380
So this building plan must be real.

246
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,980
You don't have to be worried.

247
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:58,980
So,

248
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,220
every time that you could follow me,

249
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,460
it's because of the news from the Intelligence Services?

250
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,480
The little boy from the Baili family?

251
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,220
Thank you.

252
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:52,620
Wait.

253
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,680
Today is not the right timing.

254
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,660
Baili Hongyi and Miss Liu

255
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,060
are visiting relatives.

256
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,830
Liu Xiang is in the mansion now.

257
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,340
He didn't go to Zhoushan for Chan training.

258
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,160
Baili Hongyi's father

259
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,420
has just passed away,

260
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,710
and he has the mood to visit relatives.

261
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,460
Miss Liu and Hongyi just got married,

262
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,180
and it is time for them to visit relatives.

263
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,240
This is the custom.

264
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,310
Anything wrong?

265
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,340
Baili Hongyi that you know

266
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,470
is someone who will follow the custom?

267
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,340
Miss Liu has been listening to Hongyi blindly.

268
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,820
If this matter

269
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,710
has been mentioned by Hongyi voluntarily...

270
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,280
Baili Hongyi is in danger.

271

You came here,

272
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,700
is it because you're interested in

my account room?

274
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,740
I passed by here,

275
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,440
I see that this room

276
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,740
is built with a rare seven layers of bucket arch.

If that's the case,

280

then I've been worrying too much.

281
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,460
But why do I feel that

282
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,200
you came to my house not because of visiting relatives,

283
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,660
but it was for your own motives?

Mine was reckless,

347
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,460
then yours is considered a calm action?

348
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:54,800
Hongyi.

349
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,700
I know you went to the Liu Mansion

350
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,900
to look for evidence.

351
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,020
But your rash action

352
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,080
is very dangerous.

353
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,240
I have to go.

354
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:10,830
Where are we going?

355
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,120
Liu Xiang has been hiding deeply.

356
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,300
Now, I see that

357
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,020
those who know about Mount Lian's copper ore

358
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,880
will be killed.

359
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,180
Instead of searching for evidence,

360
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,780
I should take actions when he's out of the mansion.

361
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,510
Gao Bingzhu.

362
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,380
Arresting and interrogating criminals

363
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,340
are what the officials should do,

364
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:28,860
it's not something that you can do.

365
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,590
If the officials could do this,

366
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,300
would Baili Yan die?

367
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,420
It's true that the officials are not reliable.

368
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,900
No matter what,

369
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,460
we should not go against the law.

370
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,770
If we were to be overcautious,

371
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,370
when could we get the evidence?

372
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,620
But if you go and arrest Liu Xiang,

373
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,850
and accidentally kill him,

374
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:49,780
then my father's case

375
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,680
can never be investigated anymore.

376
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,010
So we have to cooperate,

377
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,180
at least we can't block each other's way.

378
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,860
Everyone please have a seat.

379
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,920
We have to plan this

380

from the beginning.

381
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,230
You guys want to continue wasting time?

382
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,480
The most urgent thing now

383
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,430
is to find

384
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,900
the account books from Chuiliu Corporation

385
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,030
so that we can prove Liu Xiang's crime.

386
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:33,870
I ask you,

387
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,860
did you find anything from the Liu Mansion?

388
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,040
I'm asking you.

389
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,660
Since we're cooperating,

390
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,120
you should be more polite.

391
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:47,880
Hongyi,

392
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,640
did you find anything at the Liu Mansion?

393
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,440
I found Liu Xiang's account room.

394
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,780
Then did Liu Xiang

395
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,460
know that

396
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,710
you're looking for the account books?

397
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,600
It's possible.

398
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,390
Where's the account room?

399
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,580

Huang An has been killed by me.

402

Accordingly,

I think he won't get anything.

404
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,160
But he still found out that I'm involved.

405
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,350
Is it possible that he has found something

406

from you?

407
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,860

408
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,940
get rid of him?

Alright.

I'll go and search for it at that time.

will not stay for a long time at the Eastern Palace.

519
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,000
This...

520
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:18,900
Let's go.

521
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,400
Be careful.

522
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,660
Hongyi.

523
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,020
Hongyi.

524
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,080
To get rid of Baili Hongyi,

525
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,300
is it very difficult for you?

526
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,300
I have a request.

527
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,780
He is Liu Ran's husband,

528
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,860
if he doesn't create any problem anymore,

529
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,060
can we just leave him?

530
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,300
But Baili Hongyi

531
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,230
but he will not easily let it go.

532

[Elegant Residence]

533
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:26,840
Mother.

534
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,120
Your Highness.

535
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:29,980
Try this.

536
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,290
It is very nice.

537
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,700
The wine and dishes today are very nice.

538
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,520
Hongyi.

539
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:37,580
Try this.

[The Crown Princess: Lady Du]

541
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,180
Come, mother.

542
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,060
Thanks for your hospitality today.

543
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,100
This feast at the Eastern Palace

544
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,140
is well-deserved.

545
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,180
The fact that the guests are enjoying it

546
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,510
is the honor of the host.

547
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,340
Everyone please enjoy.

548
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,720
I've assigned more people to strengthen our arrangement.

549
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,950
Since the house that he found last time

550
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,260
was our trap,

551
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,700
if he has the courage to step in,

552
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,870
I can assure him that...

553
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,270
he has no chance to be alive.

554
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,200
How do you know that this is the account room?

555
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,950
Liu Xiang mentioned it.

556
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,660
How could Liu Xiang

557
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,370
admit that it was the account room?

558
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,820
Would a mouse tell a cat about

559
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,890
its own cave?

560
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,640
It's quite late by now,

561
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,100
everyone should go back and have some rest.

562
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,300
That's all for today.

563
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,660
Thank you, Your Highness.

564
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,260
Thank you.

565
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,740
Think about it.

566
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,600
Any more clues?

567
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:57,420
How?

568
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:58,690
Sure.

569
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,860
It's rare that Baili Hongyi is here today.

570
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,100
As a gastronomist,

571
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,500
what do you think about the feast today?

572
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,040
It's very nice.

573
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,219
The best gastronomist in the capital said that it was nice.

574
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,880
My preparation is not wasted.

575
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,900
If not because of Your Highness' birthday today,

576
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,780
we won't get to enjoy this delicious food.

577
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,540
Thank you, Your Highness.

578
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,010
Come on, everyone.

579
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

580
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,500
Thank you, Your Highness.

581
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,440
Since everyone is in the mood,

582
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:33,739
why don't we add on some wines and dishes,

583
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,139
and everyone just enjoy it?

584
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:35,739
Sure.

585
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:36,350
Sure.

586
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,980
Let's have a seat, everyone.

587
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,580
Have a seat.

588
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,239
Have a seat.

589
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,240
Your Highness,

590
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,100
I'm drunk,

591
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,540
I'll take a move first.

592
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,620
Crown Princess, Princess,

593
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,100
I'm also drunk,

594
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,940
I'll leave with King Dongchuan.

595
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,480
Your Highness,

596
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,020
King Dongchuan and Duke of Mount Wind

597
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,260
haven't tasted the dessert.

598
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,060
You mentioned that because of your birthday,

599
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,780
you have invited some western chefs.

600
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,900
We haven't tasted it.

601
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,540
Yes,

602
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,220
I almost forgot about it.

603
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,740
Siyue is very thoughtful.

604
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,710
Please wait for a while.

605
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:26,920
I'll ask people

606
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,130
to serve the dessert.

607
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,920
Think about it.

608
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,220
What clues do we have?

609
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,550
A snake lock.

610
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,670
A snake lock?

611
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,140
I passed by a house,

612
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,700
the house looks normal,

613
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,780
but the lock

614
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,950
is the snake lock

615
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,120
made by Directorate from the palace.

616
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,080
A snake lock

617
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,620
is usually being used at some confidential places.

618
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,380
They'll not use it

619
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,380
for a normal room.

620
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,860
Do you remember

621
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,860
where's the room?

622
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,700
It should be here.

623
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,830
So the real account room

624
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,410
could be here.

625
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,320
Mother.

626
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,480
Your Highness,

627
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,740
this dessert is very delicious,

628
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,940
but I am of old age already,

629
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,340
I can't eat dessert.

630
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,580
Everyone please enjoy it,

631
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,660
I am leaving.

632
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,980
The others do not matter,

633
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,140
but I heard that the western chefs'

634
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,820
date pastries are different.

635
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,850
The pastry crust is crisp on the outside

636
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,300
and is so tender that it melts in the mouth.

637
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,360
Duke of Mount Wind,

638
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,780
don't you want to taste it before leaving?
