she would be in the kitchen.

I walked her back last night.

She said she wanted to rest

410

and asked me to leave.

No, I searched her room.

and even wanted a divorce.

There were

438
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,370
two pieces of isinglass.

439
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,390

as facial masks every day.

521
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,070
Madam, someone left you a message.

522
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,180
[Noon, Liubai Building]

523
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:13,100
[Liubai Building]

524
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,310
Siyue!

525
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,050
Come here!

526
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,650
It rained a lot this year.

527
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,370
The white dew tea from Hongzhou

528
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,630
is the most savory one.

529
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,960
You're always occupied with work.

530
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,340
You finally have a day off.

531
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,050
I picked these leaves

532
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:41,520
myself.

533
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,350
And I made sure

534
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,890
they were roasted at the right temperature.

535
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,570
A higher temperature will ruin the leaves,

536
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,410
but a lower temperature makes the tea astringent.

537
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,010
-Only the right one...
-Ran.

538
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,510
I asked people

539
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,370
to give you this several days ago.

540
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,280
Now, you're treating me to it?

541
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,630
Is that so?

542
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,520
I forgot.

543
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,970
Siyue, I haven't seen you for a while.

544
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,230
Here you are, try this.

545
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,989
We met days ago.

546
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,460
What happened to you?

547
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,690
Nothing.

548
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:15,739
Can I only meet you

549
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,270
when I need your help?

550
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,360
Have some.

551
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,080
You invited me here

552
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,139
not to drink tea,

553
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:27,070
am I right?

554
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,080
Because of Hongyi?

555
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:30,820
No!

556
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,960
No, you have to trust me.

557
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,610
Your father passed away.

558
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,630
What do you do for a living?

559
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,710
I resigned.

560
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,620
I'm an ordinary person now.

561
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,000
Fame or money

562
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,220
won't bother you anymore.

563
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,120
Does that mean

564
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,510
you live on

565
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,770
my daughter's dowry?

566
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,480
I was told that

567
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,110
you refused to marry her
until the wedding day came.

568
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,420
Our marriage

569
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,320
is more about the two families

570
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,750
than us two.

571
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,670
Then, why did you say yes later?

572
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:36,830
The Baili family
raised high officials before.

573
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,610
Although it isn't as prestigious as ours,

574
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,010
I was never bothered by

575
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,900
the differences in our backgrounds.

576
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,990
Hongyi,

577
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,870
you're a talented man even in the capital.

578
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,840
In order to uphold your values,

579
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,240
you refused to marry her.

580
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,950
I really admire you.

581
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,110
If you were my son,

582
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,940
I would die without regret.

583
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,520
Such a shame.

584
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,740
You are just my son-in-law.

585
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,870
On the other hand,

586
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,230
Liu Ran is my daughter.

587
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,860
She was spoiled when she was little.

588
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,030
She will get

589
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,750
anything she wants

590
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,470
no matter how hard it is to get.

591
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,000
Baili Hongyi,

592
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,520
tell me.

593
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,910
How much has she suffered

594
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,030
in the Baili family?

595
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,510
How upset did she feel

596
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,020
that she finally chose to leave?

597
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,240
Do you remember

598
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,720
the peach tree in the Eastern Palace?

599
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,480
We both wanted to eat peaches,

600
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,850
but I had to follow

601
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,070
all those rules.

602
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,960
Even if there was no one around,

603
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,950
I wouldn't climb up to get the peaches.

604
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,250
But you did as you wished

605
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,520
without thinking too much,

606
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,920
saying that whatever you want,

607
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,980
you would go for it.

608
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,040
I've never seen you like this.

609
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,550
What happened?

610
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,840
Nothing happened.

611
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,070
Stop asking.

612
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:12,730
Have some tea.

613
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:14,350
Fine.

614
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,600
You don't want to tell me.

615
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,810
I'll go talk to Hongyi.

616
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:17,350
Don't!

617
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,710
I know it's about him.

618
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,630
What happened?

619
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,240
Siyue,

620
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:27,890
please don't ask him.

621
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,330
I can't cause any trouble

622
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,310
for Hongyi.

623
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,830
What trouble?

624
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,150
What do you mean?

625
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,190
His father died because of my uncle.

626
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,510
I dare not face him

627
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,320
or stay with him.

628
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:51,310
His father died from having white fungus soup.

629
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,330
I had no idea

630
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,030
and even cooked
white fungus soup for Hongyi.

631
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,280
I can't imagine

632
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,180
how sad he must have been.

633
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,830
However, I didn't notice it at all.

634
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,100
I've been thinking recently.

635
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,580
If I hadn't been in this world,

636
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,670
Hongyi

637
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,910
probably would've had fewer things
to worry about.
