These two people

177
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,040
have just died.

178
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,010
They both died of stab wounds,

179
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,890
and their time of death is close.

180
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,720
They must have been killed by the same person.

181
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:42,530
To silence them.

182
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,360
The man is Zhang Silang,

183
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,320
the shopkeeper of Chuiliu Corporation.

184
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,970
He was involved in the theft of the copper in Mount Lian.

185
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,650
Hence, his death

186
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,440
is not a surprise.

187
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,970
But the lady...

188
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
She is Lady Zhai,

189
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,040
the concubine of Huang An, the supervisor of the Ministry of Works.

190
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,720
Huang An worked under my father.

191
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,760
Last month, Lady Zhai spilt

192
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,530
a pot of sweet soup.

193
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,120
Then she was chased out of the house by Huang An.

194
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,360
Not long after that,

195
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,130
Huang An died in an accident.

196
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,360
So,

197
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,600
Huang An knew that

198
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,680
something would happen to him.

199
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,850
So he sent his wife,

200
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,160
Lady Zhai, away in advance.

201
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:24,720
Then, Huang An...

202
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,920
must have told Lady Zhai

203
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:27,730
something.

204
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,440
That's why she was killed.

205
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,730
One more possibility.

206
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:32,570
Huang An

207
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,650
could have entrusted something to Lady Zhai.

208
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,920
The instinct of a mortician.

209

[A Report to the Empress]

210
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,520
I was foolish and ignorant.

211
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,930
For being appointed a supervisor, I am much obliged to the empress.

212
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,850
I shall repay the empress' grace

213

Huang An wrote this.

215
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,890
He knew from the accountant in Mount Lian

216
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,520
that the operation of the copper mine was abnormal.

they were trying to inform.

220
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,400
They were trying to feather their nest.

221
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,120
They wanted to embezzle the copper mine in Mount Lian.

I'm afraid that your marriage

and proposed a marriage to your family.

241
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,760
He gained your father's trust

242
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,960
and got the copper mine in his name.

243

Now that he's been exposed,

244
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,320
he killed your father.

245

Why do we have to bootlick the Liu family?

What did you say?

247
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,080
Are you sure that you're not using this marriage

to help you advance in your career?

249
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,200
And made your father a scapegoat

250

of stealing from the copper mine.

251

This has been planned.

It's not your fault.

00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,090
She can't eat or sleep but thinking about him.

349
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,610
How's Duke of Mount Wind's itinerary

350
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,600
for the coming days?

351
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,800
Can I let my sister

352
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,010
see him secretly?

353
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,640
A jar of old wine after it's done.

354
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,080
Two jars.

355
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:16,960
Two jars?

356
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,280
Sure!

357
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,160
Great!

358
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,970
Have you got it?

359
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,490
It's not easy to get

360
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,800
Duke of Mount Wind's itinerary for the coming days.

361
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,400
I bribed

362
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,570
his stableman

363
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,080
with three jars of old wine.

364
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:57,850
Three jars.

365
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,730
Remember that.

366
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:06,690
Thank you.

367
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,240
Why are you sharpening your blade?

368
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,930
You want Duke of Mount Wind's itinerary...

369
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,040
Bingzhu,

370
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,530
don't be impulsive.

371
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:21,410
Duke of Mount Wind...

372
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,000
Duke of Mount Wind is not any ordinary man.

373
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,280
He has countless

374
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,120
private soldiers.

375
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,160
Before you can even touch

376
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,610
the corner of his clothes,

377
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,290
you would have been killed.

378
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:27,840
Do you know that?

379
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:30,850
What's wrong?

380
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,600
What do you mean?

381
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,440
Thanks for your effort.

382
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:37,480
I...

383
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:37,960
You...

384
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,480
You're well-rounded.

385
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:41,970
Worth it.

386
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,560
Things like this

387
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,400
must not be done by someone else.

388
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,290
I'll do it for you.

389
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,850
The core secret of the Intelligence Services was leaked.

390
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,410
The mole is either Agents or Buddha.

391
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,930
Agents?

392
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,320
Agents and Buddha are the cores of the Intelligence Services.

393
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,760
For the rest of Agents' life,

394
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:05,800
he will never leave the Palace of Nature.

395
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:06,810
He can be trusted.

396
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,480
Be careful of what you say.

397
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,680
There have been thefts in the copper mine in Mount Lian.

398
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,640
The coppers for the the Supreme Buddhist Temple project have been changed.

399
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,250
Recently, Baili Yan was killed.

400
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,730
The Intelligence Services

401
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,640
failed to make any prediction regarding these incidents.

402
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,650
They didn't even notice

403
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,000
any clues.

404
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,400
The mole is either Agents or Buddha.

405
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,170
To enter the Palace of Nature,

406
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,120
the procedure is complicated,

407
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,490
and there is record keeping.

408
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,040
If the mole were to contact the outside world,

409
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,560
[Guard of Intelligence Services Lord Chu: An Baitan]

410
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,730
there must be a secret agent.

411
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:34,600
Zhao Yang.

412
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,360
Zhao Yang is the secret agent.

413
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,600
In public, he was

414
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,680
the owner of the nearby meat shop.

415
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,960
However, upon inquiry,

416
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:41,730
ten years ago,

417
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,440
he used to be an outstanding Falcon Tamer.

418
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,610
He was the person

419
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,000
who used the Saker Falcon of the Intelligence Services

420
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,040
to leak the secrets.

421
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,480
However,

422
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,930
the mole can't be

423
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,610
just Jianfeng in the Corps,

424
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
a Falcon Tamer.

425
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,080
They must have

426
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,680
infiltrated into the Intelligence Services for quite some time.

427
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:00,170
Master.

428
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,570
Agents and Buddha are the cores of the Intelligence Services.

429
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,250
Now that it has been infiltrated by a mole.

430
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,290
This is an emergency.

431
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,200
Shall we...

432
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,760
Shall we activate the Reclining Buddha Order?

433
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,680
Agent Han.

434
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,410
Once the Reclining Buddha Order is activated,

435
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,650
the Intelligence Services will no longer function.

436
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:15,930
If we don't get rid of the mole,

437
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,050
the Intelligence Services will be in a difficult situation.

438
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,690
The Reclining Buddha Order?

439
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,290
The Intelligence Services are the empress' spies.

440
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,450
The empress can't be without her spies.

441
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:56,600
Hurry up.

442
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,010
Be quiet.

443
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:15,760
Got it.

444
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,490
Got it.

445
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:19,480
Follow me.

446
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,200
What are you afraid of?

447
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,090
Great!

448
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,650
Great! Great!

449
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,480
Good job!

450
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,920
It's really bustling in the capital.

451
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,960
Lower your voice.

452
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,440
It's so much better than the Unwelcome Well.

453
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,400
Of course.

454
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:21,850
Bingzhu.

455
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:22,720
Bingzhu.

456
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,080
The red one...

457
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,370
That is sugar-coated haw.

458
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,520
It's delicious.

459
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,730
When I go out later,

460
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,730
I'll buy it for you to try.

461
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,050
We are all the empress' people

462
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,560
earning a living in the capital.

463
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,530
Why do we from the Unwelcome Well

464
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
are not allowed into the capital?

465
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,250
Let me tell you.

466
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,730
One day,

467
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:37,640
I'll make sure

468
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,560
all people from the Unwelcome Well

469
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,290
can live freely in the capital.

470
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,570
They can do whatever they want,

471
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,680
buy anything they want,

472
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:43,760
just like the people in the capital.

473
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,070
Let's go take a look.

474
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,770
How did you know that I'm here?

475
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,840
There are no tombstones on these seven graves,

476
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,960
and there are no names.

477
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,840
After I went to the Unwelcome Well,

478
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:05,880
I found out that

479
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:07,520
the people buried here

480
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,440
were your companions.

481
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,000
It's fine.

482
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,810
When you collect my body in the future,

483
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,240
at least you know the place.

484
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,130
Why didn't you put up a tombstone?

485
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,080
Trying to stay away from calamity?

486
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,450
I've told you.

487
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,560
Stop following me.

488
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,330
In April, the first year of Daqing period,

489
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,560
Gao Bingzhu, the Well officers,

490
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,770
broke the rule with seven people from the Unwelcome Well,

491
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,160
leaving the Unwelcome Well without permission.

492
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:50,360
They died.

493
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,480
In the same month, the Grand Court locked the Well.

494
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,850
Gao Bingzhu, the Well officers.

495
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:54,800
died...

496
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,210
Stop investigating me!

497
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:58,440
This has nothing to do with the case.

498
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,400
I've gone to the Unwelcome Well,

499
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:00,850
and met Mr. Unsightly.

500
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,770
Apart from the record

501
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,650
which was written

502
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,640
on the file,

503
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,840
no one else knows

504
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:08,970
what happened that year.

505
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:10,960
Why are you not saying anything?

506
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,160
You can't say it?

507
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,930
Or you don't dare to say it?

508
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,000
I know what you're afraid of.

509
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:22,960
All people from the Unwelcome Well

510
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,370
are not allowed to leave the Unwelcome Well without permission.

511
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:25,170
Seal the well.

512
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:25,920
Yes.

513
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,960
As a Unwelcome Well officer,

514
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,640
don't you know

515
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,600
the consequences of breaking the rules?

516
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,600
You're right. I'm investigating you.

517
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,170
But I'm not just investigating the case.

518
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,250
I'm curious.

519
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,330
A person who used to protect the capital,

520
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,760
an officers,

521
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,440
how could he turn into someone

522
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,530
who is in a mess!

523
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,000
This has nothing to do with you.

524
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,160
Gao Bingzhu.

525
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,170
What happened when

526
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,520
Xiaowu and the rest died?

527
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,840
You still remember, don't you?

528
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:30,770
Wait for me.

529
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:31,440
Wait for me.

530
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,280
Bingzhu, wait for me.

531
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,120
Wait for me.

532
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,240
Bingzhu, wait for us.

533
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:34,880
Wait for me.

534
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:36,210
Wait for me.

535
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:40,360
Wait for me.

536
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,090
-Bingzhu, wait for me.
-Wait for me.

537
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:43,280
Bingzhu, wait for me.

538
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:45,800
Wait for me.

539
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:47,570
Higher.

540
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,650
-Higher. 
-Higher.

541
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,570
Good!

542
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,010
The wind out here is sweet.

543
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,440
He broke the root.

544
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,520
Help me!

545
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,080
I brought you out

546
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,450
-not to mess things up.
-Help.

547
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,040
Help me!

548
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,080
Bingzhu, help me!

549
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,090
Bingzhu, someone's there.

550
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,760
Go back.

551
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,280
I'll have a look.

552
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,040
Bingzhu.

553
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,850
Listen to me. Leave now.

554
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:31,840
Meet you at the main gate.

555
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,370
Go.

556
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,440
King Tongyang of that year,

557
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,560
the current crown prince,

558
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,840
was assassinated at the outskirt of the capital.

559
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:46,920
The crown prince once said that

560
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:48,770
if it weren't for some people who saved them,

561
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,520
they wouldn't have lasted till aid arrived.

562
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,400
But the people who saved him

563
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,850
vanished into thin air

564
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,130
and never appeared after that.

565
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,840
Gao Bingzhu.

566
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,880
The people who saved him

567
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,160
were you and your brothers

568
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,320
who are buried here.

569
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:01,700
Right?

570
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,410
Stop it!

571
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:08,490
I don't know what you had gone through.

572
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,160
I also don't know

573
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,610
what makes you feel difficult to disclose.

574
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,160
You are the only person

575
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,000
who knows what happened that year.

576
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,130
You should tell the truth.

577
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,770
The truth?

578
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:17,770
Who cares?

579
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:19,850
Do you care?

580
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,610
You only want to investigate the case.

581
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,490
The Grand Court

582
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,120
and the Interior Guard Services

583
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,330
are just fighting for merits.

584
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,480
They don't care.

585
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,200
But they are also the people of Luoyang.

586
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,650
They shouldn't be dead

587
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,250
for no reason.

588
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:44,560
Xiaoqi,

589
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,680
someone said you're the people of the capital.

590
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,450
Brothers,

591
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,170
are we the people of the capital?

592
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,360
Brothers...

593
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,380
This is the first time someone said

594
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,120
we were the people of the capital.

595
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,440
But we don't deserve it.

596
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,480
We can only live forever

597
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,040
in darkness in the Unwelcome Well.

598
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,730
Who are the people of Luoyang?

599
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,320
Who are the people of Luoyang?

600
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,040
I won't let them sacrifice for nothing.

601
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:23,360
I will never ever

602
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,570
let them sacrifice for nothing.

603
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,200
This is my business.

604
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,040
What if you die?

605
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,050
If you die,

606
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,880
who will know

607
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,320
these people in the deserted grave?

608
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,160
Who will revenge

609
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,290
for them?

610
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,210
Gao Bingzhu.

611
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,360
You're so selfish.

612
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,810
You have no rights

613
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:51,930
to allow them to become

614
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,530
nobody.

615
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,520
You'll be wondering,

616
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,600
who cares.

617
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:21,840
Today,

618
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,050
I swear

619
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:24,490
in the name of Siyue.

620
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,120
No matter what happened that year,

621
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,000
I'll reward the men of merit punish the felons.

622
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,000
Be it innocent or guilty,

623
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,440
I will give you an explanation.

624
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
Protect His Highness!

625
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:53,490
Protect His Highness!

626
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:02,700
[King Tongyang: Li Dun]

627
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,810
Father, I'm scared.

628
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:18,770
Who sent you here?

629
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,290
For Bingzhu, charge!

630
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,610
Mother.

631
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,490
Evacuate this place!

632
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,560
We managed to stop some of the assassins.

633
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,320
While the soldiers were escorting King Tongyang,

634
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,560
they were eager to evacuate

635
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,040
and did not care about us.

♫Hidden identity♫

647
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,250
I was presumptuous

They won't blame you.

669

You are the one

who blames yourself for everything.

671
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,130
They won't be at ease seeing you like this.

Let me tell you.

673
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:53,989
They've never

674

left me.

675
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,790
I see them every day

676
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,830
in my dream.

677
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,310
I've seen Xiaowu.

678
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,350
One day, Xiaowu...

679
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,630
was riding a big white horse.

680
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,110
I asked him, "Why are you here?"

681
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,110
When I turned back,

682
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,390
I saw that he brought a mysterious lady.

683
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:15,670
He told me,

684
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,350
"Bingzhu, I'm getting married soon."

685
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,670
I said, "Great!"

686
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,390
"It's great that you're getting married."

687
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,030
He said,

688
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,760
"I came to inform you."

689
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:31,510
I said,

690
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,510
"I'm going to attend your wedding."

691
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,240
He said, "Bingzhu,

692
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,750
it's too cold at my place.

693
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,670
You can't take it."

694
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,390
Gao Bingzhu.

695
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:56,710
Gao Bingzhu.

696
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,070
I don't want to wake up from my dream.

697
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,790
When I wake up,

698
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,200
it's really hurtful.

699
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,870
I've never had a good day for the past five years.

700
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,240
All of them died because of me.

701
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:14,990
If they were still alive,

702
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,990
they would have had kids,

703
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,310
and wives.

704
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,600
I'm left alone

705
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,110
surviving in the capital.

706
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,990
I really hate myself.

707
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,230
Stop it.

708
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,480
Please don't...

709
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,150
I...

710
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,070
Gao Bingzhu.

711
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,990
To them, you are a hero.

712
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,470
What you should do now

713
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,750
is to pull yourself together

714
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:37,990
and revenge for them.

715
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,110
Don't let them sacrifice for nothing.

716
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,230
They shouldn't be

717
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,510
dead for no reason.

718
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,910
The reason I'm still alive

719
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,470
is to revenge for them.

720
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,910
Thanks for talking to me.

721
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,270
It has been five years

722
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,440
since I talked to anyone

723
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,630
about this.

724
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,830
Be strong after this.

725
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,190
This is the closest I've been

726
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,630
to the clues.

727
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,990
You saved them.

728
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,270
No, it's you.

729
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,070
I have nothing to do with it.

730
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,550
But you saved me.

731
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,830
I'll keep my promise.
