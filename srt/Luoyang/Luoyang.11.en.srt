[Ep 11]

4
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:43,300
Do you dare to

5
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,780
have a cup of tea that I made for you?

6
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,260
It's good.

7
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,400
A nobody like me has

8
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,100
never had such great tea before.

9
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,860
What did you find last night?

10
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,370
Last night,

11
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,430
in Riverside Resort...

12
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,480
they were smelting some fine copper.

13
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,190
The stewed goose there was also great.

14
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:01,940
Yeah.

15
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,980
You'd tried it, right?

16
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,900
Of course.

17
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,220
Madam Wu has led Interior Guards

18
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,220
to raid Riverside Resort.

19
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,910
The source of the copper

20
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,520
will be clear soon.

21
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,380
No need to panic.

22
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,610
I couldn't care less

23
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,060
about who stole the copper

24
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,520
or what the copper was for.

25
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,670
Then what do you care about?

26
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,920
All I want is to find Four Season Clan.

27
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,280
You got the right person then.

28
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,620
I am Four Season Clan.

29
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,780
I killed Baili Yan and the others.

30
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,990
Because they had to die.

31
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,100
They got in my way.

32
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,980
I won't get in your way,

33
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,140
but the killer with the halberd,

34
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,980
he must die.

35
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,580
Then there's nothing I can do.

36
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,030
Riverside Resort's been exposed.

37
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:35,659
So you can't live.

38
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,340
Right?

39
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,060
You are smart,

40
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,730
but ridiculous, too.

41
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,020
Yunzhi, let's go back.

42
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,510
As you wish, my lady.

43
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,580
Turn around!

44
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,300
You guys

45
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,820
will die soon.

46
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,020
Why are you still bustling around

47
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,620
for the so-called truth?

48
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,250
What you should do

49
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,100
is to look carefully at the world.

50
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,300
A world that is going to fall.

51
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,390
What do you mean?

52
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,070
Stop laughing! Tell me.

53
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,440
Spit it out.

54
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,040
Listen!

55
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,380
You can't die.

56
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,380
Who's your contact in Four Season Clan?

57
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,380
Where's the killer

58
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,240
with a halberd?

59
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,460
To live or to die,

60
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,980
it's up to me.

61
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:39,790
Liu Ran.

62
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,340
Hongyi.

63
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,420
Hongyi.

64
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,300
You didn't come home last night.

65
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,390
I was so worried.

66
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,240
I'm fine.

67
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,520
Liu Ran,

68
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,580
why are you here?

69
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,250
I was worried that

70
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,400
Hongyi might be in danger

71
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,560
in Riverside Resort.

72
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,620
So I checked with Uncle this morning.

73
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,960
Have you seen anyone

74
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,730
with him?

75
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,160
No.

76
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,760
But he said a lot of strange things to me today.

77
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,680
Uncle...

78
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,850
Uncle... Uncle!

79
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,760
Uncle!

80
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,880
What happened to you?

81
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,840
Help! Somebody get in here!

82
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,600
Please help my uncle!

83
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,280
Uncle, look at me.

84
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:47,560
What happened to you? Uncle!

85
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,480
Somebody come help!

86
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,159
What happened?

87
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,010
Please help...

88
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,400
Help me.

89
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,320
Please help my uncle...

90
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,050
-Uncle!
-Gao Bingzhu.

91
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,370
What happened to you, Uncle?

92
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,890
Gao Bingzhu, why did you kill him?

93
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:05,330
Tell me,

94
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,460
why did you kill him?

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,600
What did he say?

96
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Don't fight here.

97
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,770
Stop it.

98
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,330
Outside!

99
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,810
Now!

100
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,130
I was going to

101
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,410
bring Hongyi to visit you.

102
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,720
Uncle.

103
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,040
Uncle!

104
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,580
What happened?

105
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,280
Why did you confront him alone?

106
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,540
You didn't wait for us!

107
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:33,289
Talk to me!

108
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,169
Did Liu Xiang kill my father?

109
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,840
Why did he do it?

110
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,940
What did he say?

111
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,130
Gao Bingzhu.

112
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
If he said nothing

113
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,840
when you confronted him,

114
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,970
why did you kill him?

115
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,450
I didn't.

116
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,230
He killed himself.

117
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,600
Even if he did,

118
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,700
it's because of you.

119
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:05,740
Gao Bingzhu.

120
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,570
At your friends' graves,

121
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,010
I swore

122
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,540
I would clear their names.

123
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,640
Why are you so stubborn?

124
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,840
Why did you act alone?

125
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,760
If it weren't for what you did,

126
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,090
Liu wouldn't have died.

127
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,540
Gao,

128
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,270
you only think about revenge.

129
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,930
But your revenge

130
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,770
isn't the only one that matters!

131
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,530
You're right.

132
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,560
I am stubborn.

133
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,250
I think about nothing but revenge.

134
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,360
But I am a lone wolf in this world.

135
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,650
I don't even trust my own shadow.

136
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,410
All I trust is my sword.

137
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,250
Gao Bingzhu.

138
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,000
I will never

139
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,060
believe you again.

140
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,600
Nor will I help you.

141
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,220
Gao Bingzhu.

142
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,600
You never really trusted me, did you?

143
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,160
I'm sorry.

144
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,320
I'll get going then.

145
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,050
Liu Ran.

146
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,320
Nothing. Go ahead.

147
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,690
Uncle.

148
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,360
Hongyi.

149
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,040
Hongyi.

150
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:13,600
Hongyi!

151
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,050
Hongyi.

152
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,240
Hongyi.

153
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,320
Why did Uncle die

154
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,530
all of a sudden?

155
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,920
Who killed him?

156
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,370
Please tell me.

157
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,520
Please.

158
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,810
What are you guys investigating?

159
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,760
Hongyi.

160
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,530
Tell me.

161
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,610
Are you

162
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,120
investigating my uncle?

163
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,680
Tell me the truth.

164
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
My father's death

165
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,250
has something to do with him.

166
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,280
Your Majesty.

167
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,400
When Interior Guards

168
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,980
raided Riverside Resort,

169
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,220
they found melting furnaces and counterfeit coins.

170
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,570
The evidence suggests the Duke did misappropriate copper

171
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,760
from Mount Lian Copper Mine.

172
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,200
However, Duke of Mount Wind knew he would get killed,

173
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,730
so he committed suicide.

174
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,090
It was Baili Yan last time.

175
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,010
Now it's Liu Xiang.

176
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,690
I'm afraid

177
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,210
no one around me can be trusted

178
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,570

Tell me,

180
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,130
what should be the sentence?

181
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,530
Your Majesty,

182
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,160
by law, Liu Xiang, Duke of Mount Wind,

183
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,730
should get the death penalty

184
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,010
and 100-stroke caning,

185
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,690
and his property confiscated.

186
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,920
His relatives should be reduced to plebeians

187
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,520
and never become officials.

188
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,680
I think no further discussion is needed

189
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,850
as it's clear to me.

190
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,610
Duke of Mount Wind was a nobleman.

191
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,680
His relatives

192
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,650
are all members of the nobility.

199
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,130
now that Duke of Mount Wind has committed suicide,

200
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,930

201

to confiscate his property as punishment.

204

Reducing his relatives to plebeians

205

may cause trouble in the court.

00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,040
Don't worry.

353
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,080
You've been doing a lot.

354
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,320
My lady,

355
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,370
please have some food.

356
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,600
I cooked Silkie chicken soup.

357
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,040
Please have some.

358
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,240
My lady.

359
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,120
I know you are depressed

360
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,990
because of the Duke's death.

361
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,960
But at least eat something.

362
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,250
When Father-in-law died,

363
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,800
I said the same thing to Hongyi.

364
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,090
I did not know

365
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,140
how he felt

366
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,330
until today.

367
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,730
Just now, His Lordship...

368
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,610
I saw him.

369
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,000
I know,

370
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,560
he's been here.

371
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,970
My lady.

372
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,400
If it were any other day,

373
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,670
I would greet him with a smile

374
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,090
when he came to my house.

375
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,480
But now,

376
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,040
Father-in-law's death

377
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,600
has a lot to do with Uncle.

378
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,660
Hongyi won't know

379
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,840
how to face me.

380
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,130
But,

381
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
I don't know how to face him, either.

382
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:39,480
Gao.

383
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,520
I feel like

384
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,440
you've been too tired living this way.

385
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,840
Too tired.

386
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,840
Then how am I supposed to live?

387
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,190
Or should I die?

388
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,530
Come on.

389
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,070
Why are you smiling, Sir?

390
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,930
I suddenly thought of
the Spicy Soup made by Liu Ran.

391
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,750
She put as many ingredients
as what are for the whole pot.

392
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,350
Lady Liu has been very caring.

393
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,250
It's rare for a noblewoman to do that.

394
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:01,840
Shen Fei.

395
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,120
What Liu Xiang did has nothing to do with my wife.

396
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,780
You must not

397
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,450
hold any grudge against her.

398
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:08,440
We won't.

399
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:14,700
[Spicy Soup]

400
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,330
Sir.

401
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,950
You don't need to weigh
fruits and vegetables for your soup.

402
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,610
Why do you weigh copper coins?

403
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,490
There are a lot of counterfeit coins nowadays.

404
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,240
They don't weigh enough.

405
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,670
If I didn't weigh them,

406
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,200
I'd have lost a lot of money.

407
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,960
I'll take the scale, sir.

408
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,080
Shen Fei.

409
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,870
How can you take my scale?

410
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,740
Do come back, my lord.

411
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,070
I'll be waiting for you.

412
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,210
I will.

413
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,330
Upstairs, my lord.

414
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,610
You finally came, my lord.

415
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,780
Come, my lord.

416
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,530
Coming.

417
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,420
You've got such a great life,

418
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,480
King of East River.

419
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,810
With just a clue related to charcoal,

420
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,440
you took down a big dog like Duke of Mount Wind.

421
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,330
It seems that you're something.

422
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,430
Nice wine.

423
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,400
Has the stolen copper

424
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,170
been found?

425
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:09,920
Yeah.

426
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,600
Madam Wu led Interior Guards

427
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,220
and raided the smelting plant

428
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,420
in Riverside Resort.

429
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,440
They seized 33,000 strings of counterfeit coins.

430
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,090
33,000 strings?

431
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,450
Don't tell others. Wait outside.

432
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,170
Yes, Ma'am.

433
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,390
The coins should be in the treasury.

434
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,320
If you're wrong,

435
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,940
I will be told off

436
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,770
by Sir Wu.

437
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,690
A big smelting plant like this

438
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,590
can produce 50,000 strings a day.

439
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,670
Duke of Mount Wind secretly moved copper to it.

440
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,080
How can there only be 33,000 strings?

441
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,120
I knew it.

442
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,070
The coins meet the weight standard.

443
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,750
They're even heavier than normal coins.

444
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,360
Really?

445
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,680
The counterfeit coins

446
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,210
are far less than the amount of stolen copper.

447
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,080
Something's wrong.

448
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,210
Wait.

449
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,310
Duke of Mount Wind stole copper from Mount Lian

450
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,560
to forge coins.

451
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,360
He's supposed to fake the weight

452
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,430
and line his pocket.

453
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,490
But why are these coins even heavier?

454
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,710
Seems like the Duke took his own life

455
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,360
to protect people higher up.

456
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,440
All of this has been misdirection.

457
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,960
The Duke killed himself

458
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,520
only to put an end to it.

459
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,130
The copper is not in Riverside Resort.

460
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,480
Who on earth

461
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,200
is behind all these?

462
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,660
The copper isn't in the Resort,

463
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,790
where else can it be?

464
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,650
Gao Bingzhu mentioned to me

465
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,250
maybe the Duke's death

466
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,000
is related to Four Season Clan.

467
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,390
Four Season Clan?

468
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,560
Four Season Clan.

469
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,830
It's an underground organization
that existed in the capital for years.

470
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,960
What happened recently

471
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,290
may be traced back to it.

472
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,240
But the Clan

473
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,760
was eliminated five years ago.

474
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,290
No one has heard of it since.

475
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,240
They assassinated my father.

476
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,590
Looks like it wasn't just for the Copper Mine.

477
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,790
The Capital is large.

478
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,930
But who can pull all this off

479
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,960
under the nose of the Interior Guards,

480
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,560
the Grand Court and my Intelligence Services?

481
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,700
Father died from Shachi Venom.

482
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,590
Now the Duke killed himself.

483
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,270
And that man and his daughter,

484
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,590
they were killed before they had a chance to speak.

485
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:40,190
If Four Season Clan is really behind all these,

486
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,770
what are they really after?

487
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,920
Now that the Duke is dead,

488
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,430
we'll have no one to question

489
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,690
about Master's death.

490
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,400
Right now, our priority

491
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,590
is to find the missing copper,

492
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,850
and figure out the bigger plan behind it.

493
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,560
But the Interior Guards

494
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,930
and the Grand Court officers

495
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,710
have searched everywhere in the capital.

496
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,970
Where else could it be?

497
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,440
It's definitely still here.

498
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:08,700
Probably it's just

499
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,960
hidden in plain sight,

500
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,240
and we missed it.

501
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,130
Give it to me.

502
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,610
Give it to me now.

503
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,500
Give me the bread.

504
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:46,320
-My flatbread.
-My flatbread.

505
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,360
Give it to me!

506
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,310
What's wrong?

507
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,120
I stained your shirt earlier.

508
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,080
Let me help you clean it.

509
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,740
No worries.

510
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,090
You are not from here, are you?

511
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,400
You must be rich.

512
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,010
You guys,

513
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,130
do you hang out here every day?

514
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:15,920
Of course.

515
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,719
We would have starved to death if we stayed home.

516
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,120
At least we get some bread

517
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,969
on the streets if we are lucky.

518
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:32,560
Don't you see outcomers here often?

519
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:36,320
Not the ones who dress as fancy as you.

520
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,570
A while ago,

521
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,420
some people came by

522
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,080
but they dressed just like us.

523
