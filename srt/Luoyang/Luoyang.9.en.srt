00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,130
Gao Bingzhu has been gone

179
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:45,790
for a while.

180
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,970
Did something happen to him?

181
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,760
There's another possibility.

182
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,220
He found the account book,

183
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,860
but he would not come back.

184
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,250
What do you mean?

185
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,170
Did Gao Bingzhu

186
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:58,850
ever tell you

187
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,580
that he wanted to work with you?

188
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,900
People like him...

189
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:03,970
can't be trusted.

190
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,180
I trust him.

191
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,250
Are you alright?

192
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,100
I'm still alive.

193
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,020
Where's the account book?

194
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:23,530
Here it is.

195
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,690
The records on the account book are messy.

196
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,640
The characters used are incomprehensible.

197
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,300
Take a look.

198
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,260
This is cipher text.

199
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,940
Only Liu Xiang's men can decode it.

200
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,410
I guess we need to

201
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,450
kidnap Liu Xiang.

202
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,570
Gao Bingzhu.

203
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:52,770
I promise you.

204
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,250
After the truth is unveiled,

205
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,730
Liu Xiang will be punished according to the law.

206
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,770
By then,

207
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,520
you would have your answers.

208
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,380
Can you make sense of it?

209
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,340
I can decode it.

210
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,570
But I need some time.

211
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,100
How long?

212
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,820
We're running out of time.

213
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:28,880
Liu Xiang knows that

214
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,160
the account book has been stolen.

215
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,490
Before he comes out with a countermeasure,

216
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,160
we need to decode

217
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
the account book.

218
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,360
I can ask the Intelligence Services to help.

219
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,400
They must have ways

220
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,260
to decode this.

221
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,660
Are they reliable?

222
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,650
If the Intelligence Services are not reliable,

223
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,240
the capital would have already fallen into chaos.

224
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,700
I told you. I can decode it.

225
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,780
Let's ask the Intelligence Services to help.

226
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,910
But this is something important.

227
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,520
I need to see the people from the Intelligence Services,

228
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,580
and personally watch them decode it.

229
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,280
I'll come up with something.

230
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,570
Why are you here?

231
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,570
Didn't I tell you

232
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,960
not to come without an appointment?

233
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,690
It's urgent.

234
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,130
If we don't act, something bad will happen.

235
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,920
It's not like you to be short-tempered.

236
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,010
That fool, Liu Xiang!

237
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,400
He lost the Chuiliu Corporation account book.

238
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,210
Records of shipment of Mount Lian Copper Mine are in there.

239
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,330
I'm afraid the Interior Guard Services have it now

240
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,530
and might have handed it to the empress.

241
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Duke of Mount Wind was too careless.

242
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,650
How could he be so reckless

243
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,080
when dealing with such important physical evidence?

244
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,730
The wealth of the Liu family took generations to build.

245
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,319
The Divine has also put a lot of effort into the business.

246
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,440
It would be a shame

247
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,230
if it suffered losses.

248
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:10,849
Senior brother.

249
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:12,380
Now is not the time for this.

250
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,010
We need to fix the problem.

251
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,339
That's more important.

252
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,970
I know.

253
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,280
Don't worry.

254
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,800
Please explain this to the Divine.

255
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,530
Mister.

256
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:27,869
Agent Han is here.

257
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,310
What did you find?

258
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,230
Mister.

259
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,200
I couldn't find the Falcon Tamer

260
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,730
who is related to Zhao Yang.

261
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,390
I did not complete my task.

262
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,470
Please punish me.

263
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,350
Han.

264
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,870
Get up.

265
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,670
These spies are too good at hidding.

266
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,800
Everyone in the Intelligence Services

267
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,150
is suspicious.

268
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,190
I think...

269
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,080
this time...

270
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,910
Should we seek for external help?

271
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,310
What do you mean?

272
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,640
Gao Bingzhu.

273
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,350
This is related to the secrets of the Intelligence Services.

274
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,350
If the job is done,

275
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,990
he must join the Intelligence Services.

276
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:23,950
But to join the Intelligence Services

277
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,430
means accepting difficult terms.

278
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,670
One must be emotionless and desireless.

279
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,550
As far as I know,

280
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,240
Gao Bingzhu has nothing

281
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,630
but only thinks about revenge.

282
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,360
It will be difficult for the Intelligence Services to control him.

283
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,480
Is there a better candidate?

284
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,710
This man

285
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,430
is a lone wolf.

286
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:48,830

287
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,270
think of a way

288
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,390
to rid of the hatred in his heart.

289
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,910
Go do it.

290
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:04,650
Yes sir.

291
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,110

292
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,680

This place?

295
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,110
I have asked Agent Han from the Intelligence Services to meet us here.

296
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,920
He'll help us.

[Fashan Temple]

298

It's hard to spot a stupa among ten thousand towers in Luoyang,

299
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,440
it's hard to find the twelve people among the blocks.

300
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,960
I've heard this saying before.

301
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,280
I couldn't understand it then.

302
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,760
Now I get it.

303
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,310
The Fashan Temple

304
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,170
is the Intelligence Services' stupa.

305
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,200
Stupa?

306
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,650
Is this the rendezvous spot of the Intelligence Services?

307
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,390
The Intelligence Services

308
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,550
can meet people anywhere.

309
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,150
But there are only 12 stupas.

310

That's why it is important.

must be related

You are Gao Bingzhu?

I am Han Dongqing, the agent of the Intelligence Services.

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,030
I thought the people of the Intelligence Services

321
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,230
won't show up easily.

322

Five years ago, you saved King Tongyang.

323
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,850
Why didn't you report your merit?

324
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,890
It's none of your business.

325

Your life had been changed as well.

327
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,280
Since you protected the capital,

328
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,740
why didn't you mention it?

329
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,830
I don't want to protect the capital.

00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,000

Among the kings in the capital,

466
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,750
the Crown Prince, King Jin, holds a high position.

467
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,790
He has no time for the corps.

Lord Chu from the Intelligence Services

476
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,470
must have the surname Li.

477
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,430
Go on.

478
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,230
In Fashan Temple,

479
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,260
there is a statue of Ksitigarbha.

Therefore,

487
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,590
the relationship between Lord Chu and King Dongchuan

488
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,320
is obvious.

489
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,630
Am I right?

490
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,370

to put down their swords.

494
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,750
I don't think

495

The mole in the Intelligence Services is hiding well.

499

We need to seek help from outsiders to find out the truth.

500
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,469
Both of us have the same goal,

501
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,150
which is to find out the Copper Mine.

502
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,270
If we find the Four Season Clan,

503
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,400
we'll find the mole,

504
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,010
and clean up the Intelligence Services.

505
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,040
If we are working together,

506
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,360
we need to be frank with each other.

507
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,110
In all the black markets in the capital,

508
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,830
there is no extra transaction for copper.

509
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:18,200
Instead, charcoal is circulating abnormally.

510
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:18,660
Enough.

511
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,070
I'll go and investigate.

512
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:24,640
Gao Bingzhu.

513
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,310
Don't disappoint Han

514
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,800

I have found out the truth about

516
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,030
the theft of the account book in the Liu Mansion.

517
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,360
The reason Madam Wu was injured

518
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,760
might be related to this.

519
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,190
Sir,

520
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,910
does the Liu family really have problems?

521
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,270
Liu Xiang looks guilty.

522
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,850
I think Siyue must have

523
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,050
found out the truth.

524
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,230
But she lacks concrete evidence.

525
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,350
Liu Xiang openly stirred up

526
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,270
trouble in the capital.

527
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,470
He even hurt Madam Wu.

528
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,570
Does he think

529
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,960
the Interior Guard Services are pushovers?

530
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,510
If people do not attack us, we don't attack them.

531
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,240
For this,

532
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,510
I won't let them go.

533
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:08,840
Beiqi,

534
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,520
find out about

535
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,630
the Liu family's wealth.

536
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,090
Yes sir.

537
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:29,390
Baitan,

538
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,510
if the Intelligence Services don't solve this big case,

539
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,370
I wouldn't know

540
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,710
how to explain it to the empress.

541
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,130
Are you meeting the empress tomorrow?

542
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,230
Later,

543
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,270
we split up.

544
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,110
[Interior Guard: Chen Wu]

545
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,310
Three of you go to the warehouse.

546
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,350
I'll go to the tavern.

547
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,030
Let's catch them

548
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,630
off guard.

549
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,830
Duke of Mount Wind has gone too far.

550
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,030
He even hurt Madam Wu.

551
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,560
We must teach him a lesson

552
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,930
or he'll think that we're pushovers.

553
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:05,870
Eat up.

554
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:06,680
Alright.

555
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,120
Stand aside!

556
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,200
Stand aside!

557
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,930
Stand aside!

558
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,050
Search!

559
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,480
Mister,

560
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,150
what are you looking for?

561
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,270
The Interior Guard Services don't have to tell you

562
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,600
what we're looking for.

563
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,000
There must be some misunderstanding.

564
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,150
This is Duke of Mount Wind's property.

565
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,670
We are investigating Duke of Mount Wind.

566
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,330
Move aside!

567
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,880
Duke of Mount Wind,

568
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,150
another one is destroyed.

569
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,610
This...

570
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,070
I know. Leave.

571
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,050
Yes sir!

572
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,850
Duke of Mount Wind.

573
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,170
Those interior guards have gone too far.

574
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,510
Your Majesty, you know

575
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,630
Siyue's temper.

576
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,830
She will never admit defeat.

577
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,030
This time,

578
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,590
with Your Majesty's edict,

579
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,950
she'll dig for the truth

580
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,190
even if it's dangerous.

581
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,530
She's just like me.

582
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,790
The case of the informer is extremely complicated.

583
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:27,710
The specific inside story

584
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,000
and the news from the Intelligence Services

585
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,330
must be corroborative.

586
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,630
But the Liu family...

587
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:36,310
The Liu family in Hedong has been a prominent family for centuries.

588
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:39,190
Now, they lead the noble families.

589
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,880
The established noble families that follow them

590
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,270
are numerous.

591
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:46,710
Your Majesty.
