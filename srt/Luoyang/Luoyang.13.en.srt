Your father?

Your father was nothing

but a slug to me.

Wang Dengcheng committed the crime.

Why are you being his scapegoat?

153
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,240
Rebellion is a felony.

154

155

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,330
It's none of your business.

178
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,600
I will arrest

179
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,330
Wang Dengcheng

180
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,530
and make him confess.

181
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,280
The rebellion started by Song Liang
was put down.

182
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,130
It's the blessing of Your Majesty's destiny.

183
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,520
You have supreme wisdom

184
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,600
and authority, Your Majesty.

185
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,950
The people in the capital are so blessed

186
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,140
to be protected by you, Your Majesty.

187
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,500
[The King of Jin, Wu Shenxing]

188
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,000
In my humble opinion,

189
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,150
Your Majesty can make an order

190
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,060
to change Yuan into Tianyou.

191
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,220
I'm not calling you here

192
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,860
to listen to your terrible ideas.

193
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,810
What do you think of Song Liang's rebellion?

194
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,900
It's strange, indeed.

195
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,620
You used to be the Minister of War.

196
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,520
If you were Song Liang...

197
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,300
It was the past.

198
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:15,940
Well...

199
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,220
Don't panic.

200
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,860
I'm asking you

201
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,490
why Song Liang rebelled against the Court?

202
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,570
Song Liang was originally a soldier

203
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,690
and moved up because of his achievements.

204
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,930
He didn't have friends in the Court.

205
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,620
He counted on himself.

206
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,700
He was promoted

207
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,460
to be the Minister of War

208
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,340
because of his loyalty to you.

209
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
I trusted him

210
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,120
because he didn't align with anyone.

211
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,570
Yes.

212
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,050
He had no allies

213
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,130
and was totally supported
by you, Your Majesty.

214
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,140
Why did he do this?

215
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,900
That's the point.

216
00:12:58,970 --> 00:12:59,940
Go investigate

217
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,310
everyone that was involved

218
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,050
in this case.

219
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

220
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:06,460
Huan,

221
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,730
is he still on his knees outside?

222
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:17,380
[Palace of Immortality]

223
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:12,820
Alright,

224
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,610
if he insists.

225
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

226
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,810
Your Highness,

227
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,620
It's late.

228
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,960
What's the point of kneeling down here?

229
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,980
Go apologize

230
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,630
to Her Majesty

231
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,030
for the mistake you made.

232
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,670
She likes you the most

233
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,220
among all the kids.

234
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,100
Don't displease her

235
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,870
just for the sake of your pride.

236
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,500
You're right, Lord Wu.

237
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,470
[Palace of Immortality]

238
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,320
Her Majesty won't call you in today.

239
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,220
[Palace of Immortality]

240
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,940
Please go back, Your Highness.

241
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,460
Madam Huan,

242
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,650
Agent Han Dongqing from my Services

243
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,470
was assassinated

244
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,730
before the rebellion,

245
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,320
so that Song Liang

246
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,380
could use the chaos as a cover.

247
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,580
Anyway,

248
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,900
it was my fault.

249
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,300
Please don't blame

250
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,920
the Intelligence Services.

251
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,970
It's too late.

252
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:26,460
[Palace of Immortality]

253
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,590
Back then, all officials proposed

254
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,640
to weed out the Intelligence Services.

255
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,310
Her Majesty rejected their proposal

256
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,640
and let you be in charge.

257
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,460
You are more capable than

258
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,740
any other children of hers.

259
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,960
You are managing an intelligence-gathering

260
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
department for Her Majesty.

261
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,890
You should've made her reassured.

262
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
Her Majesty asked me to tell you that

263
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,940
someone else will have to take over

264
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,980
the position as Lord Chu

265
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,850
if you can't manage the Services well

266
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,880
and make her reassured.

267
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,910
[Palace of Immortality]

268
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:50,900
Also,

269
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,520
Her Majesty has assigned the King of Jin

270
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,490
to investigate Song Liang's case thoroughly.

271
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,220
The Intelligence Services
should stay out of it.

272
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,530
Madam Huan, you used the exfoliator.

273
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,940
No wonder your skin

274
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,530
is smooth and glowing.

275
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,540
I told you

276
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,170
not to come over

277
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,150
during such a chaotic period.

278
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,840
Her Majesty asked me to investigate

279
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,610
Song Liang's allies in the rebellion.

280
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,240
The more I do,

281
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,020
the more uneasy I am.

282
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,420
Chill.

283
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,180
Just keep it up.

284
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,030
If I find someone

285
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,270
that isn't supposed to be exposed...

286
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,180
You...

287
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,320
You've been working for Her Majesty
for so long.

288
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,420
You should know her well.

289
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,300
You definitely know her the best.

290
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,980
Please give me some hints.

291
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,330
Which officials

292
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,380
are Song Liang close to?

293
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:11,770
Why did she ask you,

294
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,230
a person from the Wu family, to investigate?

295
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,010
Just investigate all you want.

296
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,360
Perhaps, Song Liang has already known

297
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,820
he is doomed,

298
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,610
and will tell you some names.

299
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,940
Also,

300
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,350
you've already

301
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,610
got a suspect.

302
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,130
Interrogate him.

303
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,480
You can focus on his relationship
with Song Liang.

304
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,850
Greetings, Your Highness.

305

306

you don't have to do this. We are family.

Thanks, Your Highness.

308
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,859
Have a seat.

309
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,140
What did you

310
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:15,020
call me here for today?

311
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,690
You are well aware.

312
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,500
You don't have to play dumb

313
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,180
in front of me.

314
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,040
I really have no idea.

315
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,430
The Interior Guard Services defeated
Song Liang's troops.

316
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,980
It's such an achievement.

317
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,130
Because of you,

318
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,060
Her Majesty thinks a lot of our family.

319
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:36,980
I'm flattered.

320
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,350
I've heard that

321
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,020
Siyue helped a lot.

322
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,180
In the entire Wu family,

323
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,570
you two suffered the most.

324
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,650
Now,

325
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,440
you are the most outstanding ones.

326
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,990
The Wu family

327
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,790
will count on you two from now on.

328
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,330
I'm flattered.

329
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,450
It's good enough that

330
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,000
my poor health

331
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,470
isn't a burden to others.

332
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,050
You do need to

333
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,130
look after yourself.

334
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,470
Two Minister positions

335
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,940
have been opened

336
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,340
in the Court.

337
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,060
I want to propose to Her Majesty

338
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,620
and recommend you

339
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,300
to fill one of them.

340
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,980
Your Highness,

341
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,360
our family

342
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,810
is already full of glories.

343
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,390
I don't need to serve

344
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,850
in a high position.

345
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,420
You can just tell me

346
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,210
what you need me to do.

347
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,500
Song Liang must have been supported
by someone.

348
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,100
Her Majesty won't be immortal.

349
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,210
Who will benefit from this incident the most

350
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,850
if she passes away?

351
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,100
I think it should only be

352
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,220
someone from the Eastern Palace.

353
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,400
You need to be discreet, Your Highness.

354
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,340
You should have evidence.

355
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,670
You have the evidence.

356
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,260
Youjue,

357
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,150
I've learned that

358
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,480
you arrested a person called Gao Bingzhu.

359
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,870
It's quite interesting.

360
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,100
Gao Bingzhu

361
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,350
is from the Ghetto.

362
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,180
He is the son of criminals.

363
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,170
Surprisingly, he made friends
with Song Liang.

364
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,770
The Crown Prince was ambushed
on his way back to the capital.

365
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,070
Gao Bingzhu was unexpectedly

366
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,500
on the scene.

367
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,820
Do you mean

368
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,040
he has something

369
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,570
to do with the Crown Prince?

370
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,660
It doesn't matter.

371
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,630
What matters is

372
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,180
he can make a confession

373
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,050
and mention the Eastern Palace a few times.

374
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,260
Her Majesty will surely...

375
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,030
However, Her Majesty won't trust

376
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,060
the confession he makes

377
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,590
if he was forced to confess

378
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,390
by the Interior Guard Services.

379
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,220
What would you like to do?

380
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,180
If you agree,

381
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,000
I'll transfer him

382
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,210
to the Grand Court.

383
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,190
Gao Sheng, the Minister of Justice,

384
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,460
hates his guts.

385
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,490
If Lord Gao interrogated him himself,

386
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,980
we could relax

387
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,730
and expect good news.

388
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,260
Since you've made a decision,

389
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,940
I'll have to agree.

390
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,540
The soup is done.

391
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:58,990
Song Liang.

392
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:03,270
[Song Liang]

393
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,220
Song Liang.

394
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,130
Long time no see.

395
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:08,500
Gao Sheng.

396
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,040
I didn't confess even under the torture

397
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,180
of the Grand Court.

398
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,330
Why did you still come here?

399
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,970
I'm here to ask

400
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,050
what regrets you have.

401
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,980
I can do something for you.

402
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,440
A person who fails to get power
becomes a prisoner.

403
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,380
I don't have

404
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,100
any regrets.

405
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,930
It's just a shame that

406
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,360
I can't see

407
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,850
you lackeys

408
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,570
get killed one day.

409
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,210
I don't understand.

410
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,940
Her Majesty appreciated you so much,

411
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,200
but you rebelled against her

412
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,860
with your troops.

413
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,820
Her Majesty?

414
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,100
She is a hypocritical and vicious woman.

415
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,560
She doesn't deserve the throne.

416
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,970
She is mean and cold.

417
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,920
She killed her husband and children,

418
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,070
maltreated honorable officials,

419
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,290
disrespectfully scattered ashes,

420
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,310
and had bodies dug out to be flogged.

421
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,460
Does she deserve to be in authority?

422
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,330
Digging out bodies to be flogged...

423
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,120
You mean Lu Jing,

424
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,650
the grandfather of Qu Jiye.

425
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,850
What's your relationship with Qu Jiye?

426
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,900
Years ago,

427
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,690
that evil woman was only a noble lady.

428
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,320
The late Emperor wanted
to make her the Empress,

429
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,070
but officials like Song Wuji

430
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,980
strongly disapproved.

431
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,100
At that critical time,

432
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,460
only Lord Lu defended her

433
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,940
and saved her life.

434
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,300
Without Lord Lu's help,

435
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,090
she couldn't have become who she is today,

436
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,090
but his grave ended up being dug

437
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,980
and his body was flogged.

438
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,570
You didn't rebel

439
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,350
just for what happened

440
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,620
twenty years ago, did you?

441
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,780
You must have been
under someone's instigation.

442
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,260
Gao Sheng,

443
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,610
stop trying to get information from me.

444
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,170
I don't want to live anymore.

445
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:14,610
Song Liang,

446
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,850
your charge comes with the death penalty
on your whole family.

447
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,270
Your family

448
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,770
will have to die with you.

449
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,550
You will also be

450
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,210
cast aside by the whole world.

451
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,430
I can reassure you that

452
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,820
your family will be safe

453
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,620
if you can tell me

454
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,540
who instigated you to do so.

455
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,940
My whole family will die.

456
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,740
So what?

457
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:43,850
Gao Sheng,

458
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,470
face the reality.

459
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,950
The country won't be dominated

460
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,350
by the Wu family for long.

461
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,740
You lackeys will die

462
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,940
on the day

463
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,050
when the evil Empress gets killed.

464
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,860
Let's wait and see.

465
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,970
I'm just slightly ahead of you.

466
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,260
I will wait for you on the way to hell.

467
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,370
[In Memory of Baili Yan]

468
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,130
Our marriage was originally

469
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,590
arranged by our families.

470
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,900
My father is dead,

471
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,810
and your uncle killed himself out of guilt.

472
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,080
I think our marriage...

473
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,860
Are you pushing me away?

474
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,710
I know

475
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,710
what you have done

476
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,570
for the Baili family.

477
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,740
Once our marriage ends,

478
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,990
you can have all the fortune of the Baili family.

479
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,850
I won't take any.

480
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,080
What kind of person do you think I am?

481
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,700
I know what's on your mind.

482
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,380
I want to ask you.

483
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,250
If my uncle hadn't killed your father,

484
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,180
would you have accepted me?

485
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,690
You are different

486
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,060
from him.

487
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,250
I won't blame you

488
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,980
for his mistakes.

489
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:36,540
It's just a waste of time for you

490
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,060
to be with me.

491
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,180
I'm happy with

492
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,180
what you said.

493
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,660
Don't worry.

494
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,690
I won't badger you.

495
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,500
I will leave as soon as

496
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,580
you get the divorce notice ready.

497
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:17,610
My lord,

498
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,790
there is a letter from Madam Wu.

499
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,450
Can Gao Bingzhu clear his name

500
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,050
if Wang Dengcheng is caught?

501
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,820
Not really.

502
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,660
You're aware of it.

503
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,500
Then why did you ask me for help?

504
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,510
I will keep trying

505
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,560
even if it's a small chance.

506
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,760
Without Gao Bingzhu,

507
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,300
the capital would have been disrupted

508
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,760
and many people
would have lost their lives.

509
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,260
Are you going

510
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,310
to do nothing

511
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,310
and watch him die?

512
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,300
I guess

513
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,320
Wang Dengcheng still has Gao Bingzhu's mother.

514
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,730
Right.

515
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,290
I went to the Ghetto.

516
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,290
I didn't find her.

517
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,130
Wang must have taken her away.

518
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,240
Gao's mother is old and vulnerable.

519
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,450
She can't get out of town
without a carriage.

520
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,250
That's to say,

521

00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,500
if he had wanted to catch me.

694
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,060
He sees you as a brother.

695
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,040
How about you?

696
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,980
Do you see him as the same?

697
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,260
Madam Wu,

698
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
I will go with you.

699
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,090
Take me back to save him.

700
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,610
Please save him.

701
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,840
I will surely save him

702
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,660
if you go with me.

703
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,480
I'll make sure his mother is taken care of.

704
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,810
You don't have to worry.

705
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,980
Thank you, Madam.

706
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,210
Let's go.

707
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:29,980
Anesthetic.

708
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,330
My life is cheap, huh?

709
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,140
Why?

710
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:35,420
Why?

711
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,650
Why?

712
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,260
Why do the Ghetto folks

713
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,450
have to live like rats?

714
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,220
Why do we have to live in sewers forever?

715
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,940
Are we that worthless?

716
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,139
Are we your puppets?

717
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:12,570
I'm looking for a way out for my people.

718
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,630
What did I do wrong?

719
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,010
There is nothing wrong.

720
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,540
I'm not wrong.

721
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,170
I did nothing wrong.

722
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,050
Shen Fei, what's the time?

723
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,060
It's already evening.

724
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,449
It has been four hours.

725
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,219
Right. Madam Wu hasn't come back.

726
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,710
Technically, it will only take two hours

727
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,469
to go to Zeyan Peak and back.

728
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,600
It has been four hours now.

729
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,860
She must be in trouble.

730
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:56,719
I can go find her now.

731
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,520
It's useless.

732
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,530
If Wang Dengcheng got her,

733
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,020
he must've taken her somewhere else.

734
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,130
What should we do now?

735
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,240
You stay here.

736
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,170
I'm going out.

737
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,140
My lord.

738
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,250
[Red Silk House]

739
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,620
Sir,

740
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,330
this place has been reserved.

741
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,790
Please go somewhere else.

742
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:25,840
I am Baili Hongyi.

743
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,770
I need to see the King of East River.

744
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,420
Let him in.

745
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,100
Greetings, Your Highness.

746
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,460
You are known as

747
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,900
a gourmand in the capital.

748
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,460
I'm surprised that

749
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,870
you are a fan of this place as well.

750
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,580
Come on in.

751
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,330
I'm here just to see

752
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,460
a person.

753
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:46,650
Who?

754
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,530
Lord Chu of the Intelligence Services.

755
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,540
You can leave now, girls.

756
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:58,890
Alright. Go.

757
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,050
-Yes.
-Yes.

758
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:00,860
Go.

759
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,850
You want to see Lord Chu.

760
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,100
Why did you come to me?

761
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,550
Madam Wu went to find

762
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,720
Wang Dengcheng, the Ghetto officer,

763
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,320
to prove Gao Bingzhu's innocence,

764
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,250
but Wang Dengcheng kidnapped her.

765
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,880
I hope, Your Highness...

766
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,340
I hope that Lord Chu can get

767
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,000
Gao Bingzhu

768
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,260
out of the Grand Court.

769
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,680
You can ask Wu Youjue

770
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,220
if you want to save Madam Wu.

771
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,210
Why do you need the Intelligence Services?

772
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,800
Wang Dengcheng is in hiding.

773
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,860
Only Gao Bingzhu can

774
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,780
find him.

775
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,580
Madam Wu went to find Wang.

776
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,040
It was a secret operation.

777
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,680
Things would go out of control

778
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,300
if Sir Wu knew about it.

779
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:39,370
Then, why are you asking me for help?

780
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,200
Your Highness, people say that

781
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,000
you're a playboy in the capital,

782
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,370
but you're actually genuine
and happy to help people.

783
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,650
Madam Wu is in trouble.

784
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,500
Lord Chu,

785
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,020
I guess you won't just stand aside.
