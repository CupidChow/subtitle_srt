Why isn't that lotus lamp lightened?

The lamps were only allowed
 to be handled by Agent Han.

He's dead now,

You've been focusing on revenging

21

It's because you don't trust anyone.

and yet your Services had no idea.

33
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,120
You were too old-fashioned with recruiting.

He must know something about them.

58

It's inappropriate for us to ask the Grand Court

59

Sometimes,

65

the inspectors might be trapped
 by seaweed and drown.

If you run into any danger underwater,

71

you can take the elixir and wait for rescue.

but I might be able to find one or two.

'When the Hidden Phoenix shows up,
 the world will collapse.'

It was Song Liang that led an army to save him.

365
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,310
and the places he's frequently visited
 since five years ago?

366
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,390
I was also wondering

367
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:18,970
why the 16th Night

368
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,310
showed up in the arsenal.

Supposedly,

370

Song Liang has been

371
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,150
working with the Divine since five years ago.

372
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,070
Song Liang earned merit
 because he wiped out the Divine.

373
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,390
So, the arsenal and the coup he plotted

374
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,800
was not the first time
 he's cooperated with the Divine.

375
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,820
Their first cooperation
 dates back to five years ago

376
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,200
when he wiped out the Divine
 and caught Lord Freedom.

377
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,160
Besides, the Divine was never wiped out.

378
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,810
Only the kin of Lord Freedom were killed.

379
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,730
Someone in the Divine must've colluded
 with Song Liang

380
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,010
and sold Lord Freedom out.

381

It should be the same person

that helped Song Liang
 with the arsenal and the coup.

383

So, Song Liang and this person

384
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,240
must've gotten in touch five years ago.

As long as we catch Ruo'an,

509
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,500
the mole will become

510
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,530
a kite with broken strings.

511
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,920
He will not be able to send intel back to the Divine.

512
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,360
You should go back.

513
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,440
I will have someone search here thoroughly.

514
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:30,680
Madam Wu,

515
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,250
what do you mean?

516
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,770
Your duty is to oversee,

517
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:41,730
not to enforce the law.

518
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,450
You haven't forgotten your role, have you?

519
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:45,380
Gao Bingzhu.

520
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,720
Hongyi, you must be hungry.

521
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,930
Have some food.

522
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,280
Tea?

523
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,170
Liu Ran...

524
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,410
Hongyi...

525
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:53,810
It's hot.

526
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,290
No, it's not.

527
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,570
Not hot at all.

528
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,040
It's late. Have some rest.

529
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,250
I'll help you undress.

530
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,280
No need.

531
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,159
It's usually Shen Fei's job.

532
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,290
I'd hate to bother you with it.

533
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,610
How would you like to sleep?

534
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,570
I mean...

535
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,690
Which side of the bed do you prefer?

536
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,290
I don't mind.

537
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,730
You're hogging the cover.

538
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:04,530
Liu Ran...

539
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,320
Hongyi, you...

540
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,090
You're hogging the cover.

541
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,200
Here.

542
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,360
Good night.

543
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,520
Good night?

544
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,450
Good night, then.
