the guards said...

178
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,020
The layout here is not right.

179
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,940
There's something wrong with the axis.

180
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,340
Based on the topography,

181
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,170
you should apply

182
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,490
the axis of symmetry.

183
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,490

are misplaced.

00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,190
Chen Que of the Grand Court was killed,

351
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,740
but the assassin let me go.

352
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,660
It's not that I've never suspected you.

353
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,320
It's just that I don't want to.

354
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,650
Yao,

355
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,950
you've gone to all that trouble

356
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,730
just for me.

357
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,090
Finally, this day has come.

358
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,070
Finally, I don't have to

359
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,440
hide my identity from you.

360
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,570
Today,

361
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,000
I want to tell you my story.

362
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:34,940
Okay.

363
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,380
Go ahead.

364
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,860
Do you know?

365
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,100
When I was little,

366
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,570
my father sold me

367
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:57,910
to an outlander

368
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,210
that was passing by

369
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,500
in exchange for a bag of rice.

370
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,370
Do you know

371
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,700
who that outlander was?

372
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,300
Someone in the Clan.

373
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,370
Father!

374
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,740
Father!

375
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,260
Father!

376
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,460
Father!

377
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,900
Father!

378
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,650
Father!

379
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,980
My father didn't even look back.

380
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,420
He just left.

381
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,140
Then, the Clan

382
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,420
recruited hundreds of kids like me.

383
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,610
We were kept together

384
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,340
and taught martial arts.

385
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,960
We were taught how to kill.

386
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,980
Do you know what the first mission

387
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,460
the Clan assigned me was?

388
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,930
To kill.

389
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,780
To kill all of those people.

390
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,170
To kill all the other kids.

391
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,340
Only three of us

392
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,690
could survive.

393
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,690
I was thinking,

394
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,010
'Only three can live.

395
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,420
It's either me

396
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,500
or...'

397
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,680
Never mind.

398
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:29,900
I shall kill.

399
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,300
Kill!

400
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,450
Kill!

401
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,650
At last,

402
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,970
I was the only one alive

403
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,290
because the other two

404
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,100
were killed by me.

405
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,190
At that moment, I realized that

406
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,930
it doesn't matter

407
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,370
if you're noble, poor, good, or bad.

408
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,910
As long as you can stay alive

409
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,340
and accomplish your mission,

410
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,410
you can kill

411
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,550
all you want.

412
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,850
You can kill all you want?

413
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,540
So, you killed Master Kang?

414
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,610
He was never your husband.

415
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,050
He was your target.

416
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,150
I failed the mission.

417
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,220
[Master Kang, disciple of Four Season Clan]

418
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:25,730
I will take punishment

419
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,060
from the Lady of Autumn.

420
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,440
Why are you doing this?

421
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,970
She said that

422
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,020
you don't need to go back.

423
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:33,860
Yao,

424
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:35,980
I've been staying

425
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,660
in Luoyang for about ten years.

426
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,820
I've been running Ji Shan Fang

427
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,850
for half a decade.

428
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,660
I've done a lot

429
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,300
for the Lady of Autumn.

430
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,410
If you kill me now,

431
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,090
what the Clan

432
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,460
has achieved in Luoyang over the years

433
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,220
will go to waste, Yao.

434
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,620
I know I botched the mission

435
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,680
because I wanted to

436
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,600
take credit.

437
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,020
The Lady of Autumn always listens to you.

438
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,380
Please, ask her to show mercy.

439
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,340
Please, I have always been...

440
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,210
Kang,

441
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,800
the Lady of Autumn has asked me

442
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,210
to take over Ji Shan Fang

443
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,220
from now on.

444
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,820
Then, one day,

445
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,100
I met you.

446
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:30,730
I realized that

447
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,940
life could be different.

448
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,370
You shall pay back the debt

449
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,220
owed by Master Kang when he was alive.

450
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,740
If you're a smart lady,

451
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,060
then come home with me.

452
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,770
I'll give you everything you want.

453
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,770
How's that sound?

454
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,170
Huh?

455
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,700
Do you all want to die?

456
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,050
Do you know who I am?

457
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,460
I am a Well officer!

458
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,370
Listen carefully!

459
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,340
She's my girl.

460
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,820
If you dare to even touch her,

461
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,940
I will cut off your tongues

462
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,940
to feed dogs.

463
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,330
It's only right and proper to pay back your debt.

464
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,020
If you don't get in my way,

465
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,620
I'll let you go today.

466
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,340
Otherwise...

467
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,460
What's your name?

468
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,580
Yao.

469
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,660
Yao,

470
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,410
be my witness.

471
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,620
No matter how many people

472
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,620
are killed today,

473
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,030
if the authorities ask,

474
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,830
it's these people that started it.

475
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
Step back.

476
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,260
Further back.

477
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,340
Further back.

478
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,900
Boss...

479
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,450
I'll show mercy to you today.

480
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:30,950
Let's wait and see.

481
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,250
Let's go.

482
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,380
Thank you.

483
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,250
It was nothing.

484
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:47,930
I wanted to

485
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,410
kill someone for fun.

486
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,420
You are a woman.

487
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,980
It's not easy to run a casino in Luoyang on your own.

488
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,130
If it's too taxing,

489
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,450
sell it and live a comfortable life.

490
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,380
Sir!

491
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,140
What's your name?

492
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,780
Gao Bingzhu.

493
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,890
I was too naive back then.

494
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,730
I played the hero to save you.

495
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,140
You are a killer

496
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,740
who's taken countless lives.

497
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,730
You knew all along

498
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,140
that I wouldn't kill them.

499
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,930
Back then,

500
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,660
you were only trying to scare off those rascals.

501
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,020
I was just amazed that

502
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,050
you'd never killed before,

503
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,850
and yet, you were willing to do it

504
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,380
for me, a total stranger!

505
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,740
I was so moved.

506
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:13,740
However,

507
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,100
it was too late.

508
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,260
I met you too late in life.

509
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,060
I couldn't stop what I was doing.

510
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,860
Five years ago,

511
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,980
you and your friends showed up

512
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,020
where you were not supposed to.

513
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,420
You don't have the right to talk about them!

514
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,130
Are we there?

515
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,260
Almost. Over there!

516
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,400
Well...

517
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,340
Bingzhu!

518
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,050
Bingzhu!

519
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,540
They're all dead.

520
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,940
All dead.

521
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,100
These hands...

522
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,550
You stabbed my friends to death
with these hands, right?

523
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,730
I was so foolish that

524
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,790
I thought of you as my closest friend.

525
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,900
Five years later,

526
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,760
you killed that man and his daughter.

527
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:46,120
[Kill the informers]

528
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,700
His daughter was only 12 years old.

529
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,630
Do you know that?

530
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,640
Then, you killed Chen Que.

531
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,740
You left the halberd on the spot on purpose,

532
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,540
because you knew I'd follow up on it.

533
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,970
Indeed, I found that the halberd

534
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,780
was made with copper from Mount Lian.

535
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,040
Copper from Mount Lian

536
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,020
could only be connected with Baili Yan.

537
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,420
So, you went the extra miles

538
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,700
to lure me to the Baili Mansion,

539
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,300
hoping to frame Baili Yan's death

540
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,690
on me.

541
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,970
Is there any way to get me

542
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,230
into the wedding at the Baili Mansion?

543
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,020
To make me give up on the investigation,

544
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,140
you brought all those boatmen

545
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,140
to have a row here.

546
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,580
They were so loud 'cause they wanted to
attract my attention.

547
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,540
Then, you lured me

548
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,270
onto the boat

549
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,100
to fight against you.

550
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,420
You made me think I had killed the 16th Night.

551
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,970
If I hadn't done all that,

552
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,770
you would've been dead long ago.

553
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,910
There were countless times when you got in my way

554
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,180
and disrupted the Clan's plan.

555
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:09,860
If others had done that,

556
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,190
I'd have killed them without hesitation.

557
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,810
You were so determined on the investigation.

558
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,020
I couldn't even fool you

559
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,000
even if I had someone pretend to be me.

560
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,450
As the 16th Night,

561
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,900
I should've killed you hundreds of times.

562
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,970
As Yao, however,

563
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,330
I couldn't do it.

564
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,860
You went to all that trouble for me.

565
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,530
Still,

566
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,220
you figured everything out.

567
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,820
The 16th Night...

568
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,250
Wait for me here.

569
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,220
Where did Gao Bingzhu go?

570
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,840
What's he investigating?

571
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:21,930
I don't know.

572
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,220
Where did he go?

573
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,220
Who is he meeting?

574
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,180
I don't know.

575
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,860
You should know him well.

576
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,040
Over the years,

577
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,740
he's been willing to risk his life

578
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,400
to avenge his friends' death.

579
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,300
Since he joined you,

580
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,560
he's become one of you.

581
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,810
Do you

582
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,780
want him to be killed?

583
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,210
Can you

584
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,540
or Lord Chu

585
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,980
protect him?

586
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,500
I can.

587
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,580
Tell me where he is.

588
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,660
Why did you shave your beard?

589
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,210
It's time.

590
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:15,970
[It's your last chance. Kill both Gao Bingzhu and Baili Hongyi]

591
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,070
The 16th Night,

592
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,300
this is your last chance.

593
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,510
Do not let me down this time.

594
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,060
Bingzhu.

595
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,650
Bingzhu,

596
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,980
does this outfit look familiar?

597
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,490
And this.

598
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,020
I greet

599
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:25,050
noble guests

600
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,699
every day,

601
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,580
but someone like me

602
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,900
could only

603
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,620
hide in the darkest corner

604
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,770
and watch you from afar.

605
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,020
I envy Wu Siyue.

606
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,659
That young lady...

607
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,050
She can stay by your side in broad daylight

608
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,850
and help you do all those things.

609
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,460
I, however, couldn't tell you anything

610
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,020
even if I'd done so much for you.

611
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,480
It's all because of this outfit I'm wearing.

612
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,380
You don't get to compare yourself with her.

613
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,060
Gao Bingzhu,

614
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,780
my mission today

615
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,020
is to kill you.

616
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,010
If you die,

617
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,820
I can live.

618
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,620
Bingzhu,

619
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,540
I am sorry.

620
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,130
I won't lie to you anymore.

621
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,540
Yao!
