00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:17,780
he could be

177
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,980
a monk who collected alms,

178
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,460
a starving beggar,

179
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,260
or a customer in the Cakery.

180
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,100
However,

181
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,150
no matter what he looked like,

182
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,160
he always took this bowl with him.

183
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,180
I've sent extra men

184
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,410
to keep watch on all the stores

185
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,020
and continue

186
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,150
looking for Ruo'an.

187
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,550
Remind them that

188
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,690
he is good at disguising.

189
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,730
He's been sending messages

190
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,300
for Four Season Divine.

191
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,380
He must be very discreet.

192
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,490
If they find him,

193
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,340
don't take action unless they're well prepared.

194
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,380
Try to keep him alive.

195
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,020
Don't worry.

196
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,180
I'll be in charge of this.

197
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,140
I won't let him get away...

198
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:46,740
It's fine.

199
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,550
I have other plans for you.

200
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,590
I don't know what he looks like.

201
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,940
I...I only recognize this bowl.

202
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,260
The person who came every time

203
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,170
was different.

204
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,550
As long as he took this bowl,

205
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,810
whether he was a monk, or a beggar,

206
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,700
I just hid the message in the pie

207
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,100
and put it in the bowl.

208
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,100
Then, I'd get a large sum of money when I came home.

209
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,740
On the third of that month,

210
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,740
I remembered that

211
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,780
he dressed like an elder lady.

212
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,580
My lady!

213
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,660
My lady!

214
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,940
Yunzhi.

215
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,690
My lady,

216
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,170
where were you?

217
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,140
I'm worried about you.

218
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,170
Are you alright?

219
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,530
I'm fine.

220
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,500
Shen Fei got hurt!

221
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,370
So did Lord Baili!

222
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,480
Yunzhi,

223
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,200
find a doctor for Shen Fei.

224
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,210
Yes.

225
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,270
Hongyi, it's fine.

226
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,650
It heals quickly.

227
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,850
I'll help you with...

228
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,980
How did he find you in the first place?

229
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,780
A beggar brought me a note.

230
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,540
It said that

231
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,900
once I hid the note in the pie

232
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,460
and gave it out the other day,

233
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,860
I would get a lot of money.

234
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,450
I was so stupid that time.

235
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,420
You didn't even see them.

236
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,540
And you betrayed us

237
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,930
for money.

238
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,180
Take him away!

239
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,340
The Intelligence Services
really need to clean house.

240
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,010
We only found one.

241
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,180
There are more of them

242
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,300
hiding here.

243
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,580
Birds of a feather!

244
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,980
We'll root out them one day.

245
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,640
Help with what?

246
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,020
Hongyi, anything wrong?

247
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,580
Nothing.

248
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,540
I'm hungry. Go prepare food.

249
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,810
Hongyi, your hand was hurt.

250
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,500
Let the doctor

251
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,620
have a look.

252
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,620
It's fine.

[Baili Mansion]

Shen Fei, where's he going?

257
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,380
My lady,

258
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,490
my arm hurts.

259
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,820
I need to have a rest now.

260
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,470
Please give this to Supervisor Zhang.

261
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,300
Okay.

262

The doctor is here.

He's giving Shen Fei treatment.

265

Where is Lord Hongyi?

266
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:40,980
He left.

267
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,900
I don't know where he is.

268
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,320
He might have something to do.

Where did you and Lord Hongyi go?

274
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,460
Why did he and Shen Fei get injured?

It has been so many years.

Yunzhi,

289
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,050
I remembered that

290
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,580
most of the servants have left.

291
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,840
When did they start to hire new servants?

292
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,540
Uncle Baili said it's Lord Hongyi's order.

293

Hongyi's order!

294

295
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,780

is a field agent
who defected to Ruo'an.

298
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,260
Field agents

299
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,920
collect all the information.

300
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,140
Four Season Devine asked the moles

301
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,860
to try all methods

302
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,610
to find these field agents.

303
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,490
Then, Ruo'an persuaded them

304
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,820
to betray us

305
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,690
and made them into his spies.

306
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,300
Where is the register

307
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,280
of these field agents?

308
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,370
There is a copy

309

in the Palace of Nature.

310
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,580
Only a limited number of people

311
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,180
have access to the register.

312
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,050

the register?

315
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,980
The register was written in cipher.

316
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,740
They must know how to decode it.

317

What is this cipher look like?

318
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,180

I can't believe he found this.

352
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,000
Luckily, there is only one sentence on this.

353
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,060
I guess

how smart Baili Hongyi is.

359

I'm afraid...

360
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,300
I'm afraid...

361

00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,380
decoding the cipher.

363
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,730
How can he know

364
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:35,930
the secret behind it?

365
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,820
I can't believe that

366

Baili Hongyi is this smart.

367
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,540
He can even tell that

368

372

373
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,460
the content of their conversation.

374

I just think

382

Hongyi is being weird.

383
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,180
I think he's been behaving as usual.

We were attacked this time.

387

Someone wanted

388

what he found in Mount Lian

389
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,780
and wanted to kill him as well.

390

But he didn't mention a word.

391

Why are you so calm?

398

it's my first day here.

used to work here as a servant.

409

He got injured today.

00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,750
anything important to say?

522
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,050
No.

523
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,060
If not,

524
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,790
does it mean I can't talk to you?

525
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,770
Not today.

526
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,340
Why?

527
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:53,930
Hongyi!

528
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,970
Hongyi, where are you going?

529
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:56,820
Are you going to rest now?

530
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,220
You haven't had food yet.

531
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,460
I'm not hungry.

532
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,050
You said you were hungry.

533
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,370
Hongyi!

534
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,450
Hongyi!

535
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:05,930
Hongyi,

536
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,700
are you hiding something from me?

537
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,700
I need to rest now.

538
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,000
Did you find something

539
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,220
in Mount Lian

540
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,280
and didn't tell me?

541
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,800
Am I right?

542
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,460
I need to rest now.

543
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,030
Hongyi,

544
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,610
you promised

545
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:25,600
to tell me

546
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,200
no matter what you found out.

547
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,640
Although we came back safely

548
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,800
from Mount Lian,

549
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,170
it was not a safe journey at all.

550
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:32,720
Hongyi,

551
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
what did you find on earth?

552
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,720
I need to rest now.

553
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,380
How many times should I say it?

554
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,310
Leave.

555
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,830
Hongyi!

556
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,560
Leave now.

557
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,350
My lady.

558
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,070
My lady.

559
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,430
My lord.

560
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,410
How's your arm?

561
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,270
It's fine.

562
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,990
The doctor sutured my wound.

563
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,590
Look,

564
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,030
it's not serious at all.

565
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:29,830
How about you?

566
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,120
How's your hand?

567
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,150
I'll meet

568
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,430
Supervisor Zhang
from the Ministry of Works

569
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,090
at Liubai Building tomorrow.

570
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,360
I'll go with you.

571
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,190
It's fine.

572
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,520
You stay at the mansion and rest.

573
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,190
If possible,

574
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,830
make sure Ran is safe.

575
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,530
She'd better stay away from me

576
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,280
in consideration of current situations.

577
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,580
No wonder you're so cold

578
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,350
to Lady Liu.

579
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,840
You did this on purpose!

580
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,230
I'm in extreme danger now.

581
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,510
She doesn't need to be involved in this.

582
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,110
So, you do have feelings

583
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,190
for Lady Liu.

584
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:12,790
My lord,

585
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,470
my arm still hurts.

586
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,820
I need a rest.

587
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,110
My lord, remember to go to bed early.

588
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,190
How long do we need

589
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,790
to go through them one by one?

590
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,600
Three years.

591
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:42,400
Three years?

592
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,430
The Intelligence Services will...

593
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:46,030
What I mean is that
Agent Han was very cautious.

594
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,230
He changed the code every half of a month.

595
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,980
Considering the amount of data here,

596
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,840
it would take at least three years

597
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,310
to figure out the cipher.

598
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,270
Find out all the people

599
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,060
who've served over 3 years

600
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,990
in the Services.

601
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,590
Yes.

602
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,460
There are almost 100 people

603
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,060
who have served over 3 years.

604
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:11,790
Madam,

605
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,150
I'll do this on my own.

606
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:15,790
Fengyang,

607
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,910
you two come here.

608
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,750
Filter out people who didn't start their work

609
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,590
in the Services

610
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,590
as a scribe.

611
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:31,750
Why?

612
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,990
If the moles wanted to be familiar with

613
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,120
the work procedure,

614
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,270
they had to start from the lowest level.

615
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,640
Only in this way
can they know more secrets

616
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,570
without being noticed by others.

617
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,230
Madam An,

618
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:47,790
let me do this.

619
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:30,240
[Baili Mansion]

620
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,550
Madam.

621
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,390
How's everything?

622
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,600
We didn't find anyone suspicious.

623
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,930
Everything is alright.

624
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,810
This is from Baili Hongyi.

625
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,290
[Baili Hongyi's route to Liubai Building]

626
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,230
Is it too dangerous

627
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,080
to use Baili Hongyi as a decoy?

628
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,950
He dared to

629
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,350
go to Mount Lian himself.

630
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,870
He went to Mount Lian!

631
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:14,880
What do you mean?

632
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,590
The two informers from Mount Lian

633
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,630
were killed

634
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,670
before they revealed anything.

635
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,870
He's working on this.

636
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:21,670
Baili Hongyi

637
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,130
came back from Mount Lian.

638
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,090
Do you think

639
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,790
the assassins from Four Season Divine

640
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:27,900
will kill him?

641
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,790
He was attacked

642
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,670
on his way back.

643
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,080
This confirmed my guess.

644
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,470
People in the Divine are cruel.

645
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,260
Gao Bingzhu

646
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:35,750
is a martial arts expert.

647
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,790
He almost lost his life,

648
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,620
let alone you.

649
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,190
A huge secret

650
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,510
is hidden in the copper mine.

651
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,760
If I don't find the culprit,

652
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,710
my father's case

653
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,990
won't be cleared.

654
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,950
Don't you want to catch them?

655
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:45,830
I won't agree

656
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,790
if you need to

657
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:47,770
risk your life.

658
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,550
Then,

659
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,630
I'll go find Gao Bingzhu.

660
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:58,550
Fine.

661
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,510
If you have to do this,

662
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,760
let me make the plan.

663
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,670
This shows his route

664
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,330
to Liubai Building tomorrow.

665
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,940
Ask people to stand by along the route.

666
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,390
Okay.

667
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,510
Where is Baili Hongyi?

668
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,940
He's been behaving as usual

669
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,030
according to your plan.

670
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,710
Nothing happened.

671
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,070
Supervisor Zhang

672
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,430
already received the note.

673
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,550
The decoy is set. Proceed accordingly.

674
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,550
What if they take action in advance?

675
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,580
Four Season Divine doesn't know

676
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,110
what he found in Mount Lian.

677
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:24,870
They won't show up

678
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,750
before he meets

679
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,430
Supervisor Zhang tomorrow.

680
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,430
Keep your eyes on.

681
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,710
Make sure he is safe.

682
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:31,710
Yes.

683
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,550
For people on this list,

684
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,350
I need their detailed information.

685
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:44,790
Yes.

686
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,550
Agent Gao!

687
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:07,500
Agent Gao!

688
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:11,110
Agent Huangzhong.

689
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,230
Agent Gao, how can I help you?

690
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,460
You visited the Archive

691
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,260
three times on January the 20th.

692
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:20,710
Why?

693
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,190
What an absurd question!

694
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,420
An agent goes to the Archive

695
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,880
to do research, of course!

696
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:27,060
Do I need to

697
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,630
report this to you?

698
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,150
What research?

699
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,300
What case?

700
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,480
Why do you ask these questions?

701
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,710
It's a natural thing for an agent

702
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,510
to do research there.

703
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,230
Don't waste your time on this.

704
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,830
Since we're looking for the moles,

705
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,590
we can't miss any details.

706
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,949
Are you defending Agent Huangzhong

707
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,270
by saying that?

708
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,350
You...

709
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,830
How dare you say this!

710
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,870
Please calm down.

711
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,830
Sir,

712
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,040
I remember that
the Heavenly Temple

713
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,390
was under repairs that day.

714
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,960
They needed extra men for that.

715
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,390
We were looking for

716
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,640
people who could help with the repair.

717
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,140
I guess Agent Huangzhong

718
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,790
was working on this.

719
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,270
Agent Gao!

720
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,110
If you have to do so,

721
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,990
let me make the plan.

722
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,120
You need to trust me.

723
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,990
What's your plan?

724
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,920
I'll make sure your safety first.

725
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,030
After you're back in the capital,

726
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,820
I'll ask Interior guards

727
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,680
to protect you.

728
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,830
You have to say yes.

729
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,230
It's not a choice for you.

730
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,510
Even you are

731
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,510
just an ordinary person,

732
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,310
it's our duty to protect you,

733
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,370
not to mention that

734
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,510
you have become

735
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,300
Four Season Divine's target.

736
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,030
They killed my father.

737
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,750
I'm sure what they are hiding

738
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,150
is related to the Ministry of Works.

739
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,870
I'll arrange a meeting

740
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,830
with Supervisor Zhang at Liubai Building.

741
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,310
Okay.

742
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,660
This is a deal then.

743
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:10,870
I'll send my man to Liubai Building

744
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,070
before your meeting.

745
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,480
Take a rest. I'll stay here.

746
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:17,590
Thanks.

747
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,590
Didn't I tell you

748
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,630
not to show up easily?

749
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,830
The Interior Guard Services said that

750
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,190
the King of Jin will go out tomorrow.

751
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,110
All the officers in the field

752
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,640
are drafted to protect him.

753
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,630
This is the order from Sir Wu.

754
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,920
[Chen Wu, Interior Guard]

755
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,550
Everyone should assemble

756
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,750
before the daybreak.

757
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,430
No exceptions.

758
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,670
We're taking action tomorrow.

759
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,470
Are you leaving

760
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,190
at this critical moment?
