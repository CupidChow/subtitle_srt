[Episode 29]

4
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,070
Let me tell you a joke.

5
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,070
There was a scholar

6
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,960
who really loved braised ox heads.

7
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,830
He could finish a whole head in one sitting.

8
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,630
One day,

9
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,110
he had a dream.

10
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,490
In this dream, he was dead.

11
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,080
An officer from the Underworld

12
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,450
came to bring him back.

13
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,710
Seeing the officer,

14
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,630
the scholar

15
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,790
wasn't afraid at all.

16
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,870
He even smiled at him.

17
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,230
Do you know why?

18
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,850
Because...

19
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,350
Because...

20
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,880
Because the officer who came was the Ox-head.

21
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,329
Have you heard of this?

22
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,270
I heard this joke

23
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,829
when I was seven or eight.

24
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,440
Aren't you too old-fashioned?

25
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,010
I have another one.

26
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,430
A tiger was living

27
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,470
in the forest.

28
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,530
It often...

29
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,480
Gao Bingzhu,

30
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,990
I know you're afraid that I'd sleep

31
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,990
and never wake up.

32
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,720
Don't worry.

33
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,350
I won't give up.

34
00:02:59,310 --> 00:02:59,970
I trust you.

35
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,030
I know you can.

36
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,410
Should we chat for a while?

37
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,110
You see,

38
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,960
I've always been curious about

39
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,430
how you became an interior guard

40
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,150
as a woman.

41
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,050
My brother is the leader of the Services.

42
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,470
All I needed

43
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,670
was his approval.

44
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:08,630
Siyue,

45
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,040
show some mercy.

46
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,630
You can't even win a fight

47
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,560
against a woman!

48
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,909
How do you protect Luoyang

49
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,320
and Her Majesty?

50
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,510
Practice more!

51
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,670
Yes, sir!

52
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,630
From this moment,

53
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,909
Wu Siyue will officially become an interior guard.

54
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:58,550
Address her

55
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,070
as 'Madam.'

56
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,070
Madam!

57
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,310
I almost hit Madam Wu

58
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,710
during the combat.

59
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,550
Madam.

60
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,390
Luckily, I was quick on my feet.

61
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,270
I pretended to be attacked and fell,

62
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,670
or Sir Wu must punish me

63
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,680
for hurting her.

64
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,490
What Madam?

65
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,930
She is just a woman.

66
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:24,990
If Sir Wu hadn't asked us

67
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,920
to go easy on her,

68
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,030
I would've defeated her ten times!

69
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:27,490
Enough.

70
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,570
She is the sister of Sir Wu.

71
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,280
She joined the Services

72
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,230
just for fun.

73
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:33,830
Indeed.

74
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,330
I did ask them to go easy on you.

75
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:38,310
Siyue,

76
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,990
since you were little,

77
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,310
I've been giving you whatever you want.

78
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,070
No matter what you did,

79
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,420
I always supported you,

80
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,550
made sure you enjoyed what you did,

81
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,430
and had fun.

82
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,030
However, you need to know

83
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,430
that you're only a woman,

84
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,630
a grown-up woman.

85
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,990
One day,

86
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,300
you'll become a wife and a mother.

87
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,310
You can't put yourself

88
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,750
in danger every day!

89
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,310
If Beiqi competes with you seriously,

90
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,640
you won't have a chance.

91
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,350
How dare you!

92
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,270
Are you happy now?

93
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,590
I'm not as good as them.

94
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,590
I won't complain.

95
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:46,710
Next time,

96
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,720
we'll have serious combat.

97
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,070
So, you were angry

98
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,720
because they didn't

99
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,270
take you seriously.

100
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,360
I was angry 'cause they were right.

101
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,470
I joined the Services

102
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,350
just for fun.

103
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,910
If I hadn't heard what they said,

104
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,310
I would have quit several days later

105
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,870
and returned to my old life

106
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,950
as a noblewoman.

107
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,710
I would have

108
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,470
learned the Four Arts

109
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,950
together with the princess and Liu Ran,

110
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,010
met someone

111
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,810
who came from a similar family

112
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,750
and married him.

113
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,860
Neither my brother nor I

114
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,830
would've thought that

115
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:00,910
I am still an interior guard to this very day.

116

Don't sleep!

125

Sir Wu is your brother.

He will save you

151

at all costs.

Yes.

154
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,680
Find the place that collapsed
during the explosion.

155
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,070
Find the place that collapsed
during the explosion!

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,270
Siyue, look at me.

159
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,340
Look at me.

160
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,510
Look at me.

161
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,670
I am awake.

162
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,710
I'm just tired.

163
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,680
Do you...

164
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,110
Do you know that

165
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,760
I have a younger sister?

166
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,870
We haven't met

167

for so long.

170
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:38,970
Her name is Tan.

[Gao Tan]

172
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,510
Tan, are you hungry?

173
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,630
Have some congee.

174
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,190
Bingzhu,

175
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,440
mother said that

176
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,390
we can't eat until she's back.

177
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,450
Never mind.

178
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,660
I'll add some water to the congee.

179
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,720
She won't find out.

180
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,000
It's hot!

181
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,510
How dare you snaffle the congee?

182
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,150
Dare you do it again?

183
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,710
Mother, let go of me!

184
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,510
How can you...

185
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,310
Come back! Where are you going?

186
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,770
Mother!

187
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,590
Don't you run!

188
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,230
Stop!

189
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,720
-Stop!
-Mother!

190
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,350
Stop!

191
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,230
Mother!

192
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,190
Mother!

193
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,390
Mother!

194
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,560
Are you alright?

195
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,870
How dare you run away!

196
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,870
Hare dare you!

197
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:30,950
Mother, I'm sorry.

198
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,030
Mother, I'm so sorry.

199
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,760
How dare you!

200
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,950
You're sorry?

201
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,050
Sorry for what?

202
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,320
I'm sorry for

203
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,330
eating without your permission.

204
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,570
You're hungry.

205
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,040
You can have congee.

206
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,070
You should be sorry for
not feeding Tan first.

207
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,870
Your father died.

208
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,650
You're the only man in the family now.

209
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,670
Remember,

210
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,490
if there is only

211
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,820
one bite of bread left,

212
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,750
you have to let Tan eat first.

213
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,070
Remember, she is your sister!

214
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,450
Mother,

215
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:07,870
I see.

[Medicine]

217
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:14,790
Go.

218
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,110
Just leave.

00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,950
We don't accept patients with no money.

220

Please save my sister!

221
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,920
I will pay you later.

222
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,660
Please save my sister.

223
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,630
Kowtow doesn't help.

224
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,430
Bingzhu,

225
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,390
I'm not sick.

226
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,630
Let's go home.

227
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,810
It's alright, Tan.

228
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,020
Leave now.

229
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,390
Please, save my sister!

230
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,300
I promise.

231
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,510
I'll pay you in the future.

232
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:32,910
Let go.

233
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,630
I'll do anything.

234
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,890
Stop pulling my shirt!

235
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,630
Let me tell you!

236
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,630
Nobody can save her life
if you don't have money!

237
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,560
Please save her!

238
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,030
Let go!

239
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,190
Let go!

240
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,840
Bingzhu!

241
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,370
Mr. Unsightly.

242
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,160
Why did you give these kids a hard time?

243
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,800
[Medicine]

244
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,270
Come here.

245
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,150
I'll pay for her treatment.

246
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,800
Please save her.

247
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,200
Thank you, Mr. Unsightly!

248
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,910
Get up!

249
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:09,910
Remember,

250
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,240
don't perform kowtow to anyone

251
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,910
apart from your parents.

252
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,400
Let's go.

253
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,510
Tan

254
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,520
is seven years younger than me.

255
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,470
When I was exiled
from the Unwelcome Well 5 years ago,

256
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,670
she went missing.

257
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,230
We never met

258
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,270
anymore.

259
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,910
Mother,

260
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,710
we searched

261
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,570
the whole Well.

262
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,710
We didn't find Tan.

263
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,270
Mrs. Gao!

264
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,070
Tan!

265
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,660
Mrs. Gao!

266
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,470
My daughter!

267
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,990
Mrs. Gao, calm down.

268
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,760
Mrs. Gao!

269
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,350
Take care, Mrs. Gao.

270
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,270
Listen to me.

271
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,710
I'll find her, Mrs. Gao.

272
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:53,870
Mrs. Gao!

273
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,470
Please take care of yourself!

274
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,930
I'm begging you, Mrs. Gao!

275
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,550
My daughter!

276
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,950
Please don't be like this!

277
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,870
My daughter!

278
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,950
We will find her!

279
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:05,960
Mrs. Gao!

280
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,270
Gao Bingzhu,

281
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,720
I'm cold.

282
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,430
So cold.

283
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,950
It's cold in this cave.

284
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,670
Let me warm you up.

285
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,070
Gao Bingzhu.

286
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,070
What?

287
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,110
Don't worry!

288
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,310
I'll hang in there until we get out.

289
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,220
You need to save your strength.

290
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:49,550
I will.

291
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,950
Siyue.

292
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,630
Madam!

293
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,310
Siyue!

294
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,390
Madam!

295
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,750
Siyue!

296
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,790
Madam!

297
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,430
Sir,

298
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,390
The North Mountain is so big.

299
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,430
Even the hounds

300
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,150
can't locate them.

301
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,790
Find all the hounds

302
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,350
in Luoyang then!

303
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:13,870
Yes!

304
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,350
Sir,

305
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,070
it's cold on the mountain.

306
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:17,470
Please

307
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,190
take care.

308
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,870
Why not go back and have a rest?

309
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,800
We'll stay here.

310
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,230
Madam!

311
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,070
Madam!

312
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,430
Madam!

313
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,390
Madam!

314
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,470
Li Beiqi,

315
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,910
on the first day she joined the Services,

316
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,270
I reminded you

317
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,830
that her safety

318
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,910
should be your top priority.

319
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,310
What did you tell me?

320
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,950
I could give up my life

321
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,710
to ensure her safety.

322
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,030
Did you keep your promise?

323
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,550
I deserve to die!

324
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,310
Li Beiqi,

325
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,990
I only have one sister.

326
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,310
If anything happens to her,

327
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,400
I won't forgive you even if you die!

328
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,510
How about

329
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,950
you tell me

330
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,150
what you'll do

331
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,470
after we get out?

332
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:33,550
Siyue,

333
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,910
after I get out, I want to find Tan.

334
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,040
Come with me, and let's find her together.

335
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,250
What do you say?

336
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,940
I want to look after her.

337
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,980
I want

338
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,140
all people in the Unwelcome Well

339
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,030
to come out,

340
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,830
to be here in Luoyang,

341
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,630
to live in the sunshine

342
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,680
without hiding themselves again.

343
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,610
Siyue, did you hear me?

344
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:09,910
I want...

345
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,510
I want to go to the south market of Luoyang with you.

346
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,470
Siyue?

347
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,600
We can stand on that bridge

348
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,670
and watch those festival lanterns.

349
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,470
It was the first time

350
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,230
that you made me realize

351
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,110
how beautiful the city is.

352
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,790
I saw the lights in every family.

353
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,870
I saw

354
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,230
so many happy faces.

355
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:37,790
Siyue,

356
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,960
do you remember the south market that day?

357
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,270
It was amazing!

358
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,990
The lanterns in Luoyang

359
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,270
were amazing.

360
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,320
It was at that moment

361
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,830
that I found the meaning of my life.

362
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,109
So, I decided

363
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:06,790
to protect Luoyang as you do.

364
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,190
Siyue?

365
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:14,510
Siyue?

366
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,990
Did you hear me?

367
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:25,589
Sir!

368
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,570
We found traces of the collapse.
It's not far ahead.

369
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,710
Show me the way!

370
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,350
Yes!

371
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,270
Don't mind me!

372
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,630
Go find her!

373
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,430
Yes!

374
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,190
Hurry!

375
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,630
Move!

376
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,170
Hongyi,

377
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,440
it's quite early. Where are you going?

378
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,670
Sir Wu told me himself

379
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,510
that Gao Bingzhu and Madam Wu

380
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,310
got stuck in the North Mountain.

381
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,780
I can't calm down right now.

382
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,270
I need to go check some clues.

383
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,390
Siyue and Gao Bingzhu

384
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,920
were stuck in the mountain?

385
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,350
How did it happen?

386
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,750
What can I do?

387
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,240
Sir Wu and his men

388
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,510
are in the North Mountain.

389
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,750
Stay here and wait for my news.

390
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,210
Hongyi,

391
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,220
we were just out of the woods.

392
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,420
If you leave home now,

393
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:17,950
I'm afraid...

394
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,680
Don't worry.

395
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,550
I'm going to Hong Ru Guan

396
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,610
to meet the master.

397
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,840
I won't be in danger.

398
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,690
Wait for me.

399
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,070
Hongyi!

400
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,030
Please be careful!

401
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:37,710
Hurry!

402
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,470
Hurry!

403
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:39,550
Hurry!

404
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,850
Bring them out!

405
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,430
Siyue!

406
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,750
Hurry!

407
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,590
Hurry!

408
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:45,270
Hurry!

409
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,950
Hurry!

410
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,070
Hurry!

411
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:48,910
Hurry!

412
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,230
Go on!

413
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,670
Hurry!

414
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,670
Everyone, move!

415
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,430
Hurry!

416
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,310
Sir, the collapse is quite serious.

417
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,150
Without others' help,

418
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:57,870
I'm afraid...

419
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,150
Go.

420
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:58,590
Hurry!

421
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,470
Bring people of the Grand Court

422
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,150
and the Palace Guard!

423
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,150
Go!

424
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,430
Now!

425
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,350
Deeper!

426
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:06,750
Yes!

427
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,380
Attention, everyone!

428
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,150
Siyue needs to come out alive today!

429
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,270
Or...

430
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,550
everyone dies with her!

431
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,870
Gao Bingzhu,

432
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,950
if I could live longer,

433
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,030
we can

434
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,070
look for Tan

435
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:43,720
and watch...

436
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,710
watch festival lanterns.

437
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,110
Stay with me.

438
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,240
I want...

439
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,910
I want...

440
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,150
I want...

441
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:08,750
Siyue?

442
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,350
Siyue?

443
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,100
Stay with me.

444
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,140
Siyue?

445
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,550
Siyue?

446
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:25,710
Siyue?

447
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:31,470
Siyue.

448
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,630
Pull!

449
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,350
Harder!

450
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,030
Pull!

451
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,910
Pull harder, everyone!

452
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,550
Harder!

453
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,950
Harder!

454
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,230
Pull!

455
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,230
Madam!

456
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:12,910
Siyue!

457
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,550
Madam!

458
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,390
Siyue!

459
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:15,870
Siyue!

460
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,310
Siyue!

461
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,030
Madam!

462
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,270
Siyue!

463
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,390
Madam!

464
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,790
Madam!

465
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,710
We're here!

466
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,070
We're here!

467
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:28,990
Doctor!

468
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,030
Doctor!

469
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:31,790
Siyue!

470
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,430
Siyue!

471
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,030
Siyue!

472
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,420
Siyue!

473
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,080
Gao Bingzhu!

474
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,670
Let go of me!

475
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,080
You only bring bad luck!

476
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,350
If not for you,

477
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,470
Siyue wouldn't be

478
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,510
like this!

479
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:57,950
Siyue!

480
00:21:58,990 --> 00:21:59,510
Siyue!

481
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,310
Siyue!

482
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:02,680
Don't speak!

483
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,560
-Don't hurt him!
-Don't speak.

484
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,070
Don't speak.

485
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,630
Siyue.

486
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,230
Hurry!

487
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,630
Take her back!

488
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:11,470
Hurry!

489
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,150
Careful.

490
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,870
Careful!

491
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,590
Move!

492
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,630
I promised her I won't kill you,

493
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,030
but if I ever see you again,

494
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,630
I'll let you

495
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,900
and people from the Well

496
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,510
know what hell looks like!

497
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,830
Bring Sir Wu back!

498
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,550
Move!

499
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,910
Thanks for seeing me.

500
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,190
I made friends

501
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,680
with your grandfather.

502
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,830
However, I've been staying away
from the outside world

503
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,150
for several decades.

504
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,590
If you were not his grandson,

505
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,930
I wouldn't see you.

506
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,470
My grandfather mentioned you

507
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,150
many times.

508
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,350
He admired you so much.

509
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,110
I have one thing that I don't understand.

510
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,240
That's why I'm here.

511
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,070
Mountains overlook the crowd?

512
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,910
I seemed to have read them before.

513
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,430
Where did you get this?

514
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,030
I accidentally found it

515
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,230
in my brother's room.

516
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,670
I remember that

517
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,110
scholars in Four Season Academy

518
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,510
seemed to be working on these
many years ago.

519
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,710
Four Season Academy?

520
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,150
Young people probably don't know it.

521
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,950
There was a place

522
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,410
called Four Season Academy in Chang'an.

523
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,750
In the first year of Chunxi,

524
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,270
Yu, the former Crown Prince,

525
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,870
admired the Jixia Academy
in the Warring States Period.

526
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,350
So, he found an auspicious site

527
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,270
in the countryside of Chang'an

528
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,140
and built Four Season Academy,

529
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,000
hoping for more scholars to come.

530
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,350
After he died,

531
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,630
Four Season Academy

532
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,760
changed its name to North Sea Academy.

533
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,190
Several years later,

have something to do
with Four Season Clan?

537

What is that?

It reminds me that your grandfather,

I can't believe

You've been working on this for years

to cut off your fingers,

553
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,910

Master Baili Hu never let me talk about it.

After he left,

615
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,070
horrible rumors were going around.

616

No one in the family

617

wanted him to be mistreated like this.

621

Why did they argue?

622
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,560
I have no idea

what happened.

624

horrible rumors about him.

However,

630
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,830
it reminds me that

631
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,380
there was a time

632
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,710
when the mansion was full of smoke

633
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,750
and pungent smell

634
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,950
like what happened when you made elixirs.

635

he knew witchcraft.

637

those copper boxes

were full of imperfect Thunders.

That's what

649

Taoist Tiantong said.

650
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,040
The proportion is correct.

651
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,310
This sword is heavy.

652
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,310
It's made of copper from Mount Lian.

[Guanglin Inn]

656
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,070
I've always thought

657
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,990
that Four Season Clan

658
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,390
was making some elixirs.

659
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,770
While I was testing

660
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,230
Tiantong's manuscript,

661
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,430
I tried all the ingredients, formulas,

662
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,910
and all types of woods

663
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,470
to make sure the elixirs were perfect.

664
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,870
I took those small explosions

665
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,110
as failures.

666
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,470
Now I see,

667
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,830
that's what they're aiming for.

668
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,550
They don't want to

669
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,350
remove the toxicity of elixirs.

670
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,640
They want Thunder, the explosive!

671
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,630
They stole from those copper mines

672
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,830
not to make fake coins

673
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,350
or weapons,

674
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,470
but to make copper boxes.

This type of copper has great hardness.

the shattered pieces

678
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,270
will largely increase

679
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,270
the explosion's radius and damage.

680
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,510

If they succeed,

684
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,790
its damage will be beyond imagination.

685
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,080

Before you came here,

687
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,590
I was forced to test the formula.

688

But while I was doing so,

689
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,610
they found out the secret.

690
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:02,440
I thought

691
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,910
I could use frozen Xuanwu's Pearl

692
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,310
to lower the temperature and buy more time.

693
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,990
I didn't realize that it was this idea

694
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,470
that helped the furnace
to reach the right temperature.

695
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,950
That's the key to success.

696
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,490
Using this method,

697
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,150

00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,510
I didn't do it

709
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,440
intentionally,

710
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,030
but this was my fault.

711
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,870
I'll take full responsibility

712
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,670
for what I did.

713
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,950
You were in danger.

714
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,250
It was an accident.

715
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,590
It wasn't your fault.

716
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,780
Without you,

717
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,190
they would still

718
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,990
succeed.

719
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,570
You're the victim.

720
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,630
Don't blame yourself

721
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,590
for everything.

722
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:09,950
Instead of

723
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,090
blaming yourself,

724
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,890
why not think of ways to fix it?

725
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,350
It's my fault.

726
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,110
I got carried away

727
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,600
and told others about the manuscript,

728
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,230
putting you and Hongyi

729
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,990
in extreme danger.

730
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:36,790
Father,

731
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,590
we're alright now.

732
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,390
We returned home safely.

733
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,480
If anything had happened to you two...

734
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,830
It's all my fault!

735
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:47,710
Father,

736
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,610
don't blame yourself.

737
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,870
Taoist Tiantong is devious and cunning.

738
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,030
Even if you hadn't mentioned it,

739
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,390
he would have found us.

740
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,110
Father,

741
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,240
have you met Liu Feng recently?

742
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,370
How is he doing?

743
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,000
I'm afraid we will argue with each other
once we meet.

744
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,430
I asked someone to go to

745
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,630
Hong Xiao Fang to inquire about him.

746
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,950
He was kicked out

747
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,150
after he spent all his money.

748
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,990
Liu Feng is stubborn.

749
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,190
He was humiliated like this.

750
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,670
I wonder if he can get over it.

751
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,270
I don't want him to sleep on the streets.

752
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,650
I already sent people to find him.

753
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,550
I finally realized that

754
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,110
I should be blamed

755
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,830
for everything that has ever happened.

756
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,090
Father!

757
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,910
I will never

758
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,230
poke my nose

759
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,680
into anything he does.

760
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,110
He can marry whoever he likes

761
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,070
and do whatever he wants.

762
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,230
All I wish for is that

763
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
Hongyi and you can be safe and sound.

764
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:00,590
Father.

765
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,210
My lady!

766
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:03,390
My lady!

767
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,390
Uncle Baili, what happened?

768
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,409
Lord Hongyi

769
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,630
has gone mad!

770
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:12,429
He wants to dig his brother's grave.

771
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:13,989
In the following 15 days,

772
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,510
all the entrances to Luoyang,

773
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,710
no matter for boats or carriages,

774
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,590
should be examined closely

775
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,050
for anything suspicious.

776
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,110
Contact all the middlemen

777
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:21,949
and field agents.

778
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:22,909
If they see any copper boxes

779
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:23,670
in the city,

780
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:25,409
report to us immediately!

781
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,030
Here.

782
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:27,710
This one.

783
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:28,199
Move.

784
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,760
Gao Bingzhu!

785
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,350
Gao Bingzhu!

786
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:53,159
Gao Bingzhu!

787
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,280
Gao Bingzhu!

788
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,080
Gao Bingzhu!

789
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:25,710
Madam!

790
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,750
Madam, are you alright?

791
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,750
Why did you get up?

792
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,750
Where is Gao Bingzhu?

793
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,410
Where is he?

794
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,550
Where?

795
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,510
We were in a grave situation that day.

796
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,570
After we found you,

797
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,610
we immediately brought you back.

798
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,030
We didn't pay attention.

799
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,510
Indeed.

800
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,550
Gao Bingzhu.

801
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,520
Li Beiqi.

802
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,110
I want to see Li Beiqi.

803
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,800
We didn't see Sir Li.

804
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,790
He probably went out.

805
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,150
Tell him to see me

806
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,080
after he's back.

807
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:52,510
Yes.

808
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:53,290
We will.

809
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,610
Madam, have a rest now.

810
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,230
Your medicine is here.

811
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,300
[Li Chun, Interior Guard]

812
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,910
If you don't have other orders,

813
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,630
I'll bring the medicine

814
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,430
to Sir Wu now.

815
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,670
What happened to him?

816
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,430
Sir,

817
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,270
we confirmed with the Customs Office.

818
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,310
Nobody saw the copper box

819
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,510
Gao Bingzhu mentioned.

820
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,510
Nothing has been reported

821
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,770
from those entrances.

822
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,400
In this case,

823
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,190
Four Season Clan

824
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,510
hasn't transported

825
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:27,490
a large number of Thunders
they made to Luoyang.

826
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,150
We haven't received

827
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,710
any related news.

828
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:32,990
Could the Thunder

829
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,310
really cause such huge damage as you described?

830
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,440
I saw it with my eyes.

831
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,830
The Thunder

832
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,230
caused a landslide in the North Mountain.

833
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,510
It was just a defective product

834
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,770
discarded by the Clan.

835
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,070
If they improve the formula,

836
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,910
I can't imagine how powerful it will be.

837
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,030
In your opinion,

838
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,230
why did

839
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,950
Four Season Clan

840
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,590
make such a powerful weapon?

841
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,350
The Ceremony of Light.
