00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,430
I will give you the elixir

180
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,110
in due time.

181
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,750
The big day is coming.

182
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,370
I have no more time for you.

183
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,730
If you put it off again,

184
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,760
you know what you'll be facing.

185
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,830
To the court!

186
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,390
It's impossible!

187
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:07,310
Give us our money back!

188
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,430
I knew your elixirs

189
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,290
have problems.

190
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,690
They don't!

191
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,500
[Ke Tribe, Xuanwu's Pearl]

192
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,840
Xuanwu's Pearl?

193
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,710
Ke Tribe, realgar, and bat guano.

194
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,230
What did you find?

195
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,590
Here.

196
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,190
Why is the bell ringing?

197
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,150
It is a warning.

198
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,270
Someone sneaked into the temple.

199
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,730
Let me escort you, my lord.

200
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,630
Go.

201
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,190
There's still fire in the furnace.

202
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,150
They must have left

203
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,810
right after hearing the bell.

204
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,590
They seemed to be escorting

205
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,720
someone important.

206
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:48,830
This seems to be

207
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,290
an ordinary alchemy room.

208
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,850
Why did they pick such a secret place?

209
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,070
It looks familiar.

210
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,390
What's wrong?

211
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,830
What did you find?

212
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,030
Go. Get out first.

213
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,590
In Luoyang,

214
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,390
only dukes, marquises, and above

215
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,590
can use the pattern of Xuanwu, the Black Tortoise.

216
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,320
This is even a gold-inlaid one.

217
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,250
It's for the Eastern Palace only.

218
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,560
The Eastern Palace?

219
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,640
Look at the manuscript.

220
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,830
It's all about elixir formulas.

221
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,150
It seems the one who bought
a lot of Xuanwu's Pearls

222
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,550
is that Taoist Tiantong.

223

[Notes of Alchemy]

224
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,460
Those who we saw in the yard

225
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,770
must be from Four Season Clan.

226
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,480
As soon as the bell rang,

227
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,110
those in the alchemy room left quickly.

228
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:11,270
They seemed to be escorting someone
in a black cloak to the outside.

229
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,790
I heard from Princess Lu that

230
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,190
the Crown Prince has been
obsessed with alchemy these years.

231
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,430
Could the mysterious man

232
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,790
be...?

233
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,020
[Baili Mansion]

234
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,200
It does smell like Xuanwu's Pearl.

235
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,120
They are making elixirs with Xuanwu's Pearl.

236
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,990
Why did a box from the Eastern Palace

237
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,320
end up at Yuncui Temple?

238
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,040
The Eastern Palace is probably involved.

239
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,750
Many high-ranking nobles in Luoyang

240
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,750
are into alchemy.

241
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:57,170
It can be a coincidence that
the Crown Prince makes elixirs at Yuncui Temple.

242
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,480
What if he went there

243
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,520
to meet Tiantong

244
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,590
rather than make elixirs?

245
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,970
You lack evidence.

246
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,080
Random guessing

247
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,380
can lead to mistakes.

248
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,780
We only need to figure out

249
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,810
his relationship with Tiantong.

250
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,070
It doesn't make sense.

251
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,990
Say Tiantong is from Four Season Clan.

252
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,750
The Crown Prince was once
attacked by the Clan,

253
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,230
so he's not supposed
to have anything to do with them.

254
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,030
But five years ago,

255
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,470
Song Liang also claimed
to have wiped out the Clan.

256
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,350
We should go back to their relationship.

257
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,670
No.

258
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,770
He's the Crown Prince.

259

[Eastern Palace]

260
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,340
I'll meet no one in the next few days.

261
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,270
No matter who comes,

262
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,310
tell them I'm sick.

263
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,440
Yes, Your Highness!

264
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,600
[Eastern Palace]

265
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,070
One of you is an agent.

266
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:47,990
The other, an interior guard.

267
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,250
Why does the Eastern Palace concern you?

268
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,910
Investigating the Crown Prince

269
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,820
is a big deal.

270
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,800
Since you can't decide,

271
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,270
let's vote.

272
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,010
I think we should do it.

273
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,070
Me, too.

274
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,200
Then find out the Eastern Palace's role in it.

275
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,510
We have to be cautious, though,

276
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,440
since it's about the Crown Prince.

277
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:31,710
My lord,

278
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,070
we've searched the temple,

279
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,800
but didn't find the two people.

280
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:37,870
That lord

281
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,790
is already paranoid.

282
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,590
Then, he got startled today.

283
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,750
If he gets traced,

284
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,320
he will not cover for us.

285
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,240
Back to the Clan.

286
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:47,790
Go.

287
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:56,670
Sir.

288
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,020
Go.

289
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,990
Find out if Taoist Tiantong of Yuncui Temple

290
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,630
has contact with the Eastern Palace.

291
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,430
The Eastern Palace?

292
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,960
I'm afraid we can't do that.

293
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:05,650
Why not?

294
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,000
We have to ask His Lordship's permission.

295
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,710
You want to investigate
the Eastern Palace just because of this box.

296
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,230
It's for the Eastern Palace only.

297
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,710
What if this is a set-up?

298
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,330
More reason to get to the bottom of it.

299
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,490
I saw someone from the Clan

300
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,590
at Yuncui Temple.

301
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,720
The Eastern Palace?

302
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,790
Why do you want to investigate them suddenly?

303
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,190
I suspect they're related to Four Season Clan.

304
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,380
Where's your evidence?

305
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,380
I'm working on it.

306
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,850
Please arrange a stake-out of the temple, Brother.

307
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,950
Brother?

308
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,400
You're making a personal request.

309
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,240
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

310
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,950
You can't investigate them.

311
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,790
We are Her Majesty's ears and eyes,

312
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,150
but we can't get near certain forces,

313
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,510
including the Eastern Palace.

314
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,310
It's the rule.

315
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,500
Since the informers were killed,

316
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,180
a lot has happened in the past two months

317
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,510
and all the clues can be traced back to the Clan.

318
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,990
So many things are off-limits.

319
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,220
The Clan won't care about

320
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:00,820
any rules.

321
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,310
How dare you relate our Services to those crooks?

322
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,750
Do you want to be punished?

323
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,150
Can I investigate them after that?

324
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:07,910
Gao Bingzhu!

325
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,890
I will do it one way or another.

326
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,550
The Eastern Palace goes by the royal Li
while we go by Wu.

327
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,589
The matter of the succession
to the throne is delicate enough.

328
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,990
Every move of ours is being watched.

329
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,869
You're Madam Wu of the Interior Guards...

330
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:20,400
Brother,

331
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:24,109
I saw someone being escorted
outside Yuncui Temple.

332
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,670
If I don't figure this out,

333
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,069
I won't deserve the Peony Token
bestowed by Her Majesty.

334
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,150
The Peony Token

335
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,590
is just a token.

336
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,830
It should make your detection easier

337
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,150
rather than bring you trouble.

338
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,120
If the Services can't do it,

339
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,710
I can do it myself.

340
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:43,950
Siyue,

341
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,270
act more mature.

342
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,110
Remember,

343
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,070
if you get into any trouble,

344
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,870
the Services won't help you out.

345
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,350
Have you gotten

346
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,030
any witnesses or evidence

347
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,270
to prove that mysterious person
was the Crown Prince?

348
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:01,790
No.

349
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,190
In that case,

350
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,390
you shouldn't go to the Eastern Palace.

351
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,670
Otherwise, someone may take advantage of that

352
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,510
and attack you, me, and the Interior Guards.

353
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,240
Do you know what that will mean?

354
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,240
You have wanted to do this, my lord.

355
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,590
If you'll excuse me.

356
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,430
Go. I'm tired.

357
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:27,470
Brother...

358
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,350
Go.

359
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,960
If you'll excuse me.

360
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,590
What?

361
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,670
You lost the manuscript.

362
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,000
There was an emergency.

363
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,190
I was walking the lord out.

364
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,600
Or the manuscript wouldn't be stolen.

365
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,790
Who stole it?

366
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:57,570
I...

367
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,210
I only know they were a man and a woman.

368
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,390
Idiot!

369
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:03,970
Sister,

370
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,430
what makes you so angry?

371
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,270
Check what your man did.

372
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,110
We've been planning at Yuncui Temple for so long.

373
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,630
[Lord of Spring, Four Season Clan]

374
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,270
Now it's all figured out

375
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,950
and even the manuscript is lost.

376
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,430
How will you punish him?

377
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,200
By our rules, of course.

378
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:23,830
I am sorry!

379
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,830
Please show mercy to me!

380
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,560
You've been teaching Tiantong for years.

381
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,240
Do you really have the heart

382
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,550
to kill him?

383
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,010
No matter who they are,

384
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,630
as long as they disrupt the Clan's plan,

385
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,550
they'll be a sinner against the Clan

386
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,950
and should be discarded.

387
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,830
Tiantong is the only one

388
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,350
who knows about the manuscript.

389
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,880
Now the manuscript is gone.

390
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,830
All of our plans

391
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,350
rely on him.

392
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,490
How can we kill him?

393
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,590
You talked all this about punishing Tiantong,

394
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,820
but you are actually reminding me

395
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,490
that I'll be the sinner

396
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,180
if he is killed.

397
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,510
You're overthinking.

398
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,510
I didn't mean that at all.

399
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,390
The big day is coming.

400
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,310
All I hope

401
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,640
is that you won't disrupt our plan.

402
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,710
Thank you for saving me, my lord.

403
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,430
I'm so sorry I screwed it up.

404
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,430
Please punish me.

405
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,030
Tiantong,

406
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,750
strong wind and rain

407
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,510
do not last long.

408
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,070
You are a Taoist.

409
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,630
I believe you understand it well.

410
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,150
Lord of Spring sides with his man.

411
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,670
Are we just letting it go?

412
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,380
[Lu Li, Disciple of Four Season Clan]

413
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,860
He and I are of the same rank.

414
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,790
We have no control over each other.

415
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,350
He is polite and friendly to me

416
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,190
only because we're in the same sect.

417
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:14,990
The same sect?

418
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,740
I can't tell

419
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,600
he's ever considered that at all.

420
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,800
He was even trying to

421
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,000
make you the sinner.

422
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,440
He's way out of line!

423
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,590
Should we do something about it?

424
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,110
The greater good is not achieved.

425
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:26,710
Spare him.

426
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,970
He'll be of use.

427
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,280
Sir Wu didn't agree to the investigation.

428
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,070
The Services doesn't allow me
to do it as the Halberdier, either.

429
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,870
It's about the Crown Prince,
so they can't get involved.

430
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,630
Both Services

431
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,830
can't investigate the Eastern Palace.

432
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,870
No wonder Four Season Clan turned to them

433
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,130
to cover their tracks.

434
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,950
So, I've made up my mind.

435
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,110
I'm going to get in the Palace in another way

436
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,830
and see if I'll find any clue.

437
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,670
No.

438
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,660
It's too risky.

439
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,120
If you get caught,
even your Services can't save you.

440
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:09,700
[Yuncui Temple]

441
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,310
I'll go visit the Crown Prince
in the Palace tomorrow.

442
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,710
No.

443
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,470
You have the special identity
of being one of the Wu people.

444
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,590
If the Li and Wu families have a conflict,

445
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,650
you will be blamed.

446
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,770
Let me do it.

447
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,830
I once got into the Liu Mansion.

448
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,600
I can do it better this time.

449
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,790
You didn't get caught in the Liu Mansion,

450
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,110
but the Eastern Palace is heavily guarded.

451
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,390
You may not have such good luck this time.

452
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:45,990
Forget it.

453
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,390
Anyway, you can't go.

454
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,120
I'll figure something out.

455
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,190
Sir Li,

456
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:58,750
we've deployed men at both side gates
and the back gate of Yuncui Temple.

457
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,550
Tell our men,

458
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:00,470
from now on,

459
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,750
keep their eyes on whoever enters the temple.

460
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,590
Note down anyone suspicious.

461
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:05,370
We will.

462
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:07,390
Sir Li,

463
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,870
how long are we watching the temple?

464
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,070
Until Sir Wu tells us to stop.

465
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,150
Yes, sir.

466
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,120
Don't worry.

467
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,440
I've thought up a perfect plan.

468
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,170
He's the Crown Prince, after all.

469
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,710
Do it in a roundabout way.

470
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,840
Don't confront him.

471
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,950
If we find nothing on him,

472
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,410
we can think of other ways.

473
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:52,390
[Eastern Palace]

474
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:51,480
Madam Wu,

475
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,360
His Highness has dizziness

476
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,690
and can't meet guests.

477
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,370
We could pass your message

478
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,720
to His Highness, madam.

479
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,870
It's serious.

480
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,640
I must meet His Highness today.

481
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,790
Madam Wu, please don't make things difficult.

482
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,430
All right,

483
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,590
I won't force you.

484
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,630
Please tell Princess Lu

485
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,890
that I want to meet her.

486
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:15,790
So,

487
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,190
the Crown Prince

488
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,850
and Princess Lu are both sick?

489
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,150
Madam.

490
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,310
Cinnabar, mercury,

491
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,470
lead,

492
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,070
and sulfur.

493
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,910
These are all alchemical ingredients.

494
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,990
Nothing special.

495
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,090
Hongyi,

496
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,910
now that

497
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,310
Liu Feng has returned to Luoyang,

498
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,710
what can I do

499
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,700
to let him visit Father?

500
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,630
There is nothing special in this manuscript,

501
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,590
so why did Taoist Tiantong hide it?

502
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,230
When Father left home to travel,

503
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,030
Liu Feng was just four.

504
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,020
He couldn't remember anything.

505
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,350
I remember the question

506
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,200
that he asked Mother most often

507
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,470
was where Father had gone.

508
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,160
Mother couldn't answer it,

509
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,310
so he asked Uncle

510
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,110
and me.

511
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,110
But since Mother died,

512
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,640
he's never asked this question again.

513
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:33,870
What can I do?

514
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,830
Since I was little, all the nobles in Luoyang

515
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,630
have been falling over themselves

516
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,510
for elixirs made by our Liu family.

517
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,830
During my stay in Luoyang,

518
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,910
I visited old friends

519
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,430
and heard that Taoist Tiantong of Yuncui Temple

520
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,870
was making the Elixir of Life.

521
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,510
Many elixirs need Xuanwu's Pearl
to enhance their efficacy,

522
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,870
including Nine Turns Golden Elixir,

523
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,630
Lead-mercury Immortality Elixir,

524
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,230
and Golden Cinnabar Elixir.

525
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,650
Hongyi,

526
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,070
where are you going?

527
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,990
Liubai Building.

528
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,650
Wait for me.

529
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:10,510
Hongyi.

530
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,480
I've invited you so many times.

531
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,020
You keep saying you're busy.

532
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,080
How come you have time to see me today?

533
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,310
Actually, I came for work.

534
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,720
I want to meet the Crown Prince.

535
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,880
Why do you need me

536
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,470
if you want to see Father?

537
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,510
He always thinks of you as one of us.

538
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,720
I heard His Highness has been sick these days.

539
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,630
I don't know why Father

540
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,560
has kept himself in the room
and met no one these days.

541
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,510
Not only that,

542
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,510
he doesn't allow me to go out.

543
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,350
I am so bored

544
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,560
staying in the Eastern Palace.

545
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,730
What illness does His Highness have?

546
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,030
Nothing

547
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,080
but worries.

548
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,190
Song Liang's case has passed,

549
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,470
but Her Majesty has become
more and more suspicious of Father

550
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,030
and keeps ignoring him,

551
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,150
thinking that others want to take her throne.

552
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,950
Mind your words, Your Highness.

553
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,390
As the Crown Prince's daughter,

554
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,590
you have to be cautious

555
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,920
about what you say or do.

556
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:08,870
Siyue,

557
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,310
I said all that

558
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,110
because I think you're one of us.

559
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,350
Don't tell others.

560
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,350
I will not.

561
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,350
Actually, I came to confirm something
with His Highness today.

562
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,350
Could you help me?

563
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,430
Okay.

564
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:25,790
I'll help you.

565
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,070
Sorry, my lord and lady,

566
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,400
Master Baili just left.

567
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:31,770
Where did he go?

568
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,490
Where did my father go?

569
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,560
I hired the carriage for Master Baili

570
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,550
and I'm not supposed

571
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,750
to tell others.

572
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,790
But you are

573
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,790
his daughter

574
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:43,960
and son-in-law.

575
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,710
I shouldn't keep it from you.

576
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,380
Just tell us

577
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,580
where my father went.

578
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,770
Hong Xiao Fang.

579
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,310
Hongyi,

580
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,510
you almost caused trouble

581
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,570
when you went there last time.

582
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,650
How about I go and find Father myself?

583
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,040
I'll take him back here.

584
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,870
You can order nice food and drink

585
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,770
and wait for us.

586
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,070
Okay.

587
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,470
Here.

588
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,190
My lord.

589
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,110
My lord,

590
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,450
you're so handsome

591
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,830
and generous with us.

592
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,590
You can get any of us

593
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,550
that you fancy.

594
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,870
Why do you have to wait for Peipei?

595
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,110
Yeah.

596
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:30,750
Yeah.

597
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:31,750
Yeah,

598
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,470
why do you have to wait for her?

599
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,150
We are all

600
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,550
as beautiful as her.

601
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,270
Exactly.

602
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:37,750
Liu Feng!

603
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,590
Our House is privately reserved today.

604
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,270
Liu Feng!

605
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:39,790
Get out!

606
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,550
You can't get in.

607
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,310
What are you doing?

608
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:41,950
Don't get in.

609
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:42,410
Go away!

610
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:44,990
Go!

611

612
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,960
You have been away from home for years.

613
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,270
Now you are back,

614
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,270
but you came to this brothel first!

615
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,630
Shame on you.

616
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,710
Get up!

617
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,410
What are you doing?

618
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:08,830
Go back with me.

619
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,710
I won't!

620
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,590
So you can stay here

621
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,030
and embarrass the Liu family?

622
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,390
Who are you to tell me what to do?

623
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,750
I am your father!

624
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,390
Father?

625
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,710
You are my father?

626
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,070
You left home when I was four.

627
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,840
You didn't even come back when my mother died.

628
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,020
It was my uncle

629
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,420
who arranged her burial.

630
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,080
Where were you at that time?

631
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,330
I had been naughty.

632
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,740
It was my sister who taught me

633
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,750
to read and write with a ruler in her hand.

634
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,410
Can I ask you

635
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,270
where you were at that time?

636
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,870
When they separated me and Chunhe,

637
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,470
I became a laughingstock of Luoyang's nobles.

638
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,310
When I needed my father the most,

639
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,230
let me ask you,

640
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,090
where were you?

I...

642

All my life, I can only be told what to do

643
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,790
by two people!

644
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,230

647
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,710
don't get to do it!

648

Liu Feng...

649
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,520
I don't want your explanation.

650
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:26,890

slow down.

656
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,250
Slow down, my lord.

657
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,270
My lord, take care.

658
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,000
This way.

659
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,710
Take care.

660
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,550
Please don't be mad, father.

661
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,080
I'll talk to him seriously.

What exactly do you want?

669
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,950
Hongyi, let's eat first.

670

00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,600
Her Majesty is getting old.

693
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,120
We, as sons and daughters,

694
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,470
should think up ways

695
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,280
to help Her Majesty live longer

696
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,750
and enjoy an everlasting reign.

697
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,750
So, we can live up

698
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,010
to Her Majesty's kindness of raising us.

699
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,030
Your Highness is such a devoted son.

700
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:06,790
Actually, I came to ask
Your Highness about one thing.

701
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,270
Sure, no problem!

702
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,190
Go ahead.

703
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,700
Has Your Highness heard of Xuanwu's Pearl?

704
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:26,910
No.

705
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,760
I don't feel well today.

706
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,850
Please go back.

707
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,250
Your Highness!

708
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,490
Has Your Highness ever seen this?

709
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,230
There are at least

710
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,540
hundreds of such boxes in the Eastern Palace.

711
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,340
What exactly do you want to know?

712
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,950
I'd like to know if Your Highness

713
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,810
went to Yuncui Temple yesterday.

714
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,490
I've been into alchemy

715
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,940
for a long time.

716
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,170
Everyone in Luoyang knows it.

717
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,590
I've been to Yuncui Temple many times,

718
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,450
but yesterday,

719
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,750
I didn't go there.

720
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,950
Nor do I know

721
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,150
what the box is about.

722
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:11,270
If you've asked all your questions,

723
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,070
please leave.

724
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,489
Your Highness.

725
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:14,790
Fire!

726
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,190
Fire!

727
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,960
What's going on?

728
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:25,389
Your Highness,

729
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,000
the backyard is on fire.

730
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:27,790
Go!

731
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:28,949
Go!

732
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,310
Somebody help!

733
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,239
Hurry up!

734
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,350
My elixirs...

735
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,360
What happened?

736
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:37,270
Water, water!

737
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:46,830
Didn't I tell you

738
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,070
to watch the furnace?

739
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,110
How could there be a fire?

740
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,260
Your Highness,

741
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,830
we put Xuanwu's Pearl in it

742
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,830
and it soon went on fire

743
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,469
for unknown reasons.

744
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:05,970
Your Highness,

745
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,830
are you still going to

746
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,790
hide the truth?

747
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,500
[Ke Tribe, Xuanwu's Pearl]

748
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,630
The formulas and ingredients here

749
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,070
are nothing special.

750
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:19,000
Instead, they're ridiculous.

751
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:19,990
Yes.

752
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,750
I've looked it up.

753
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,750
The things on the manuscript

754
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,470
were from hundreds of years ago.

755
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,590
So, naturally, they don't make sense to us now.

756
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,120
Exactly.

757
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,470
Alchemists in ancient times

758
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:33,710
knew little about how ingredients
interact with each other.

759
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,190
However, this manuscript is ridiculous

760
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,750
not only because of that.

761
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,580
Get out of here, all of you.

762
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,800
Yes, Your Highness.

763
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,290
Yesterday,

764
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,190
I did go to Yuncui Temple.

765
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,590
It was also me

766
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,870
who left the box there.

767
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,100
Song Liang's case

768
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,350
has made Her Majesty doubt me even more.

769
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,950
I thought about it

770
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,590
over and over

771
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,720
and finally came up with this idea.

772
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,560
I wanted to present Her Majesty

773
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,770
the elixirs made by myself
at the Ceremony of Light,

774
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,050
hoping I could win back Her Majesty's...

775
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,470
favor.

776
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:38,970
Your Highness,

777
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:43,070
may I ask what your relationship
with Taoist Tiantong is?

778
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,240
He was recommended to me

779
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,330
by a retainer of mine called Dai Zhou.

780
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,230
He said this man is good at alchemy

781
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,070
and can teach me about it.

782
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,400
However, the two of them

783
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,510
have asked me for a lot of money

784
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,520
and ingredients

785
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,190
and I have made

786
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,230
no elixirs even to this day!

787
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,530
If that is the case,

788
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,480
why does Your Highness have to cover for them?

789
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,510
Dai Zhou

790
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,520
once asked me for written consent,

791
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,590
saying it was for getting identity documents

792
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,720
for a caravan from the Ke Tribe.

793
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,420
I foolishly agreed

794
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,430
to his request somehow.

795
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,830
Liu Feng met Kang Jin not long ago.

796
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:41,990
They didn't get their documents

797
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,470
forged in the black market.

798
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,910
How did they make it here

799
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,470
without passports?

800
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,510
How did they get those identity documents?

801
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,110
These questions need to be answered.

802
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,550
Who would've thought that

803
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,190
some outlanders in the caravan died?

804
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,510
If this was leaked,

805
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,510
Her Majesty would get mad.

806
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,910
I recognized him.

807
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,310
The Taoist Priest in Yuncui Temple

808
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,830
is the person who attacked me

809
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,550
on my way back to Luoyang.

810
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:10,810
I...

811
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:11,790
I really didn't mean to...

812
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,650
Your Highness,

813
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,460
Taoist Tiantong

814
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,390
may be related to Four Season Clan.

815
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,330
Four...

816
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:22,710
No...

817
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,630
It was all because of that rat Dai Zhou

818
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,910
who deluded me.

819
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,310
I... I was used by them!

820
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,790
Where is Dai Zhou now?

821
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,630
He hasn't shown up for days.
