63
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,550
Geology is a key factor
in selecting a location for a building.

Also, there is mainly ooze below the surface in Luoyang.

The shift in its location

means it is now

Are you alright?

Did you find Four Season Palace?

187

I saw that you came back

188
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,510
with Qingye.

She didn't do anything to you, did she?

Did you find Siyue?

Long story.

I got it immediately

and rushed to the Interior Guard Services.

You know what?

They didn't know me

199

I guessed you must be here.

200
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,650
Madam Wu wasn't there.

201
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,590
I've heard that interior guards

I guess she is on call
at the Imperial Palace now.

205

Is the ceremonial dress ready?

206

It is, madam.

207

We do.

217

You will certainly look stunning

I won't go inside.

523
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:52,470
Follow me.

524
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,390
If you trust me,

525
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,580
come with me.

526
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,190
Where is Lady of Autumn?

527
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,030
She went to Luoyang

528
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,490
with people from the Clan.

529
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,110
The Clan has been making plans

530
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,470
based on the Rhyme these years.

531
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,530
Take me to Luoyang,

532
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:05,990
or I'll burn it.

533
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,630
What's with the boom?

534
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,890
Why were they all gone?

535
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,510
They held us back on purpose.

536
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,310
We were probably fooled.

537
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,710
It's part

538
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:20,750
of their plan.

539
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,430
Go check what the explosion was about.

540
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,430
Got it.

541
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,270
This isn't as simple as we thought.

542
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:36,750
The Clan must have

543
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,750
something to do with the explosion.

544
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,590
One thing is strange as well.

545
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,350
Somehow,

546
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,780
the killer I brought back

547
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,070
from the Clan has been helping me

548
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:45,790
look for the Thunder

549
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,430
around the Heavenly Temple.

550
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,290
Is it possible that

551
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,510
the Ceremony is just a guise?

552
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,600
They might have planned a bigger conspiracy.

553
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,480
My lord.

554
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:04,250
My lord.

555
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,030
Hanjia Granary was blown up.

556
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:09,910
What?
