00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,259
Come with me.

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,310
Yes, my lady.

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,010

[Li Dun, the Crown Prince]

9
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,740
Have a seat.

10
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,680
How may I help you, Your Highness?

11
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,900
Take a seat first.

12
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

13
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,860
Siyue,

14
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,540
the life of everyone in the Eastern Palace

15
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,900
is now in your hands.

16
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,780
That would be a stretch,

17
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,780
Your Highness.

18
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,460
Your Highness.

19
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,420
Youjue, we're brothers.

20
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,940
What is the kneeling for?

21
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,230
I have something serious to report to you.

22
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,320
Is it about Gao Bingzhu?

23
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,680
Yes, Your Highness.

24
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,890
What a good-for-nothing Gao Sheng is!

25
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,079
How could Gao Bingzhu escape under his watch?

26
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,230
I've asked him to investigate it.

27
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,160
Once it's clear,

28
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,730
no matter who did this,

29
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,230
I won't let them get away with it.

30
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,010
Your Highness,

31
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,710
Siyue is also involved in it.

32
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,600
No wonder Siyue was also there

33
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,730
when we were catching Wang Dengcheng.

34
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,829
This girl

35
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,790
really leaves us trouble.

36
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,010
Your Highness,

37
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,320
Siyue is young, naive and reckless.

38
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,550
Please show mercy to her.

39
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,829
But in my humble opinion,

40
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,210
this is not supposed to do you no good.

41
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,190
Go on.

42
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,380
Gao Bingzhu

43
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,640
has little to do with the Crown Prince.

44
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,560
What is untrue will always be untrue.

45
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,110
If we really tell Her Majesty about this,

46
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,150
given her mindset,

47
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,280
what will she think?

48
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,510
Now we have caught

49
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,070
the real murderer.

50
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,270
You could simply tell her the truth

51
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,190
to show her your impartiality

52
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,390
and commitment.

53
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,990
How about Gao Bingzhu?

54
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,790
Now that he has run away,

55
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,550
we'd better not make a scene

56
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,390
to catch him.

57
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,160
Or people will notice this.

58
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,440
I think

59
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,720
the best solution is

60
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,910
to not make a big deal out of it

61
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,360
and just let it go.

62
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,510
Why are you still on your knees, Youjue?

63
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,750
Get up.

64
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,530
Thank you, Your Highness.

65
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,270
Youjue, among the youngsters in the Wu family,

66
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,190
who I care about the most

67
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,590
are you and Siyue.

68
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,080
Don't disappoint me.

69
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,510
We'll never do that!

70
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,420
I'm wondering why you said that, Your Highness.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,830
Sit down.

72
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,110
I'm sure you've known

73
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,710
Her Majesty ordered the King of Jin
to oversee the Song Liang case.

74
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,110
It seems Your Highness

75
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,710
is bothered by this case.

76
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,790
The King of Jin

77
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,320
has a problem with the Eastern Palace.

78
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,360
Now he got a big case of rebellion.

79
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,990
He'll surely take the chance

80
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,870
to point the finger at me.

81
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,730
Don't get me wrong.

82
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,940
I have nothing to do with the Song Liang case,

83
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,870
I swear to God.

84
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,190
I believe you, Your Highness.

85
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,950
You don't seem to know the situation.

86
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,590
Song Liang has gone crazy.

87
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,510
In the prison, he's been slandering others.

88
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,260
He even said that he and I

89
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,550
were like-minded

90
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,440
and that we were close friends.

91
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,750
Don't worry, Your Highness.

92
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,880
In detection, we only
make judgments based on evidence.

93
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,480
Now,

94
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,250
whether there is evidence

95
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,150
doesn't matter anymore.

96
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,910
The thing is

97
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,830
the King of Jin will surely take advantage of this

98
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,110
and set the Eastern Palace up.

99
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:21,950
Siyue,

100
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,550
Her Majesty must have known about this,

101
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,160
but she hasn't summoned me.

102
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,350
So,

103
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,430
I haven't slept or eaten well these days.

104
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,280
There's no one I can turn to.

105
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,640
The only person that can help me out

106
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,510
is you.

107
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,080
I'm afraid that

108
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,830
even I won't be of any help.

109
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,560
You will.

110
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,600
You're an interior guard

111
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,240
in Her Majesty's favor.

112
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,150
If you can say something for me

113
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,450
to Her Majesty,

114
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,530
she will listen.

115
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,640
I got what you mean, Your Highness.

116
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,920
Your Highness invited me here

117
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,160
and said all these to me.

118
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,920
I believe Your Highness has a clear conscience.

119
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,850
I will verify everything said by Song Liang

120
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,980
and won't let him slander anyone.

121
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,600
But what worries me now

122
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,640
is that I did have contact

123
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,920
with Song Liang.

124
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,130
If he slanders me,

125
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
I won't be able to defend myself.

126
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,040
When I was going
from Fan Prefecture back to the capital,

127
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,730
I was ambushed by assassins.

128
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,650
Mother!

129
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
-Mother.
-Li Dun.

130
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,409
Song Liang led the Capital Battalion

131
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:52,270
and rescued me.

132
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,090
Bring His Highness out of here!

133
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,900
Were the assassins

134
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,970
from Four Season Clan?

135
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,600
Yes.

136
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,890
Song Liang was the Deputy Minister of War.

137
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,490
It was his job to chase and kill the assassins.

138
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,530
Within ten days,

139
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,300
he killed hundreds of people from the Clan

140
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,530
and captured the leader alive,

141
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,060
who's called Lord Freedom.

142
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,000
Since then,

143
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,940
the Clan has disappeared.

144
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,680
Lord Freedom.

145
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,630
It was Song Liang who destroyed the Clan.

146
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,010
All this was credited to Song Liang.

147
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,360
Since then, he has been promoted

148
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,220
all the way to the Minister of War.

149
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,340
Your Highness,

150
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,480
those from Four Season Clan
are crazy and ruthless.

151
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,610
How could Song Liang

152
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,200
wipe them out so easily?

153
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,760
You mean...

154
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,100
Your Highness,

155
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,410
do you know where Lord Freedom is kept?

156
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,820
The cleansing mask

157
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,840
was made from illite clay minerals.

158
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Welcome, ladies.

159
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,640
It's best for purifying the skin.

160
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,440
I was able to

161
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,050
spare you one jar

162
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,450
from the gifts bestowed by Her Majesty.

163
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,040
It feels so smooth.

164
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,100
No wonder it's from the royal family.

165
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,880
Wrap it for me, then.

166
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:27,910
No problem.

167
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:28,960
Lad.

168
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,250
My lord.

169
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,330
Sir,

170
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,970
has Lady Liu bought isinglass from you?

171
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,660
I don't know this lady.

172
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,820
This box is from you, right?

173
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:46,940
My lady,

174
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,500

I'll have someone make it for you.

Among 18 stores selling isinglass in the capital,

182
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,940
this is the only one you frequently visit.

183

Yunzhi told me

184
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,360
there had been no isinglass at home.

185
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,040
If you wanted any,

186
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,560
you had to buy it from the store.

187
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,760
So, it's not hard

188

to find you.

189
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,510
The chef's lamp soup is not fresh now.

190
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,810
So, I asked Tao to cook this just now.

191
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,370
Eat it when it's hot.

192
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,650
Why are you here, Hongyi?

193
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,400

194

about Song Liang.

Song Liang is slandering others in the prison.

358

All nobles in the capital are worried

What's the point?

363

The thing behind him isn't that simple.

Why?

365

I went to the arsenal the other day

366
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,840
and I felt something was wrong.

367
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,760
They did forge a lot of weapons,

368
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,400
but the secret tunnel in the Unwelcome Well

369
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,600
is narrow and twisty.

370

This means

371
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,510
there wouldn't be many rebel forces.

372
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,160
But Song Liang is not an idiot.

373
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,890
He wouldn't think

was doomed to fail.

00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,890
your friend's buddy

518
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,040
was arrested

519
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,130
and died in prison.

520
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,770
So, you think

521
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,220
you don't deserve

522
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,730
your friend's trust.

523
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,670
You must really care about that friend,

524
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,920
don't you?

525
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,930
I...

526
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,660
I'm an interior guard,

527
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,880
but I keep making mistakes in this case.

528
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,300
I just feel

529
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,480
I failed myself.

530
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,520
Really?

531
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,930
Let me ask you this.

532
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,930
If the guy who died

533
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,050
had nothing to do with your friend,

534
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:48,520
would you still not let it go?

535
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,090
Siyue,

536
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,640
you once told me that

537
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,330
if there's something I want to do,

538
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,080
I should try everything to achieve it.

539
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,770
Right?

540
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,730
Then, do it my way.

541
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,070
If you keep thinking about it,

542
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,730
your guilt will never go away.

543
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,720
If you can do something about it,

544
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,490
you will feel relieved.

545
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,490
I thought

546
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,820
you would never grow up.

547
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,160
But marrying Hongyi

548
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,800
changed you so much.

549
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,930
Everyone says Hongyi is distant,

550
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,280
but I don't think so.

551
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,050
I am the only one

552
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,880
that knows how nice he is.

553
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,960
He is really a good man.

554
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,080
You're easy to please, my lady.

555
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,570
Small praise for Lord Hongyi

556
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,900
can cheer you up all day.

557
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,090
Be careful with it.

558
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,170
Shen Fei.

559
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:47,850
Lady Liu.

560
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,850
Are you getting on a long trip?

561
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,530
Where's Hongyi going?

562
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,310
His lordship wants to go on an outing today.

563
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,320
An outing?

564
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,820
But this carriage

565
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,280
is clearly for a long trip.

566
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:01,110
You won't need so many things for an outing.

567
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,130
Map of Luo Prefecture.

568
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,470
Why do you need

569
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,270
such a complex map for an outing?

570
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,730
Where is Hongyi going?

571
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,720
Where's Hongyi?

572
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,030
My lady.

573
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,280
Where are you going in such a hurry?

574
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,180
Stay at home.

575
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,310
I'll be back soon.

576
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,630
Shen Fei acted weirdly.

577
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,630
You are not going on a normal outing.

578
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,080
You are being evasive,

579
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,090
so I guess it's about Uncle.

580
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,000
If I'm right,

581
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,160
you should stop keeping it from me.

582
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,600
Am I right?

583
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,350
All of these started from
the Mount Lian Copper Mine.

584
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,910
I have to sort it out in Mount Lian.

585
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:03,950
Let me go with you.

586
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:05,650
Hongyi,

587
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,010
your father's death is related to the copper.

588
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,110
My uncle also killed himself
to escape punishment.

589
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,610
If I can't figure out the cause,

590
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,250
I'll be constantly bothered.

591
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:13,910
Gradually,

592
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,730
we will grow apart.

593
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,710
And we'll never truly get along.

594
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,090
Hongyi, let me go with you.

595
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,010
No.

596
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,110
Hongyi.

597
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:25,820
Hongyi.

598
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:37,430
Ma'am.

599
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,530
[Lanqing]

600
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:44,880
My lady.

601
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:50,920
My lady?

602
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:59,750
Hongyi.

603
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,800
Shen Fei, stop!

604
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,530
Hongyi.

605
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,469
It's something serious.

606
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:16,530
Don't mess around.

607
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,170
Hongyi,

608
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,650
from what Shen Fei said,

609
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,440
I can tell

610
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,080
what you're going to do.

611
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,850
I can also do detection.

612
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,679
I really want to help you.

613
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:26,440
Shen Fei,

614
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,659
go to the station ahead

615
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:28,880
and get Liu Ran a carriage.

616
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,929
Hongyi.

617
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,650
My lord, it's late.

618
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,699
How about taking Lady Liu with us?

619
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,659
If you are worried,

620
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,190
go back to the capital with her.

621
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,719
I'll get a carriage myself.

622
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:45,770
My lady.

623
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:46,290
Shen Fei.

624
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:46,840
My lady.

625
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,730
The station is just a short walk away.

626
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:49,860
Please go back, my lady.

627
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,389
Shen Fei.

628
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,850
What's the problem with Mount Lian?

629
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:52,980
Why can't I go there?

630
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:53,889
Nothing.

631
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,880
It's just that the long and bumpy ride

632
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,080
can be physically challenging for you.

633
00:34:59,110 --> 00:34:59,890
My lady,

634
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,030
I can tell you the truth,

635
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,880
but promise me

636
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,480
you'll go back, all right?

637
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,920
Mount Lian is owned by officials.

638
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,370
If you just rush in,

639
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,720
it can be a one-way trip.

640
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,610
A one-way trip?

641
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,870
Don't worry, my lady.

642
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,800
It's going to be fine.

643
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,660
I will be there.

644
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,630
I'll go back, then.

645
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:26,990
Sure.

646
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:27,720
Take care.

647
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,220
We will.

648
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,310
The wind's coming. It's a bit cold.

649
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,710
Seems it's going to rain.

650
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,050
It's getting late.

651
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,330
I'm afraid Lady Liu won't listen

652
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,200
or just go back to the capital.

653
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,120
If she goes somewhere else,

654
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,360
it'll be a problem.
