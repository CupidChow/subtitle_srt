00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:28,950
Okay.

175
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,270
Here you are.

176
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,900
Your Highness.

177
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,809
Hongyi said he wanted

178
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,159
to see you today

179
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,130
and even prepared a gift for you.

180
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,000
Your Highness.

181
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,400
Your Highness.

182
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,480
I felt that Baili Hongyi

183
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,470
was a handsome and brilliant man

184
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,550
when I first met him.

185
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,630
No wonder Liu Ran fell for him

186
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,650
and was only willing to marry him.

187
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,570
I appreciate the gift,

188
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,710
Baili Hongyi.

189
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,340
There's a hidden mechanism.

190
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,940
Princess can try to press it.

191
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,260
This is interesting.

192
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,650
Hongyi designed them

193
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,510
himself.

194
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:26,680
Tell me.

195
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,350
What favors

196
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,670
do you want from me?

197
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,860
I heard that your mansion

198
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,420
has bought quite a bit of charcoals recently.

199
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,220
May I know what they are used for?

200
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,180
Your Highness, please don't be offended.

201
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,110
Hongyi speaks

202
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,710
very directly.

203
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,860
I don't know much about this.

204
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,930
These trivial matters

205
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,730
are handled by the chamberlain.

206
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,090
But recently,

207
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:48,850
Duke of Mount Wind purchased

208
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,050
my Linchuan mansion.

209
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,080
I think the charcoals were purchased by him.

[King Dongchuan: Li Yichen]

211
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,100
I heard you are not feeling well.

212
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,900
I was worried, so I came to visit.

213
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,370
I've brought you

214
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,970
some delicious cherries, great grandmother.

215
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,400
Among all my grandsons,

216
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,950
you're the one who cares about me the most.

217
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,300
Great grandmother,

218
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,010
I think that...

219
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:33,950
Do you know

220
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,460
how the current Crown Prince

221
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,040
was stripped

222
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,670
of his titles?

223
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:52,350
[Palace of Immortality]

224
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,070
He was the emperor,

225
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:58,020
[The Crown Prince: Li Dun]

226
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,260
but he wanted to give everything

227
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,670
to his father-in-law.

228

[Palace of Immortality]

Even though he was the son of

230
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,790
me and the previous emperor.

231
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,800
I couldn't let him to do that.

232
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,120
He treated the kingdom

233
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,710
as his own property.

234
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,400
I will not allow anyone to ruin

235
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,470
this magnificent kingdom I've built.

236
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,900
Grandmother,

237
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,470
I'll do better

238
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,050
and make sure the Intelligence Services

239
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,590
can do its job.

240
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,790
Let me remind you once more.

241
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,740
This is not a place you should go.

242
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,290
I need to find out

243
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,160
why they killed my father

244
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,210
and changed the copper materials.

245
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,110
I'll let you know once I found out.

246
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,240
You said the same thing

247
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,530
when you found the account books.

248
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,960
I don't have faith in you anymore.

249
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
I'll go by myself.

250
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,730
We're not there for leisure.

251
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,830
It is dangerous.

252
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,750
I can't take care of you.

253
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,300
Do you know the different ways of smelting copper?

254
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,570
Do you know

255
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,490
how copper and charcoal are mixed?

256
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,150
Do you know?

257
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,710
Then you need to follow my instructions.

258
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,870
You hear me?

259
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,140
This is date flower cake from the Biyun Pavilion.

260
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,890
Even though this is not as good as

261
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,060
what you usually have,

262
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,420
it is still very well known in the capital.

263
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,080
That's why I brought you some.

264
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,750
Did something happen?

265
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,630
You're usually busy with work.

266
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,160
If there isn't something important,

267
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,760
you usually don't come here.

268
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,400
Come,

269
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:15,590

270
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,350
Tell me about it.

271
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,400
There is still no progress

272
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,030
in the case of the informer.

273
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,010
A few days ago,

274
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,140
I investigated the case in the name of the Interior Guard Services.

275
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,870
I even got my brother worried.

276
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,600
I feel like...

277
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,860
I have not lived up to the expectations of the empress.

278
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,470
The Siyue that I know

279
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,880
is someone who would

280
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,480
do her best

281
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,650
to prove that

282
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,580
the belief that women cannot become interior guard is wrong.

283
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,510
It is unlike you to say such things.

284
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,070
I made a mistake...

285
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,740
and put someone else in trouble.

286
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,200
Even though I didn't kill the person,

287
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,470
he died because of me.

288

Do you think what you're doing is right?

289
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,260
What about this person?

290
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,130
Did he die

291
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,190
because he was doing the right thing?

292
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,860
Then what are you worrying about?

293
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,590

The ground here does not produce chalcanthite water.

It's not suitable for copper smelting.

310

Something is wrong.

318
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,570
Is it because the people here

319
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,630
like to eat fruits?

320
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:30,910

the people here do not farm at all?

The river is just beside here.

Why do you have to go so far

to collect water?

342

Go and play.

00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,440
Your water.

348
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,460
The water here has problems.

349
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,020
The waste products from copper smelting are poisonous.

350
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,480
If this is the downstream,

351
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,700
then somewhere upstream

352
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,480
must be a copper foundry

353
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,940
that we haven't found yet.

354
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,580
If the waste is dumped into the river,

355
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,780
then the water here cannot be consumed.

356
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,190
Lady,

357
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,740
you've cleaned the shelves for three times.

358
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,680
Three times?

359
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,430
Be careful, Lady.

360
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,210
This is Hongyi's

361
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,230
favorite.

362
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,270
I know it.

363
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,260
Lady Liu Ran,

364
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,630
Madam Wu is here.

365
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,190
Siyue,

366
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,630
why are you here?

367
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,040
I'm here to see you.

368
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,340
Why are you doing the cleaning yourself?

369
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,670
Where are the servants?

370
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,300
I've dismissed them.

371
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,960
Let me help you.

372
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,120
It's okay, Yue.

373
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,800
I saw that

374
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,540
Hongyi's study room was messy,

375
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,270
so I wanted to do some cleaning.

376
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,640
It's not a big deal.

377
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,470
It's okay.

378
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,610
It has just been a few days,

379
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,970
but you have changed a lot.

380
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,260
The previous Liu Ran

381
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,750
would not do all these.

382
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,500
The Baili family

383
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,200
has suffered such a misfortune.

384
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,970
Hongyi's mother died when he was little

385
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,290
and now his father is dead too.

386
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,500
I pity him.

387
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,530
That's why I need to take better care of him.

388
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,230
You encountered so much tragedies

389
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,690
shortly after marrying into this family.

390
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,750
You should take care yourself first.

391
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,110
Let me know

392
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,030
if there's anything

393
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,160
that I can help with.

394
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,230
I know.

395
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,410
I won't hold back.

396
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,860
But you came here

397
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,080
not just to see me,

398
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,940
right?

399
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,260
I'm here

400
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,550
to ask about Duke of Mount Wind...

401
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,790
and Baili Hongyi's problems.

402
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,410
What happened between my uncle and Hongyi?

403
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,100
Where's Erlang?

404
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,250
I don't know.

405
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,520
You're here, then where's Hongyi?

406
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,400
Erlang wanted to go to the countryside.

407
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,810
He didn't want me to follow him.

408
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,210
Are you not worried about

409
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,780
Erlang going out on his own?

410
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,650
There's nothing to worry about.

411
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,460
Have a seat.

412
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,120
I saw this person during the day.

413
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,530
There are calluses on his hands.

414
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,760
But it doesn't seem like they are from using a hoe.

415
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,490
He probably works at a foundry.

416
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,930
This is likely a trap.

417
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,090
But this is also the only clue we have.

418
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:20,850
If we don't go,

419
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,110
we can't leave as well.

420
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,060
Be quick.

who else could ensure their safety?

521
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,610
Duke of Mount Wind worries about Miss Liu, right?

522
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,750
So long as you do what needs to be done.

523
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,740
Miss Liu

524
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,940
will stay alive.

525
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,860
I'm sure Liu Xiang has a motive

526
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,770
for stealing the copper from Lianshan.

527
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,360
You go to the Interior Guard Services and look for Madam Wu now.

528
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:42,950
Ask her to bring some people

529
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,480
to collect the evidence at Linchuan mansion.

530
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,600
What about you?

531
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,200
Don't worry about me. Go now.

532
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,820
[Jianchun Gate]

533
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,450
Madam Wu .

534
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,210
How was it?

535
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,290
We can't find him.

536
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:01,700
Let's go.

537
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,840
Do you have evidence of what you're saying?

538
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,610
There's no evidence.

539
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,470
This is what I saw with my own eyes.

540
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,280
In the workshop,

541
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,540
what were they making?

542
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,730
It was a chaotic situation.

543
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,860
We didn't get check.

544
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,280
But the workers there

545
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,280
looked sinister.

546
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,530
There must be some problems.

547
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,480
Just now you said…

548
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,140
Both of you?

549
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:30,860
Yes.

550
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,510
I was with Gao Bingzhu.

551
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,500
Where is he?

552
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:38,820
Beiqi,

553
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,090
go back to the Interior Guard Services and get some men.

554
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:41,540
Yes.

555
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,200
Lady Liu Ran is here.

556
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,510
Tell uncle that I have something urgent to tell him.

557
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,040
Alright.

558
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:53,740
Uncle.

559
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:57,500
Uncle.

560
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,620
Liu Ran,

561
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,260
why did you come?

562
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:01,780
I...

563
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,740
Is it because Baili Hongyi

564
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,990
has made you angry?

565
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,850
You are prejudiced against Hongyi.

566
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,370
Hongyi treats me nicely.

567
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,800
Yesterday, he asked me to go out with him.

568
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,870
But after coming back,

569
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,170
he told me he wanted to go out.

570
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,300
He didn't return

571
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,420
and there was no news of him.

572
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,080
I'm really worried about him.

573
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,360
This morning it suddenly occurred to me...

574
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,470
if he went to

575
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,870
the Linchuan mansion you bought recently.

576
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,700
I'm worried that something bad happened to him.

577
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,900
I see.

578
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,060
Uncle,

579
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,090
I know what you're thinking about.

580
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,890
I understand Hongyi's personality.

581
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,320
He definitely didn't go out for leisure.

582
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,180
I'm sure he had something urgent.

583
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,570
You don't have to worry.

584
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,580
The Linchuan mansion belongs to me.

585
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,490
What could happen to him?

586
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,500
Don't worry.

587
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,620
-Come on.
-Uncle, please tell me.

588
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,700
Liu Ran,

589
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,600
ever since your father went into the mountain to meditate,

590
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,090
I've been looking after you for more than ten years on behalf of him.

591
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,300
In my heart,

592
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,380
you're my own daughter.

593
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,940
I gave you everything you wanted.

594
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,780
I don't want you to suffer.

595
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
And the tenth son.

596
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,690
He said he wanted to go and make something of his own.

597
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,350
He has not been home for years.

598
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,540
If your father

599
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,140
comes back in the future,

600
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,860
I'll feel guilty about it.

601
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,340
Uncle.

602
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,430
I shouldn't have allowed you

603
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,290
to marry Baili Hongyi.

604
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,610
Hongyi has been very nice to me.

605
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,690
I don't think I've been mistreated.

606
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,370
You did not see it.

607
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,470
As time goes by,

608
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,900
you will understand it.

609
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:52,020
As time goes by...

610
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:53,660
Yes,

611
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,180
as time goes by.

612
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,330
How could I've never thought of that?

613
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,570
I know your temperaments.

614
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,780
Even if your

615
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,050
father came back,

616
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,300
he wouldn't

617
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:07,750
be able to stop you.

618
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,460
Uncle.

619
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,220
Liu Ran,

620
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,640
please remember.

621
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,450
We, the Liu family from Hedong,

622
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,820
are a noble family.

623
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,780
If in the future,

624
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,620
Baili Hongyi bullies you,

625
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,650
you can give him a divorce letter

626
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,890
and get a divorce with him.

627
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,490
We'll not tolerate bullies.

628
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,400
Why do you keep talking

629
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,660
about strange things?

630
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:28,780
What happened?

631
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:29,860
Nothing.

632
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,090
I don't want you to get bullied.

633
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,510
Then Hongyi...

634
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,570
You don't have to worry.

635
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,300
He'll be fine.

636
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,970
Are you sure?

637
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,020
I'm sure.

638
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,090
There's no rush.

639
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,320
It's alright.

640
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,580
You go back first.

641
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,410
I still have something to do.

642
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,300
Then I'll go back first.

643
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,610
When Hongyi is back,

644
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,080
I'll come and visit you with him.

645
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,860
Sure.

646
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:50,730
Last night,

647
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,120
there were at least ten workers here.

648
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,260
They must have left

649
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:55,090
because we discovered them.

Gao Bingzhu, right?

653
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:30,980
Master Xunshan wants to meet you.

You're here.

656
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,940
You look relaxed.

657
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:13,590
I guess

658
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,860
you were expecting me.

659

Now,

660
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,620
I'm a bit surprised.

661
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,380
You...

662
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:26,380
a lowly

and standing before me?

667
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,030
Where did you get the courage to do so?

668
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,830
Would you dare to drink

669
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,770
a cup of tea prepared by me?

670
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,300
What did you find out last night?

671
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,290
You don't have to be nervous.

672
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,490
I don't care about

673
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,500
who or why

674
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,300
they stole the copper.

675
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,180
Then what do you care about?

676
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,650
I only want to find Four Season Divine.

677
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,680
You have found the right person.

678

I'm Four Season Divine.
