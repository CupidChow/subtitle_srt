The King of Jin will go out tomorrow.

All the officers in the field

11

are drafted to protect him.

This is Sir Wu's order.

13
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,030
Everyone should assemble

Shall we ask Hongyi

20

to push it back a day?

21
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,030
No.

22
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,470
It would alarm Four Season Clan.

23

If we need reinforcements,

24
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,270
can we ask Gao Bingzhu for help?

I didn't expect to see him on the list.

He's just investigating.

47
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,230
It doesn't mean

48
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,310
you are guilty.

49
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,270
My lord, you asked Gao to find out the mole,

50
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,390
not mess things up.

51
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,710
He looked up all the registers

52
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,110
and fabricated charges.

53
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,829
I think he's listed all our agents as suspects.

54
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,870
We haven't found the mole.

55
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,790
It's true that everyone is suspicious.

56

57

After I took over the Services,

62

70
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,150
just leave it to Gao Bingzhu.

you enjoy alcohol.

117

It's just Lord Hongyi doesn't drink,

118

so you rarely get to drink.

made in the western countries.

Okay.

165
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,010
I'll ask the officers to find him.

My lady,

167
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,230
he is at Liubai Building.

00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,640
An assassin wouldn't attract so much attention.

176
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,950
Pass this list around.

177
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,760
Yes, sir.

178
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,370
Is there a mistake?

179
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,110
Agent Gao,

180
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,590
why is my name

181
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,080
[Yanqing, junior scribe]

182
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,040
on the list of suspects?

183
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,970
[Agent Guxi]

184
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,910
I compiled this list myself.

185
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,560
Over 30 people are on it.

186
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,290
We haven't found the mole yet.

187
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,590
So, everyone on the list is suspicious.

188
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,040
I need detailed information
on everyone on the list.

189
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,030
All of us

190
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,430
have helped you all night.

191
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,930
[Agent Yize]

192
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,750
Somehow, we've become suspects.

193
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,230
Have a look.

194
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,960
In that case,

195
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,360
I don't think I should be
involved in the investigation.

196
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,060
[Agent Huangzhong]

197
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,950
Why are you, a newly appointed halberdier,

198
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,080
so sure of yourself?

199
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,390
How dare you to suspect us,

200
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,850
who've worked for the Services for decades?

201
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,220
If you'll excuse me...

202
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:39,950
Now that our names

203
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,010
are all on the list,

204
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,640
we shall recuse ourselves.

205
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,120
I'm leaving.

206
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,010
Take it.

207
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,710
He's stirring up trouble
with all the investigation.

208
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,210
My lord.

209
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,750
My lord, this way.

210
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,920
Lord Pei of the Grand Court?

211
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,190
So, Madam Wu

212
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,850
asked the Grand Court to help.

213
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:24,920
It's urgent.

214
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,150
My guards are on a last-minute task.

215
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,990
After much thought,

216
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,070
I could only ask you for help, Lord Pei.

217
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:29,600
Madam Wu,

218
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,950
it is okay for different departments

219
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,410
to work on a case together.

220
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,230
However, this is a huge case.

221
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,790
I'm afraid Lord Gao won't allow it

222
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,630
without the license issued by Sir Wu.

223
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,760
That's why I came to visit you at night.

224
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:41,870
Our mission

225
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,370
is to lure the Clan out.

226
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,030
The Clan has disappeared for years.

227
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,790
Lord Pei, don't you want to

228
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,750
arrest these rebels on your own?

229
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,670
The investigation of the mole is important.

230
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,230
If the mole

231
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,630
was indeed among us,

232
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,350
they'd love to see

233
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,710
what we're doing now.

234
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,440
There's a mole in the Palace of Nature.

235
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,570
I bet you're all thinking,

236
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,240
'Well, it's not me. I've got nothing to fear.'

237
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,520
It makes sense if the people on the list

238
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,160
want to recuse themselves.

239
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,990
You should've been the pillar of the Services

240
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,390
and a rock of Her Majesty!

241
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,190
Turns out you're just a bunch of cowards

242
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,450
trying to run away from responsibility.

243
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,810
You always remind me that I am new.

244
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,590
I want to ask you this.

245
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,350
The almighty Intelligence Services

246
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,950
has been disrupted by a mole.

247
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,750
Is this the so-called

248
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,680
'the ears and eyes' of Her Majesty?

249
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,750
Agent Han

250
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,110
died mysteriously.

251
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,310
Are you going to let it go?

252
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:30,990
Okay.

253
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,210
My lady,

254
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,950
we've got some tasty dishes ready for you.

255
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,350
Yes.

256
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,270
Okay, let's go.

257
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,590
Such delicacies!

258
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,800
Here.

259
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,070
Welcome back.

260
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:54,440
Okay.

261
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:54,790
Thanks.

262
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,190
Enjoy.

263
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,890
Please.

264
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,370
On that day,

265
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,750
I was investigating another case

266
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,590
when Agent Han suddenly came

267
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,790
and asked me to send a secret letter

268
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,190
to Madam Wu of the Interior Guard Services.

269
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,110
The envelope was sealed,

270
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,910
so I don't know what it was about.

271
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,030
It was not until Agent Han died

272
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,230
that we were told that

273
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,670
he went to Fashan Temple

274
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,110
to meet with Madam Wu.

275
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,110
I was told that he brought some monks

276
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,170
with him on that day

277
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,190
to Fashan Temple.

278
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:27,710
Yes.

279
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,350
They are actually the middlemen of our Services.

280
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,210
The middlemen?

281
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,230
The middlemen

282
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,550
are in charge of intel gathering.

283
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,630
They often deal with encrypted information.

284
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,150
So, some middlemen

285
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,520
can decode ciphers.

286
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,500
On that day,

287
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,230
it was me that sent them the message

288
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,270
to go on a mission

289
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,630
at Fashan Temple.

290
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,310
But there's no way

291
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,790
they would've known

292
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,950
about the details of the mission

293
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,510
or the leader of the mission.

294
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,910
They wouldn't leak

295
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,080
Agent Han's whereabouts for sure.

296
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,610
How long have you known Agent Han?

297
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,190
Since I joined the Services.

298
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,550
When I was a scribe,

299
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,750
it was he that coached me.

300
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,480
He was my teacher and my friend.

301
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,110
So,

302
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,990
you must've known a lot

303
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:09,950
about the ciphers

304
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,350
with him as your teacher.

305
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,190
The ciphers were written and revised by Agent Han.

306
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,230
No one else was allowed to be involved.

307
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,710
Therefore, I don't know much

308
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,770
about the ciphers.

309
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,510
My lord, please.

310
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,120
Okay.

311
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,320
Take care, my lord.

312
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:35,670
My lady, how may I...

313
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,330
I am looking for Baili Hongyi.

314
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,510
Baili Hongyi?

315
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,760
What are you doing here?

316
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,390
Sir, more juice, please.

317
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:16,849
No need.

318
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:18,190
Okay.

319
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,339
I've got something important to do.

320
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:20,940
Leave now.

321
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,950
I can't talk too loud.

322
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,510
I know you are lying.

323
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,350
You got an important lead from Mount Lian.

324
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,880
However, it put you at risk.

325
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,670
So, they wanted to kill you on the way.

326
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,070
Right?

327
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,710
After we got back,

328
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,550
I was surrounded by strange people.

329
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,990
You were worried that I'd feel scared,

330
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,070
so you didn't tell me

331
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,270
because you wanted to protect me

332
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,630
and take all the risks on your own.

333
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,310
Am I right?

334
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,520
Hongyi.

335
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,470
Hongyi,

336
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,670
we're a couple!

337
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,430
No matter what happens,

338
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,770
I will be there for you.

339
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,470
May I take your order?

340
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,130
I'm looking for Baili Hongyi.

341
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,070
Gao Bingzhu has narrowed the list

342
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,590
down to around thirty people.

343
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,830
He's summoned these people to the Hall of Skills.

344
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,630
I don't know what he's planning.

345
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,210
Are they all at the Hall of Skills?

346
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,830
Yes.

347
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,070
Gao Bingzhu.

348
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,720
I am intrigued to see
what surprise he's prepared for me.

349
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,750
It's not your business.

350
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,380
Leave now.

351
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,310
Stop lying to me!

352
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,270
I know you're trying to protect me.

353
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,070
That's not it.

354
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,750
I just don't want you to get in my way.

355
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,410
Stop lying!

356
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,670
Should I take her away?

357
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,130
No need.

358
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,420
It will ruin the mission.

359
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,090
Back at Mount Lian,

360
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,870
if not for you,

361
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,310
Shen Fei and I would've been much freer.

362
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,170
Instead, we lost the opportunity and the evidence.

363
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,070
And your uncle...

364
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,090
If not for him,
my father would've still been alive.

365
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,110
Are you blaming me?

366
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,710
Yes, I am.

367
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,190
Ever since we got married,

368
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,670
Baili Mansion has been through a lot.

369
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,510
Keeping your distance

370
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,370
is the best thing you can do for me.

371
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:42,750
Are you

372
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,910
being serious?

373
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,310
Are you Baili Hongyi?

374
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:00,930
No, I am not.

375
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,800
What's he doing?

376
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,570
Don't move!

377
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,310
Sweet and tasty!

378
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,190
Try some!

379
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,110
Try some!

380
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,290
My lord,

381
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,270
have a try.

382
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,680
It's very tasty.

383
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,090
Thank you, my lord.

384
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,800
My lady, buy one!

385
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,230
See you soon!

386
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,270
You didn't kneel before me.

387
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,100
What on earth are you up to?

388
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,480
My lord, please allow me

389
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,910
to arrest and interrogate

390
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,870
these people.

391
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,110
The mole is among them.

392
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,190
My lord, you're wise.

393
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,710
All of us here have been dedicated ourselves

394
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,310
to the Services for decades.

395
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,990
If you question our loyalty to the Services,

396
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,390
you might as well kill us.

397
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,160
Gao Bingzhu,

398
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,080
all these people are veterans.

399
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,310
Think before you speak.

400
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,490
[Agent Linzhong]

401
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,150
Do you think

402
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,550
we are all moles?

403
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,030
Right.

404
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,430
Now that I've joined the Services,

405
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,310
I need to act according to the rules.

406
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,910
I want to arrest you for interrogation

407
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,830
just to make sure

408
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,360
I'll have enough evidence.

409
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:00,950
Seems that

410
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,970
you've had a suspect on your mind.

411
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,390
I've figured out

412
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,150
who the mole is.

413
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,450
Really?

414
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,590
Who is it?

415
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,750
An Baitan!

416
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,470
Have a look!

417
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,070
You've done a great job hiding your identity.

418
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,630
Gao Bingzhu, how dare you!

419
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,920
Impossible.

420
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:01,770
My lord,

421
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,280
you won't harbor her, will you?

422
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,750
Please, my lord, trust me!

423
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,210
You're talking nonsense.

424
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,120
His Lordship trusts Madam An the most.

425
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,390
If she's the mole,

426
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,270
why didn't she just kill him?

427
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,190
Even by revealing His Lordship's identity

428
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,990
would she destroy the Services.

429
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:17,910
He's right.

430
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,150
If she killed Lord Chu,

431
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,870
Her Majesty will appoint someone else.

432
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,830
An Baitan has earned His Lordship's trust.

433
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,230
If he was replaced by someone else,

434
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,870
how could she obtain confidential information?

435
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:26,150
You!

436
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,280
Ridiculous!

437
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,630
You fabricated charges

438
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,360
and wanted to

439
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,830
throw mud at Madam An.

440
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,070
Even the biggest rascals in the world

441
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,510
would bow down to you.

442
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,350
Fellows, let's reread
The Book of Fabricating Charges

443
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,470
and learn from Agent Gao.

444
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,960
If His Lordship believed your lies

445
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,480
and unprecedentedly convicted Madam An,

446
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,470
all of us in the Services

447
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,410
[Agent Taicu]

448
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,470
would be deterred

449
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,910
and want to protect ourselves.

450
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,990
We'd choose self-protection over dedication.

451
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:51,590
Then,

452
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,310
there'd be no one trustworthy

453
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,710
and reliable in the Services.

454
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,470
Our Services will be stuck in infinite chaos.

455
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,150
Yes, he's right.

456
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:57,410
Yes.

457
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,200
Gao Bingzhu,

458
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,710
good for you!

459
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,720
He's fabricating charges.

460
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,250
Move! Out of my way!

461
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,790
Out of my way!

462
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,440
Careful!

463
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,950
Move!

464
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:19,990
Watch out!

465
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,450
What are you doing?

466
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:29,940
Watch it!

467
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,350
Move!

468
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,550
What's wrong with you?

469
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,810
What's wrong with you?

470
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,040
Slow down, will you?

471
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:35,950
I need proof.

472
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,430
Agent Han decided to go to Fashan Temple
at the last minute.

473
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,270
Since the mole knew about his whereabouts,

474
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,590
they must've also been at the Hall of Skills.

475
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,350
The mole has been hiding
in the Services for years

476
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,310
and has never been found.

477
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:49,150
It means that no one will ever think of them
as a suspect.

478
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,070
And that's who I wanted to find,

479
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,980
a person no one will suspect.

480
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:35,550
An Baitan!

481
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,870
You've had frequent visits to the Hall of Skills.

482
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,670
You have access to all the confidential files.

483
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,870
You are trusted by His Lordship.

484
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,200
You have a clean record.

485
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,180
Even after all the internal investigations,

486
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,790
you, of all people, still are the least suspicious.

487
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,920
-An Baitan.
-You...

488
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,190
How long have you worked here?

489
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,850
More than three years, right?

490
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,990
So, you know how it's run and the agents' jobs

491
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,450
like the back of your hand.

492
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,270
An Baitan,

493
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,830
I've looked up all of your records.

494
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,390
You've not made a single mistake

495
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,470
in the past three years.

496
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,750
You've got a perfectly clean record.

497
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,070
Everyone trusts you,

498
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,270
including Agent Han.

499
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,430
He didn't even hide it from you

500
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,460
when he went to Fashan Temple

501
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,910
to check Liu Xiang's ledgers.

502
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,970
More importantly,

503
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:10,820
the ciphers he wrote

504
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,150
were based on the Selections from Music Books
compiled by Her Majesty.

505
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,910
The mole needs to know well about music theory

506
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,950
and musical temperament
to understand the ciphers.

507
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,670
An Baitan,

508
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,430
if the records are correct,

509
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,950
you were sent to the Royal Academy

510
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,270
as a kid to study musical temperament, right?

511
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,030
Nonsense!

512
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,350
I did study musical temperament,

513
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,990
but I'm not the only one here
that has studied it.

514
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,250
That's your evidence?

515
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,360
How ridiculous!

516
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,190
Only those whom Agent Han trusted the most

517

could leak his whereabouts.

518
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,630
You just said that

519
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,950
he was your teacher and your friend.

520
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,530
The 16th Night?

521
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,310
Go!

522
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:00,920
Gao Bingzhu,

523
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,440
your accusation

524
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,320
lacks witness or evidence.

525
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,070
It's based on your assumption.

526
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,530
It cannot be used as proof.

527
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,010
The mole in the Services is a serious matter.

528
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,360
I urge you to thoroughly investigate.

529
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:12,890
My lord,

530
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,030
An Baitan is a major suspect.

531
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,830
Before everything is clear,

532
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,630
I urge you to hold her in detention.

533
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,070
Gao Bingzhu!

534
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,320
Are you alright?

535
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,080
Madam Wu!

536
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,000
Carry on!

537
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,250
Yes, madam.

538
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,270
The mole has been caught.

539
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,990
You should go back to work

540
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,870
as usual.

541
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,550
Why are you following me?

542
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,350
Madam An is only in detention temporarily.

543
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,270
She's not convicted.

544
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,910
Before I see any decisive evidence,

545
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,190
I refuse to believe

546
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,190
that she's the mole that sold us out.

547
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,110
You think of her as your colleague.

548
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,370
It's only natural you feel sorry for her.

549
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,270
However, if I made all this up,

550
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,590
why would His Lordship agree

551
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,030
to hold her in detention?

552
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:37,420
Guys,

553
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,680
if any of you can find proof,

554
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,000
you'll be rewarded.

555
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:45,790
Guys,

556
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,750
if any of you can work out this case,

557
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,630
I will ask His Lordship

558
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,980
to promote you as an executive agent.

559
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,390
It's...

560
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,550
If you want to earn merit,

561
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,710
now is the time.

562
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,510
What?

563
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,570
Do you all want to take advantage of a colleague?

564
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,590
If anyone is after

565
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,510
my position,

566
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,120
they can come talk to me.

567
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,720
I won't get involved

568
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,080
in this dirty business.

569
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,190
Yes.

570
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,390
He's right.

571

I'm out.

572

575

I'm out.

Where is the assassin?

577
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,030
You almost died earlier.

578
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,960
Do you know that?

579

Zhang is an officer at the Grand Court.

580
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,870
We agreed to let him protect you.

581
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:47,910
You acted on your own

582
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:48,460
without him by your side.

583
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,470
Do you know how risky that was?

584
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,030
Liu Ran showed up out of the blue.

585
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,070
I didn't have time to think.

586
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,230
I couldn't let him make a move at Liubai Building.

587

What if I hadn't arrived in time?

588
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,950
I knew you'd come.

589
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,090
I'll let it pass

590
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,290
for Liu Ran's sake.

591
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,230
That assassin is the 16th Night of the Clan.

592
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,230
He didn't kill you this time.

593
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,310
He won't give up.

594
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:15,310
You should stay at the Interior Guard Services
for a few days.

595
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,710
There will be other assassination attempts
by the Clan.

596

I can continue to be a bait

until we catch him alive.

598

How many lives do you think you have?

599

They are sly and they're everywhere.

600
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,590
You were almost killed

601
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,630
even if we'd made a thorough plan.

602
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,430
And the next time?

603

Who could possibly ensure your safety?

604

We need to give it a chance.

more and more like Gao Bingzhu.

Why did you accuse An Baitan?

625

It was just an act.

626
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,190
I thought so.

that I'm devoting myself

to investigating it.

how sure are you
that the mole will walk into your trap?

637

I wrongfully accused An Baitan.

638
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,290
The mole will make a move for sure.

639

00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,390
you've now

690
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,360
become a target.

691
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:43,350
If you don't want to be grounded, you'll be killed.

692
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,130
If you don't like these books,

693
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,710
I'll have them find other books.

694
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,670
I am not bragging,

695
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,530
but I can get you all the classics.

696
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,370
As long as I don't go out of your sight,

697
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,830
I can walk around freely in here?

698
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,870
Sir Li didn't say.

699
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:06,870
However,

700
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,910
as long as it's not somewhere off-limits,

701
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,910
I think it's okay.

702
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:15,750
Come!

703
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,150
Come on!

704
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:33,530
My lord,

705
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,190
I am innocent.

706
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:36,970
My lord!

707
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,750
My lord!

708
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,270
I know

709
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,070
you won't say anything.

710
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,810
You killed an executive agent

711
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,750
and tried to destroy my Services.

712
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,310
Do you think

713
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,950
I'll end your life

714
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,470
that easily?
