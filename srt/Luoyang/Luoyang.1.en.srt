The only captive in the south of the capital

521
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,720
almost got killed.

522
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:45,860
This morning,

523
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,160
Gao Sheng sent someone to question us.

524
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:50,560
I know.

525
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,140
It was my fault for not protecting the convict.

526
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,890
It was your fault for

527
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,170
almost getting yourself into trouble.

528
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,220
If the only convict was killed,

529
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,870
the empress would be angry.

530
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,450
The reason Gao Sheng is doing this,

531
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,660
is to make you

532
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,710
take the blame,

533
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,470
and cause you to be killed.

534
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,750
To serve the empress

535
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,380
is the job of the Interior Guard Services.

536
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,690
If the empress were to blame us,

537
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,020
I should take the blame.

538
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,260

how are you going to protect yourself in the palace?

A few days ago, we received an order.

586
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,790
A father and daughter

587
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,190
came from Mount Lian to capital to tip off.

588

The soldiers of Weizhou

were supposed to escort them to the Interior Guard Services.

But when Li Chun arrived at the Dragon Gate Ferry,

he found out that the cabin of the escort team

when transported to the capital

631

needs to be done through water and land.

It was her first trip here with her father.

691
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,720
All the evidence...

692
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,690
The reason I'm here today,

693
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,580
is because the guards need cooperation from the Grand Court

694
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,040
to investigate the murder of the informers.

[Lin Yan, Lin Zhong]

696
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,510
Did you find any token or letter

697
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,900
on their bodies?

698
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,660
In reply to your question,

699
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,250
we only found an official document

700
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,180
on their bodies,

701
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,540
to prove that they were from Mount Lian.

702
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,180
Did anyone touch the bodies?

703
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,530

[Morgue]

705
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,410
When you moved the bodies here,

706
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,740
did you take any belongings

707
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,920
from their bodies?

708
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:18,820
Ma'am,

709
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,200
"do not take the belongings of the dead"

710
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,420
is the rule of our job.

711
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,940
Unless you want to go to the Infinite Hell when you die.

712
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,400
Nobody would ever do that.

713
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:26,250
Yes!

714
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,300
Nobody dares.

715
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,350
Lord Pei.

716
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,710
The murderer who was caught in south of the capital

717
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,720
has been sent to the cell to recuperate

718
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,020
as he was stabbed last night.

719
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,320
However, when I went to send food to him this morning,

720
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:35,990
I realized that

721
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,650
he's dead for quite some time.

722
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,850
He suffered three stabs,

723
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,810
but he survived.

724
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,740
And now he's dead after being sent for treatment.

725
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,330
Lord Pei,

726
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,800
what a good show

727
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,150
the Grand Court

728
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,320
has put up!

729
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:57,460
That's a dirty lie!

730
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,970
If it weren't the instructions from the superior,

731
00:40:58,970 --> 00:40:59,930
there must be traitors

732
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:00,990
in the Grand Court!

733
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,400
Stop talking nonsense!

734
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,090
He died because of serious injury.

735
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,620
It has nothing to do with us!

736
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,720
What are you still waiting for?

737
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,850
Whoever have entered

738
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:12,870
the cell where the murdered was held,

739
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,170
get all of them.

740
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,850
Interrogate them one by one.

741
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:16,910
-Yes sir.
-Yes sir.

742
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,540
I killed him.

743
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,270
How is it possible?

744
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,910
-Yes.
-Right.

745
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,800
How can it be you?

746
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,280
Gao Bingzhu.

747
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,370
Please don't joke.

748
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:28,410
Impossible!

749
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:29,900
Impossible!

750
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,720
Gao Bingzhu was drinking with me last night.

751
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,310
I've worked with him

752
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,440
for years.

753
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:33,660
It can't be him.

754
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:34,370
-It can't be him.
-Right.

755
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,300
I am Gao Bingzhu,

756
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,910
the mortician of the Grand Court.

757
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:43,420
That person,

758
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,080
I killed him.
