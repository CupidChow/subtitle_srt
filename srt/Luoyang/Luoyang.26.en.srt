[Episode 26]

4
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,420
No one expected that

5
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,660
some outlanders

6
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,050
from the caravan died.

7
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,220
If the news

8
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,460
leaks out,

9
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,640
Her Majesty will become furious.

10
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:50,530
I...

11
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,590
-I didn't mean it.
-Your Highness.

12
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,420
Taoist Tiantong

13
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,600
could be related to Four Season Clan.

14
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,350
Four Season...

15
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,460
No.

16
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,300
It was Dai Zhou's fault!

17
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,780
He deceived me!

18
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,060
I.. I was fooled by them!

19
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,220
Where is Dai Zhou?

20
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,540
He has been missing

21
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,540
for several days.

22
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,290
So, as you said,

23
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,380
if people make elixirs
according to this formula,

24
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,140
what they get

25
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,620
will either be poison

26
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,700
or lime.

27
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,740
You're right.

28
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,860
Cao Gongqi,

29
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,520
a writer in Liang Dynasty,

30
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,180
once wrote Techniques for People.

31
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,640
You can have a look at that.

32
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,380
Then you will know

33
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,180
how ridiculous this formula is.

34
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,750
Father, have some food.

35
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,340
Hongyi.

36
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,700
Hasn't she come back?

37
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,380
The water is boiling!

38
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,170
Bingzhu, didn't you see this?

39
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,630
You're so absent-minded.

40
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:17,860
Are you going to

41
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,990
set my house on fire?

42
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,820
Look how worried you are!

43
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,880
Everyone can tell.

44
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,700
The Eastern Palace is strictly guarded.

45
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,660
She wasn't there for shopping.

46
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,740
How could she be back so quickly?

47
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,780
Calm down.

48
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,140
Didn't you join
the Intelligence Services

49
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,079
and swear to never

50
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,410
dream of love or family?

51
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,260
Why are you...

52
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,900
Do you want me

53
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,360
to throw you into the fire?

54
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,740
This is between the two of you.

55
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,000
Don't get me involved.

56
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,579
Was His Highness hard on you?

57
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,420
It's fine.

58
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,340
People in the Eastern Palace said

59
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,290
they haven't seen Dai Zhou for 7 days,

60
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,020
which means

61
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,170
he went missing

62
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,590
after Kang Zhanbi died.

63
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,980
He seems to be hiding from His Highness

64
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,620
as well as others who want him dead.

65
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,880
That's why he ran away.

66
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,700
Probably.

67
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,140
I've heard that he loves gambling.

68
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,470
He owed Yang's Casino in Hui Jie Fang a lot.

69
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,860
Since he still owes the owner,

70
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,589
they probably know where he is.

71
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,180
We need to hurry.

72
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,040
Shall we go now?

73
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:19,690
No.

74
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,330
That casino is a mixed bag of people.

75
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,990
They are hostile to officers.

76
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,020
Stay here.

77
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,340
I can wear a disguise.

78
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,290
It doesn't work.

79
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,220
Those people are sharp-eyed.

80
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,450
They can tell
something is wrong from your eyes

81
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,110
and you'll be in trouble then.

82
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,090
If anything

83
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,370
ever happens to you,

84
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,060
he...

85
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,970
You have no idea

86
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,860
how lost he was just now.

87
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,330
He almost burned my house!

88
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,330
Eat your pancake!

89
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,300
Leave this to us.

90
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,060
Wait for my good news.

91
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,940
Take care.

92
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,820
The Thunder Formula?

93
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,260
What's this?

94
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,740
You spent ages reading this page.

95
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,060
I finally see

96
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,850
why Lord Liu said it was ridiculous.

97
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,180
The manuscript recorded a lot

98
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,020
on Xuanwu's Pearl.

99
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,150
It's similar to this Thunder Formula,

100
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,720
but this formula isn't for

101
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,100
making elixirs containing minerals.

102
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,820
It's used to eliminate the toxicity

103
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,020
produced by minerals and ingredients.

104
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,340
Shen Fei!

105
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,370
Shen Fei!

106
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,760
Hongyi, what's your plan?

107
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:56,810
My lord.

108
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,020
My lady.

109
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,500
My lord, anything I can help with?

110
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,450
Get a furnace.

111
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,620
Buy five portions of these

112
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,150
according to this formula.

113
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,870
What are you going to do?

114
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,220
Make elixirs.

115
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,420
Go now.

116
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,290
Okay.

117
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,220
Hongyi?

118
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,620
Hongyi,

119
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,790
are you going to be an alchemist

120
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,060
like my father?

121
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:38,260
Hongyi!

122
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,640
Please don't, Hongyi!

123
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,130
My father was like this before.

124
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,810
At first, he was just reading

125
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,940
at home.

126
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,860
Then he started to make elixirs.

127
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,010
Later on, he went on traveling.

128
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:47,900
He left us behind

129
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,090
and never came back.

130
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,340
Are you leaving us

131
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,260
like my father?

132
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,460
Father used to say that

133
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,659
he did this

134
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:54,740
to reassure Her Majesty,

135
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,580
but I think

136
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,860
his love for Taoism

137
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,780
is true.

138
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,330
Will you ignore us

139
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,580
like him?

140
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:00,980
Hongyi?

141
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,460
I won't.

142
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,980
People who seek immortality

143
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,780
will die of these elixirs one day.

144
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,100
I'm not like your father.

145
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,380
I just want to know

146
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,970
what elixirs can people make

147
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,140
using this formula.

148
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,310
Are you sure?

149
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,810
Then, can I join you?

150
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,110
Why are you here?

151
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,730
I've been here for a while.

152
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,330
You have others on your mind.

153
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,980
Of course, you didn't see me.

154
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:00,860
How can you make jokes

155
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,140
at this moment?

156
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,700
Have you heard about what happened

157
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,300
in the Eastern Palace today?

158
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,260
It is said that

159
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,060
there was a fire in the backyard.

160
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,020
His Highness was making elixirs

161
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,550
and the furnace was on fire.

162
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,670
Making elixirs?

163
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,220
The Ceremony of Light is coming soon.

164
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,020
His Highness wants to make the elixir

165
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,350
and please Her Majesty.

166
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,250
What Her Majesty thinks about him

167
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,080
remains unclear.

168
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,770
Or I could definitely get him into trouble

169
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,300
in the name of collaborating with Song Liang.

170
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,990
You're just Her Majesty's nephew,

171
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,220
but he is her son.

172
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,490
You should know

173
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,370
what to do

174
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,250
and what not to do.

175
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,900
It should be here.

176
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,420

this person as well.

265

He has a gambling addiction

266
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,300
and he places large bets.

267
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,530
He owed me a lot.

268
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,530

269
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,940
At least this much.

Such a large amount!

as a pledge to get so much money?

273

He's a retainer in the Eastern Palace.

00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,940
What he had

276
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,620
was this Tortoise Token.

277
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,220
Is this real?

278
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,260
It is!

279
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,100
He used this Tortoise Token

280
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,930
to borrow real money.

281
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,220
I've sent people to find him

282

so many times.

283

They almost

284
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,570
started to fight in front of the Palace.

285
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,020
However, he refused to return my money.

286
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,260
When I sent people the last time,

287
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,540
he was already gone.

288
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,060
Where is he now?

289
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,260
I sent people to search for him.

290
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,180
Someone met him

291
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,590
at the quay in the south of Luoyang.

292
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,980
He seemed to take a boat to Jiangnan.

00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,660
Is it done?

find Dai Zhou!

324
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,090
The owner of this casino

325
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,140
was lying.

326
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,050

were all true.

331
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:08,940
Didn't you prove that

332
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,540
the Tortoise Token was real?

333
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,700
That's where I found it strange.

334
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,320
If you are the owner of the casino,

335
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,180
will you accept
the Tortoise Token or Official Seal

336

to be the pledge?

337
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,980
I was stupid.

338
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,810
These things are worth nothing

340

Nobody wants these.

341
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,580
So the owner took it out

342
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,410
just to persuade us

that Dai Zhou had already resigned
and went to Jiangnan.

The owner

People like him

353
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,620
won't easily agree to meet someone new

354
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,180
or tell other people the truth.

355
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,540
So you caught the dealer cheating

356
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,570
just to see the owner.

357
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,860
We wouldn't be easily fooled.

358
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,620
He could tell by simply looking at us.

359
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,300
He made up the story

360
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,340
of Dai Zhou going to Jiangnan,

361
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,960
but he just wanted us to leave.

362
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,860
If I'm right,

363
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,180
Dai Zhou

364
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,340
is in the casino right now.

365
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,690
We questioned

366
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,570
the owner tonight.

367
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,700
He won't let Dai Zhou stay.

368
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,220
Nobody wants trouble.

369
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,040
Dai Zhou will probably

370

leave before sunrise.

Why?

386
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,500
Just save it.

00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,340
Aren't you teaching Taoism

526
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,000
and calling yourself a saint?

527
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:56,740
He's right.

528
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,850
I didn't become a saint

529
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,620
by making elixirs.

530
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,180
The basis of Taoism
is to cultivate yourself

531
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,900
and pay no attention to mundane affairs.

532
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,780
That's how you become a saint.

533
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,520
But Taoist Tiantong in Yuncui Temple

534
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,940
said something different.

535
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,940
Yes, why?

536
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,420
Tiantong is a nerd.

537
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,740
He is crazy now!

538
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,200
What he said was nonsense!

539
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:15,540
This...

540
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,180
I think you are the one who's crazy!

541
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,820
Taoist Tiantong is kind and generous.

542
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,060
Indeed.

543
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,210
He treats ordinary people

544
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,540
and gives his elixirs for free.

545
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:21,700
Right.

546
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,900
Don't you say things like that!

547
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,140
Right.

548
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,130
You're jealous.

549
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,890
He is.

550
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,420
I know he gives elixirs for free,

551
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,460
but after reading

552
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,650
the manuscript,

553
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,730
it's hard to tell whether he's giving elixirs

554
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,620
or poison.

555
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,050
Is he treating people

556
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,780
or killing people?

557
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,500
How could he let you read

558
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,650
his manuscript?

559
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,820
Unless you stole it from him.

560
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,540
I stole it? Why would I steal that?

561
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,570
I didn't even want to look at it!

562
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,980
If I wasn't helping my daughter...

563
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,420
I...

564
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:46,740
What?

565
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,850
Did he read the manuscript?

566
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,330
He did!

567
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:48,930
He read it!

568
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:49,530
He did.

569
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,460
Please teach us!

570
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,740
He did read it!

571
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,420
He did!

572
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,260
Indeed.

573
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,900
I really

574
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,100
don't want to be here.

575
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,460
I'll remove the stove then.

576
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,860
Your health...

577
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,110
Just go straight to the point.

578
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,160
What's your idea on His Highness's interest

579
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,240
in alchemy?

580
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,650
He wants to please Her Majesty.

581
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,660
It's not something serious.

582
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,740
Her Majesty is getting on in years.

583
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,220
The fight for the crown is about to happen.

584
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,750
How could it not be serious?

585
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,010
I can't bring my men

586
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,570
and go to the Eastern Palace

587
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,380
to destroy His Highness's furnace, right?

588
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,570
Just tell me

589
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,450
if you have any favor to ask.

590
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,010
Youjue, you know me better than others.

591
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,300
The Internal Guard Services

592
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,770
seems to be working on a case

593
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,660
on the murder of merchants from the West.

594
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,720
It's related to Xuanwu's Pearl.

595
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,060
His Highness

596
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,820
seems to be involved.

597
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,340
Indeed.

598
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,640
Keep working on it.

599
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,940
If you find anything
that can be used against him,

600
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,620
it will be of great help to me.

601
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,620
We spent a whole day

602
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,860
staying near Yuncui Temple.

603
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,190
Nobody was suspicious.

604
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,130
A whole day?

605
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,410
What about

606
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,250
Hui Jie Fang?

607
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,270
Hui Jie Fang?

608
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,610
I...I'm not sure.

609
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,410
Send a person

610
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,140
to Yang's Pawnshop

611
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,400
and the neighborhood.

612
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,490
Yes.

613
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,500
Wait!

614
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,340
I'll go check myself.

615
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:46,900
Hurry!

616
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,210
Be quick!

617
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,600
Did you check them all?

618
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,210
Yes.

619
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,410
Take what you can take

620
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,300
and destroy the others.

621
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,060
Yes.

622
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,450
Hurry!

623
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,380
We can't let others

624
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,540
find this place again.

625
00:29:59,540 --> 00:29:59,900
Okay.

626
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,780
Hurry!

627
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,900
Sir, I've got some news.

628
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,980
Destroy all of these.

629
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,660
Burn them!

630
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,380
What's going on? Tell me everything.

631
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,490
Someone mentioned the manuscript

632
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,620
at Liubai Building.

633
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:44,940
My lord.

634
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,720
Such big smoke!

635
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,580
Is it done?

636
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:51,740
No.

637
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,140
I've tried twelve times.

638
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:54,930
In the end,

639
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,180
I only got ashes,

640
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,030
not elixirs.

641
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,080
What are they making exactly?

642
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,830
Where is Liu Ran?

643
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,300
She knew that you didn't sleep.

644
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,100
She is making breakfast for you.

645
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,130
My lord,

646
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,060
you didn't sleep yesterday.

647
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,660
Why not have some rest?

648
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,460
Sir,

649
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,130
[Dai Zhou, Retainer in the Eastern Palace]

650
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,020
I can give you more money.

651
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,580
Please let me stay for a few days.

652
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,060
They already knew this place.

653
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,930
I won't be able to help you

654
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,060
no matter how much money you pay.

655
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,010
Whom on earth

656
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,020
did you mess with?

657
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,600
There he is.

658
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:03,740
What...

659
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,670
What's going on?

660
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:06,820
There's a fight!

661
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,340
They're fighting!

662
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,260
Hold them!

663
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:08,740
Don't move!

664
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,060
Who are you?

665
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,720
Don't move!

666
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:11,930
What should we do?

667
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,450
Let me see.

668
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,770
Where do you rascals

669
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:15,780
come from?

670
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,560
How dare you to fight here!

671
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,980
Are you bored with your life?

672
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,620
Beat them!

673
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:23,980
Sir,

674
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:25,940
don't you recognize

675
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,050
this person?

676
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,090
Everyone,

677
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,340
he is a seventh-rank official

678
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,600
in the Eastern Palace.

679
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,700
He is a wanted man now.

680
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,220
Have you ever thought about

681
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,480
what will happen to you

682
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,620
if you hide him here?

683
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,110
What's going on?

684
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,430
The smoke is toxic!
Cover your mouth and nose!

685
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,780
Help me buy these.

686
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,580
One kilo each.

687
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,270
[Realgar, Bat Guano,
Sandalwood and Cinnabar, one kilo each]

688
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:12,890
My lord.

689
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,060
Bingzhu!

690
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,220
Bingzhu!

691
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,969
Help! Help him!

692
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:14,340
Do you want to die here?

693
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:34,739
Come!

694
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,139
Go!

695
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,260
Follow him!

696
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,340
Let's go inside and save others.

697
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:04,880
Move!

698
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,820
Stop him!

699
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,060
