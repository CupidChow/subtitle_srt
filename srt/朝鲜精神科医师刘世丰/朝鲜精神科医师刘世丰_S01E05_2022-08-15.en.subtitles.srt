1
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,410
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,881
Can you delay it by an hour
instead of just 30 minutes?

3
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,342
Hey, you are already pushing it.

4
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,344
Just give me the ten nyangs and go.

5
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,521
Delay it by an hour.

6
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,125
Move!

7
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:25,960
Move out of the way.

8
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,546
Wait, do not kill me…

9
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,465
Hold on, just wait a moment…

10
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,389
Stop right there!

11
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,991
Stop!

12
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,300
Young Master!

13
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,198
I am sorry.

14
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,994
Wait!

15
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,745
Just wait…

16
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:06,853
Get out of my way!

17
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,821
You did not do anything wrong,

18
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,198
Lady Hyo-yeon.

19
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,332
He is the one to blame.

20
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,167
He is right.

21
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,628
You can still choose
to do the right thing.

22
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,767
Silence.

23
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,645
I am the only one who can protect her.

24
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,135
I am sorry.

25
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,263
Please, forgive me…

26
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:46,828
What do we do…

27
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,040
Young Master…

28
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,259
Stop!

29
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,941
Here is the real perpetrator.

30
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,075
This man killed Gae-ban.

31
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,542
I was simply planning on

32
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,171
going on a trip with the love of my life.

33
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,424
What makes you say that I am a murderer?

34
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,052
Did you find the incriminating evidence

35
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,512
that you speak of?

36
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,434
Yes. We have the witness right here.

37
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,159
I saw it

38
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,704
with my own eyes.

39
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,587
He strangled Gae-ban,

40
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,592
and killed him.

41
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,762
-What? Strangled?
-How dreadful!

42
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,349
So he is the killer.

43
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:39,565
It all started when he ordered me
to stop playing the geomungo.

44
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,775
I am warning you.

45
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,069
Do not touch the geomungo from now on.

46
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,198
If other men hear you playing it,
they will swarm you like flies.

47
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,367
But if you will really do
whatever you want,

48
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,827
let us break our engagement.

49
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,413
But if you decide to do that,

50
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,792
you will need to return the money
I have paid for our marriage

51
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,585
as well as the debt I paid in your stead.

52
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,965
That is just how the world works.

53
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,175
But,

54
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,053
I secretly kept playing the geomungo.

55
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,557
It made me feel less suffocated.

56
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:17,395
Ban loved to hear me play.

57
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,189
He even made me a suldae.

58
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,108
SULDAE: A STICK USED
TO PLAY THE GEOMUNGO

59
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,789
No.

60
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,315
Let us go, my lady.

61
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:07,987
Lady Hyo-yeon.

62
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,326
Come on, we need to go.

63
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,287
-Do you really wish to die?
-Wait.

64
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,672
We will have to stop
by the government office first.

65
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,740
Run, Gae-ban.

66
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,272
You damned bastard!

67
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,690
You evil bastard!

68
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,400
You piece of garbage.

69
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,069
Release this man immediately,

70
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,072
and take Gil-soo to a cell.

71
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,198
Yes, sir.

72
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,338
Young Master.

73
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,215
-Man-bok.
-Young Master.

74
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,635
Can you get me out of these ropes?

75
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,845
Of course.

76
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,474
Did you worry about me?
Well, I am totally fine.

77
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,713
Her energy is circulating much better now.

78
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,089
That is right.

79
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,467
And it will keep getting better.

80
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,012
If it were not for me,

81
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,765
Ban would still be alive.

82
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,893
I should have saved him.

83
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,270
No, my lady.

84
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,481
Why would you say that?
You did nothing wrong.

85
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,576
You had those hand tremors

86
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,453
due to stress, and your heart was weak.

87
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,872
It is in the Donguibogam.

88
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,543
But you managed to speak against him
in that stressful situation

89
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,087
without even blinking an eye.

90
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,131
That means that you have overcome
the hand tremors.

91
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,217
However, if you start
feeling stressed again,

92
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,094
your energy circulation will slow down.

93
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,970
So, try your best to relax.

94
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,264
What I am saying is,

95
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,434
you should try to fart often
and make sure your intestines are moist.

96
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,020
So…

97
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,524
So…

98
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,819
What Mr. Yoo is trying to say

99
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,863
is that he is very impressed by

100
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,491
how you overcame
the hand tremors all by yourself.

101
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,493
-Right, Mr. Yoo?
-Exactly.

102
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,120
Thank you.

103
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,207
I could not have done this
without you two.

104
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,127
You were courageous enough
to help reveal the truth.

105
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,004
I am sure you will be able
to take care of yourself from now on.

106
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:57,758
Do you really think so?

107
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,760
Of course.

108
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,763
From now on, you can be the master
of your own life.

109
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,481
Our boar is back

110
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,820
From now on, do not ask me about anything.

111
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,030
Do you have any idea how much
he yelled at me?

112
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,244
Here, eat. And do not ever make us
worry like that again.

113
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,663
Ugh, you sure are useless
for such a big guy.

114
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,374
Eat up.

115
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,003
Does this mean that you guys…

116
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,507
-were that worried about me?
-No, not really.

117
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,429
You should not laugh right after crying.

118
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,556
Just eat.

119
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,060
Thanks for the food.

120
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,791
It is so good.

121
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:15,753
Hey, slow down.

122
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,589
These are my favorite herbs.

123
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,312
What are you talking about?

124
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,066
If the previous King was really poisoned,

125
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,276
His Majesty would have
done something about it.

126
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,948
His Majesty cannot do anything yet
because of the Left Councilor.

127
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:48,202
But I heard His Majesty
is looking into it in secret.

128
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,207
The servants should have tested
his food with silver spoons.

129
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,376
It makes no sense.

130
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,628
Apparently, it was a very rare poison.

131
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,965
I heard it myself
while delivering some goods.

132
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,633
Really?

133
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,059
I do not know anything, sir.

134
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,853
Why are you doing this to me?

135
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,650
Tell me where you heard
that baseless rumor of yours.

136
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,902
I have all of the witnesses as well.

137
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,196
Do you really want
to get executed for this?

138
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,074
I…

139
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,826
I just…

140
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,619
I once met with Minister Yoo

141
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,498
-because he came looking for me.
-Minister Yoo?

142
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,838
What did you plot with Minister Yoo?

143
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,131
No.

144
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,216
I did not plot anything.

145
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,596
Minister Yoo was simply looking for

146
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,640
the source of a strange herb
I had never seen before.

147
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,100
An herb?

148
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,644
Did you take that herb?

149
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,105
Of course not.

150
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,566
I have never seen this herb before, sir.

151
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,069
He only let me see it for a split second.

152
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,655
It was wrapped up in a piece of cloth.

153
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,749
So Minister Yoo got his hands
on the dan sedge?

154
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,751
How did he get it?

155
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:27,843
If someone wishes to uncover the truth
behind the previous King's death…

156
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,430
If that is the King, what will you do?

157
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,226
We need to kill Se-yeop, sir.

158
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,228
Even if Minister Yoo had found something,

159
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,314
we killed him before
he could tell the King.

160
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,733
If we kill his son,
we have nothing to worry about.

161
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,069
That is easy for you to say,

162
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,947
although you are always
messing everything up.

163
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,660
He should have been killed
a long time ago, sir.

164
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,707
It will be easy for you.
You can do anything in this country.

165
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,967
I will take care of the physician myself.

166
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:13,180
Your job is to find and kill
the court lady from the Royal Kitchen.

167
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:15,849
Yes, sir.

168
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,269
After we kill Yoo Se-yeop,

169
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,564
nobody else will know about the dan sedge.

170
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,318
If anybody finds out,

171
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,155
we will both be executed.

172
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,866
I understand, sir.

173
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,786
Since all copies of
the Haedong Book of Herbs were burnt,

174
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,664
and everybody
related to Jeon Gyu-hyeong was killed.

175
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,382
What is this?

176
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,221
Oh, my.

177
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,985
Haedong Book of Herbs?

178
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,950
I thought I had read
every medical text in Joseon.

179
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,203
Cirsium pendulum.

180
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,789
Sanyeon herb.

181
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,001
Geungeun herb.

182
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,507
Dan sedge?

183
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,053
HAEDONG BOOK OF HERBS

184
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,132
I wonder if these texts will be
too difficult for Eun-woo.

185
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,921
You look like you got lost
after getting slapped by a strong wind.

186
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,843
I guess getting locked in a cell
counts as "a strong wind."

187
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,469
Do not say that to Mr. Yoo.

188
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,472
You are too good
at figuring things out. It is scary.

189
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,682
Come to think of it,

190
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,059
I heard that you are great
at telling people's fortunes.

191
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,521
Can you tell me anything about my future?
Come on, take a look.

192
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,944
Something like "you will eat
a lot of great food at a feast."

193
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,156
How can you predict something like that?

194
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,240
Nam-hae.

195
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,534
Will it rain on March 3rd?

196
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:03,952
Yes, a lot.

197
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,705
Pick the flowers and mugworts in advance.

198
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,416
I should have asked you earlier.

199
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,918
-Thanks.
-Go on.

200
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,303
This is my scorched rice!

201
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,848
Are you seriously stealing
Jang-goon's scorched rice now?

202
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,475
Unbelievable.

203
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,935
No, it is not like that.

204
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:31,772
It was on the shelf, so I thought
it was up for grabs.

205
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,440
No! It is mine!

206
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,777
Hey, Jang-goon.

207
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,613
Good food is meant to be shared.

208
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,866
Hey.

209
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,577
I am sorry.

210
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,704
I am sorry.

211
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,164
Jang-goon.

212
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,541
I am sorry.

213
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,420
Here you go. It is all right.

214
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,342
Why did you do that to him?

215
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,552
My goodness.

216
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,513
What is up with him?

217
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,432
I was just messing around.

218
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,726
He does not share
his scorched rice with anybody

219
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,769
other than Mr. Gye.

220
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,649
Where did Dad go
this early in the morning?

221
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,701
Who is there?

222
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,631
Dad, we have food and firewood.

223
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,425
Who gave us all this?

224
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,552
Gosh.

225
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:48,348
That was close. I almost got caught.

226
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,103
What?

227
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,397
Mr. Gye.

228
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,233
Hello, Madam Jeodonggung.

229
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,444
What brings you here at this hour?

230
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,155
Please take a look at this child.

231
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,449
What happened?

232
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,784
He started seeing things
and speaking strangely

233
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,745
like he was possessed by a ghost.

234
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,121
What should I do?

235
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,832
Well, let us take him inside first.

236
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,793
Get ready to perform
acupuncture and moxibustion.

237
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,212
Here.

238
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,976
What is going on?

239
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,146
Hey, be careful.

240
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,203
How is he?

241
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,206
It is hard to feel his pulse.

242
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,000
Are you saying that you cannot save him?

243
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,044
No, madam.

244
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,797
A needle on the emergency points
will wake him up.

245
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,299
You said that he was seeing things?

246
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,259
Has this happened before?

247
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,637
I am not sure.

248
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,557
I am not always watching him.

249
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,520
If he was seeing things during
the day, it is not sleepwalking.

250
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,980
Apparently, it usually happens
in the early morning.

251
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,234
I do not understand what is going on.

252
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,903
Let us get ready for moxibustion.

253
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,827
I will perform moxibustion
on his lower abdomen.

254
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,309
His pulse is weak,

255
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,687
but not too weak that
he should be hallucinating.

256
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,480
How strange.

257
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:06,278
By the way, madam. I was not aware
that you had such a young son.

258
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,368
I heard they took in a concubine's son.

259
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,578
I guess that is him.

260
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,538
She is not his real mother?

261
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,583
Why does she care for him so much?

262
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:23,503
She has always been kind and noble.
She treats a concubine's son like her own.

263
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,883
There is nothing wrong
with being a concubine's son.

264
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:28,884
Hey!

265
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,178
Those who talk behind
other people's backs should die.

266
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,352
I feel like there is
nothing wrong with her head.

267
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,231
This child is…

268
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:44,983
According to medical texts,

269
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,402
the veins of the chest become lax
for women aged 49.

270
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:50,363
the menstruation stops,
and they become infertile.

271
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,617
Judging by how pale and gaunt
your face looks, madam,

272
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,286
there is no way that
you could have given birth to him

273
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,621
before menopause.

274
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,499
This child must be a concubine's child.

275
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,502
What the…

276
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,130
On top of that, you probably
took him in very recently

277
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,132
since you do not know much about him.

278
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,179
You idiot, you…

279
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,098
I am sorry, madam.

280
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,601
He does not have much exposure
to the real world.

281
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,686
He can be… a bit clueless.

282
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,814
He did not mean anything by it, madam.

283
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,275
She is not that old, all right?

284
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:28,944
No.

285
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,488
You are right.

286
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,867
He is the son of Lord Cho's concubine.

287
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,453
Should I have told Mr. Yoo
that he is a concubine's kid?

288
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,664
I mean, he can be clueless sometimes,

289
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,750
but he probably will not say that
to the madam's face, right?

290
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,086
No. He would definitely do
something like that.

291
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,590
Oh, no.

292
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,808
I shall perform moxibustion
on his back now.

293
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:00,934
Wait.

294
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:06,898
I can stay here and watch him, madam.
You should return home before breakfast.

295
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,068
You are right.

296
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,531
Please take good care of him.

297
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,825
Please send him back home
as soon as he wakes up.

298
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,287
Yes, madam. Do not worry.

299
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,038
Take good care of him.

300
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,707
I will see you out.

301
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,314
Who did this?

302
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,569
I cannot tell you, sir.
I will be punished.

303
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:56,323
There are bruises and cuts
on his abdomen, back, and even his arms.

304
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,409
Tell us the truth.

305
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,955
If you do not, we will not be
able to save him.

306
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:06,791
Who hit him?

307
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,127
Was it the madam?

308
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:14,007
I do not know.

309
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:21,931
Madam.

310
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,185
Hey, what are you doing? Stop him.

311
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,228
-No.
-I have a question for you, madam!

312
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,605
Do not do it.

313
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,232
Madam.

314
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,613
What?

315
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,823
I stopped him.

316
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:41,785
Young Master.

317
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,120
-Poong.
-Young Master?

318
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,998
-Goodness, Poong.
-Mr. Yoo.

319
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,166
-What is wrong?
-Poong.

320
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,210
-Poong.
-Young Master.

321
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,046
Here.

322
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,423
Try doing this.

323
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,555
You know, you really need
to learn some tact.

324
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:07,185
Why are you so careful
around her? Who is she?

325
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:10,688
Her mother is the princess.

326
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,024
She is the granddaughter of the king.

327
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,693
She is one of our most
important customers.

328
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,362
Be careful, all right?

329
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,657
Lord Cho was forced into the countryside,

330
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,993
but his family is related
to the Left Councilor, so he will be fine.

331
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,746
They are the most powerful family
in Sorak County.

332
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:32,585
So you do not think she abused the child
because her family is powerful?

333
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,170
You think the madam hit the kid?

334
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,506
Do not be ridiculous.

335
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,300
The madam would never do that.

336
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,761
She gives out rice
when there is a bad harvest,

337
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,805
and she cares so much about the poor.

338
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,599
The concubine that the child stayed with

339
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,560
before he came here did it to him.

340
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:52,230
He came to stay with the madam
because of all the beatings.

341
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:56,025
I am sure Madam Jeodonggung
will take good care of him now.

342
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:00,113
You are not just tactless.
You are overly suspicious too.

343
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:04,534
Yes. You really should not
insult Madam Jeodonggung.

344
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,412
They say the people
in Hanyang should not be trusted.

345
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,581
You see, people from Hanyang

346
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,250
are very suspicious by nature.

347
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,544
Just like him.

348
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:17,297
They tend to be a bit jaded and mean.

349
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,970
Do not trust pretty people.

350
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,098
They always have hidden thorns.

351
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,309
Who are you talking about?

352
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,770
I do not have any thorns.

353
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,441
He is awake.

354
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,318
Seok-chul is awake.

355
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,154
Are you feeling all right?

356
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,117
I am cold.

357
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,162
And I am thirsty.

358
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,666
I cannot hear anything.

359
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,502
Since when?

360
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,671
My head hurts.

361
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:01,966
It hurts.

362
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,602
Seok-chul, this water is
for washing your feet.

363
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:22,821
Oh, my.

364
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:29,536
He is rambling and thirsty.
He has a headache and is shivering.

365
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,205
These are the symptoms
of severe dehydration.

366
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,291
Why is he dehydrated?

367
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,709
I am not sure.

368
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,588
Maybe the injuries on his back
have something to do with this.

369
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,097
CHILDREN

370
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,071
Are you lending him your clothes?

371
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:08,992
How kind of you.

372
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,709
Seok-chul is sick.

373
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,335
Is Seok-chul sick?

374
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,504
Yes, he is sick.

375
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,047
Seok-chul is sick.

376
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,593
Seok-chul is sick. He is sick.

377
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,387
He is sick. He is not feeling well.

378
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,935
Looks like he is awake.

379
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,062
Help him bathe first,

380
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,106
then tell the old man
to take him back home.

381
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,526
I will take him home.

382
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,403
What? Why?

383
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,113
What are you going to do now?

384
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,199
I do not like the looks of his injuries,

385
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,910
and the dehydration is suspicious.

386
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,621
I need to check what exactly is going on.

387
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,665
Why are you so nosy
about other people's business?

388
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,584
It is not "other people's business."

389
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,170
This is my duty as an adult.

390
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:18,519
Master Seok-chul, it is time to go inside.

391
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:37,246
Do you know how busy I have been?
What took you so long?

392
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,126
I was weighed down by this.

393
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,008
Fair enough.

394
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,052
You are making good money.

395
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:56,099
For a noble family,
they all seem pretty troubled.

396
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,102
I was almost killed
by a premium ink stone.

397
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,691
Lord Cho can be a bit hot-blooded.

398
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,113
Darn it!

399
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:16,119
Do you know how much money
I have spent on your schooling?

400
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,787
What is this?

401
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:23,001
Seok-chul could write better than you two,
and he just learned how to write!

402
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,920
You useless brats.

403
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,716
How despicable. Get out of my sight!

404
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,856
And it seemed like
Seok-chul's half-brothers

405
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,899
would rather see him dead.

406
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:50,236
-What a moron.
-You piece of garbage.

407
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:01,622
Please thank Mr. Gye
for what he did this morning.

408
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,751
And thank you for treating Seok-chul.

409
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,714
I have some medication for him,

410
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:12,550
but I have not figured out
why he is hallucinating.

411
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,553
I will observe him carefully
when I visit him, though,

412
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:16,679
so do not worry, madam.

413
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,014
Thank you.

414
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,851
Seok-chul.

415
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,355
The concubine was in the house

416
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,316
right in front of the madam.

417
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,318
It felt a bit…

418
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,215
I could not keep on living

419
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,551
if something bad happens to you.

420
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,182
Thank you, sir.

421
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,267
Thank you so much.

422
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,525
Thank goodness.

423
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,861
Thank the heavens.

424
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,741
There are plenty of other people
with worse family problems.

425
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:19,742
Do not act so naive.

426
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,619
Do you think you will be any different?

427
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:23,830
Of course I will.

428
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,665
If I ever get married,

429
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:28,793
I will love my wife
for the rest of my life.

430
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:32,839
Yes, good luck with that.

431
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,509
Anyway, what Seok-chul has
is not just a simple illness.

432
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,887
Somebody is secretly abusing him.
I am sure of it.

433
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,225
Seok-chul is ill. He is hurting a lot.

434
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,102
-We must help Seok-chul.
-We must help.

435
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,062
That is why you are visiting him.

436
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,982
Just do what you can do right now,
all right?

437
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,401
Seok-chul is in pain.

438
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,945
-No. I do not want to hear it.
-Seok-chul is ill.

439
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,072
Seok-chul is in pain.

440
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,288
Do you think so too, Eun-woo?

441
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,041
Yeah.

442
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,837
I also want to love just one person
for the rest of my life.

443
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,845
I was talking about Seok-chul.

444
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,431
Right.

445
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:27,476
His bruises and cuts all happened
at different points in time.

446
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,936
He has been abused for a while.

447
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,314
We need to do something.

448
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,232
We have to.

449
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,864
They look good. Your husband got them?

450
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,575
I cannot sell these
for less than two nyangs today.

451
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:45,203
Getting these was a nightmare.

452
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,789
Madam Jeodonggung
must have paid you pretty well.

453
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,833
-Give us a discount.
-What are you talking about?

454
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,835
She hasn't been paying us a lot recently.

455
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,463
Just ask any of the merchants here.

456
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:58,299
It is weird. She has gotten stingy.

457
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:03,638
-We are eating fish for dinner.
-Granny, put them down!

458
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,181
-Stop!
-Let us eat fish.

459
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,475
You cannot touch
things that you will not buy.

460
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,477
I will buy the ones that she grabbed,

461
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,145
and these as well.

462
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,108
By the way, how long has
she been like that?

463
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,568
Who?

464
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,028
Madam Jeodonggung.

465
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:22,240
She used to be so generous,

466
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,492
so why is she being so stingy now?

467
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,870
It started around this time,
two years ago.

468
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,538
Two years ago?

469
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,395
I did not tell anybody.

470
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,523
I did as I promised.

471
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,472
At this rate, you will stay up all night.

472
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,309
Young Master, can you not take a hint?

473
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,188
Let us stop here for today.

474
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:37,648
All right.

475
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,484
I can take these away.
We have all the time in the world.

476
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,696
Pilose bellflower and orange peels.

477
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,036
My goodness.

478
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,750
What? Are you not that kid
from earlier in the day?

479
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,126
Young Master.

480
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,170
You do not even have shoes.
What are you doing here?

481
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,928
Mom, I am cold.

482
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,306
I am thirsty.

483
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,266
What?

484
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,936
Let us take him inside.

485
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,272
I cannot hear.

486
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,027
I cannot hear anything.

487
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:32,787
Here.

488
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,638
Who did this to him?

489
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,182
How? Why?

490
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,684
Excuse me.

491
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,769
Sir.

492
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,905
I was looking everywhere for him.

493
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,242
I did not think
he would be at this infirmary.

494
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,537
Who is the person abusing Seok-chul?

495
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,211
As you know,
Lord Cho has always been very strict,

496
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,423
and Seok-chul is a concubine's son.

497
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,550
Madam Jeodonggung too…

498
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:33,848
We can hardly do anything in that house.

499
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:39,103
Do they starve him
or forbid him from drinking water?

500
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,735
I should have paid him more attention.

501
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,157
Is he very ill, sir?

502
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,783
If we do not go back right now,

503
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,369
we might both get kicked out.

504
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,624
You should try to stay calm,

505
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,626
since you are pregnant.

506
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,089
Why not go back and get some rest?

507
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,508
We will bring Seok-chul back
once he is recovered.

508
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,902
We cannot send him back home.

509
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,449
If we give up on him,

510
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,242
he might as well be dead.

511
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,996
But you will not give up on him.

512
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,749
Besides, I have a plan.

513
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,651
Mr. Gye…

514
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,249
I told you to not get involved
with that physician.

515
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,378
But I feel so bad for him.
He has these bruises everywhere.

516
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,338
-If you see him, I am sure you would…
-I would what?

517
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,841
I would feel pity for him
because I was just like him once?

518
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,678
That is not what I meant.

519
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,764
It was different for you.
You had people who saved you,

520
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:41,016
and Councilor Cho adopted you.

521
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,188
You are the one who saved me.

522
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,692
I learned martial arts
after you took me to Magistrate Seo.

523
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:51,443
You gave me my reason to live.

524
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:01,328
By the way, why have you been
distancing yourself from Father lately?

525
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,042
It is because of you.

526
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:08,711
What?

527
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,756
He made you suffer by marrying you off
to that horrible family.

528
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:18,053
Are you being serious?

529
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,767
I cannot lose her like this.

530
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,352
Please just give me some time.

531
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,939
Eun-woo has already gotten engaged
to the son of the Lee family.

532
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,736
How…

533
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,906
How could you do this to me?

534
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,118
Do you not know my feelings
toward Eun-woo?

535
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,417
Is it because I do not come
from an admirable family?

536
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,547
You are just like everybody else.

537
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,973
I was planning on visiting
Lord Cho anyway.

538
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,266
You can come with me.

539
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,477
Really?

540
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,604
Thank you, Shin-woo. Let us go.

541
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:09,938
Next time.

542
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,607
I need to go to Hanyang first.

543
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,983
I see.

544
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,779
You are going to visit
Councilor Cho, right?

545
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:20,115
I see. You are really
a wonderful son to him.

546
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,451
Let me know when you are back.

547
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:23,994
I will.

548
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,501
Did you find Se-yeop?

549
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:33,962
Yes, sir.

550
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,134
Kill him.

551
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,185
Will it be too difficult?

552
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:50,938
Not at all.

553
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,190
You told me to wait, that is all.

554
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:01,323
But if it is urgent,
I can make sure that he dies tonight.

555
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,208
You know, I really do like you.

556
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:17,089
It was so obvious that the others
were putting on an act

557
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:19,591
in order to become my adopted son,

558
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,095
but I could never read you.

559
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:29,852
You have the skills to keep your position
for a very long time.

560
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:34,314
However,

561
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,235
that also means
that you have the skills to betray me.

562
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:45,117
That is why I want you to kill him.

563
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:49,121
Prove that you are truly faithful to me.

564
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:05,053
You eat so well.

565
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,475
Did I eat all of your food?

566
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,561
Nope, I eat this every day.

567
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:14,146
Really?

568
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,318
I wish I could live here too.

569
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:25,032
Do you want some scorched rice?

570
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,456
Here you go.

571
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,792
I have never seen anybody
with an appetite like yours!

572
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,638
Try dipping it in here.

573
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,108
Why did you do that?

574
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,860
Sugar is incredibly rare!

575
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,071
Sorry.

576
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,073
I did not know.

577
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,470
-Is it not sweet?
-Yes, it is really good.

578
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,514
Here.

579
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,435
-It is good, right?
-It is.

580
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:49,908
You look so pretty.

581
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,495
Anybody can look pretty if they dress up.

582
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:57,499
No, she has always been pretty.

583
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,753
You should dress like that more often.

584
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,381
I cannot do that.

585
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,550
Why not? You are a widow, not a criminal.

586
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:13,140
Madam Jeodonggung usually
comes to my mother's tea party,

587
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,350
so I will go and hear what she has to say.

588
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,687
Young Master, you want me
to come with you?

589
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,190
You are still sitting down.

590
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:26,695
Wear this gold hairpin.

591
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:28,447
This one is prettier.

592
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,533
Granny, there is no way
that is made of gold.

593
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:32,659
Sit down and eat.

594
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,537
-Come here.
-Where did you even get that?

595
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:38,206
You are ugly,
so you can wear a wooden hairpin.

596
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,042
-What?
-My goodness.

597
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,628
My goodness.

598
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,921
I almost did not recognize you
in those clothes, Lady Eun-woo.

599
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,466
When you go to the tea party,

600
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,926
please make sure
to tell people about our infirmary.

601
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,222
You.

602
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:58,727
Take your young master back home.
Make sure to get paid, all right?

603
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,062
Sure.

604
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,899
Goodbye, Young Master.

605
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,693
See you later.

606
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,279
-I will see you all later.
-Bye.

607
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:11,698
Oh, my.

608
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,914
We need to save Seok-chul.

609
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,666
Seok-chul likes scorched rice.

610
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,255
Hey.

611
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,549
Are you going to give him
all your scorched rice

612
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,761
and work twice as hard when
you are digging up herbs and working?

613
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,974
I can just share the scorched rice.

614
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,768
That is what I thought.

615
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:43,313
Stop being ridiculous and eat.

616
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:51,822
Jang-goon.

617
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,032
Unbelievable.

618
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,251
Young Master.

619
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,545
How is he?

620
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:09,339
He has gotten better,
but he has still got a long way to go.

621
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,508
Please lead us to his room.

622
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,968
This way, please.

623
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,904
Who hit you, Seok-chul?

624
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,992
It is all right. You can tell me.

625
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:41,413
Mr. Yoo.

626
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,627
It is time for Seok-chul to go to school.

627
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:52,632
What? He cannot go to school.
Look at the state he is in.

628
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,051
-I am sure he can miss one…
-I am sorry.

629
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:58,180
If he misses school, Lord Cho
will be furious with the two of us.

630
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:27,292
Try it. The tea smells exquisite.

631
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,835
Thank you.

632
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,547
My daughter wanted to come
to this tea party so badly.

633
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,965
She could have come with you.

634
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,550
How old is she?

635
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,427
Five years old.

636
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,138
Five years old, huh?

637
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,727
You are nothing compared to us.

638
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,772
I do not want to see your
dirty face around here.

639
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:50,982
What are you doing?

640
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:56,947
Let us go.

641
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,032
I hate him.

642
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,083
We should go back.

643
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,585
You cannot go to school like this.

644
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,424
Are you really going to go?

645
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,930
There is nowhere else for me to go.

646
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,918
I thought you were picking out
romance novels or something.

647
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,836
Mr. Yoo.

648
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,047
You can put down that medical textbook.

649
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,716
I have compiled a collection
for you to read.

650
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:25,303
You know, you can be
quite impatient sometimes.

651
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,265
I am always learning things from you.

652
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:33,061
So I wanted to start helping you
sooner than later.

653
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:38,817
I appreciate that, but I have read
every single medical text in this country.

654
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,114
You know,

655
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:48,118
you can bluff a lot sometimes.

656
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,293
I am not bluffing.

657
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,337
I am not bluffing.

658
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,673
I am not.

659
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:04,843
Did you learn anything at the tea party?

660
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:08,847
Yes, I did. The madam asked me
to visit her and check her pulse tomorrow.

661
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:14,185
She seemed like
she was stressed about something.

662
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,187
Did you find anything?

663
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,272
Well…

664
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,359
Do older brothers usually
beat up their younger brothers?

665
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,820
Are you talking about Seok-chul?

666
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:31,369
They are probably unhappy
about suddenly having a half-brother.

667
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,123
It might take some time for them
to become a true family.

668
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:37,917
Are they his family or his abusers?

669
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,128
I do not know.

670
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:44,215
I told him not to go to school
after he was beaten up by his brothers,

671
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,469
but he said that he has
nowhere else to go.

672
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,679
I just felt so…

673
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:53,224
You can try talking
with the madam tomorrow.

674
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:55,769
All right.

675
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,270
Do you think I can do it?

676
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:58,521
Of course.

677
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,941
When I was young, my mother told me that

678
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,944
the things you worry about
will usually turn out just fine.

679
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,822
But the things that you do not think about

680
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,282
will come back to bite you.

681
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:14,162
I was smart, but I was a bit timid.

682
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:17,415
Your mother sounded like a wise woman.

683
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,709
I am sure she was a wonderful person.

684
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,176
You are not crying, are you?

685
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,180
What do you prescribe for a runny nose?

686
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:34,849
Crow-dipper tonic.

687
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:38,853
I think you might be a genius, Eun-woo.

688
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:42,732
Crow-dipper tonic.

689
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:54,244
Se-yeop is His Majesty's childhood friend.

690
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,914
His Majesty is planning
on calling him back to Hanyang.

691
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:00,708
So we must not be rash.

692
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,254
We need to kill him
without anybody finding out.

693
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,686
DONGUIBOGAM

694
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:24,816
Would the Donguibogam
be too hard for her?

695
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:55,430
DONGUIBOGAM 1

696
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:02,479
DONGUIBOGAM 2, 3

697
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:05,773
DONGUIBOGAM 4

698
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:28,796
Eun-woo.

699
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,133
Eun-woo.

700
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,391
Have you been reading again?

701
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:42,727
I knew it.

702
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:47,440
Here.

703
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:50,985
Thank you.

704
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,197
If you plan to read all night,

705
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:55,990
I shall take them back.

706
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:57,867
I will not, I promise.

707
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:03,373
Why not try performing acupuncture
on the madam tomorrow?

708
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:05,124
I will be there to guide you.

709
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,169
Already?

710
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:10,630
Yes.

711
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:17,679
Here.

712
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:25,478
It is a gift to celebrate
your first time placing a needle.

713
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:32,110
I cannot take this. It belongs to you.

714
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:34,779
You need to use it
when you can perform acupuncture again.

715
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,953
Then would it be fine

716
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:44,205
if you could place my needles for me

717
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,083
until that moment comes?

718
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,599
Then I shall hold onto this…

719
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:06,978
until that moment comes.

720
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:10,732
Yes.

721
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,361
When that moment comes, you can return it.

722
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,163
Sure. I will do that.

723
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,658
Is there an herb that could
change the color of metal?

724
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,451
You must get rid of him this time.

725
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:07,205
Were you nervous
when you had your first patient as well?

726
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:09,457
I am sure that one day
you will make me think,

727
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,542
"Your hands are even better than my own."

728
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,795
-How dare you turn in something like this?
-Be quiet.

729
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:16,464
Lord Cho had a mark
on his right index finger

730
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:17,632
from using a whip frequently.

731
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:19,801
Mr. Gye! Are you in there?

732
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:21,594
If a curse was involved,

733
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,304
we need to take it
to the government office.

734
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,390
Come up with an infallible plan.

735
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,100
He is gone, Mr. Yoo.

736
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,769
We can still save him.

737
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,312
I cannot do that.

738
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,647
You must.

739
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:38,403
