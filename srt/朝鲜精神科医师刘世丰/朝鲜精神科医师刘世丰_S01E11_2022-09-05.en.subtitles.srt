1
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,368
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,507
Wol…

3
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,093
Wol…

4
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,162
No, Mr. Yoo.

5
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,497
He killed her.

6
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,165
But Mr. Yoo…

7
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:15,301
But if you get killed
by those men right now,

8
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,555
then nobody will be able
to avenge her death.

9
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,473
But…

10
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,268
You cannot.

11
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,982
Where have you been?

12
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,156
Somebody dared…

13
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,617
to try to assassinate
a member of the Cho family.

14
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,663
That is why I was late.

15
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,834
Please have mercy, sir!

16
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,087
You know that I did it
out of my loyalty to you.

17
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,567
You must pull yourself together.

18
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,527
Mr. Yoo.

19
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,155
Come on, we need to get out of here.

20
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,304
Darn it.

21
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,514
He is the one who told me to kill him.

22
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,683
What are they playing at?

23
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,690
Why did you not kill him?

24
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,446
Why have you not killed Se-yeop yet?

25
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,782
Please give me another chance, Father.

26
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,493
Please.

27
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,540
Prove to me

28
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,379
that you are not a weakling.

29
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,172
I will.

30
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,801
I will get rid of Yoo Se-yeop,

31
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,639
and bring back the needle.

32
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,280
I have a job for the two of you.

33
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,338
How are you feeling?

34
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:01,342
That knife went in pretty deep.

35
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,314
Councilor Cho will be suspicious

36
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,608
if you kill me right now.

37
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:22,405
It will look like you did it
because you have something to hide.

38
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,411
You have

39
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,123
something that belongs to me.

40
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,130
I am not sure what you are talking about.

41
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,062
You are being a bit too obvious here.

42
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,691
I am guessing that is pretty important.

43
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,450
We will have to hurry if we want to finish
what Councilor Cho told us to do.

44
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,953
It is almost the harvest, after all.

45
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,164
I need your help

46
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,708
to make sure that it circulates well.

47
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,948
You are bleeding.

48
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,369
We cannot keep going like this.

49
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,869
Mr. Yoo.

50
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,497
I can never

51
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,085
protect the people who I love.

52
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,634
You could not have stopped it
from happening.

53
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,179
I had no idea

54
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,932
that Shin-woo
would do something like that, either.

55
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:57,935
I…

56
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,521
I was foolish.

57
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,781
Do not blame yourself.

58
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,784
Please do not.

59
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,581
You are the biggest victim
in this situation.

60
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:24,587
The criminals are the ones
who should be punished.

61
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,956
My goodness.

62
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,751
What if something happened
to my Young Master?

63
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,795
Do not cry.

64
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,172
Will you stop whining?

65
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,384
Come on, eat this.
It will make you feel better.

66
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,427
I do not want to eat it.

67
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,889
Eat.

68
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,642
Yes. Do not worry too much.

69
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,143
Those two are smart.

70
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,437
Since Wol can talk now,

71
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,190
she just needs to come back home safe.

72
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:30,236
Maybe we could ask
His Majesty for some help.

73
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,947
-Yes.
-I mean, something else might happen.

74
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,825
Dad, go to Hanyang
and tell His Majesty what happened.

75
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:36,742
Yes.

76
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,494
Am I a government official?

77
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,372
I have no power there.
How am I supposed to meet him?

78
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,916
Should I go?

79
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,420
I can pretend that I am the queen.

80
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,880
I think you will just look like
an old woman.

81
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,550
I am not that old.

82
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,887
You were born on the year
of the black horse, on the fourteenth day.

83
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,515
You are more than 40 years older
than His Majesty.

84
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,558
Do not say that!

85
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,228
I am 19 years old at heart.

86
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,355
This is killing me.

87
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,526
-Young Master.
-Lady Eun-woo.

88
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:11,944
Oh, dear!

89
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,404
Lady Eun-woo.

90
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,656
Oh, gosh.

91
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,619
Where is Wol?

92
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,048
Wol…

93
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,761
Is dead.

94
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,515
What?

95
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,145
What? What are you talking about?

96
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,064
Why would she die?

97
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,274
What?

98
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,406
-Lady Eun-woo.
-Oh, Wol.

99
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,827
-Wol.
-Our precious Wol. My baby.

100
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,331
-Wol.
-She was just a child.

101
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,542
This is breaking my heart.

102
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,712
Wol, my baby.

103
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,467
-My precious baby Wol.
-Wol.

104
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,222
My precious baby Wol.

105
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:25,017
-It is all right.
-My baby.

106
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,853
Wol, no.

107
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,494
Well, what are you going to do now?

108
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,581
I need a horse.

109
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,333
I am going to Hanyang.

110
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,503
You are going to Hanyang right now?

111
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,047
You must be suffering too.

112
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,301
I need to tell His Majesty what happened.

113
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:03,764
Since Councilor Cho was involved,
he should be punished.

114
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,850
But you do not even have Wol,
your witness.

115
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,893
What can you do in Hanyang?

116
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,152
You will come with me.

117
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,074
No, you cannot.

118
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,536
You are in exile. You will be turned away
at the gates if you go alone.

119
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:31,000
Do not worry about that.
His Majesty gave me an entrance pass.

120
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,627
Councilor Cho is still looking for you.

121
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,379
You should not use that.

122
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,507
I know what to do. Just take me with you.

123
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,184
Listen to her.

124
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,855
Is there anything that I can do in Sorak?

125
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:59,445
I need you to find out
what Mr. Im is doing.

126
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,572
Im Soon-man?

127
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:05,117
Yes. He is plotting something
with Councilor Cho,

128
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,869
so please find out what he is up to.

129
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,414
All right.

130
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,189
How could you leave me behind?

131
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,774
I will find you.

132
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,567
I will drag you back to this hell.

133
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,986
-Do not leave me.
-You sold your own child.

134
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,030
-Do not go.
-You sold us for that drug!

135
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,865
Was that drug more important than us?

136
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,575
Just die!

137
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,937
-What in the world?
-Dad, come out here.

138
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,896
Stop right there.

139
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,485
I…

140
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,864
I am so sorry.

141
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,329
No! I did not do it!

142
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:36,667
He is the one who did that at the fields!

143
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,502
That is why we are missing them.

144
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,881
-It is all right, Jang-goon.
-Sir, please do not kill me!

145
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,341
Please do not beat me, sir!

146
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,806
Darn it, I need a break.

147
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,725
I think he has jeongwangjeung.

148
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,477
Is illness why he is
talking nonsense like that?

149
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,314
He has an illness
that is affecting his brain.

150
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,232
Some might say that he is possessed.

151
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,819
Your idiot master would be great
at treating somebody like him.

152
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,155
What a shame that he is not here.

153
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,368
Are you two married?

154
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,705
Yes. We have been married for two years.

155
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:18,125
We are planning on opening
a business in Hanyang.

156
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,003
You can go in.

157
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,171
Eun-woo.

158
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,840
I think we will need my entrance pass…

159
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,184
Please hold this for a moment.

160
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,359
Name, Yoo Se…

161
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,403
Poong.

162
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,409
Where are you from?

163
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,749
We are from Cheongju, Sorak…

164
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,463
Sorak County.

165
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,677
You can go in.

166
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,639
Hold on.

167
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,606
You two.

168
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,110
What brings you to Hanyang?

169
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,782
Well…

170
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:35,577
We are looking for a house to live in.

171
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,920
We have been married for a year,

172
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,715
and my husband is going
to take the liberal arts exam.

173
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,177
You may go.

174
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,368
-Eun-woo.
-Yes?

175
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,121
Thank you for coming with me.

176
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,170
But please promise me
that you will not do anything dangerous.

177
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,422
Of course.

178
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,508
I will just lend you my wits
like I promised.

179
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,562
There are bugs…

180
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,314
Eating my skin and bones.

181
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,941
Please help me.

182
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,402
Stop whining. You will live.

183
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,239
I do not understand.
His energy has been disturbed a bit,

184
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,075
but he should not be in so much pain.

185
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,374
-What are you doing?
-I just touched his arm, that is all.

186
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,709
Jeez.

187
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,337
Jang-goon, can you brew some anshin?

188
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,507
We do not have any sanjoin
and seokchangpo.

189
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,217
Darn it.

190
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,969
Get ready to go down to the market.

191
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,847
I am not going anywhere.
It is almost time to eat.

192
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,850
Would you rather be kicked out
and starve to death?

193
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,978
I will go. I am ready.

194
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,147
Come on.

195
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,861
What do you mean, you do not
have any sanjoin and seokchangpo?

196
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,365
A lot of physicians have been
looking for them recently, actually.

197
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,659
Are there many people with jeongwangbyung?

198
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,578
I guess so.
Maybe it is a side effect of the plague.

199
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,665
Get out of here.

200
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,587
I swear I will bring you money.
I will sell my wife if I have to.

201
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,298
So please give me just one dose of opium.

202
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,301
It just hurts so much.

203
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:00,806
The wind feels like needles on my skin.

204
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:01,974
If it is so painful,

205
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,060
then go and sell your wife first.

206
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,979
Darn it.

207
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,077
Confucian classics are that way.
Other books are this way.

208
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:23,912
Two nyangs each.

209
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,874
I have not seen you before.

210
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,126
When did you open up this bookstore?

211
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:35,799
Why? Do I need your permission
to sell books around here?

212
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,012
I am not looking for books.

213
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,472
Give me some opium.

214
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,523
I am going to need money first.

215
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,619
Are you kidding me?

216
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,456
You could not buy a single dose
with this money.

217
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,166
Just go.

218
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,002
How can it be that expensive?

219
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,253
Our…

220
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:18,133
Our item is special.

221
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,970
Let me see it first.

222
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,514
I will tell him to fetch me more money.

223
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,615
Just look.
Do you not see how the color is different?

224
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,167
Did you dissolve this in water once?

225
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,963
Of course. That makes it taste better.
Do you have a pipe on you?

226
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,967
How dare you sell something like this?

227
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,719
Who made this? Who was it?

228
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,639
Dong-pal.

229
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,225
Yes, sir.

230
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,062
-Get rid of them.
-Yes, sir.

231
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,608
You little…

232
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,197
If you want to get to Mr. Gye,

233
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,949
you have to go through me first.

234
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,203
Are you asking for a broken bone or what?

235
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,292
I am feeling a bit
under the weather today.

236
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,377
So if you mess with me,

237
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,548
then you will get a few broken bones, too.

238
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,885
You are no match against me.

239
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,848
That must have hurt.

240
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,644
My goodness.

241
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,772
That hurt!

242
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,902
Let me ask you nicely just one last time.

243
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,906
Who made this? Answer me!

244
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,342
Follow me.

245
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,791
Your Majesty.

246
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,337
Se-yeop.

247
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,470
Who is this?

248
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,973
She is a physician at Gyesu Infirmary.
She is here to help me, Your Majesty.

249
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,768
All right, then.

250
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,356
How is Wol? Has she gotten any better?

251
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,862
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

252
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,366
I could not…

253
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,370
Protect her.

254
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,086
Please punish me,

255
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,339
for I failed to follow your orders.

256
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,606
We brought the corpse
from the ice storage.

257
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:10,198
She tried to tell me the truth
at the cost of her own life.

258
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,450
I can no longer trust the Royal Infirmary,

259
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,661
so you will have to carry out the autopsy.

260
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,209
Madam!

261
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,629
Can you hear me? What on earth happened?

262
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,047
Wake up.

263
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,634
There is a court lady

264
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,683
who was involved in your father's death.

265
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,562
That discoloration is caused
only by the dan sedge.

266
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,231
Does that mean…

267
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,442
her blood has traces of the dan sedge?

268
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,527
Yes.

269
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:15,323
The people who killed her
used the dan sedge on the King as well.

270
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,993
The other needle was discolored
in the exact same way.

271
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,036
The color of her boils

272
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,497
is just like the ones from the plague.

273
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,126
You are right. Actually…

274
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:29,462
Then, the illness
that went around the village…

275
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,048
The illness that I got…

276
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,509
No. It was not the plague.

277
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,018
Did you bring me an answer?

278
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,772
Well, what is this?

279
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,816
I trust that you know by now.

280
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:56,031
This needle is given to the best
physician in the Royal Infirmary.

281
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,909
Judging from the markings,
it is definitely from the royal palace.

282
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,412
Really?

283
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,914
And why is it so discolored?

284
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,675
I think it was caused
by a very rare and fatal poison.

285
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,553
A poison?

286
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:24,601
Have you heard anything
about how the previous King died?

287
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:32,067
Some people say that he was poisoned.

288
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,071
Poisoned?

289
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:50,794
An infirmary this pathetic
does not suit such a location.

290
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,253
If it had been up to me,

291
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,548
I would have built
a better and grander building.

292
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,675
Just give Gyesu Infirmary to me.

293
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,971
Maybe he came after our infirmary because

294
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:05,016
he wanted to grow poppies on the land.

295
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,937
He had to stop stealing the martens
after the Nine-Tailed Fox incident,

296
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,232
so he wanted to sell opium
by taking the infirmary.

297
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,025
But that did not work,

298
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,195
so he started to distribute it
to the bookstore.

299
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,156
I swear I will bring you money.
I will sell my wife if I have to.

300
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,535
So please give me just one dose of opium.

301
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:27,080
Soon-man is working for Councilor Cho.

302
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:31,209
So if I can prove that Soon-man sold opium
to benefit Councilor Cho,

303
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,254
it will help us bring Councilor Cho down.

304
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:49,436
I want you to triple
the amount of the harvest.

305
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,312
I want them all picked within ten days.

306
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,064
We might get caught, sir.

307
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,444
Do not worry. I know what I am doing.

308
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,572
I am going to live like a king

309
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,408
after I distribute these
all over the country.

310
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,830
Come on, hurry up.

311
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,963
Soon-man is selling smoking opium, sir.

312
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,424
Smoking opium?

313
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,926
He is a government official,

314
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,721
but he is making the people
fall sick and even killing them.

315
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,931
He must be arrested right away.

316
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:28,933
How do you know this?

317
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,980
I caught the owner of the bookstore
selling it in secret.

318
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,191
Then we must arrest
and interrogate him first.

319
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,526
Soon-man is a snake.

320
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,904
He will find a way to escape.

321
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,033
But I cannot go after him
without any solid proof.

322
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,882
Sir, I have bad news.

323
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,259
The government office
is planning on arresting you.

324
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,385
What?

325
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,221
How dare they?

326
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,097
What happened?

327
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,850
The physician from Gyesu Infirmary
knows about the bookstore.

328
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,061
Ji-han, that damned bastard!

329
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,065
How dare he spoil my plans again?

330
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,776
-Let us go.
-Yes, sir.

331
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,861
-Bring me the sedan chair!
-Sir?

332
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:26,074
-Darn it. Just get me a horse.
-Yes, sir.

333
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:37,961
DO NOT ENTER

334
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:41,464
Let us stay here for the night.

335
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,887
What is this place?

336
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:52,267
Well, it is my house.

337
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:58,231
But it is old and ghastly now
because it is the house of a criminal.

338
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,401
Not at all.

339
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,070
It is very grand.

340
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,450
Then shall we sneak in?

341
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:39,314
This house feels like you, Mr. Yoo.

342
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,820
It is probably because I have lived here
ever since I was born.

343
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,868
Young Master, where are you going
looking like that?

344
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,786
I was called to the palace.
I will be right back.

345
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,371
Stop.

346
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,665
I told you that I need to hurry.

347
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:08,051
I lost my mother here.

348
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,223
After that, I promised myself
that I would not lose anybody else.

349
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,309
That is why I became a physician.

350
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,604
But…

351
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,941
then I lost my father,

352
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,029
as well as many others.

353
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,368
Mr. Yoo.

354
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,495
Give me your hand.

355
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,427
Sinmun.

356
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,391
Sobu.

357
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,730
Do you feel a bit better?

358
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:08,528
Those are the acupuncture points
in the Heart Meridian.

359
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,238
You are better than me.

360
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:17,120
You use sinmun when you are feeling down,

361
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:22,625
and to treat various illnesses
of the mind, right?

362
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,837
Yes, very good.

363
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:36,347
The Heart Meridian.

364
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,726
Councilor Cho.

365
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,483
Councilor Cho.

366
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,153
You must help me, sir.

367
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,739
How dare you come here?

368
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,325
-Get him out of my sight.
-Councilor Cho.

369
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:02,040
Did you know that I have that needle?

370
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:08,004
A little birdie told me that the needle,
which was used on the King,

371
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,882
changed colors because of poison.

372
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:15,261
But you want to kill
the physician who used that needle,

373
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,597
as well as the court lady
from the Royal Kitchen.

374
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:25,313
Now, that looks like treason
to me, Councilor Cho.

375
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,130
Councilor Cho.

376
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,674
If you kill me right now,

377
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:58,930
that needle will be sent
straight to His Majesty.

378
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,182
Is that all right with you?

379
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,522
Is there a reason
why you are asking me that?

380
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:10,900
Why?

381
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:16,405
Is there a reason why
His Majesty should not get that needle?

382
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,284
Well…

383
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:32,839
It does not concern me.
Do whatever you want.

384
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,433
Please have mercy on me, sir.

385
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:49,981
I just want to stay in your good graces.

386
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:55,444
I would never use that needle
against you, sir.

387
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,748
All right, then.

388
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,376
What do you want?

389
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,755
The magistrate of Sorak
is trying to mess with

390
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,300
the opium farm, sir. Please stop him.

391
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:20,386
You just need to send
a little letter, sir.

392
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:26,309
I work for you now.

393
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,978
After the opium harvest is done,

394
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:32,231
I will bring you that needle as well.

395
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:26,494
Your late father was holding
a discolored needle in his hand.

396
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:34,001
I think the man who stabbed me
took it with him.

397
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:39,799
Your father was murdered.

398
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,031
Mr. Yoo.

399
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,908
Good morning.

400
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,080
Let us return to Sorak.

401
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,183
Open the doors.

402
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,020
You are under arrest, Im Soon-man.

403
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,104
It is fine.

404
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:37,565
If you do not open the doors,
we will kick them down.

405
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,150
Stop right there.

406
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,410
The King's Court has ordered
a fair investigation.

407
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,662
Withdraw your men.

408
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,966
What is going on?

409
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:08,512
I think you are at the wrong house.

410
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,598
What are you doing here?

411
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,142
What is going on here?

412
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,395
Move aside.

413
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,357
You little…

414
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,650
What? Why?

415
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,821
What are you doing?

416
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,366
-Arrest them!
-Yes, sir.

417
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,701
You have no right to do that.

418
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,078
Hey, let go of me!

419
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,330
-What the heck?
-Stay away.

420
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,123
Do not touch us.

421
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,291
-Hey.
-Stay away.

422
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,585
It is all right, Jang-goon. Do not worry.

423
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,420
Hey, Ji-han.

424
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,090
Let go.

425
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,634
Stop it.

426
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,555
I could kill them all right here.

427
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:55,393
Just cooperate, all right?

428
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,812
Dad.

429
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,654
It is all right.

430
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,187
Mr. Gye.

431
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,399
Jang-goon. Ip-boon.

432
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,985
Man-bok, where are you?

433
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:50,239
Poong.

434
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,994
Granny, what is going on?
Where did they go?

435
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:59,123
I do not know. They dragged them away.

436
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,417
They were not the barbarians, though.

437
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,044
The guy who looks like a rockfish.

438
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,923
You mean Mr. Im? He took them away?

439
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,845
There is the weird guy.

440
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,350
Please do not hit me.

441
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,228
Please, just do not kill me.

442
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,903
He is coming for me. Mr. Im…

443
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,405
Mr. Im is coming for me.

444
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:37,203
Sir, I did not steal it, I swear.

445
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:40,039
I swear I did not steal the opium.

446
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,249
Mr. Im?

447
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:43,751
Opium?

448
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,882
I think he knows something.

449
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:13,572
Did you work for Soon-man?

450
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,075
Not at all.

451
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,537
Please do not beat me, sir.

452
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,290
Can you tell me what happened?

453
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:34,760
Stop it.

454
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,096
I deserve to die.

455
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:38,973
I…

456
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:44,770
I sold my entire family away.

457
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,817
And it was just for some opium.

458
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:54,572
Stop hitting yourself. It hurts.

459
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,660
Where did you sell your family to?

460
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,620
You can tell us.

461
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,873
I do not know.

462
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,793
Please help me, sir.

463
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,379
Please help my child.

464
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,256
Our family has been taken there, too.

465
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,508
They are very dear to me.

466
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,220
Please tell me where they are.

467
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:21,056
You cannot hide forever.

468
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,517
We must know
in order to bring Mr. Im to justice.

469
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,145
Tell me. Where is it?

470
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,359
I do not know anything.

471
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,495
The ground is dark.

472
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,001
From the black ground,

473
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,463
I can hear hissing noises.

474
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:57,468
And when it gets dark,
I can hear those darn ghosts.

475
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,930
It scares me. It scares me so much.

476
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,516
I told you,

477
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,728
you should not have gone there.

478
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,481
It is a scary place.

479
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,653
Granny, do you know where it is?

480
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,529
Why is it scary?

481
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,948
Of course it is scary.

482
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:23,452
The barbarians will kill us all.

483
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,832
They all returned to their homeland
in the year of the red cow.

484
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:35,756
They will kill us all before they leave.

485
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,509
They will drag us away.

486
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:47,643
What is it? Did you figure it out?

487
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,649
Mr. Yoo.

488
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,238
Mr. Yoo.

489
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,960
Pour it in here.
I have the limestones already.

490
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,879
I am boiling ot, eunhaeng,
chooh, and cheonoh.

491
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,215
It stinks.

492
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,758
The worse it smells, the better.

493
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:23,804
The texts say that we should
use poisonous cheongeumja as well,

494
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,723
but we are running out of time.
Let us just use these for now.

495
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:27,724
Cheongeumja?

496
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,312
Well, I have this soksuja right here.

497
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,983
We shall put this in as well.

498
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,917
What are you playing at?

499
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,085
Beat him!

500
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,341
Stop being so lazy. Move it!

501
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,335
What are these?

502
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:42,841
Wait, this is the drug
you can get addicted to, right?

503
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,093
Dad would never use it.

504
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:48,931
There are so many of them.
What are they going to use them for?

505
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,475
Opium. It is so strong
that it could kill the patient.

506
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:52,976
-Jang-goon.
-Calm down.

507
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,436
Opium is very bad.

508
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,523
-Be quiet.
-It can kill the patient.

509
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,942
You cannot use it. It can kill…

510
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,068
-No!
-No!

511
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,698
Shut your mouth.

512
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:07,991
Ip-boon.

513
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,368
-Ip-boon.
-Ip-boon.

514
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,953
-Ip-boon.
-Ip-boon.

515
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:20,337
Well, I smell money in the air.

516
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,880
How lovely.

517
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,301
Hey, move it!

518
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,016
So this is it?

519
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,979
How dare you try to ruin my plans again?

520
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:38,730
Well, not this time.

521
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,358
This is too big for you.
Do you understand?

522
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,360
It is too much for you to handle.

523
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:44,444
Hey.

524
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,781
I do not need your concern.

525
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:50,867
I almost had to burn
this entire place down

526
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,036
right before the harvest because of you.

527
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,289
Because you were being so nosy.

528
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:59,251
Have you never considered
living an honest life?

529
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,005
You are a quack physician
who kills people,

530
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,965
and you want to talk about an honest life?

531
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,970
If you have money and power,
you can live an honest life.

532
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:13,140
You are making your entire family suffer
because you are poor.

533
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,017
Where is my family?

534
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,185
Do not worry.

535
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,688
I will make sure to put them
on a pretty sedan chair

536
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,815
and send them straight to hell.

537
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,443
You little…

538
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,863
You will have to try harder
to get out of those.

539
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,700
Goodbye.

540
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:34,453
You will be going to the afterlife.

541
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,387
It does not look like
anybody ever comes here.

542
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:55,057
I did not know that this place
existed on Sorak Mountain.

543
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:59,394
I grew up hearing about
the haunted black land.

544
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,980
So it actually exists?

545
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,440
Yes. Granny was right.

546
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,734
During the war,
the barbarians chased our people

547
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,820
deep into the mountains
and slaughtered them.

548
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:12,824
Now, there is not even a path
because people are too scared to go.

549
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,535
I have never been here, either.

550
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,439
A black land.

551
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,235
A black land that was watered

552
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,238
with the blood of innocents.

553
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,533
That is heartbreaking.

554
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,203
He is using this place

555
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:00,664
to ensnare people with opium.

556
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,709
He must be stopped. We need to find him.

557
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,877
Yes.

558
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,368
We need to get out of here.
Ip-boon will die.

559
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,328
-Jang-goon.
-We need to get out.

560
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,080
-Calm down.
-No.

561
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,166
Just look at me. Calm down.

562
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:45,584
Ip-boon.

563
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:48,336
You cannot go to sleep. Wake up.

564
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,546
We need to get out.

565
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:52,632
-I am not going to die.
-We need to get out.

566
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:56,261
We need to leave. Ip-boon is going to die.

567
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:58,346
We need to leave.

568
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,265
My goodness.

569
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:11,568
It looks like there are not
that many people here.

570
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,278
Yes. Thank goodness.

571
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:20,952
Where do you think they are?

572
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,624
Maybe they are in there.

573
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,312
What is this?

574
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,827
-Lady Eun-woo.
-My lady.

575
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,078
Ip-boon.

576
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,454
What on earth happened?

577
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,289
How did you find us?

578
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,793
Let us get out of here first.

579
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:11,920
Lady Eun-woo is here.

580
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,506
We need to get out.

581
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:17,175
-Ip-boon, wake up.
-Ip-boon.

582
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,260
Oh, no.

583
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,263
Come on, get up.

584
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:25,475
We need to get out. Ip-boon will die…

585
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,356
You can do it. Hold onto me.

586
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:35,777
Slowly. Take it easy.

587
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,039
-How did you find this place?
-We should talk outside.

588
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,332
Who are you?

589
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,335
Do not move.

590
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,257
You are the idiot physician.

591
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,843
So you managed to survive.

592
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:02,846
You know, Councilor Cho
is out for your blood.

593
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,932
But you walked right into his hands.

594
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,727
I told you, you should have joined us
a long time ago.

595
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:12,230
Let these people go
and burn all of the opium.

596
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:13,899
Hold on.

597
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:17,777
Are you looking for that needle, too?

598
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,615
Well, I have it.
I bet you did not know that.

599
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,410
Everybody is looking for that needle now.

600
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:28,455
I will give it to you
as a parting gift when you die.

601
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,253
What? Go and bring them back.

602
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,964
You better not lose them,
do you understand?

603
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,843
You two, kneel. Now!

604
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,095
Stop this now.

605
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,223
Shut it. You annoying prick.

606
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,684
I am going to kill you, I swear.

607
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,853
You will be the one dying instead.

608
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,855
Do you really trust Councilor Cho?

609
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:59,819
This is your last chance
before it is too late to return.

610
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,368
Do not make me laugh.

611
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,704
What are you doing? Cut them.

612
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,292
We have an order from His Majesty!

613
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,839
Burn it down.

614
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,229
Darn it.

615
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,606
Darn it.

616
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:43,113
That way.

617
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:58,712
Oh, no!

618
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:22,694
Do not come any closer.

619
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,288
If you take another step,
this needle will be thrown into the fire.

620
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:43,173
This is very precious to you,
right, Se-poong?

621
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:49,429
If you have this needle,
you can redeem yourself to everybody.

622
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,854
I will give you this if you let me go.

623
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,818
It has always been mine.

624
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,238
I will give this back to you.

625
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:08,907
So please,

626
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,243
have mercy on me, Se-poong.

627
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,082
Give it here.

628
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,293
All right.

629
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:48,279
How can you live with yourself?

630
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:05,964
How dare you? Do you not know who I am?

631
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:09,259
I am under Councilor Cho's protection.

632
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,636
Even if you arrest me,

633
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:14,681
I will be released the very next day.

634
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:18,101
You forced innocent people into labor

635
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,687
and crippled them
by making them into drug addicts.

636
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:23,398
They will provide testimony
to your evil deeds.

637
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:27,485
So let us see if Councilor Cho will
take your side this time.

638
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,073
Wait, hold on.

639
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:34,742
Fine.

640
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,875
I am sorry.

641
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,418
I did terrible things.

642
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:47,505
But I did everything
under Councilor Cho's orders.

643
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:51,384
I did not want to do it, I swear.

644
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:58,516
It is time for you
to reveal the entire truth.

645
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:01,686
Reveal the orders you received
from Councilor Cho,

646
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:05,607
and every single crime
that you committed to bribe him.

647
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,860
Of course I will.

648
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:11,488
I will tell you everything.

649
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:12,780
So,

650
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:17,160
please spare me this once.

651
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,371
Please, Se-poong.

652
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:23,625
I mean, Lord Yoo.

653
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,636
I will tell you everything
that he made me do,

654
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,137
and everything that I gave him.

655
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,598
I will tell you everything.

656
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,934
Just trust me.

657
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:47,148
I swear that I will tell you
everything that Councilor Cho did.

658
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:23,101
Councilor Cho must have used
the dan sedge to kill the King.

659
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:25,687
I found the ledger.

660
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,647
What does this line mean?

661
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:33,444
Did you really hope to lead a normal life
after poisoning the King?

662
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:37,490
We need to find out who was behind it.

663
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,158
I want that needle and Se-yeop

664
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,578
completely wiped from this world.

665
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:42,620
I will do that.

666
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,375
I am going to bring them to justice,

667
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:49,627
and make things right.

668
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:54,716
