1
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,410
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,520
Eun-woo.

3
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,234
Eun-woo.

4
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,952
Have you been reading again?

5
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,872
I knew it.

6
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,001
Here.

7
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,546
Thank you.

8
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:31,758
If you plan to read all night,

9
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,051
I shall take them back.

10
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,428
I will not, I promise.

11
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,975
Why not try performing acupuncture
on the madam tomorrow?

12
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,685
I will be there to guide you.

13
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,730
Already?

14
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,191
Yes.

15
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:03,873
It is a gift to celebrate
your first time placing a needle.

16
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,463
I cannot take this. It belongs to you.

17
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,174
You need to use it
when you can perform acupuncture again.

18
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,348
Then would it be fine

19
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,600
if you could place my needles for me

20
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,478
until that moment comes?

21
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,241
Then I shall hold onto this…

22
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,244
until that moment comes.

23
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,165
Yes.

24
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,752
When that moment comes, you can return it.

25
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,886
Sure. I will do that.

26
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,507
Se-yeop is His Majesty's childhood friend.

27
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,552
We must kill him
without anybody finding out.

28
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,721
You cannot leave a single trace behind.

29
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,568
I have found the residence
of the runaway court lady, sir.

30
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,874
-It is in Chungju?
-Yes, sir.

31
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,043
With your permission,
I will strike right away.

32
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,922
You must get rid of him this time.

33
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,342
If we just kill Se-yeop
and that court lady,

34
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,805
every piece of evidence tied
to the previous King will be destroyed.

35
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,015
Of course, sir.

36
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,271
This time, I will go there myself.

37
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,954
My back.

38
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:50,832
It is a ghost!

39
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,254
A ghost!

40
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:58,673
Go away!

41
00:04:58,756 --> 00:04:59,924
Where?

42
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,468
Where is the ghost?

43
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,637
Where is it?

44
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,475
It is me, Eun-woo.

45
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,688
You scared me.

46
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,608
What is that?

47
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,868
My lady…

48
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:30,246
It is such a shame to waste perfectly
good meat for acupuncture practice.

49
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,207
It will be much better
if you practice on me instead.

50
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,297
Have you really been practicing
since the early morning?

51
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,635
I was so excited after getting this
that I could hardly sleep.

52
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,974
Let us go ahead, then.

53
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,310
Since it is the back,
we shall try the pancreas.

54
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:59,400
I am supposed to place the needle
shallowly at a 45-degree angle.

55
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,735
Right?

56
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:01,986
Yes.

57
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,086
Everything is fine.

58
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,073
Considering it was your first time,
you did very well.

59
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,832
Really? I hardly felt that.

60
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,418
I think you are ready
for the medical exam.

61
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,046
-Do not move.
-That hurt.

62
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,548
Mr. Yoo.

63
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,551
You need to come out here.
There is a patient with a stomachache.

64
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,053
A patient already?

65
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,097
Stay here and practice more.

66
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,312
You know, my young master

67
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,190
used to bruise me all over
when he was practicing.

68
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,819
Come on. Try placing
your needles somewhere else.

69
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:27,822
Well, then…

70
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,992
Let us try hapgok this time.

71
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,622
Here.

72
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,585
You see,

73
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,713
after the madam passed away,
the young master suddenly gave up

74
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,507
on his honors liberal arts studies

75
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,051
and decided to become a physician.
It was a huge deal.

76
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,722
Young Master practiced on me
countless times back then,

77
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,516
so I know exactly where hapgok is.

78
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:00,229
So Mr. Yoo passed
the liberal arts exam with honors too?

79
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,857
Of course. He is good at
everything he does,

80
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,150
including acting stubborn.

81
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:08,863
Anyway.

82
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,616
That needle box

83
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,576
was given to the young master
by His Majesty

84
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,162
when he passed
the medical exam with honors.

85
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,289
You cannot find that anywhere else.

86
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,045
I did not realize that it was so precious.

87
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:27,715
In the palace, they called him
the Top Acupuncturist.

88
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,551
His Majesty gave him that nickname too.

89
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,845
He was great at brewing tonics,

90
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,056
but once he pulled out a needle,

91
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,642
he could bring a corpse back to life.

92
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,771
That is very impressive.

93
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,859
It is so impressive that it sounds unreal.

94
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,157
I am fine.

95
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,076
I am…

96
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,621
That is what is driving me crazy.

97
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,123
It would have been better

98
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,125
if he had gained his talent
out of nowhere,

99
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,254
but he lost his talent
out of nowhere. It is so frustrating.

100
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:22,019
It is all right. There is a first time
for everything.

101
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,857
Were you nervous
when you had your first patient as well?

102
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,026
Of course I was.

103
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,446
My first patient
was the crown prince himself.

104
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,409
-Really?
-Yes.

105
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:41,330
I think my hands shook even more
than they do now.

106
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,249
Look.

107
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,293
Like this.

108
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,007
Sorry. I should not be laughing.

109
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:56,053
I am sure that one day
you will make me think,

110
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,764
"Her hands are working miracles."

111
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,643
"They are even better than my own."

112
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,086
Madam.

113
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,130
May I feel your pulse?

114
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,550
Go ahead.

115
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,771
Your fingers have been
very stiff recently, right?

116
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,690
How did you…

117
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,152
You have been too worried to sleep
for the past few days.

118
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,493
And the blockage in your liver
has pulled your veins tight.

119
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,787
And your pulse is uneven
because of stress.

120
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,790
The concubine's son, Seok-chul,

121
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,793
or the concubine in the outbuilding
must be troubling you.

122
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,676
How can you know that
just by feeling my pulse?

123
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,015
Do you know where I saw
this kind of illness most often?

124
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,311
It was in the Queen's Court.

125
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,897
There are many concubines
among the Women of the Internal Court.

126
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,651
Your muscles are tight
because you are very stressed and worried.

127
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,529
However, this can be treated
right away with acupuncture.

128
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,866
This must have been bothering you.
Why did you never see a physician?

129
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,628
Lord Cho called in famous shamans

130
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,047
instead of physicians.

131
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,759
He only believes in those things.

132
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,178
Who did this to you, madam?

133
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,014
Was it Seok-chul or his mother?

134
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,142
Mr. Yoo, you should not…

135
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:09,145
Seok-chul has a kind heart.
That poor thing.

136
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,355
He is nothing like his mother.

137
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:18,612
However, I was not able
to take care of him for a long time.

138
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,449
That concubine must be a thorn
in your side, madam.

139
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,206
It has already been two years

140
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,877
since that concubine moved into my home.

141
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,714
I have been keeping my frustrations
to myself, though.

142
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,467
But you are right.

143
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,636
I cannot even control a gisaeng concubine.

144
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,723
It is truly shameful.

145
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,271
Well, you can place the needle now.

146
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,565
Yes, madam.

147
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,150
I will be performing the procedure.

148
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,857
Do you feel that?

149
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,613
It should feel as if
your finger is being pulled in.

150
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,915
Next, Jun-young.

151
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,006
I have told you several times

152
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,799
that I will become

153
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:48,095
a minister right away

154
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,347
when the Left Councilor calls for me.

155
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,933
I still have my connections.

156
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,019
As my oldest son,

157
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,522
how dare you turn in something like this?

158
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,450
I am sorry.

159
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,410
Forgive me, Father.

160
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,536
Please forgive me.

161
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,289
How could you be so inferior to Seok-chul,

162
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,460
a son of a concubine?

163
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,129
Get up.

164
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,633
Get up.

165
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,398
I see why you said
that she had trouble sleeping.

166
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,817
She fell asleep
right after her head hit the pillow.

167
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,694
Because of your well-placed needle,

168
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,571
you dissipated her energy blockage.

169
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,950
Who are you,
and what are you doing at my house?

170
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,592
We are physicians from Gyesu Infirmary.
We are here to tend to the madam.

171
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,594
I see.

172
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,389
I heard that a widow
stopped mourning her husband

173
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,015
to become a female physician.

174
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,268
I did not think I would run into you here.

175
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,395
My apologies, sir.

176
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,271
I heard that the madam was feeling ill.

177
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,691
She does not need a physician,
for she is not ill.

178
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,694
My wife does not have an illness.

179
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:30,155
Her destiny has simply diverged
from the will of the heavens.

180
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,700
You must administer the correct
treatment to treat--

181
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,827
Right. My apologies, sir.

182
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,996
We were there to listen to her troubles.

183
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,873
But her condition did not improve much,
so we are on our way back.

184
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:56,807
Eun-woo.

185
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,142
Lord Cho may be powerful, but--

186
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,144
-Be quiet.
-That does not mean…

187
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,195
We need to examine
the children of this household.

188
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,956
I hate you.

189
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,917
You arrogant prick.

190
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,087
Who do you think you are?

191
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,547
Get lost.

192
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,300
Hwi-young, Jun-young.

193
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,510
Let me take a look at you.

194
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,598
Oh, my. Are you all right?

195
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,184
My goodness.

196
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,737
Do not cry.

197
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,363
It is all right.

198
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,365
It is all right.

199
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,875
Lord Cho had a mark
on his right index finger

200
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,543
from using a whip very frequently.

201
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,961
He has been hitting him repeatedly.

202
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,631
Seok-chul's hallucinations
and delirious speech

203
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,716
were caused by dehydration,
not the beatings.

204
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,427
Dehydration?

205
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,345
Yes.

206
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,935
But it is not hot enough
for heat strokes yet.

207
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,270
So why did he get dehydrated?

208
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,855
When I felt his pulse,

209
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,400
I did not find anything wrong
with his body.

210
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,277
Then…

211
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,155
It is not a physical illness.

212
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,952
Seok-chul's life may be in danger.

213
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,705
Can we not do something about this?

214
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,918
He will only get better
if we can get him out of that house.

215
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,936
Where did Dad go?

216
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,479
I cannot find him anywhere.

217
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,940
Jang-goon, have you seen Dad?

218
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,735
Really?

219
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,114
Is that really all you want?

220
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,326
Yes. You would be doing me a solid.

221
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,080
The legendary physician

222
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,291
of the Royal Infirmary, Gye Ji-han,

223
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,252
came all the way to Hanyang
to ask me for a favor like that?

224
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,879
You must be getting old.

225
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,343
I know it is a lot to ask,
since we have not talked for a while.

226
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:43,307
You probably did not have
anybody else to go to

227
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,058
after the death of your good friend,
Hoo-myung.

228
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:50,189
What? Hoo-myung died?

229
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:51,940
You did not know?

230
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,860
After the previous King passed away,

231
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,114
everybody was talking

232
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,409
about how Hoo-myung had died
after falling from a horse.

233
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,745
You really did not know?

234
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,747
Since his son, Se-yeop, was the one

235
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,957
who performed acupuncture
on the previous King,

236
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,085
his entire family was razed to the ground.

237
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,421
Maybe that is why you did not hear
about it.

238
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,634
My goodness, you should really
pay more attention to things.

239
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,552
Here, drink.

240
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,629
Mr. Gye!

241
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,214
Are you in there?

242
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,758
Are you in there? Mr. Gye!

243
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,637
Mr. Gye.

244
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,597
Mr. Yoo.

245
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,349
What is going on?

246
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,728
I think…

247
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,314
I think master Seok-chul…

248
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,900
is dead.

249
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,571
What on earth?

250
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,532
Slow down. What happened?

251
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,575
Why did he die all of a sudden? When?

252
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,576
How? Why?

253
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,913
Just now. He looked like
he had gotten possessed by a ghost,

254
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,748
then he stopped breathing.

255
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,921
Go get your needle box.

256
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,549
-Jang-goon, go grab some herbs.
-All right.

257
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,925
Where is Mr. Gye?

258
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,553
I think he is still in Hanyang.

259
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,638
The lights are off in his room.
I will tell him when he returns.

260
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,516
Let us go. I need to
take a look at Seok-chul.

261
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,726
All right.

262
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,196
Seok-chul got possessed by a ghost

263
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,240
because the madam
buried these horrid things

264
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,035
near my room

265
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:11,580
and placed a curse on us.

266
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,752
Please let me keep this child, sir.

267
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,427
How could you do something so horrible?

268
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,597
Have you forgotten yourself?

269
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:32,851
You let your jealousy consume you,
and now you are cursing people?

270
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,186
I had nothing to do with this.

271
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,354
All right, then.

272
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,525
Lock her up until she gives a confession.

273
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,110
Yes, sir.

274
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,077
Maybe you believe her because you are dim,

275
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,871
or maybe you are just pretending
to believe her.

276
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,832
Either way, I am innocent.

277
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,168
You will regret

278
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,003
doing this to me.

279
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,922
Did you hear me?

280
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,717
-Mother.
-Mother.

281
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,011
Oh, no.

282
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,429
Are you all right?

283
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:25,946
This way.

284
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,917
Where is Mr. Gye when you need him?

285
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,752
He has been going out at night.

286
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:41,795
It is suspicious.

287
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,296
Where are you going this late?

288
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,881
Where have you…

289
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:49,136
We should just go.
This is urgent. Just follow us.

290
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,681
Seok-chul is dead
because you did not do anything!

291
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,725
It is all right. Mr. Yoo will save him.

292
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,645
What is going on here?

293
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,105
We should hurry.

294
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,649
Run. You will figure it out
once you get there.

295
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:03,692
Hey…

296
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:08,947
Seok-chul.

297
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,490
Seok-chul.

298
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,702
Come on, open your eyes.

299
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:14,870
Seok-chul.

300
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,130
I think we are too late.

301
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,396
No. Grab a needle.

302
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,900
Place a needle on baekhoe, injung, hapgok,
then geumjin and okaek.

303
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,943
He is gone, Mr. Yoo.

304
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,362
No, it is not too late.

305
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,156
It is weak, but I can feel his pulse.

306
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,367
We can still save him.

307
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,541
What do you want me to do?

308
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,752
Place a needle on baekhoe first.

309
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,849
Move your fingers forward a bit.

310
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,737
It is right here. Try it again.

311
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,904
Good job.

312
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,698
Now, let us find geumjin and okaek.

313
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,742
Are they not inside his mouth?

314
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,161
And must I draw blood?

315
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,496
I cannot do that.

316
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,081
You must.

317
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,200
One,

318
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,119
two,

319
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,329
three.

320
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:15,091
Mom…

321
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,010
Seok-chul.

322
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:22,515
You did it, Seok-chul. Good job.

323
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,101
Water…

324
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,401
Move it. Hurry up.

325
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,989
Where are they?

326
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:45,955
Here you go.

327
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,917
I will not say anything.

328
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,170
I will not tell anybody.

329
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:59,302
Please do not kill me.

330
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,307
Jang-goon.

331
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,061
Here. Drink.

332
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,527
My goodness.

333
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,655
Water.

334
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,660
Water.

335
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,373
You need to leave.

336
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,499
Get them out of here!

337
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,960
What are you doing?

338
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,004
My goodness.

339
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,048
Just listen to me.

340
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,675
Come on. Seriously.

341
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,343
Stop pushing me.

342
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,471
Go on. Leave.

343
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,098
Stop it.

344
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:50,729
Why are you making
such a ruckus in my house?

345
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,648
Lord Cho.

346
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,317
We revived the dead child.

347
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:06,077
My family is dealing
with some personal matters. Go back.

348
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,585
Did you not hear me?

349
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,462
-Get them out of here.
-Yes, sir.

350
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,130
-Hey.
-Wait.

351
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:30,852
Oh, my.

352
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,354
What do you think you are doing?

353
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,567
It looks like your talismans
are useless, sir.

354
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,735
You have no idea that the energy of water

355
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,488
is battling the energy of fire
in your family.

356
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:44,115
This is why so many misfortunes
have befallen the household.

357
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,873
Water and fire?

358
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,294
Where do you see that?

359
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:01,508
Seok-chul has been asking
for water recently, has he not?

360
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,134
That is the energy of water.

361
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:12,143
Then are you saying
that I have the energy of fire?

362
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,436
Yes, sir.

363
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,022
Would you not agree, Mr. Gye?

364
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,150
That is right.

365
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,445
Lord Cho, you are very righteous.

366
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,031
You never hesitate to point out
the faults of others,

367
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,450
and you are always very fair.

368
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:32,288
Whether it is your son or servant,
you scold them equally with your whip.

369
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,583
That is the energy of fire, sir.

370
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,925
How dare you?

371
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,262
Your pulse did not feel very healthy, sir.

372
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,223
At this rate,
you will end up getting a stroke.

373
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,141
What?

374
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,435
Your complexion is very red,
like a war general,

375
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,439
and you have a generous amount
of fat behind your neck.

376
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,149
You will definitely get a stroke.

377
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,822
A stroke?

378
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,909
What on earth am I supposed to do, then?

379
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:13,121
This old physician right here

380
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,789
will prescribe medication for you.

381
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,499
Meanwhile, I will treat Seok-chul

382
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,585
since he is full of the energy of water.

383
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,378
All right.

384
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,715
Fine. You can stay,

385
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,551
and you can take him away.

386
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:31,180
Please make sure
that Lord Cho gets better.

387
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:34,893
Of course.

388
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,527
It is because your body runs hot.

389
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,113
Yes, I do run very hot.

390
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,869
You were pretty convincing
back there, Mr. Yoo.

391
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:56,331
Right. I almost asked you
to feel my pulse too.

392
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,000
When you told him
that he would get a stroke,

393
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,252
-the look on his face was hilarious.
-Yes.

394
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,921
I was not making that up.

395
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,966
When I felt his pulse,
I felt a great amount of heat in his body.

396
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,303
The heat had traveled upward,
putting a lot of pressure on the heart.

397
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,430
That kind of pulse
must be treated right away.

398
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:13,932
Or one will suffer a stroke.

399
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,934
It is called palsy.

400
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,646
Can you really predict things like that
with pulses?

401
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,648
That is very cool.

402
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,983
It is nothing compared
to how you predict rainfall.

403
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:28,029
I could tell you
what you ate for dinner, though.

404
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,282
If you are not scared, give me your hand.

405
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,910
You can tell by feeling somebody's pulse?

406
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:36,162
Yes, he can.

407
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,832
Jang-goon, you ate scorched rice.

408
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,839
I actually ate yumilgwa.

409
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,967
YUMILGWA: A KOREAN OIL-AND-HONEY PASTRY

410
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,324
WE MUST PROTECT POOR SEOK-CHUL

411
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:20,081
SALT

412
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,291
SEOK-CHUL

413
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,584
Salt?

414
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:29,007
How could they force him to eat salt
to make it seem he was possessed?

415
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,300
That is frightening.

416
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,301
Yes.

417
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,554
In the past, I saw people
drinking seawater

418
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,597
when they ran out of water
on a sea voyage.

419
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:40,018
Then they would speak gibberish
and pass out as if they were possessed.

420
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,395
Yes. It could pass for insanity.

421
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,646
It is an evil thing to do.

422
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,983
We must find out who it was
and make them pay for it.

423
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,526
How could anybody do that

424
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,404
to a child?

425
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,700
So we will find the person
who fed him the salt.

426
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,868
Easier said than done.

427
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,661
Anybody in that household
could have done it.

428
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,499
If you really think about it,
they are all kind of suspicious.

429
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:08,713
Yes. Any one of them could have done it,
and they are all responsible.

430
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,549
There is no way
that the madam did it, though.

431
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:12,550
There is no way.

432
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:16,054
I agree. When she brought
Seok-chul to the infirmary,

433
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,014
she looked genuinely worried.

434
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,098
Mr. Gye.

435
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,768
Please take a look at this child.

436
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,020
Still, the madam did not do anything

437
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,646
to help Seok-chul.

438
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,274
Do not cry.

439
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:32,070
What if the madam tried to harm Seok-chul

440
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,614
because she felt threatened
by the concubine, Ra-hab?

441
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:36,949
It is a possibility.

442
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:42,830
She would not try to kill a kid.
You are going a bit too far there.

443
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,749
Who else thinks it was not the madam?

444
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,428
Mr. Yoo is right.

445
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,180
It could have been the madam.

446
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,390
People can do strange things.

447
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,103
Besides, the madam is probably in charge

448
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,604
of storing their precious salt.

449
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,318
I heard from the woman who sells fish

450
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:15,446
that the madam has become more stingy
over the past two years.

451
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,533
Come to think of it,

452
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,326
she stopped giving rice to the poor
since last year.

453
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,744
Yes.

454
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,287
You are the stingy one, Ip-boon.

455
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,751
You took the key to the storeroom
because we were handing out rice.

456
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,670
You bad girl!

457
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,589
We should just give out the rice
to the needy, not everybody!

458
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,341
-Let me go!
-Stop it.

459
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,301
My goodness.

460
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,848
Why are you still up
and wasting your time?

461
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,933
You should all be in bed.

462
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,102
And you.

463
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:49,105
Did I not tell you
to not get involved with that family?

464
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,607
If a curse was involved,

465
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,359
we need to take it
to the government office.

466
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,069
Just report it and forget about it.

467
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,071
I was planning on reporting it.

468
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,241
Did you not say that you would help me?

469
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,785
We rescued the kid.
What else am I supposed to do?

470
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,328
If you get involved
with the madam's business,

471
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,747
then you will have to deal
with the royal palace.

472
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,541
This will not do, you idiot.

473
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,877
From now on, you are forbidden

474
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,254
from going around
and visiting patients like a bum.

475
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,758
You are so mean! Seok-chul is sick!

476
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:22,180
Right. I did not realize
that you were actually such a big jerk.

477
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:27,018
Yes. How come you are so mean
both inside and out?

478
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,145
Mr. Gye, show some sympathy.

479
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,314
-Right.
-You big jerk.

480
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,357
Why are you being such a party pooper?

481
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,113
We cannot just charge in there recklessly.

482
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:44,911
Come up with an infallible plan.
If you cannot, we are not doing anything.

483
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,616
Your fingers have been
very stiff recently, right?

484
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,139
My goodness.

485
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:51,018
This is harder than it looks.

486
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,606
-Hey. Put it down.
-Yes, ma'am.

487
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,113
Do you know how hard it is to make this?

488
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,865
I will give you an ugly one later to eat.

489
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,909
Why would you give me an ugly one?

490
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,202
I want a pretty one.

491
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,579
The pretty ones are for the patients.

492
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,584
This is Jang-goon's poop.

493
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,504
No, it is not!

494
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,134
Is Seok-chul…

495
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,553
Is he fine now?

496
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,976
Of course he is.

497
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,814
If he goes back,
he will become sick again.

498
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,151
Can he just live with us?

499
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,195
See, I was really sick too,

500
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,783
but Mr. Gye let me live here.

501
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,286
Did he now?

502
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:51,871
Yes, he did.

503
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,457
It was during the Double Third Festival.

504
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,709
Hey.

505
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,753
He left the infirmary with a lot of money

506
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,921
to build a storage for the herbs
due to the warm weather.

507
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,965
But he came back with a boy on his back.

508
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,175
Is he a patient?

509
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,552
I thought that all he cared about
was money.

510
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,846
Nam-hae, get him some water.

511
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:13,851
Here.

512
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,627
Mr. Gye.

513
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:41,879
Where is the boy?

514
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,632
In his room. Please help him.

515
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,480
Who are you?

516
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,609
You cannot take him for free.

517
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,487
-Just go.
-How dare you?

518
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,535
He is not your son anymore.

519
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,497
He will be better off without a father
who cares more about money

520
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,040
than his son's health.

521
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,129
These patient records.

522
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,381
These stupid things are annoying me.

523
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,843
You are heartless, Mr. Gye.

524
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,679
What do you want from me?

525
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,640
If you care so much about Jang-goon,

526
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,517
why will you not let us help Seok-chul?

527
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,020
Charging in there
without a plan is not helping.

528
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,188
You are crazy.

529
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,613
Here. Take a gongjin pill.

530
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,118
I made it for you.

531
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,873
You are my favorite, Mr. Gye,

532
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,168
because you will save Seok-chul

533
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,753
just like you saved me.

534
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,298
I see what you are doing.

535
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,509
This is a bribe, is it not?

536
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,900
Eun-woo and I came up
with a plan overnight.

537
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,067
So just hear me out.

538
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,113
Fine, I will.

539
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,991
But if it ends up hurting my infirmary,

540
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:37,328
then I will make you stay here forever.

541
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:39,705
Go for it.

542
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,502
These look much fresher
than they did last time.

543
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,045
Keep it up, all right?

544
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:48,756
This is all thanks to Nam-hae.

545
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,050
She knows everything.

546
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,384
She can tell so much
from looking at a person's face,

547
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:56,055
and she knows exactly
how to pick out good locations for graves.

548
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,933
That woman at Gyesu Infirmary
who is really good at cooking?

549
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,477
Yes, Nam-hae.

550
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,854
There is no way a person can do that.

551
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,398
I am telling you, Nam-hae can.

552
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,193
Nam-hae can do anything!

553
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,736
We are going to

554
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:13,697
make him destroy himself
with what he likes best.

555
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,368
Tell me. Do you think

556
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,204
that the Left Councilor
will call for me soon?

557
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,081
Of course, sir.

558
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:25,876
If you wear your jade pins
on your lucky day,

559
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,211
you will…

560
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,715
You will become a government official.

561
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,218
I feel…

562
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,638
You feel?

563
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,724
I feel the energy of a minister
within you, but…

564
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,685
That is right.

565
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,940
But I also feel an obstacle
in your path, sir.

566
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,777
Can you tell me what that is?

567
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:00,953
Here you go.

568
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,248
That is where you come in, Mr. Gye.

569
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,625
The child is completely fine now.

570
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,168
I took him to his room.

571
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,631
You need to emphasize
the importance of "tonight".

572
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,466
Tonight will be very important.

573
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,303
If he makes it past tonight,
he will be completely healed.

574
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:21,223
So, tell Lord Cho
that I will not be coming back after that.

575
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,392
Sure thing, Mr. Gye. Thank you.

576
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,561
It is tonight, got it?

577
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,995
Tonight,

578
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:46,498
I am going to pray right here
with some sacred water.

579
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,959
So please make sure that nobody,

580
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,712
and I mean nobody,
is walking around the house.

581
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,312
-Mother.
-Mother.

582
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:11,940
What are you doing here?

583
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,818
You need to get out.
You need to go and do what you must do.

584
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,945
You are right. Let us go.

585
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:24,912
You need to be waiting at the place
that I told you about, Lord Cho.

586
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,652
Wake up, honey.

587
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,491
Eat some porridge.

588
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,661
Get up and eat some porridge.

589
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:36,668
Get up.

590
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:39,922
I said, get up.

591
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,977
You evil woman.

592
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:57,439
How could you do this to your own son?

593
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,524
How?

594
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,078
Why did you do it?

595
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,748
You used to be so beautiful and innocent.

596
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:16,917
So why?

597
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,509
I just wanted to live
like the proud woman I am.

598
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,386
What?

599
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,263
Did you not say that I could become

600
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,181
the madam of this house, Lord Cho?

601
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,570
I…

602
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,988
I never said that!

603
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,578
Why do you think she did it?

604
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:57,499
Why did that woman

605
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,879
feed salt to her son every single night?

606
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,974
She wanted to make him fall ill

607
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:16,643
to get people's attention and sympathy

608
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,938
by having to take care of him.

609
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:20,981
On top of that…

610
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,570
she framed the madam of this house,

611
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,196
and tried to steal her position.

612
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,784
This cruel woman was trying
to catch two birds with one stone.

613
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,752
How dare you?

614
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:14,701
You nosy bastard. You ruined my plan!

615
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,745
Go to hell!

616
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,376
Eun-woo.

617
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:27,714
Eun-woo.

618
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,428
Do not move just yet.

619
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,190
I think there is a slight dent.

620
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:47,901
What should I do?

621
00:49:58,745 --> 00:49:59,913
Thank the heavens.

622
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:02,332
Thank goodness.

623
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,394
I am fine.

624
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:25,188
What is all this fuss about?

625
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,608
I thought you did not care
whether he lived or died.

626
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,029
You always beat him up, remember?

627
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,782
You are no different from me!

628
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:36,700
Hey!

629
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,495
Drag this treacherous wench away!

630
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,496
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

631
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:44,624
Let go!

632
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,001
Let go of me!

633
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:47,836
I said, let go of me!

634
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,547
-That little…
-Do you know who I am?

635
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,508
Let me go right now!

636
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:54,718
Unbelievable.

637
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,678
Wait.

638
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:03,602
Sir, let me talk to you privately.

639
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,191
I will give you
the perfect solution to all this.

640
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,693
Right.

641
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:15,614
Right, I almost forgot about you!

642
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:18,533
You will be the one
to put on the finishing touches.

643
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,746
You must remove Seok-chul
from that family permanently.

644
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,833
There are more obstacles
in the way of your success.

645
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,669
-What are those obstacles?
-Men.

646
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,047
There are too many men here.

647
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,050
They are blocking the warm energy
from the north.

648
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:41,056
MEN

649
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,270
The energy of the sun.

650
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,272
What do you think this is?

651
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,526
It is "yang," for "sunlight" of course.

652
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,113
-This is…
-Hanyang.

653
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:03,662
You must send the boy here.

654
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:09,084
I feel something ominous in this house.

655
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,043
Something bloodthirsty.

656
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:12,128
Death is approaching.

657
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,214
Is somebody going to die?

658
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,928
You are stupidly suppressing

659
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,973
all of that energy from the sun.

660
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:25,350
You have filled this place
with evil energy.

661
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:29,938
You are blocking the way of your success
with your own hands.

662
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:34,109
I swear that I will never do it again.

663
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,116
I am so tired after laying out
all that nonsense to Lord Cho.

664
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:43,743
Thanks to you,

665
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,996
we were able
to get Seok-chul out of there.

666
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,626
We should thank Lady Eun-woo too.
She risked her own life.

667
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,548
Do not ever…

668
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,467
do that again.

669
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:10,145
But you saved my life three times.

670
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:12,272
I never put my own life
on the line to do it.

671
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,445
Ip-boon.

672
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:22,365
Mr. Gye. Should we give them some privacy?

673
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,742
-No.
-It is fine.

674
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,291
By the way, Mr. Yoo,

675
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,252
how did you know that the concubine
was the perpetrator?

676
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,464
Can you tell that
by feeling somebody's pulse too?

677
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,259
Actually, you told me about it.

678
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,179
I did?

679
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:48,391
The madam has become more stingy
over the past two years.

680
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,060
Come to think of it,

681
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,853
she stopped giving rice to the poor
since last year.

682
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,188
Yes.

683
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,522
It has already been two years

684
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:58,401
since that concubine moved into my home.

685
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:01,279
You took the key to the storeroom
because we were handing out rice.

686
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,615
You bad girl!

687
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:07,410
I thought that somebody had taken
the key to the storeroom

688
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,079
from the madam, and I was right.

689
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,207
She was hiding it all this time

690
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,668
because she was too embarrassed
to let anybody know.

691
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,381
I thought you found out with her pulse.

692
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,551
Actually, that is exactly
how you figured it out.

693
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:26,096
Your patients tell you
all about themselves

694
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,056
while you are feeling their pulse.

695
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,143
If I think about it,
you are good at that, Mr. Yoo.

696
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,104
Hey,

697
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,691
did I not tell you that you should use
that pretty face of yours

698
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,317
to treat your patients?

699
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,777
And I was right, right?

700
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:46,074
Anyway, what are we going to do
about Seok-chul?

701
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:48,994
Right.

702
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:56,334
One of my friends,
who is a physician in Hanyang,

703
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,294
will teach him medicine.

704
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:03,383
If you are going to be nosy,
at least try to make some money from it.

705
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,098
When I grow up,

706
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:14,686
I want to become a physician
and help sick people.

707
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,147
Do you think I can do that?

708
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,525
Of course you can.

709
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:33,913
That is good to hear.

710
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:38,084
I think Seok-chul will have
a lot of good luck in his future.

711
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,717
It is hot.

712
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,808
Hello, sir.

713
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:58,438
Is there anything new
that might be worth some good money?

714
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:02,650
Of course, sir.
If you ask, I will deliver.

715
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,028
Sounds like you have something good.

716
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:16,956
This is…

717
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,875
Yes, sir. It is.

718
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:23,046
It is the flower that I told you about.
The one that will make you rich.

719
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,297
The money flower.

720
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:30,553
You see, my wallet has been feeling
a bit thin lately.

721
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:34,307
Do you own any land in Sorak County, sir?

722
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,478
This flower grows very well
in the soil over there.

723
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:41,272
I do not have any land
that is big enough to grow these.

724
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:44,901
If you give me the land,
you do not need to worry about paying me.

725
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,365
Are you in there?

726
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,873
My goodness, Inspector Cho.

727
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,542
What brings you here?

728
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,293
It is Cho Shin-woo?

729
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,963
I heard you have
the oldest pharmacopeia here.

730
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,382
That is true, sir.

731
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,552
Is there an herb that could
change the color of metal?

732
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:15,682
It depends on the type of metal
you are talking about.

733
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,152
This looks like a needle
used by physicians.

734
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:35,368
I am not sure, sir.

735
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,375
Have a safe journey back.

736
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,379
Why on earth does he want to know?

737
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:54,429
Your sedan chair is here.
Whenever you are ready.

738
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,348
Wait, madam.

739
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:00,435
Madam.

740
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,814
Why are you leaving me behind?

741
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,942
I am sure the Left Councilor
will send you some good news soon.

742
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,527
You can come up to see me then.

743
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:14,073
I am already fully dressed.
Can I come with you?

744
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,827
No, you cannot.

745
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,580
Did the princess…

746
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,291
I mean, your mother,
not give you a part of the land

747
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:25,585
that she inherited?

748
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,003
Yes, she did.

749
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:30,131
Do not worry, for I plan to send
the children to a good school

750
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:33,218
and raise them well
with the profits from that land.

751
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:38,306
I hope that you will become a minister
and come back to Hanyang.

752
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,060
Let us go.

753
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:46,773
Gosh.

754
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,400
You cannot do this.

755
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:55,782
Hey!

756
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,368
You think you are all that
because you are the princess' daughter?

757
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:04,582
Fine! See if I…

758
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:06,876
care.

759
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:13,216
At this rate,
you will end up getting a stroke.

760
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,059
You never let me eat those.

761
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:32,110
-What? Is this really for me?
-Yes.

762
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,285
Is it that good?

763
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,580
You look so happy.

764
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,083
Another one?

765
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,192
I am sorry.

766
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:17,822
You saved me, Mr. Yoo.
What are you sorry about?

767
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,243
The adults should have

768
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,953
protected you and cared for you.

769
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:29,375
They should have helped you
and saved you from the pain.

770
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:36,674
If you do not want to go to Hanyang,

771
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,051
you can tell me.

772
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,846
No. I want to become just like you.

773
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:46,517
I am going to study hard in Hanyang
and pass the medical exam with honors.

774
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:53,149
You know, it will not be that easy.

775
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,402
I got the highest scores of all time.

776
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:00,740
I will do it too.

777
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:08,665
By any chance,

778
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:12,043
if somebody tries to harm you again,

779
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:15,421
it will never be your fault.

780
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:21,052
Never forget that. All right?

781
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,025
I am sorry for everything, dear.

782
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,153
Sorry.

783
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:42,365
If anyone messes with you in Hanyang,
we will take care of them.

784
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:49,455
Here. This is for you.

785
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,011
Let us go.

786
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,477
What is up with you?

787
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,564
Why are you sharing
your scorched rice with everybody?

788
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,234
I do not know.

789
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:22,280
Mom…

790
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:25,908
Mom…

791
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,911
We are going home soon. Do not cry.

792
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,248
Mom.

793
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:37,336
Mom.

794
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,342
Mom.

795
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,850
Here, eat this.

796
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:04,781
Get on my back.

797
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,918
Crying, vomiting, and pooping

798
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:19,086
will bring your fever down.

799
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,380
Go ahead and cry.

800
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,935
I am fine now.

801
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:35,686
You saved me.

802
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:42,026
I am not the one who saved you.
You saved yourself.

803
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:45,488
I just helped you along the way.

804
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:51,702
Seok-chul will be all right now,
even without us.

805
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,834
In the end, you will always have to

806
01:03:58,793 --> 01:03:59,919
save yourself.

807
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,714
Do you understand?

808
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:05,883
Yes.

809
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:34,620
Oh, my.

810
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,459
What is he doing in Sorak?

811
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,378
So many handsome men around here.

812
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:44,297
Are you kidding me?

813
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:46,924
He looks like he is out for blood.

814
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:48,259
Seriously?

815
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,596
Stop saying those mean things
to handsome people.

816
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:53,639
I want them to stick around.

817
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:03,190
My goodness, what are you doing here?

818
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:04,984
Are you hurt?

819
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:08,195
We are closed for today, actually.

820
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:10,156
I am here to see Mr. Gye.

821
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:12,909
Did not you hear me?
Did you hurt your ears?

822
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:18,706
Listen, we are closed.

823
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:21,959
We are not seeing any more patients.

824
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,879
What are you doing
in front of the inspector?

825
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:26,964
This way, sir.

826
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:36,265
What is up with her voice?

827
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:39,936
"This way, sir."
Is she a mosquito or what?

828
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:06,462
This is a physician's needle.

829
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:10,132
To be precise, it is a needle
that changed colors.

830
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:16,013
Why did you bring this all the way here

831
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:18,933
so late at night, Inspector Cho?

832
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:21,102
It is very urgent.

833
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:28,442
Tell me everything about
what caused this needle to change colors.

834
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:35,116
I am just a poor physician
living in the countryside, sir.

835
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:37,243
I do not know anything.

836
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:40,413
Actually, I heard that

837
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,499
you are the master of poisonous plants.

838
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:50,172
That is not true at all.
I am nothing like that, sir.

839
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:56,470
Is that so?

840
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:02,059
I will apologize for tonight, then.

841
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:05,521
Well, if you ever feel sick,
feel free to--

842
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,497
I did not do anything, sir.

843
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:47,646
Have you known my identity all along?

844
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,232
Why are you giving this to me now?

845
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:51,275
Let me have Gyesu Infirmary.

846
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:55,321
We need to be more frugal from now on.

847
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:57,406
If I get reincarnated,
I definitely want to live as you.

848
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:00,951
Being a nobleman is
not that big of a deal.

849
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:02,953
Mr. Gye said you eat like a pig, Eun-woo.

850
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:04,914
-Pardon?
-You damned bastard.

851
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:05,956
Go do some work!

852
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,584
I wish I could wring his neck…

853
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:11,962
I am embarrassed to call him my father.

854
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,589
Is it fine if Ip-boon knows, though?

855
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:16,092
Her mother died because of you,

856
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:18,260
the useless physician?

857
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,429
Shut your mouth!

858
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:25,518
