1
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,410
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:36,953
Did Councilor Cho…

3
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,331
order you

4
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,376
to kill me?

5
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,340
Are you…

6
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,177
going to kill me now?

7
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,188
Yes.

8
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,191
But not today.

9
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,695
I want you to leave
Gyesu Infirmary at once.

10
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,907
I cannot disobey his order,

11
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,285
but I do not want to kill
someone who saved my life.

12
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:20,288
So you must leave this place
and never come back.

13
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,541
No, I cannot do that.

14
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,710
You are an amazing physician, are you not?

15
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:30,048
You have saved so many people,
and you will save more in the future.

16
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,343
But those who are after you
are like wild beasts.

17
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,680
They will only stop
once they have torn you apart.

18
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,974
They are cruel men.

19
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,436
I was told to not turn my back

20
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,271
when facing a wild beast.

21
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,858
The only way to avoid getting eaten

22
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,528
is to look it straight in the eyes
and shout.

23
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,655
Besides, who knows?

24
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,282
Perhaps I am the natural enemy
of that wild beast.

25
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:05,834
So you are saying that
you are not going to leave this place.

26
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,796
I am not going to back away now.

27
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,757
I do not want you to hesitate
just because you owe me your life.

28
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,717
Just do what you need to do,

29
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,929
and I will do the same.

30
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,578
Who on earth did something like that?

31
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,582
Tell me everything about
what caused this needle to change colors.

32
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,043
They were both students
of Jeon Gyu-hyeong,

33
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,671
the master of poisonous plants
who wrote the Haedong Book of Herbs.

34
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,638
Tell me what you are hiding

35
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,265
about the dan sedge.

36
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,019
I said I do not want to talk about it.

37
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,478
The symptoms caused by the dan sedge

38
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,565
were the same ones exhibited
by the previous King before he died.

39
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,401
If somebody used that plant
in the royal palace…

40
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,944
Do not say something like that.

41
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,407
What happened was caused
by your own arrogance.

42
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,409
Are you putting the blame
on something else

43
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,785
and trying to run away?

44
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,916
I need to find out the truth.

45
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,710
If somebody used the dan sedge
on the previous King,

46
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:31,794
it must be revealed!

47
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,213
If you try to dig too deep into it,

48
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,591
you might be killed
before you even know it.

49
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,926
Not only will you endanger
Gyesu Infirmary,

50
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,177
but you will

51
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,471
endanger every single person
in Sorak County.

52
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,726
Councilor Cho wants me dead already.

53
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,898
Now is not the time to run. We must fight.

54
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,108
Do you not want revenge too, Mr. Gye?

55
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,322
Please, help me.

56
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,543
Your father, Gwi-soo, and I

57
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,839
were all students of the author,
Jeon Gyu-hyeong.

58
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,306
What do you think you are doing?

59
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,058
I am sorry, sir.

60
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,351
What…

61
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:32,605
Gwi-soo did everything he could
to get on Councilor Cho's good side

62
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,107
because of his political power.

63
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,240
He killed…

64
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,617
his own mentor.

65
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,998
To weaponize the dan sedge
and to gain power,

66
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,834
they burned all of the books
and killed everybody involved.

67
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,963
I managed to run away,

68
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,464
but I lost everything.

69
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,220
If Councilor Cho is after you,
you must run.

70
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,305
They will

71
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,348
kill you.

72
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,729
No.

73
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,899
I am going to Hanyang

74
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,985
to reveal the truth.

75
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:22,071
You need to find the evidence
to incriminate them,

76
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,698
before running to Hanyang.

77
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,534
I should find the evidence
in Hanyang, where it all happened.

78
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,786
I need to go there.

79
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,966
What on earth is he talking about?

80
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,304
I just do not get him sometimes.

81
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,640
Did something happen?

82
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,392
No, it is nothing.

83
00:05:58,816 --> 00:05:59,776
Lady Eun-woo.

84
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,903
Can you help me, please?

85
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,740
He wants me to start packing food
in the middle of the night

86
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,494
because he is going to Hanyang.
That is insane!

87
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,829
-Mr. Yoo said that?
-Yes.

88
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,748
Why Hanyang?

89
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,833
Beats me.

90
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,711
It has only been a couple of days
since he almost died

91
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,880
trying to come up with that cure.

92
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:24,050
Besides, he is supposed to be
in exile right now.

93
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,515
My goodness, I do not understand him.

94
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:42,819
Mr. Yoo.

95
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:48,699
Eun-woo.

96
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:03,047
Are you really going to Hanyang?

97
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,220
Yes.

98
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,766
Did something happen?

99
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,482
You do not have to know.

100
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,111
It is best if you do not know.

101
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,950
So, you really have to go?

102
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,579
Yes, I do.

103
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,374
I need to go there myself.

104
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,295
But what about me?

105
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,469
Maybe I could help.

106
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,847
You will endanger
the people at Gyesu Infirmary,

107
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,559
and endanger every single person
in Sorak County.

108
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,269
No.

109
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,481
You must not.

110
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,816
You need to stay in Sorak.

111
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,910
Well…

112
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,245
I left a book
back at the government office.

113
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,623
I will get it for you right now.
So do not leave.

114
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,125
Eun-woo, you can give it to me next…

115
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,595
Of course he is not going to listen to me.

116
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,138
I should not have said anything.

117
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,443
Thief…

118
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,834
She could have been there
and back 12 times by now.

119
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,711
Where on earth is she?

120
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,255
It is my fault.

121
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,631
I should have gone with her.

122
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,176
Young Master.

123
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,053
Look…

124
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,269
Eun-woo.

125
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,272
Oh, my.

126
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,463
She was extremely disturbed
and her pulse feels startled,

127
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,299
but there is no trace of blood.

128
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,259
-What is he talking about?
-Do not ask me.

129
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,972
She has not been bleeding for that long,
and she passed out because of shock.

130
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,432
Is that really so hard to say?

131
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,684
-Move aside.
-My goodness.

132
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,318
Please use naegwan and sinmun.

133
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,778
Let go of me. I know that, obviously.

134
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,211
Stay right here until
Lady Eun-woo wakes up.

135
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,548
Keep watching her. If you try
to run away, I swear to the gods…

136
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,717
I do not need you to tell me.

137
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,724
-Hey, get out. All of you.
-Oh, right.

138
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,810
Yes. Mr. Yoo will be
more helpful than you.

139
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:45,728
Let us go.

140
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,482
Young Master, what about Hanyang…

141
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,608
Get out. Go.

142
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,027
I am leaving.

143
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,993
Until Lady Eun-woo gets better,
do not say a word about that place.

144
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,745
How could Lady Eun-woo

145
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,331
treat her patients without you?

146
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,751
I bet you did not think about that.

147
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,252
You selfish prick.

148
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,835
Eun-woo.

149
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,345
Is she awake?

150
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,496
I am so glad that you are all right.

151
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,590
I am so glad that you are fine.

152
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,597
That was foolish. Why were you
walking around all alone at night?

153
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,101
That is what I am saying.
Why did you go there at that hour?

154
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,979
Well…

155
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:01,567
I was going to the government office
to get a book and seal for Mr. Yoo.

156
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,571
So late at night?

157
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,240
Never do that again.

158
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,455
It is dangerous to go out
by yourself at night.

159
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,207
It is my fault.

160
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,293
I should have followed her.

161
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,086
Why would you?

162
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,050
Next time, call for me.

163
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,480
I thought she had something
going on with Mr. Yoo.

164
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,651
You can never be too sure
about romantic relationships.

165
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,697
I feel like my young master
is not doing too well though.

166
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,617
Just let them be.

167
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,953
That house?

168
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,288
After the government official died,
only his wife and daughter live there.

169
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,209
So the thief was after their wealth.

170
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,628
It might not have been a thief.

171
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,713
Then what else could he have been?

172
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,968
Something could have happened to them.
I should go and check.

173
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,094
I must find out who he was.

174
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,679
-No, you cannot.
-No.

175
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,640
I will go.

176
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,935
A government officer should go
to catch the thief.

177
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,353
I will go.

178
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,897
A physician should go to treat illnesses.

179
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,696
Then both of you can go.

180
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,697
-Yes.
-Yes.

181
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,616
-Both of us?
-Why should I?

182
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,452
Well, you both said that you wanted to go.

183
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,061
I thought you were
going to take my advice and leave.

184
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,855
What are you still doing here?

185
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,065
Actually, I was never planning on leaving.

186
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,489
I gave you the perfect way out.
Why did you refuse?

187
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,159
Do you need to risk your life to leave?

188
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,286
Or is this perhaps

189
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,413
because of Eun-woo?

190
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,708
Gyesu Infirmary is my home now,
and they are my family.

191
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,501
Of course Eun-woo is a part of that.

192
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,920
Then there is no better reason
why you must leave.

193
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,382
They will all be in danger
if you try to face your pursuers.

194
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,268
Do you think it is a coincidence
that Eun-woo got hurt?

195
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,564
Are you saying the man from yesterday
attacked Eun-woo

196
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,858
because he was coming after me?

197
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,445
Using Eun-woo will make it
much easier to kill you.

198
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,449
He might have sent another assassin.

199
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,369
If anybody hurts Eun-woo,

200
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,206
they will have to deal with me.

201
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,292
I could say the same thing.

202
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,893
Inspector Cho, what brings you
to our house?

203
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,063
I heard that you were robbed last night.

204
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,981
Robbed?

205
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,610
Somebody saw a man jumping over your wall.

206
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,571
Are you missing any of your possessions?

207
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,120
I do not think so.

208
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,080
I am not sure what you are talking about.

209
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,667
I did not even wake up last night

210
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,961
because it was so quiet outside.

211
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,591
You must be at the wrong house.

212
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,593
See them out.

213
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,742
Excuse me.

214
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,619
Yes, sir.

215
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,955
Does the madam have a daughter?

216
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,544
I need to meet with her
for the investigation.

217
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,880
That is against the law.

218
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,883
You cannot meet a maiden
who has not been married yet.

219
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,677
He is a royal inspector,

220
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,846
and this is a very serious
incident we are dealing with.

221
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,182
Are you disobeying the inspector?

222
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:48,103
But, it will not be possible
without the madam's permission.

223
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,317
I guess the royal inspector
really is not all that.

224
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,530
Hey.

225
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,325
How dare you disobey
the orders of a royal inspector?

226
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,246
Lead the way. I will be responsible
for whatever happens.

227
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,381
My lady, it is me.

228
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,514
My lady.

229
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,684
My lady.

230
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,479
Lady Yeon-hwa, wake up.

231
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,647
Lady Yeon-hwa.

232
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,732
I must take her to the infirmary.

233
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,983
No, you cannot.

234
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,527
She cannot go anywhere
without the madam's permission.

235
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,321
What do you suggest that we do, then?

236
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,698
I am not going.

237
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,827
Lady Yeon-hwa, are you all right?

238
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,122
I am not going anywhere.

239
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,507
Did Lady Yeon-hwa run into
the thief last night?

240
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,885
Well…

241
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,888
Something must have happened.

242
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,098
But,

243
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,184
her pulse does not feel surprised.
It actually feels downcast.

244
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,062
She must be deeply worried
about something.

245
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,649
Last night,

246
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,611
something very bad almost
happened to Lady Yeon-hwa.

247
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,571
What do you mean?

248
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,119
A maiden kidnapper broke into the house.

249
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,580
A maiden kidnapper?

250
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,502
She is afraid

251
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,421
that he will come back.

252
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,223
A maiden kidnapper?

253
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,060
I have heard of widows
getting kidnapped, but I have never…

254
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,688
I noticed something else that was odd.

255
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,607
She said that Lady Yeon-hwa
was shocked last night,

256
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,818
but her pulse felt deeply depressed.

257
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,820
It must have been that way
for a long time.

258
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,573
The madam seemed
more nervous than her, honestly.

259
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,536
I heard she treasures her daughter so much

260
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,913
that Lady Yeon-hwa
never even left her house.

261
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,292
If she cares so much about her daughter,

262
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,294
would she not have reported it first?

263
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,046
That is a good point.

264
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,049
She did not even say anything
in front of an inspector.

265
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,008
It feels a bit off.

266
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,344
I will go and talk to her tomorrow.

267
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,554
No.

268
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,389
You have not even fully recovered yet.

269
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,058
I am feeling fine now.

270
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,435
I am the only one who saw it happen.
Let me go.

271
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,355
We do not know if it was
a maiden kidnapper.

272
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,233
If something else is going on,
you could be in danger.

273
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,819
Something else?

274
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,155
Danger?

275
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,163
I am sure that I can help you,
as I am the witness.

276
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,581
Take me with you.

277
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,545
So that is what happened.

278
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,922
I see.

279
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,467
I told you to not let anybody in.

280
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,515
I am here to check something, madam.

281
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,184
She already told me about
the maiden kidnapper.

282
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:18,021
Why did you hide that yesterday, then?

283
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,398
She will be marrying into
a very noble family soon.

284
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,943
You will ruin her future with this ruckus

285
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,946
when you are not even sure
that it was a maiden kidnapper.

286
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,324
I cannot believe you listened
to a lowly servant.

287
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,827
Lady Yeon-hwa is very ill.

288
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,578
She needs some medical treatment.

289
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,627
I have heard all about you, Lady Eun-woo.

290
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,880
You should be staying faithful
to your dead husband as a young widow,

291
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,966
but you cut your ribbon,
let your hair loose,

292
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,385
and do whatever you want.

293
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,389
To people like us who follow the law,

294
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:55,058
you are a very unlucky woman.

295
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,980
Yeon-hwa is nothing like you, though.

296
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,358
Remember this.

297
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:06,987
You must not speak a word
about today to anybody.

298
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:11,616
If my daughter ends up being harmed
because of some false rumor,

299
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,618
whoever is behind it

300
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,745
will have to face my wrath.

301
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,291
Madam.

302
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,462
Lady Yeon-hwa…

303
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,476
Stop being so foolish.

304
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,940
She lacks blood and fluids due to stress.

305
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:47,903
The energy in her heart, liver,
and intestines is not circulating.

306
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,697
She needs a needle
to get her energy flowing again,

307
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,033
and she will need medicines like
yukmi or cheongshim bohyultang

308
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:53,950
for the long term.

309
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,952
YUKMI, CHEONGSHIM BOHYULTANG:
STRENGTHENS THE LIVER, KIDNEY, AND HEART

310
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:02,792
I cannot have a male physician
placing a needle on her.

311
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,711
Just prescribe her some medication.

312
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,465
I may be an unlucky woman,

313
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,508
but I can come in handy
when treating other women

314
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,385
as I have practiced medicine.

315
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,263
For her condition, I can place a needle
on hapgok on her hand,

316
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,723
There is no need to be embarrassed.

317
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,993
One, two,

318
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:38,453
three.

319
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,752
I feel much better now.

320
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,094
Since she cannot leave our house,
Come see her a few more times.

321
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,941
You must have been very scared, my lady.

322
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:12,237
I saw him outside of the house,
but I still passed out.

323
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,072
You must have been so frightened.

324
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,536
Could you tell me what happened?

325
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,585
My lady.

326
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,586
What is wrong?

327
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,673
Where did you get this?

328
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,758
Where?

329
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,600
Just go.

330
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,980
Go. Leave me alone.

331
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,528
What is wrong with her?

332
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,115
I think she was very shocked
by the maiden kidnapper.

333
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,492
She has palpitations
from shock and anxiety, right?

334
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,121
No. If she was just startled,

335
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,832
then her pulse would have been
much more uneven.

336
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,959
But her digestion has gotten very weak.

337
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,295
She had no strength
and her pulse was weak.

338
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:13,131
What on earth is she suffering from, then?

339
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:19,095
I guess physicians
are not all that, after all.

340
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,014
You cannot even name her illness.

341
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,766
I am being careful.

342
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,854
I need to know the cause
to treat the symptoms.

343
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,982
It was obviously the maiden kidnapper.

344
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,444
Maybe that is a relief,

345
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,987
but what will you do now?

346
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,589
Again? Where do you keep
running off nowadays?

347
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,050
When the idiot returns,
tell him to see the patients.

348
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,969
And make sure he does not
give a discount to the nobles.

349
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,180
Come on, are you meeting some woman?

350
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,556
Am I getting a stepmother?

351
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,350
You are an old man getting married!

352
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,561
Ji-han is going to be a groom.

353
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,772
Do not even joke about
something like that.

354
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,565
That woman did not do anything wrong.

355
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,027
Mr. Gye is the pettiest man alive.

356
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,446
No woman would ever love him.

357
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,074
That is what Man-bok said.

358
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:23,993
You little…

359
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,870
-That is not true.
-It is true.

360
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:26,871
-That is not true.
-It is true.

361
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,457
I mean, that is not it. It is…

362
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,586
Whatever.
The cat is out of the bag anyway.

363
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,422
I have a lot more to say, actually.

364
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,090
You have a bad temper.

365
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,925
You curse all the time.

366
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:43,638
You bark like a dog
whenever you get drunk.

367
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,348
Hey, stop it with the nonsense!

368
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,394
It is hard enough trying to take care
of you all.

369
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,146
Gosh.

370
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,941
Exactly!
You are way too mean to get remarried!

371
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,486
Jang-goon.
Are you picking a fight or what?

372
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,487
I am not.

373
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,787
Have you seen this herb?

374
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,497
No, never.

375
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,210
How many herbalists are around here?

376
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,132
Maybe three.

377
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,445
What the heck? What was that sound?

378
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,574
What was that noise?

379
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:29,744
Who are you?

380
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:34,916
Who the heck are you?

381
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:38,169
Thief.

382
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,420
It is a thief!

383
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,518
-Granny.
-Bok.

384
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,811
Oh, gosh.

385
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:55,770
Bok.

386
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,522
Oh, gosh.

387
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,940
-Oh, my.
-Hey.

388
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,536
Stay still.

389
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,164
-Man-bok.
-Ouch, my crotch!

390
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,879
-Hey!
-Stop right there.

391
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,718
Eun-woo.

392
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,892
It is all right.

393
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,439
That must have been the thief from before.

394
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,733
He must have come here
to look for you, my lady.

395
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,652
Jeez, that is creepy.
Look, I am getting goosebumps.

396
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:52,327
I am fine now. I was just a bit startled.

397
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:58,541
I think we should all sleep
in Lady Eun-woo's room tonight.

398
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,667
Yes.

399
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,212
We can all sleep in Lady Eun-woo's room.

400
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,213
All of us?

401
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,215
That sounds fun!

402
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,511
I will prepare some late-night snacks.

403
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,718
Why is it so wet? It did not even rain.

404
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,448
That is strange.

405
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,786
What is wrong? Are you missing any herbs?

406
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,831
No, but it is strange.

407
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,126
Yangjegeun, licorice, and milkvetch roots.

408
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,086
I am not missing any of those.

409
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:28,047
But there are some new herbs here.

410
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,177
Where did these come from?

411
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,222
Maybe that thief dropped them.

412
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,767
Or maybe he was trying to steal them.

413
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,685
Oh, my.

414
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,979
We do not have
any expensive herbs like these.

415
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,481
Mr. Gye is broke. He always says,

416
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,608
"Hey, this is not the royal palace!"

417
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,737
That is what he says.

418
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,123
I am going out for a moment.

419
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,416
Sure.

420
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,002
My goodness.

421
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:09,047
My lady, where are you going?

422
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,006
Gosh.

423
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:13,801
You are not supposed
to walk around by yourself yet.

424
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:42,246
It has not rained for the past few days,
so where did the mud come from?

425
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:46,876
The herbs.

426
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:49,879
The mountain.

427
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,220
What was Dol-seok doing
two days ago in the evening?

428
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,346
He was having an affair

429
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,264
with the courtesan, Woo-hui.

430
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,892
-Woo-hui confirmed it too.
-What about Yong-joon?

431
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,103
He became an alcoholic
as he could not marry.

432
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:09,315
Then he started going around the village
saying that he would kidnap a maiden.

433
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,691
Inspector Cho.

434
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,528
Oh, goodness.

435
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,322
I have been looking for you everywhere.

436
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,407
Me? Why?

437
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,202
Councilor Cho is calling you
from Hanyang, sir.

438
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,912
He wants you to come up right away.

439
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,665
And why are you bringing me this news?

440
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,085
Were you not aware, sir?

441
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:33,506
I am very close to Councilor Cho.

442
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,676
Have you even met my father?

443
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,390
I heard that you have been
trying to make connections

444
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,850
in order to work for me.

445
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,685
Yes, sir.

446
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:50,314
I swear that I will do anything
to serve you

447
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,024
until the day I die, sir.

448
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,569
You are a funny man.

449
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:01,868
Well, then.
What has Shin-woo been doing recently?

450
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,452
Yes, sir.

451
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:06,122
He is very focused on his duties
as an inspector,

452
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,290
and…

453
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:16,382
I feel that
he might be hiding something, sir.

454
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,218
Is that so?

455
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,847
-What is he hiding?
-Well, sir,

456
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,933
it is nothing too special.

457
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:31,772
It was a needle, about this long,
and it was black at the tip.

458
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,151
But it was not one of those needles
that physicians usually use.

459
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:40,364
It looked a bit strange.
It was rectangular.

460
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,784
He was carrying that around
and asking people about it

461
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,746
in secret, sir.

462
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:57,215
I see. You seem like
you are very interested in Shin-woo.

463
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,052
Oh, no.

464
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:05,181
I hope I did not say anything
that I should not have said.

465
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,152
Eat.

466
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:23,366
I should have
brought you here much earlier.

467
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:25,910
Yes, sir.

468
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,165
Until I give an additional order,

469
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,501
watch Shin-woo
and report everything he does.

470
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,128
Of course, sir.

471
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:40,591
I will do anything for you, sir.

472
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,314
The mud that was on the thief's shoes

473
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:59,277
was also found in our yard
and Mr. Choi's wall.

474
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,445
He also owns some precious herbs.

475
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,364
He must be an herbalist.

476
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,699
That is right.

477
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,201
These herbs are hard to obtain
even for an herbalist.

478
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,619
Maybe he found them himself.

479
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,538
The top of Sorak Mountain is muddy

480
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,415
because it is so humid, right?

481
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:15,793
Yes. I saw that when I went to find
some cheonma for the young master.

482
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:16,794
Yes.

483
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,506
An herbalist from the mountains
came down because he was lonely?

484
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,217
There are three herbalists
in Sorak Mountain.

485
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,012
Sorak Mountain gets very steep
and humid from its midpoint,

486
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,430
so not many people go there.

487
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:38,024
An herbalist who lives in the valley
must have dug up this wild ginseng.

488
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,275
What?

489
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,861
You can tell where he lives
by the smell of it?

490
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:44,572
That is pretty awesome.

491
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,241
No.

492
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,826
Uncle Gae-ddong told me.

493
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,078
He found wild ginseng
for the first time in years.

494
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,496
You heard from somebody else?

495
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,415
Hey.

496
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,376
We must go there first when the sun rises.

497
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:08,012
Why have you not killed Se-yeop yet?

498
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,773
I have a question.

499
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,820
Why do I have to secretly kill

500
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,447
a nobody physician like Se-yeop?

501
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:31,369
Is there some special reason for it?

502
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,669
So you need a reason to do it?

503
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:41,837
This is not like you.

504
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,302
You can leave me for today.

505
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,846
Are we at the right place?

506
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,311
Let us go.

507
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:45,818
Young Master.

508
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,279
I think this is the place.

509
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,741
I will go first. You can follow me.

510
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,751
Hey, you thief!

511
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,591
Hey, be quiet.

512
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:21,520
Oh, my.

513
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,483
Young Master.

514
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,776
Hey.

515
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,071
Wake up.

516
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,036
-Lay him down in the guest room.
-Yes.

517
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,120
Eun-woo.

518
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:39,538
Yes.

519
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,124
-He needs acupuncture.
-All right.

520
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,719
Should I place some needles
on sipseon too?

521
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:54,929
No.

522
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,430
His pulse is too weak.

523
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,350
He lacks blood and fluids due to stress.

524
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,811
The energy in his heart, liver,
and intestines is not circulating.

525
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,440
What?

526
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,109
He has the same symptoms as Lady Yeon-hwa.

527
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,738
No.

528
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,157
No.

529
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,992
Can you hear me?

530
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:39,431
My goodness.

531
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,395
Come on, be a man. How come
you cannot swallow even a spoonful?

532
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,654
Just leave me alone.

533
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,248
He may have the same illness

534
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,293
as Lady Yeon-hwa.

535
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:10,588
Really?

536
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:19,221
We caught the man
who was trying to kidnap you.

537
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:27,062
He even came to Gyesu Infirmary
and tried to attack Eun-woo.

538
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:30,983
No.

539
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,861
No. He is not like that.

540
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:35,654
So you know him?

541
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,366
What happened between you two?

542
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,168
If you do not say anything,
he will be arrested.

543
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,797
Even if you do not tell us,

544
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,091
we know who he is already.

545
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,054
He had those precious herbs,
so he must be an herbalist.

546
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,222
You each have a piece
from the same ribbon.

547
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,433
And, most importantly,

548
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,853
you are both suffering
from the same illness.

549
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,274
We know exactly

550
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,234
who you are doing this for.

551
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:19,990
We…

552
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,413
We just wanted to be together.

553
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,213
After my father passed away,

554
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,049
our family's power started to decline.

555
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,468
My goodness, I did not bring the money.

556
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,261
I will go and get it right away.

557
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,932
Until I married into a family
that would help us regain our power,

558
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,309
I was supposed to stay in the house.

559
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:53,732
That is when I met him.

560
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:54,691
Is it heavy?

561
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,694
Want me to carry it?

562
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:03,617
Where are you going?

563
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:07,955
Can you tell me where?

564
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:19,633
Let us go.

565
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,520
I told you, my mother will never allow it.

566
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,273
You went through all that for nothing.

567
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,110
Let us…

568
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,368
run away together.

569
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,787
Will you do that for me?

570
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,349
This is the proof of my love.

571
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,816
That is why we did it.

572
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,946
We thought my mother would give up on me
if I got kidnapped.

573
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,074
But…

574
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,576
No.

575
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,828
Mu-yeong.

576
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,330
Mu-yeong.

577
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,457
How dare you touch her?

578
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,918
You will never leave this place alive.

579
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:38,545
Run.

580
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,380
You must escape.

581
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,854
He might die

582
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,441
if I stay with him.

583
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,531
I swear that I will never try
to see him again.

584
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,700
Please forgive him.

585
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,467
I think she is lovesick.

586
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:29,346
When you are lovesick, you can
only think about the person you love.

587
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,932
It is not listed in the medical texts,

588
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,767
but it is extremely hard to treat.

589
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:38,063
Being lovesick means
that you cannot eat or sleep.

590
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:41,525
Even laughing will not keep
the loneliness at bay.

591
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:46,613
So they were both missing each other.

592
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,951
I am sorry, Mr. Yoo.

593
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,125
You did not get to go because of me.

594
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:02,921
But…

595
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,592
are you still going to go?

596
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:11,805
Yes, I am.

597
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:16,893
I am sorry too.

598
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,683
My goodness!

599
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,936
Oh, no. Not this again.

600
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,314
Do you know this herb?

601
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:06,568
You have no idea what I went through
because of that darn herb.

602
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,907
Minister Yoo died
while he was looking into them.

603
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,326
So you better get lost

604
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,703
if you do not have a death wish.

605
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,332
You were harmed because of this herb?
Why? How?

606
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,336
You see,

607
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:28,048
people think that this herb
was used to assassinate the King.

608
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,760
I bet you brought it from the countryside
thinking it is some precious herb.

609
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,262
But you will get arrested
if you have that.

610
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:37,974
Just go.

611
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,394
We never saw each other today,
do you understand?

612
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:44,940
Yoo Hoo-myung.

613
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:50,362
Just what were you trying to uncover?

614
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,166
So…

615
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,045
Is she all right?

616
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,509
The herbs from before.

617
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,386
I was planning on giving them to her.

618
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,471
So that must be

619
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:19,141
why you came to our infirmary that night.

620
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:25,439
I saw you entering Mr. Choi's house.

621
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,817
I planned on secretly leaving them here.

622
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,153
But I became a thief instead.

623
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,363
I deeply apologize.

624
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,911
So how is she?

625
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:47,544
Lady Yeon-hwa is fine now.

626
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,963
You should focus
on getting better as well.

627
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,011
Come out here, Son Mu-yeong.

628
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,267
Father.

629
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:05,645
What is going on?

630
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,648
I heard that Son Mu-yeong is here.

631
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,860
Did he do something wrong?

632
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:15,280
He was accused of stealing.

633
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,325
Arrest him.

634
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,618
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

635
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:22,120
Did Mr. Choi's madam report him?

636
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:23,705
Yes.

637
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,125
Father, he is ill.

638
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:40,931
He sent these for you.

639
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,061
You should go and see him.

640
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,022
No.

641
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,109
I put him through so much grief,

642
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,111
and now he is in jail because of me.

643
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:58,949
I must put this to an end.

644
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:03,203
I am just a burden to him.

645
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,332
Will you not eat anything?

646
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,128
Does she know

647
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,425
that I am locked in here?

648
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,306
Please.

649
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,643
Please do not tell her.

650
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,815
You should undergo treatment

651
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,775
for Lady Yeon-hwa's sake.

652
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,736
Even if I am released,

653
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,241
I do not want to be a burden
to her anymore.

654
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,496
I need to leave.

655
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,592
WE MUST PROTECT
THEIR BEAUTIFUL RELATIONSHIP

656
00:52:58,675 --> 00:52:59,968
Yes.

657
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,386
They should do what they want

658
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,889
instead of keeping their emotions
bottled up inside.

659
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,641
I mean, even in our village,

660
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,895
there is this handsome man

661
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:14,524
who is always walking around
with a beautiful woman.

662
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:18,028
But they are both acting so stupid.
Maybe they do not know

663
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,738
they are in love or how to show it.

664
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:22,324
I guess they will visit
the infirmary for lovesickness.

665
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,370
I bet you will love getting
two patients at once, Mr. Gye.

666
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:33,710
Not at all. The guy cannot be treated.

667
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:34,836
Yes.

668
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,298
Then they can just get married.

669
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:41,092
Yes, they can get married.

670
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,929
We should throw a party
and eat lots of rice cakes and noodles.

671
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:45,931
Marriage? No way.

672
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:48,642
You need experience
to show your affection properly.

673
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:49,643
Jeez.

674
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:55,065
That guy will never be able
to confess his love for her.

675
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,319
Then you must be very experienced
in showing your love?

676
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,655
Of course I am. I mean, look.

677
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,115
-My love.
-Stop it.

678
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,909
-Sorry.
-I swear…

679
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:10,997
Mr. Yoo, you are
a frustrating one as well.

680
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,625
You should get some practice
every once in a while

681
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,252
-with Man-bok or something.
-Jeez.

682
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,004
You cannot practice that.

683
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,049
That is a great idea.

684
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,884
I will get that ready right away.

685
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,637
-Get ready for what?
-What?

686
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:27,931
What is he going to do?

687
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,516
Is he going to confess his love?

688
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:32,560
Eun-woo.

689
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:35,939
I need you for this. Come with me.

690
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,740
It is time to celebrate!

691
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,004
You want me to let him go?

692
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,299
You ignored my request for you to leave,

693
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,260
and now with this absurd request.

694
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,221
Do I look like your friend?

695
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,560
Inspector Cho, you must know

696
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,021
that Mu-yeong is not a thief.

697
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:21,693
Should you not be worried about yourself?
I am planning on killing you.

698
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:26,156
I am sure that you do everything
for a reason, sir.

699
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,545
If you say something
under the moonlight in this bamboo forest,

700
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,089
the person you are talking
about will hear it.

701
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:46,843
Nobody can hear you here,

702
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:49,471
so you can say anything
that you want to say.

703
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:59,022
Do not worry, Lady Yeon-hwa.

704
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:01,858
If you want, you can pretend
that Man-bok is Mu-yeong.

705
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,862
Hey.

706
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,238
You can stay right here.

707
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,449
Go only if you have something to say.

708
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:10,950
-Well…
-It is easier

709
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,453
to say those things
when you are with other women.

710
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,121
-But…
-Whatever.

711
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,372
You can go, Lady Eun-woo.

712
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,589
Learn some tact.

713
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:28,009
Come on. I had a plan too, you know?

714
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,349
My lady.

715
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,852
You can say everything
that you have wanted to say.

716
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,694
I bet you have a lot to say.

717
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:52,492
I was told that I need
to keep those things hidden.

718
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:55,036
If I reveal my true feelings,

719
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,871
then something bad will happen.

720
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:02,710
If anything happens to Mu-yeong…

721
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,714
That is not true.

722
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:13,054
People say that the full moon
will make your wish come true.

723
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,891
How about you try talking to that moon

724
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,226
instead of me, then?

725
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,162
Eun-woo.

726
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:46,671
Come on.

727
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,396
I am going to miss you.

728
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,694
Please do not go.

729
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:15,116
Please stay with me.

730
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,620
My heart hurts so much

731
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:20,997
whenever I imagine you gone,

732
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:26,669
Mr. Yoo.

733
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,562
I knew it.

734
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,731
She is really something else.

735
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,693
Only if my young master

736
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,780
could be like her too.

737
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:55,865
My goodness.

738
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,161
-Oh, my.
-Jeez.

739
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,416
Like that.

740
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,086
Just like that.

741
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,100
I do not want to leave you.

742
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,436
I want to stay with you.

743
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:28,815
I miss you.

744
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,693
I miss the dirt on your hands,

745
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:34,654
your smile,

746
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,324
and the fresh smell of grass.

747
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,036
Please come back to me alive.

748
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,209
Yeon-hwa.

749
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:19,699
I was terrified that I would
never be able to reach you.

750
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,084
My heart will always

751
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:33,379
belong to you.

752
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:10,291
Where are Mu-yeong and Lady Yeon-hwa?

753
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:12,710
They left.

754
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,754
You should have sent her back.

755
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:17,298
You should have sent Lady Yeon-hwa
back to her house.

756
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:20,551
If you keep disobeying the law,
I will have to punish you.

757
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:24,013
What will you do
if both of them end up dying?

758
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,059
Those two need each other to live.

759
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:31,688
If you do not let them go now,
the madam will never let her leave.

760
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,648
So you think you did the right thing?

761
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:35,692
I was just trying to save them.

762
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:41,572
Since when have you been so reckless?

763
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:44,158
-If I had known about this…
-You do not know

764
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,413
what it is like to truly love somebody.

765
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,510
That idiot.

766
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,179
So Shin-woo

767
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:08,766
has been looking into
the discolored needle

768
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,518
that was used when the King died,

769
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:14,313
and everything that Soon-man
told me is true.

770
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,566
Is that what you are saying?

771
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,234
Yes, sir.

772
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:19,694
Minister Yoo died

773
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,488
while holding that needle.

774
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:34,751
So a tiger cub has the evidence
to prove the King was poisoned?

775
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:37,420
I suppose he is truly
going to backstab me.

776
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:41,007
I am sure he will not do that, sir.
Maybe you could call him, and…

777
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:48,097
Do you know the reason
all rebellions end up failing?

778
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:53,144
It is because people fail
to kill the one traitor.

779
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,482
So what I need to do

780
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,402
is to cut down the traitors
without any hesitation

781
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,989
and fill those spaces

782
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:08,242
with people who are loyal to me.

783
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,458
Call Soon-man to me,

784
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:18,836
right now.

785
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:32,725
You do not know

786
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:35,228
what it is like to truly love somebody.

787
01:03:58,292 --> 01:03:59,710
Did Councilor Cho order this?

788
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:32,952
You are always much braver
than I am, Eun-woo.

789
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:36,080
Well…

790
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,834
I was just saying what Lady Yeon-hwa said.

791
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:43,504
I killed the previous King

792
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:46,173
with my own hands.

793
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:52,930
That is the reason

794
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,975
I was banished from the royal palace,

795
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,227
and why I cannot
perform acupuncture anymore.

796
01:04:58,811 --> 01:04:59,687
Also,

797
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:03,399
somebody has been chasing after me
because of what happened.

798
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:10,114
I do not want to leave.

799
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,450
But…

800
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:15,494
I must reveal the truth.

801
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:19,624
Will you…

802
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:23,419
wait for me?

803
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:01,290
So Shin-woo is involved in this as well.

804
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:04,418
The adopted son of Councilor Cho,
who was trying to kill me, was attacked.

805
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:05,419
Who did it?

806
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:08,005
-Se-yeop.
-Your Majesty.

807
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,257
A court lady from the Royal Kitchen
is being brought here.

808
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:11,509
Please help her.

809
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,428
I guess she cannot talk.

810
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,347
They found the court lady
from the Royal Kitchen, Wol.

811
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:17,306
Lead the way.

812
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,558
I shall end this myself.

813
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:23,813
-Find them.
-Soon-man is bringing

814
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:26,399
a bunch of soldiers this way.

815
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:27,525
You must live,

816
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:29,110
and I must save you.

817
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,278
I will be fine.

818
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:36,951
