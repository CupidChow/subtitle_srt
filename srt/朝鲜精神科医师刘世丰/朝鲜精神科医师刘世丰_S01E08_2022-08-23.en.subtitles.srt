1
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,368
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,167
It looks like the needle
that changed colors.

3
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,044
So, that needle

4
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,047
belonged to Yoo Se-yeop?

5
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,885
What is wrong?

6
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:56,890
Shin-woo?

7
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,611
I will come back later.

8
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,464
Why did Yoo Hoo-myung

9
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,342
hold onto this needle that killed the King

10
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,677
even while he was dying?

11
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,981
The head injury that killed him

12
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,984
was definitely not caused
by falling off a horse.

13
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:54,322
Then his death was not caused by accident,
but by homicide?

14
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,999
There is food!

15
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,126
There are a lot.

16
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,093
Gosh, look at all this.

17
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,472
What is that?

18
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,276
Hey, look at this.

19
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,944
I found honey.

20
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,488
-That looks so good.
-That looks amazing.

21
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,782
We can all eat it later.

22
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,715
Hey, take it easy.

23
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,718
What do you think?

24
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,139
What kind of patient
calls the physician to a brothel?

25
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,975
Hey, you are supposed to come
when your patient calls,

26
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,019
you stupid physician.

27
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,397
You arrogant bastard.

28
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,108
I have not forgotten about
how you screwed me over

29
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,027
right in front of Ji-han.

30
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,907
Well, if you want to stay in one piece,

31
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,451
you need to do something for me.

32
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,621
No.

33
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,585
Would you look at this fool?

34
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,171
Hey, are you actually an idiot?

35
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,798
Or is this some weird sense of loyalty?

36
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,594
How come you trust Ji-han so much?

37
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,721
Do you not know what kind of person he is?

38
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,056
Of course I do.

39
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,183
He loves to drink
and loves money even more.

40
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,353
That is not the end of it, though.

41
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,064
He used to be called the Crazy Murderer.

42
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,525
I heard he cut open
somebody's stomach during the war,

43
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,986
and fed poisonous plants to people.

44
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,906
That is exactly right.

45
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,825
Ji-han is a crazy bastard.

46
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,663
He does not care about other people.

47
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,208
How about this? Kick him out,

48
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,168
and take over Gyesu Infirmary.

49
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,588
If you do that,
I will watch your back for you.

50
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,632
I do not want to
take over Gyesu Infirmary,

51
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,634
and I do not need anyone to watch my back.

52
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,845
Hey, you little…

53
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,349
Do you have any idea
how valuable that land is?

54
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,269
I just do not want it
to go to waste, that is all.

55
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,938
Even if Ji-han is a lost cause,

56
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,732
you out of all people
should see some sense.

57
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,615
You have decided, have you not?

58
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,123
He fed poisonous plants to people?

59
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,082
Unbelievable.

60
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,250
It is the plague!

61
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,711
It is the plague!

62
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,795
Let us go back inside.

63
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,881
Run! It is the plague.

64
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,217
It is the plague!

65
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,593
-It is the plague.
-Go inside.

66
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,721
Help me, please.

67
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,223
What is going on?
Is he suffering from psychosis?

68
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,141
PSYCHOSIS: LOSING TOUCH WITH REALITY

69
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,226
After we lost all of our kids

70
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,437
to the plague,

71
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,273
he goes crazy
whenever he hears the word "plague".

72
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,025
Yes, the plague!

73
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,068
The plague is spreading.

74
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,571
Let me take a look. I am a physician.

75
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,658
What if he actually goes crazy?

76
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,620
Look, I already have boils.

77
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,956
Please save me.

78
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,293
Come on, do something.

79
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,338
Please help him.

80
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,967
Will you please help him?

81
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,272
The plague is spreading.

82
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,732
Let us wrap things up and go.

83
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,729
I think the plague is spreading.

84
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,692
I just saw a patient
who had boils on his skin.

85
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:45,530
Yes. That is what I suspected
when all these people came running.

86
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,074
We need to brew digestive medicine
and cold medicine.

87
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,327
Eun-woo, please tell your father
and the inspector about the plague.

88
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,245
Yes.

89
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:16,018
If you have boils, come stand over here.
If you do not, stand over there.

90
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,687
Yes, do what he said.

91
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,277
What? The plague?

92
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,071
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

93
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,365
The patients are swarming
to the infirmary.

94
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,286
None of the other regions
are suffering from the plague.

95
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,664
We must block the roads
to prevent it from spreading

96
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,624
to the neighboring areas and Hanyang.

97
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,542
You are right.

98
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,713
I will come up with a countermeasure.
Distribute the vaccines to the villagers.

99
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,382
All right. Let us hurry.

100
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,304
We must focus on distributing
the vaccines in Sorak.

101
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:54,140
We will need more herbs
from the neighboring counties.

102
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,564
I am telling you, we are all sold out.

103
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,940
People are dying out there.

104
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,610
How can you not have
any honeysuckle or indigo?

105
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,069
I am telling you,

106
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,738
I seriously do not have anything.

107
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,116
Then give me all of the skullcap
and goldthread.

108
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,453
Somebody bought them all as well.

109
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,288
Who bought them?

110
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,959
Sir, please help us!

111
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,962
You are an herbalist!
How can you run out of herbs?

112
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,672
You are the only herbalist in town!

113
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,092
Hey, move it.

114
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,513
Put them in the innermost storeroom.

115
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,765
I better not notice any missing.

116
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,725
If I do, your head will go missing too.

117
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,772
I am going to get so rich!

118
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,902
How dare you lay your filthy hand on me?

119
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,782
Did you really buy all of the herbs?

120
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,619
You think people's lives are a joke?

121
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,872
That is funny coming from you.

122
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,291
You are Ji-han the Nutjob, after all.

123
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,002
You do not care about people's lives.

124
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,672
Stop it with the nonsense.

125
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,926
I will pay you exactly what you paid
for those herbs, so give them to me.

126
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,762
Are you actually crazy?

127
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,223
You see, the price changed a bit
since I bought them.

128
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,225
They are now
at five times the original price.

129
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:22,103
You got the money for that?

130
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,399
You darn thief.

131
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,901
You useless killer physician.

132
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,154
Fine. I will give you those herbs,

133
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,783
if you give me Gyesu Infirmary.

134
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,494
Is that what this is about?

135
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,246
I will never allow that to happen.

136
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,331
Fine, then.

137
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,542
You can just watch all those people die

138
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,752
while eating some popped corn then.

139
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,804
What?

140
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,266
Do not do it.

141
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,285
How dare you?

142
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,329
There was a fly.

143
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,081
I was catching the fly for you.

144
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,126
My goodness.

145
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,631
I will look for those herbs
somewhere else.

146
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,716
Let us go. He is useless.

147
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,634
Yes.

148
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,303
Do not waste your energy.

149
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,764
Just bring me the land certificate
for Gyesu Infirmary.

150
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,568
Here.

151
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,917
That is all we have left.

152
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,468
This will not do.

153
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,137
All of you, come inside.

154
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,279
We need to get as much
of the cure as we can.

155
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,532
Which means tonight,

156
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:44,078
we are getting all of the herbs
from Soon-man's storeroom.

157
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:45,871
Jang-goon.

158
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,623
Hide the land certificate.

159
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,502
Are you really going to give
Gyesu Infirmary to that man?

160
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,711
You cannot!

161
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,839
Where are we going, then?

162
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,259
Who said I was going to do that?
Absolutely not.

163
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,844
We are just getting the herbs.

164
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,513
Dad, did you hit your head?

165
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,681
Or do you have a fever?

166
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,767
Have you met Soon-man?
He will never give them to us.

167
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,895
Did you not learn your lesson
a few hours ago?

168
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,023
You really do not look like it,

169
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,443
but you can be pretty naive sometimes.

170
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,236
We should steal them. Come on.

171
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,739
We are going to steal everything
from his storeroom.

172
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,202
I can do it too.

173
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,579
I agree with this plan.

174
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,332
-There is no way.
-Right?

175
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,183
We are going to steal everything
from his storeroom,

176
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,060
tonight!

177
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,901
Come get some hangover stew!

178
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,819
That prick loves to drink.

179
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,738
Every night, when the curfew bell rings,

180
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,157
he receives hangover stew
and a bottle of alcohol.

181
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,409
Come get some hangover stew!

182
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,787
That is going to be our chance.

183
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,873
ALCOHOL

184
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:13,834
Who are you?

185
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,382
We have hangover stew.

186
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,223
We are delivering stew
from Namhansanseong.

187
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,225
For Lord Im?

188
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,809
The delivery goes to the kitchen.

189
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,776
That smells good.

190
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,153
Is that expensive?

191
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,906
Of course it is. We put abalones in there.

192
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,034
But you can each have a bowl,

193
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,953
if you will tell your friends about us.

194
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,746
Of course we will.

195
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:52,998
Here.

196
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,626
Have some rice wine first.

197
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,004
Rice wine.

198
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,737
Thief!

199
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,615
They took the herbs from the storeroom.

200
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,616
Thief!

201
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,496
Thief!

202
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,456
We are dead. Chase them.

203
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,714
Thief!

204
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,133
What?

205
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,353
My herbs.

206
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,736
My herbs.

207
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,738
Where did they go?

208
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,700
My precious herbs!

209
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,870
Those pricks.

210
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,414
Those evil thieves!

211
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,710
The thieves are running away, sir.

212
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,463
You are telling me?

213
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,173
Go after them!

214
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,600
Hurry.

215
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,317
Right.

216
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,259
-Get them!
-Chase them down!

217
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:13,430
-Stop right there!
-Catch them!

218
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,684
Catch those darn thieves!

219
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,686
Come on, hurry up!

220
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,020
Quickly!

221
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,480
Go after them!

222
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,450
-They are all on the cart.
-Good.

223
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,494
Now…

224
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,624
Well, at least I am giving you
more than the original amount.

225
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,005
Let us go.

226
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,176
Eun-woo.

227
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,599
-Get them.
-Get them.

228
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,559
-Thief!
-Stop them!

229
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,456
-Do not get them mixed up.
-Yes.

230
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,132
Hey.

231
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,925
Are you all right?

232
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,428
That man would pursue with all his might
if it meant his money was on the line.

233
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,180
You seemed to be very worried about me.

234
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,225
Worried about you? No way.

235
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,562
Look at this.

236
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,773
I found this in Soon-man's storeroom.

237
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:47,941
This is…

238
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,403
the hang sedge.

239
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,073
Yes. They are hard to find,

240
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,158
but he had a whole lot
of them, that prick.

241
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,827
These will be fantastic for measles.

242
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,745
Right.

243
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,289
We should make them into pills overnight
to use tomorrow.

244
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,207
All right.

245
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,640
Lift your head a bit.

246
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:23,727
Here.

247
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,531
Hey, you!

248
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,742
You stole my herbs, did you not?

249
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,704
What on earth are you talking about?

250
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,584
And what is that wrapped around your face?
Are you that scared of the plague?

251
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,628
You could line up to get some medication.

252
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,630
Give me money for the herbs.

253
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,135
I have no idea what you are talking about.

254
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,680
But I could make a report,
saying that somebody stole the herbs

255
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,306
that you had stocked up.

256
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,643
I could even write an appeal for you
if you want.

257
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,188
Darn it. Go away.

258
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,566
Get away from me.

259
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,152
You.

260
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,404
I am going to kick you out
of this village soon, all right?

261
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,455
Even a tiger would not eat
someone so rotten like him.

262
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,960
Is that all we have?

263
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,129
We have four geuns and two nyangs.

264
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,673
and we made four geun into pills.
So we have two nyangs left.

265
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,135
I hope that they will be effective.

266
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:39,928
Thank you.

267
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,722
-Thanks.
-Sure.

268
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,480
Give that back. You already had one.

269
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:52,983
Jeez.

270
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,614
My goodness.

271
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,450
Too much of a good thing
can become poisonous.

272
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,162
How are you feeling?

273
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,756
Mr. Gye.

274
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:16,798
Look at this.

275
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,968
I think it is working.

276
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,137
We need some more of the Hang sedge.

277
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,263
Right.

278
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,474
The boils became lighter in color.

279
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,274
If he has measles,
he should be getting scabs.

280
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,360
But those are purple blisters.

281
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,906
No, there is no way.
It must be a coincidence.

282
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,408
The dan sedges were all burnt.

283
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,166
Please help.

284
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,253
Please help my brother.

285
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,548
Please help him.

286
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,260
Let me look at him.

287
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:14,147
Have you been with him this entire time?

288
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,236
And you are feeling fine?

289
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:27,661
She did not get the plague
although she was with him.

290
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,745
That means…

291
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,794
We must quarantine the sick
in the mountain hut right away.

292
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,716
If we dawdle, the plague
will spread to the capital.

293
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,426
What will you do if that happens?

294
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,262
We are quarantining
the patients right now.

295
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:49,558
We do not know if it really is the plague,
or what kind of plague it is.

296
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,393
Besides, the new medicine is working.

297
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,811
We need to observe the patients more.

298
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,731
They think we are abandoning them
in the mountains.

299
00:21:55,814 --> 00:22:00,402
Well, are we all supposed
to die with them then?

300
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:04,489
Since they have the plague,
they will die anyway.

301
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,700
It does not matter where they are.

302
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:07,909
They will die anyway.

303
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,369
They can die without taking us with them.

304
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,204
Mr. Gye.

305
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,498
What do you think about this?

306
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,502
I agree with you, sir.

307
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,755
Mr. Gye.

308
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,884
If this is not the plague,

309
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,386
they will make a full recovery
in the mountain hut.

310
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,180
But if this is the plague,

311
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,891
then quarantining them in the mountain hut

312
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,226
is the only way to save
the rest of the village.

313
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,813
Really? What has gotten into you?

314
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,109
We cannot do that.
It is too early to decide.

315
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,282
One of the patients

316
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,533
has died.

317
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,788
Well, look at that.

318
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,207
Looks like your medication is not working.

319
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,626
Bury the dead,

320
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,337
and take the sick to the mountain hut.

321
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,713
-Now.
-Yes, sir.

322
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,317
A hut has been set up
in the mountains for the sick.

323
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,362
If you have the plague,

324
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,322
you must go there now.

325
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,162
Are you going to set us on fire?

326
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,206
Please do not send us away.

327
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,251
We took the medicine.
We feel a lot better now.

328
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,586
This is an order from the government.

329
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,215
If you do not obey,
you will be punished according to the law.

330
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,053
Take them away.

331
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,684
Hold on.

332
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,400
Help me.

333
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,946
Hold on.

334
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,032
Please let me talk to him.

335
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,457
How is he?

336
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,002
I do not think the Hang sedge
was the cure.

337
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,421
Am I going to die now?

338
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,466
That was not the cure?

339
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,012
No. I am not going to give up on you.

340
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,222
We will find the cure. I promise.

341
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,266
You are lying.

342
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,642
You are lying!

343
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,811
You are just going to run away!

344
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,523
How can you call yourselves physicians?

345
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,776
You are no physicians!

346
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:10,050
If this is happening
because of the dan sedge, not the plague…

347
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,366
You cruel bastards!

HAEDONG BOOK OF HERBS

349
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,953
How dare you?

350
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,204
I am sorry,

351
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,413
Mr. Jeon.

352
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,826
I heard Gyu-hyeong tricked the people

353
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:21,371
by saying that he could cure leprosy
with the dan sedge.

354
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:27,419
Yes, sir. He left the Royal Infirmary
to grow dan sedges here all by himself.

355
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,422
Burn every last page

356
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,008
of his research about the dan sedge.

357
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:40,849
Nobody can know about this plant.

358
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,226
HAEDONG BOOK OF HERBS

359
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,823
Since they filed a report,
Councilor Cho will know about this soon.

360
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,909
They must believe it is the plague.

361
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:05,248
If they start thinking
that it is because of the dan sedge,

362
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,375
they will kill everybody in this village.

363
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,029
If it really was the dan sedge,

364
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,990
the corpse will start to swell
after six hours

365
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,617
and purple blisters will appear.

366
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,802
What are you doing?

367
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,514
Move. I do not have much time.

368
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,766
I do not understand.
Why are you doing this?

369
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,894
Is it because you think a disease
other than the plague is causing this?

370
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:10,563
Get lost if you are going
to keep spewing that nonsense.

371
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,690
Why can you not tell me
what you are doing?

372
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,193
If we leave the patients
in the mountains, they will die.

373
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,486
You must know that.

374
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,531
You know nothing.

375
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,324
Do not give me that.

376
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,410
Tell me what is going on,
so we can solve it.

377
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,661
People call you a nutjob

378
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:27,288
because you are always running around
like this at night.

379
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,167
You cannot know about this.

380
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,168
Move aside.

381
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,504
Come with me.

382
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,048
We must save those who can still be saved.

383
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,971
Do you really think you are so special?

384
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,141
You think you can save everybody?

385
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,475
You arrogant fool.

386
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,476
No.

387
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,146
But I want to stay next to the patients.

388
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,480
Nothing is worse than dying

389
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,316
without ever getting the chance
to be treated by a physician.

390
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,609
Really?

391
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,902
Did you save the King

392
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,655
while you were sitting next to him
like a coward?

393
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,575
You are just a stupid physician

394
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:06,786
who could not save his patient
because of his arrogance.

395
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,247
Move! I am busy.

396
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,389
They are purple. And this shape…

397
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,897
This is not the plague.

398
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,565
It has to be the dan sedge.

399
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,746
What on earth is he hiding?

400
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,421
You are so annoying.

401
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,798
Go away, will you?

402
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,765
You should not be doing
something like this.

403
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,270
What brings you here at this hour?

404
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,564
I am here to see Mr. Gye.

405
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,691
I must talk to him
about the patients in the mountains.

406
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:25,198
Dad, get out here. The inspector is here.

407
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,333
I will go to the mountain hut.

408
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,213
-I need your permission.
-Young Master.

409
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,507
What did you just say?

410
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,221
If you go there, you cannot
come back out unless you are dead.

411
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,472
Why?

412
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,100
Are you planning
on burning the place down?

413
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,728
I am still going.

414
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,106
I will not leave them to die.

415
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,782
What a special physician you are.

416
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,910
You can go if you want.

417
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,330
Mr. Cho.

418
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,417
He does not know what he is talking about.
He is just upset.

419
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,210
What has gotten into you?

420
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,046
Is this because of yesterday?

421
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,133
A physician should never

422
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,467
give up on his patients.

423
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,165
You are so stubborn.

424
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,208
Everyone is saying that you should not go.

425
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,213
You should not have
to do this, Young Master.

426
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,926
You can put that down and head back.

427
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:12,764
Young Master.

428
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,315
Hey, I am not going to die.

429
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,491
Here. It is dried meat.

430
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,952
You need to eat well
to avoid the plague, right?

431
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,122
Are you really giving this to me?

432
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,874
This is truly a special occasion.

433
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,335
I will remember this forever.

434
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,429
I have something for Mr. Yoo.

435
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,020
He cannot treat the patients
if he does not have this.

436
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,439
Is that all right with you?

437
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,608
DO NOT ENTER

438
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,154
Eun-woo.

439
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,199
Mr. Yoo.

440
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,492
You do not look well.

441
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,453
I think you are overworking yourself.

442
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,457
Eun-woo, this disease is
nothing like I have ever seen,

443
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,250
and the blisters are different
from those mentioned in medical texts.

444
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,795
It might be a completely
different kind of disease.

445
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,297
What?

446
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,841
Please go to Suri-gol
where the disease first broke out

447
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:12,842
and look into this.

448
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:18,431
All right. Please take care of yourself.

449
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,558
You too.

450
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,691
What is it?

451
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:31,110
You should read it first, sir.

452
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,579
A plague?

453
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,879
Purple blisters…

454
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:57,011
Lord Cho, please allow us
to burn down the hut in Sorak.

455
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,597
The symptoms sound like

456
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,475
they could be the symptoms
of dan sedge poisoning.

457
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,145
But those remaining plants
were all burned.

458
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,191
The ones that we did not get
may have grown back, sir.

459
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,776
I cannot say anything for sure,

460
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,903
but I think we should be careful.

461
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,490
You should have wiped out
every single one of them.

462
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:22,245
You should have made sure
that not a single trace was left behind!

463
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,881
Hey.

464
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,092
Why are you running?
I am not going to hurt you.

465
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,553
Let me go. I am not sick.

466
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,680
You must be hungry.

467
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,348
You can have this.

468
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:34,400
Are you the only person here
who is not ill?

469
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,361
Before the disease,

470
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,072
what did you and the other adults do
to make a living?

471
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:46,078
We dug up herbs and plants,
and picked honey to sell to the village.

472
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:47,914
Honey?

473
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,834
Do you have any more biscuits?

474
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,586
Can I have more if I bring honey?

475
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,354
Mr. Gye.

476
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,564
Lady Eun-woo.

477
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,068
How come we have so many patients

478
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,737
even after quarantining the others?

479
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,865
That is what I would like to know.

480
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,868
I went to Suri-gol earlier today.

481
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,119
Do you know

482
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,497
what kind of flower this is?

483
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,254
A boy gave me some honey
that was made from this flower's pollen,

484
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,797
so I ate a little bit of it…

485
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,553
And I think I might have a headache.

486
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:01,612
My lady, you must take
some cold medicine right now.

487
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,572
What…

488
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,075
What is going on?

489
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,425
Mr. Yoo.

490
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,181
Are you all right?

491
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,117
We are all going to die.

492
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,869
We are all going to die here!

493
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,496
Shut up! Stop saying that nonsense!

494
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,539
You prick.

495
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,670
Stop it.

496
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,965
Stop it.

497
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:05,968
This is…

498
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,234
You idiot.

499
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,029
What are you doing?

500
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:28,407
I thought you were going to cure
all of the sick people in the world.

501
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,492
Come here.

502
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,997
How did you get in here?

503
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:39,418
I am not a nerd like you.
I can come in here whenever I want to.

504
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,923
What has gotten into you?
Your patients are suffering out there.

505
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,216
How are you a physician?

506
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,427
I cannot do anything for them.

507
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,762
I am giving them medicine,

508
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,806
but their symptoms
are changing too quickly.

509
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,641
Snap out of it.

510
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,353
Are you not better than this?

511
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,356
Before, I could never stop you
from going around

512
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,941
and finding those weird herbs.

513
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:04,527
And now you are going to ignore
your patients here?

514
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,822
You are acting like an idiot.

515
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,201
You need to save them.

516
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,994
You cannot give up and find a cure.

517
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,415
If I thought the cure was out there,
I would have done anything to get it.

518
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,960
When the physician gives up
on the patient, it is over.

519
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,379
You must believe
that your patient will get better.

520
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,388
Lady Eun-woo has those blisters as well.

521
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,186
She does?

522
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,439
When did this happen?

523
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,567
Today.

524
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,406
Would you really do anything

525
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:51,574
to find the cure?

526
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,951
Of course.

527
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,497
You know something, do you not?

528
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,126
Tell me.

529
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,756
I have seen this illness before.

530
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,759
Really?

531
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,262
Why did you not say anything, then?

532
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:17,183
Because it is fatal.

533
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,518
Why?

534
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,145
Is there no cure?

535
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,939
There is, but it might as well not exist.

536
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,149
Why?

537
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,653
It is called mock strawberry,
and it is too poisonous.

538
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,655
If we use it, the patient might die.

539
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,867
The Haedong Book of Herbs.

540
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,709
Mock strawberry plants.

541
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,086
"The plants died a month after sprouting

542
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,214
as they could not grow
in the soil of Joseon."

543
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,053
Have you…

544
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,180
read the Haedong Book of Herbs?

545
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:59,892
Yes. I read it because
I had never seen it before.

546
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:03,479
Besides, that book is the link
between you and my father.

547
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:08,400
He does not know
about the dan sedge, does he?

548
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,030
If mock strawberry plants
can cure this disease,

549
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,657
I will go and find them.

550
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,327
-You cannot find them in the country.
-No.

551
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,704
You missed something.

552
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,708
I found the right conditions
for the plants to grow,

553
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,628
which were abandoned, cold places,

554
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:31,006
as well as humid and windy places,
and scattered the seeds again.

555
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,011
That means…

556
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:40,224
that he was growing them somewhere.

557
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:47,189
THE PLANTS DIED A MONTH AFTER SPROUTING
AS THEY COULD NOT GROW…

558
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,713
I do not know why,

559
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,631
but there was a map hidden in that book.

560
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:17,428
A hidden map?

561
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,096
Yes.

562
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,224
I will find those plants,

563
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,935
and I will save them.

564
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,707
It has to be somewhere high up,

565
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,342
with cold and humid winds.

566
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:05,184
I am going to find them.
I swear that I will.

567
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:30,125
The order said to burn Se-yeop
along with the mountain hut.

568
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:20,926
Everything is ready, sir.
We are just waiting for your order.

569
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,053
All right.

570
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,185
Eun-woo.

571
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,191
What do you think you are doing?

572
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,484
You cannot go in there.

573
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:42,573
And what are you doing?

574
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,409
Are you going to burn this hut down?

575
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,080
Do not worry about it.

576
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,582
Go back to the infirmary.

577
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,543
I have the plague as well.

578
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,716
What?

579
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,802
Do you really?

580
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,306
Yes. I am going
to join the other patients.

581
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:11,101
If you want to set this place on fire,
you will have to kill me too.

582
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,563
No, Eun-woo. I cannot let you go in there.

583
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,399
Go to the infirmary
and have them treat you.

584
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,484
Now.

585
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:22,488
What is going on here?

586
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,496
Why are you here? Where is Mr. Yoo?

587
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,666
You know how useless he is
without his needles.

588
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,835
So he left to find the herbs

589
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,504
that could cure the plague.

590
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,216
How dare he disobey
the government's orders?

591
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:49,473
From now on, if anybody disobeys my words,

592
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,853
I shall have them beheaded.

593
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,107
Wait for my orders.

594
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,959
This is the last one.

595
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,338
Please.

596
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,090
Please.

597
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,772
It is all over now.

598
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:59,037
Why did you abandon your patients?

599
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,669
Abandon them?

600
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,505
I am on my way back
after finding the cure to treat them.

601
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:13,009
I told you that you cannot leave
the hut until you die.

602
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:17,055
You disobeyed my orders.
You will pay for that.

603
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,644
I can save the patients.

604
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,896
If you are going to kill me,

605
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,565
do it after using those herbs.

606
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:31,945
Please.

607
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,492
I will deliver those herbs.

608
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,165
But you need to die here.

609
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:53,258
Why are you doing this?

610
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,391
This is not because I disobeyed
your orders, is it?

611
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,773
Why do I need to die?

612
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:12,611
It is nothing personal.

613
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:15,447
You must die

614
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:20,619
for the peace of this country
and the royal palace.

615
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,455
That makes absolutely no sense.

616
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:25,081
Why must I die?

617
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,086
I am sorry.

618
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,271
You have a fever.

619
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:50,482
You have blisters as well.

620
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,529
Stop talking nonsense.

621
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,074
You have the plague, sir.

622
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,834
Inspector Cho.

623
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,253
Inspector!

624
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,980
They are burning the hut!

625
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,861
They are burning the hut!

626
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,951
You sure got a lot of gall.

627
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:48,164
We are carrying out the will
of the government.

628
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,708
Move aside!

629
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:53,795
So His Majesty told you
to lock up the patients in the mountains

630
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,630
and burn them to death?

631
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,341
Cut the nonsense.

632
00:52:58,925 --> 00:52:59,968
Nonsense?

633
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,139
Throw these rebels in jail.

634
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,181
Start with him.

635
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,852
I will protect my patients

636
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,230
until the very end.

637
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,524
If you do anything to them,

638
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,651
then I am going to kill you.

639
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,612
I do not care if I die doing it!

640
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,364
You are so darn loyal.

641
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,410
Do you really have a death wish?

642
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,288
All right, then kill me!

643
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,458
No! Do not hurt my father.

644
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,714
You idiots.

645
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:39,883
Lock them up.

646
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:41,718
Link arms!

647
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,263
-Hey!
-Hey!

648
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,474
Do not let them take you!

649
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,934
Let go of me!

650
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,060
What are you doing?

651
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,436
You pricks!

652
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:56,107
Fine. I will burn it down myself.

653
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,276
Give it to me.

654
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,153
Stop!

655
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,490
All of you, stop.

656
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,118
The idiot is back.

657
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,287
I have the cure.

658
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,206
I can save them all!

659
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,376
Inspector Cho.

660
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,419
What happened?

661
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,421
Inspector Cho has the plague as well.

662
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,049
Lay him down inside.
We must treat him right away.

663
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:26,846
How dare you?

664
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,598
You little…

665
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,144
Happy now?

666
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:36,523
Hey, save it. Just go inside.

667
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,528
Mr. Gye.

668
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:46,533
Dad, this is the cure, right?
Then we should use them right away!

669
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,826
Do not touch those.

670
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:52,789
I do not want any of you
touching those plants, all right?

671
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:06,720
Eun-woo.

672
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:34,998
All right, tell me.
How do we use those plants?

673
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,752
This is not the plague.

674
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,630
Was this illness

675
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,716
caused by the dan sedge?

676
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,095
With the mock strawberry plants
being the cure

677
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,181
and looking at the symptoms
of the illness,

678
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:54,726
the dan sedge is the only answer.

679
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,605
Am I right?

680
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:17,749
Yes, you are.

681
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,755
It may be a poisonous plant,

682
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:26,800
but it is the only plant
that can cure leprosy.

683
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:35,100
The dan sedge

684
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:37,769
was mixed with the herbs and honey
that the children brought back.

685
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,106
That is how everyone became ill.

686
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,107
Thank you.

687
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:45,527
My mentor

688
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,278
used to live in Suri-gol.

689
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:51,407
We studied the dan sedge there,

690
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:54,494
and he completed
the Haedong Book of Herbs.

691
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,998
Well, do you know how many
mock strawberry plants you need?

692
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,003
My mentor…

693
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,466
was murdered.

694
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:13,179
I survived because I was hiding
like a coward.

695
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,395
I told myself

696
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:23,815
that I had to stay alive

697
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:27,068
in order to pass on my mentor's teachings.

698
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,240
That is why

699
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,827
I can do nothing but drink all the time.

700
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:42,625
They are dangerous.

701
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:43,918
Do you understand?

702
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:46,087
If we slip up, everybody here could die.

703
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:49,966
Who on earth did something like that?

704
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,846
If I survive, I will tell you about it.

705
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:59,517
So you must never speak a word
about the dan sedge.

706
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,603
Mock strawberry plants are the cure.

707
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,313
That is all there is to it.

708
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:05,648
Fine.

709
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,193
Now, tell me how much of the plant I need.

710
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,569
Eun-woo is very ill.

711
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:15,325
I am not sure. You need to try
using it on the patient.

712
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,386
What the…

713
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,388
Spit it out.
Even a small amount is deadly.

714
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:45,104
If it is fresh, not dry,
then it is less poisonous,

715
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,689
and after the blisters appear,

716
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,983
it can be cured
with mock strawberry plants.

717
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,235
Darn it.

718
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:10,547
Here. Eat it.

719
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,897
You need to stay awake.

720
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:28,940
Se-yeop.

721
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,235
Se-yeop, get up!

722
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,181
Young Master.

723
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,892
Young Master. Can you hear me?

724
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:12,317
What happened, Man-bok?

725
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,276
Stay still.

726
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,909
I did it!

727
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,661
What do you mean?

728
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,830
You almost died overnight.

729
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:27,707
My goodness.

730
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:31,878
The blisters all disappeared,
but you were not waking up.

731
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:35,423
I thought you might never wake up, and I…

732
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:38,384
What about Eun-woo?

733
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:39,886
Wait…

734
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,890
Young Master, wait…

735
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,023
Eun-woo.

736
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:58,404
Mr. Yoo.

737
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:12,001
Eun-woo.

738
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:16,839
Are you all right now?

739
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:20,593
Are you sure?

740
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,136
Can you talk and see normally?

741
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:28,434
We should be worried about you.
You look more ill than she does.

742
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,229
Yes.

743
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:34,857
I am fine now, thanks to the herb
that you found.

744
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,276
I can see just fine,

745
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,696
and everything else feels fine as well.

746
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:44,075
Why did you do something
so reckless, though?

747
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:50,081
Well, you could have died.

748
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,833
I did not have much time.

749
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,125
Why did you save me?

750
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,462
I tried to kill you.

751
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:42,925
Because you are my patient.

752
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:50,850
So, Inspector Cho,

753
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:54,771
please write in your report
that this is not the plague,

754
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,939
but a strange illness
that is not contagious.

755
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,194
If you say that it is the plague,

756
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:03,654
then they will tell you
to burn down the hut.

757
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,825
Please save the people of this village.

758
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,078
We can cure them.

759
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,248
We must not give up on them.

760
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:26,552
Will I really be all right

761
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,971
if I drink this?

762
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:34,101
I drank it too, and I feel all better now.

763
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:39,315
I heard you found
these plants on an island.

764
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,151
Did you really?

765
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:43,778
Yes.

766
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:47,156
There is enough for everybody,
so do not worry.

767
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:49,951
This…

768
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:54,413
This plant could have saved them.

769
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:00,837
My goodness.

770
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:02,922
Oh, my…

771
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:06,384
My poor children…

772
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:10,012
If I had this plant,

773
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:11,514
no,

774
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:14,267
if I had somebody like you, Mr. Yoo,

775
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:16,894
my children would not have died like that.

776
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:29,490
I am sorry.

777
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:34,829
My children…

778
01:04:58,102 --> 01:04:59,896
The plague of Sorak County…

779
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,319
Am I right?

780
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:08,404
Yes, you are.

781
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,281
The dan sedge

782
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:13,701
was mixed in the herbs and honey
that the children brought back.

783
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:15,745
That is how everybody got the illness.

784
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:32,511
…is a strange illness
that is not contagious.

785
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:37,308
The medicine that was used
before I burned down the hut

786
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:38,976
turned out to be very effective.

787
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,812
The illness in Sorak
has been completely eliminated now.

788
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:46,317
I shall take care of the physician,
Yoo Se-yeop, as you ordered.

789
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,486
There is nothing
to worry about in that regard.

790
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,451
One says it was a strange illness,

791
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:56,369
CHO SHIN-WOO

792
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:01,040
and the other says it was the dan sedge.

793
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,878
Whom shall I trust?

794
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:40,579
Why did you try to kill me?

795
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:45,668
I am a physician who was exiled here

796
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:49,130
for killing the previous King.

797
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:50,756
So I do not know why you,

798
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,509
the adopted son
of the all-powerful Councilor Cho,

799
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:56,178
tried to kill me.

800
01:06:58,305 --> 01:07:00,016
Why did you?

801
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:01,392
Please, tell me.

802
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:09,859
Did Councilor Cho…

803
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:14,030
order you to do it?

804
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:24,123
Last time, you drew your sword

805
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,293
but you did not manage to cut me down.

806
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:32,673
Are you…

807
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:36,302
going to kill me now?

808
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:59,325
-Do you know this herb?
-My goodness!

809
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:01,911
If somebody used the dan sedge
on the previous King,

810
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:03,120
it must be revealed!

811
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:07,458
If you do that, then you will endanger
every single person in Sorak County.

812
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:10,961
Do you think it is a coincidence
that Eun-woo got hurt?

813
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:13,172
He might have sent another assassin.

814
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:14,256
It is my fault.

815
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,675
-I should have followed her.
-Why would you?

816
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:21,263
So a tiger cub has the evidence
to prove the King was poisoned?

817
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,682
If anybody hurts Eun-woo,

818
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:25,601
they will have to deal with me.

819
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:27,186
I could say the same thing.

820
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:32,274
