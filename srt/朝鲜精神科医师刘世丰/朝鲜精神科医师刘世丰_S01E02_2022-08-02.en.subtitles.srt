1
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,368
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:51,885
Hey.

3
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,673
Where are you going?

4
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,140
Darn, it is so hard
to make a living nowadays.

5
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:42,769
Come with me.

6
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,396
What happened now?
Did you cause trouble again?

7
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,857
I need you to hurry and place the needles.

8
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,150
The needles? What?

9
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,953
Where did you run off to?

10
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,624
Hurry. We are about to lose her.

11
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,417
Place a needle between her eyebrows.

12
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,503
You are all talk.

13
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,797
Shut it if you are
not going to do it yourself.

14
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,057
Who is she?

15
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,643
She is this family's daughter-in-law.
Please help her.

16
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,478
Will my lady be all right?

17
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,733
-Go and get the madam.
-What?

18
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,570
She and I need to talk
about this lady's treatment.

19
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,155
We need to discuss which medicine to use,

20
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,323
and how much she can afford
for the treatment.

21
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,242
Yes, sir.

22
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,334
She is the woman
you rescued from the lake, is she not?

23
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,294
The one who ran away.

24
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,771
How is my daughter-in-law?

25
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,732
She will live.

26
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:14,527
But we must use some medicine
to make sure the injury does not worsen.

27
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,990
Oh my goodness, Eun-woo.

28
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,993
Do you want to follow
your dead husband so badly?

29
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,038
You must move on from the dead.

30
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,332
Forget about my medicine.

31
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,959
Just do your best with her treatment.

32
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,210
I will pay handsomely.

33
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:36,466
Of course, we will use only the best herbs
to brew a tonic for the lady.

34
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,801
All right, please make sure
that she recovers.

35
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,220
Yes, madam.

36
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,139
-Bring what has been prepared.
-Yes, madam.

37
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,784
How kind of her.

38
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,578
The madam gave you this
to eat back at the infirmary.

39
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,080
And what is this?

40
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,957
It is a side dish made with ramps.

41
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,125
Please try some,
for it is this household's specialty.

42
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,752
Ramps?

43
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,510
Hold it steady.

44
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,136
It might leak.

45
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,015
What a great day.

46
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,435
Stop being nosy
about other people's business.

47
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,396
You cannot even take care of yourself.

48
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,480
What do you mean?

49
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:35,066
What I am saying is,
you need to stop looking so glum.

50
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,236
All you have as a physician
is your pretty face.

51
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,613
You cannot go around patients
looking so depressed.

52
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,366
I do not treat patients with my face.

53
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,410
You are an idiot who cannot place needles.

54
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,245
So you might as well use your face.

55
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,540
What?

56
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,417
Want to try placing one?

57
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,588
Just listen to what the patients
have to say.

58
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,049
Try to cheer up those who are furious too.

59
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,136
That will be your duty from now on.

60
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,056
Hey, you idiot.

61
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,518
You just thought
that I am a rambling alcoholic,

62
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,769
did you not?

63
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:16,274
You think nothing will be of use
since you cannot use your needles, right?

64
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,860
Just wait and see.

65
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:24,115
A patient's life might
depend on you doing as I say.

66
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,037
How nice.

67
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,510
A rope does not have to be up in the sky.

68
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,263
A rope does not always
have to be above everybody else.

69
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,858
I can hold that for you.

70
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,694
What are you doing? This is mine.

71
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,862
What?

72
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,907
No, I am not trying to steal it.

73
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,826
I am just trying to help, all right?

74
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,956
You know, I am really great
at doing the laundry.

75
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,084
-You wild boar.
-What?

76
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,920
Go away before I tell Poong
about what you did.

77
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,881
Poong? What do you mean?

78
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,007
Who is Poong?

79
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,843
You do not know who Poong is?

80
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,720
He is so handsome.

81
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,722
Poong!

82
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,190
-Welcome back.
-Hey there.

83
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,149
Poong!

84
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,486
Poong, you must be exhausted.

85
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,280
Poong? You were referring to him?

86
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,490
Yes, he is Poong.

87
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,164
What has gotten into him now?

88
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,000
My dad probably cussed him out again.

89
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,253
Dad, were you born
with a rag in your mouth?

90
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,089
Why are you always cursing at people?

91
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,590
How uncivilized of you.

92
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,301
I am also disappointed in you.

93
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,848
Stop it with the nonsense, all of you.

94
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,307
Just focus on preparing lunch.

95
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,352
When will Nam-hae be coming back?

96
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,021
At this rate, we will starve to death
before she comes.

97
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,189
Goodness gracious.

98
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,202
You will probably save a lot of people,

99
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,538
so please live, all right?

100
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,228
Did you do this on purpose?

101
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,023
How dare you make a scene
while the physicians were here?

102
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:05,818
Do you want everybody to think
that I am bullying a poor widow?

103
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,030
No, madam. That is not true.

104
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,366
Take her away and give her a good beating,

105
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,369
and lock Eun-woo in the storehouse.

106
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,789
Remove all sharp objects
so she cannot do anything stupid.

107
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,752
No, madam.

108
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,421
My lady will die
if you lock her in there again.

109
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,173
Forgive me, madam.

110
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,925
What are you waiting for?

111
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,176
Yes, madam.

112
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,178
No, madam! No!

113
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,639
I will go to the storehouse.
Please spare her.

114
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,516
Eun-woo.

115
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,060
It all depends on how well you do.

116
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,496
If you keep doing this,

117
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,332
then people will say
that you are being too harsh to Eun-woo.

118
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,085
Who on earth would say that?

119
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,880
Just ask anybody.

120
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,924
My daughter-in-law who made me lose my son

121
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,842
is embarrassing the entire family too.

122
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,512
Even if I told her to kill herself,
it would not be enough.

123
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:18,391
Mother, you still have me.

124
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:24,146
I am simply disappointed

125
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,066
that you failed the exam yet again.

126
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:32,321
I am sorry, Mother.
I should have done better.

127
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,699
Please do not say that.

128
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,994
It is not that easy
to become a government official.

129
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,258
I am sorry for what you went through
because of me.

130
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,386
Not at all. You are locked in here too.

131
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,232
Is she going to check
if I emptied the plates again?

132
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,610
Yes, my lady.

133
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,529
Perhaps she does not truly despise you,

134
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,491
since she gives you food
so that you do not starve.

135
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,120
Eun-woo.

136
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:38,638
Please drink this so you can live.

137
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,029
You need to eat well
if you want to get better.

138
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,073
I do not have anything to eat.

139
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,075
I am sick of eating tree bark now.

140
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,327
Do not starve for a month if you are sick.

141
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,246
Why did you not tell me about it?
Is your mouth for decoration?

142
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,123
Were you going to tell me after dying?

143
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,543
Hey, granny. Give Choong-sam
some more pearl barley.

144
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,463
I cannot even pay for the treatment.

145
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,590
Are you not used to this by now?
I am done talking. Go.

146
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,759
Come over here.

147
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,177
Let us go.

148
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,934
-Please treat me.
-Sir.

149
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,435
-Please help me.
-Mr. Gye.

150
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,688
Please take a look…

151
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,625
Young Master.

152
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,128
So…

153
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,673
You might want
to step outside for a little bit.

154
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,969
Mr. Gye says that he will extend
your contract and call the officers.

155
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,680
He is kicking up such a fuss.

156
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,601
In Hanyang, you went crazy
whenever you saw a patient.

157
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,187
You always caused a scene
by placing your needles

158
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,398
wherever you wanted,
like on a woman's chest.

159
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:16,902
So why are you being so stubborn
about not treating any patients?

160
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,529
-My head hurts!
-Please, sir.

161
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,704
What do you think you are doing?

162
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,414
Put me down.

163
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,832
What are you…

164
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,711
Your pulse feels fine.
Try eating some warm food--

165
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,671
Dad, you might want to see this.

166
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,804
INTERNAL INJURY, WOMEN

167
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,514
EXTERNAL INJURY, CHILDREN

168
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,893
Sir, please help me.

169
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,562
-Let me feel your pulse.
-Thank you.

170
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,939
May I take a look?

171
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,525
Next.

172
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,610
I have a stomachache.

173
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,111
MALE, 62 YEARS OLD…

174
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,201
This is so convenient.

175
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,953
He was being so stupid,
going back and forth like that.

176
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,872
What? Stupid?

177
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,708
That is what Ip-boon said.

178
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:18,088
-It is easier to package the medicine now.
-Jang-goon, you little…

179
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,134
You know, you have been insulting me
for a while now.

180
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,221
I mean, come on.
Physicians from Hanyang are just better.

181
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,265
He is handsome and skilled too.

182
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,726
His skin is practically glowing.

183
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,270
Hey, you idiot.

184
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,106
How are the patients supposed to read
the Chinese characters?

185
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,775
Stop being so pretentious.

186
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:41,111
Dad, stop yelling at Mr. Yoo.

187
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,906
We can just do this.

188
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,200
EXTERNAL INJURY

189
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,701
INTERNAL INJURY

190
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,911
EXTERNAL INJURY

191
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,288
Ip-boon, you have great drawing skills.

192
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,250
She cannot be useless
at everything she does.

193
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,253
INTERNAL INJURY

194
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,049
My back.

195
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:07,304
This is a medical record with
every patient's symptoms and treatments.

196
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,682
It will be easier if we know
a patient's medical history beforehand.

197
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,563
FEMALE, 62 YEARS OLD

198
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,566
And this is how much I made
by working today.

199
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,446
It will not take me that long
to make ten nyangs.

200
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,784
You need to factor
in your living costs as well.

201
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,581
You know how much that one eats, right?

202
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,670
Then I shall add
the patient visit fee from today.

203
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,463
Yes, you can do that all you want.

204
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,173
You will never make up
for how much he eats.

205
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,555
The barbarians are invading!

206
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,558
The barbarians are invading!

207
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,103
The barbarians are invading!

208
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,231
The barbarians are invading!

209
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,816
Darn it.

210
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,734
Granny!

211
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,194
Granny!

212
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,162
The barbarians are invading!

213
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,046
The barbarians are invading!

214
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,549
The barbarians. They are invading!

215
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,387
The barbarians are invading.
The barbarians…

216
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,599
The barbarians…

217
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,476
The barbarians are…

218
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,895
You could hurt yourself.

219
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,855
The barbarians are…

220
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,732
-She has lost it.
-My goodness.

221
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,652
Poong.

222
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,447
Hurry. You need to run.

223
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,574
The barbarians will come and catch you.

224
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,494
The barbarians returned to their homeland
in the year of the red cow.

225
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,871
No.

226
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,123
Evil always comes back.

227
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,708
I am scared.

228
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,465
Right, let us go back
and take a look at your hand.

229
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:08,968
Poong.

230
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,138
Your hands.

231
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,645
That was exhausting.

232
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,854
Come on, get on my back.

233
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:22,731
-No.
-What?

234
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,984
I am going with Poong.

235
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,193
My goodness.

236
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,946
Please get on my back.

237
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,750
I told you not to go anywhere.

238
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:49,383
I told you I will poke you
with a huge needle if you did that again.

239
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,386
She has dementia. Do not threaten her.

240
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,264
Then why not run from barbarians
with her every night?

241
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,311
That man is a prick.

242
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,897
Let me see your hand.

243
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,800
Poong, can you use a needle on me?

244
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,722
I can no longer

245
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,892
use my needles.

246
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,978
Why not? You are a physician.

247
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,273
Come on, put a needle right here.

248
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,778
You want me to place a needle there?

249
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,488
Does it hurt there?

250
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,159
Yes, it hurts right here.

251
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,588
It does not seem to be heart pain.

252
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,173
HEART PAIN: MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

253
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,968
I just feel bad, Poong.

254
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,724
What do you feel bad about?

255
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,104
I feel bad

256
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,648
because I came back

257
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,318
alive, my son.

258
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:53,090
The lady from Sari-gol did not finish this
because it was too bitter.

259
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,174
It would be a waste to throw it away.

260
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,015
That was brewed with poria cocos, right?

261
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,852
It is for people like Granny
who speak of strange things.

262
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,313
You put a lot of ginseng in there as well.

263
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,984
But the tonic given to the Sari-gol lady
was made from orange peels.

264
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,361
Stop jumping to conclusions.

265
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,280
You are too dumb to tell

266
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,907
what kind of tonic this is
by what it smells like.

267
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,242
Are you Dae Jang-geum?

268
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,286
-I was the top of my class--
-Whatever.

269
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,330
You can throw it out for all I care.
Throw it out.

270
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:49,229
It is the duty of a true nobleman
to be frugal and generous.

271
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,398
Therefore, one must wear simple clothing.

272
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,192
Eat.

273
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,236
Mr. Gye is determined
to make you work for one more day,

274
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,406
so you cannot make a mistake today.

275
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,366
-What?
-Look.

276
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,788
Did you wash your face
while reading again?

277
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,583
Just look at this.

278
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,836
Judging by how the water is clean,
you did not wash your face well.

279
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,882
Young Master, you really
do not have much right now.

280
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,967
Your family is gone and you are poor.

281
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,761
You were fired from the Royal Infirmary
and you cannot use needles.

282
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,848
But…

283
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,142
at least you still have
your handsome face.

284
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:32,814
That is you must take good care of it
before you lose it too.

285
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,567
Stop it. That is enough.

286
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,277
What? Hey!

287
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,531
I could be using that time to read books.

288
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,459
-Oh, my goodness.
-My gosh.

289
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,506
-He is so handsome.
-Look at him!

290
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,427
-He looks amazing.
-So handsome.

291
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,729
-How is he so good-looking?
-Goodness.

292
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,941
My goodness!

293
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,527
-Oh, my gosh!
-My heart!

294
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,660
You are feeling pain
in your stomach and heart.

295
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,329
How did you know?

296
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,330
It is abdominal discomfort.

297
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,499
Your sides are uncomfortable,

298
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,960
and your throat feels clogged.
So you cannot eat well.

299
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,045
Yes, that is right.

300
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,464
Have you been vomiting stomach acid?
Or does it hurt?

301
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,216
Well…

302
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:43,969
I see. It is heartburn.

303
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,512
It must have been hard.

304
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,931
How on earth did you know?

305
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,726
The heartburn has been
bothering me so much.

306
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,145
Then,

307
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,149
you will need licorice, not atractylodes.

308
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,567
It will be a bit bitter.

309
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,735
But…

310
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,112
why is your pulse beating so fast?

311
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,489
I do not think it is tachycardia.

312
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,116
TACHYCARDIA: AN ABNORMALLY FAST HEARTBEAT

313
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,703
Are you feeling pain anywhere else?

314
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,621
No, sir.

315
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,460
His face is the perfect medicine.

316
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,420
-You are right.
-Hey!

317
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:22,549
None of the patients who have seen
my young master's face have died yet.

318
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,968
-That is not what I--
-He is a perfect physician.

319
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,596
No, that is not what I meant.

320
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,556
His face is just so perfect…

321
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:30,891
Never mind.

322
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,518
-Wait--
-No, I do not!

323
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,147
What are you talking about?
I was going to ask about dinner.

324
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,400
Why are you asking about dinner
when you just ate lunch?

325
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,486
-You glutton.
-Hey, that is mean.

326
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,197
There is a patient here!

327
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,617
What happened?

328
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,826
My lady…

329
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,536
Something is wrong with her.

330
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,371
She was fine just a moment ago.

331
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,373
What are you waiting for? Bring her in.

332
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,631
What happened?

333
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:06,009
She was locked in the storehouse,
so I went to check on her, and…

334
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,136
She is a noblewoman.
Why would she be locked in?

335
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,304
The madam…

336
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:13,058
Please save poor Lady Eun-woo.

337
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,477
I need mung bean and black bean water.

338
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,479
She will have to drink it for a while,
so brew a lot.

339
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,396
All right.

340
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,233
What? You think she was poisoned?

341
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,776
Yes, I think so.

342
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,778
I am not yet sure
what kind of poison did this.

343
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,782
First she almost drowned,
and now she has been poisoned?

344
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,575
Did she drink or eat anything today?

345
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,411
The white rice porridge that I made,

346
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,747
and the tonic that you prescribed.

347
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:40,335
There is no way that she was poisoned.
She was locked in there the entire time.

348
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,338
Where is Eun-woo?

349
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:56,393
How dare you take her away?

350
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,815
There she is.

351
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,483
Take her back home immediately.

352
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,526
Yes, madam.

353
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,156
You cannot go in
without my young master's permission.

354
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,198
Who are you?

355
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,577
You will hurt yourself.

356
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,879
Do not worry about it.

357
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,047
There is nothing wrong.

358
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,508
She almost drowned, cut herself,
and was poisoned.

359
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,468
If she leaves right now, she will die.

360
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,679
Well,

361
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,265
I cannot let a noblewoman

362
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,559
lie in a place like this.

363
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,603
You should be the ones coming to her.

364
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,104
I shall take her home.

365
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,774
She could die if she leaves.
I cannot allow you to take her.

366
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,610
Who do you think you are?

367
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,279
He is a physician, of course.

368
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,825
When one is unconscious,
you must be careful with the needles.

369
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,077
I must perform moxibustion
about a hundred times

370
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,621
between her face and chest
for a chance of survival.

371
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,915
That will not be possible at your house.

372
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,958
She is part of my family now.

373
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,586
Even if she dies, she belongs to us.

374
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,589
What are you waiting for? Take her.

375
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,924
Yes, madam.

376
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,594
You evil wench!

377
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,846
My goodness.

378
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:16,723
Oh, my.

379
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,477
Oh, my.

380
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,605
How dare you touch me
with your dirty hands?

381
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,318
Calm down.

382
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,320
You should return to your house for today.

383
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:33,573
I must find out
what happened to Lady Eun-woo.

384
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,159
Do not think that this is over.

385
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,579
I will make sure that you are all punished

386
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,498
for disrespecting a noblewoman.

387
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:42,874
Let us go to the government officials.

388
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,292
Stop right there!

389
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:52,425
There are three things that you must
never mess with before I die,

390
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,135
but I guess you did not know.

391
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,138
I shall say it one more time,
so listen closely.

392
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,517
If you mess with my physicians,
my patients, or my family,

393
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,270
then you shall face my wrath.

394
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,437
Do you understand?

395
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:11,194
If a patient enters Gyesu Infirmary,
nobody can take them away

396
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,906
until they have fully recovered.

397
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,033
Not even the King could change my mind.

398
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,577
Only me, Gye Ji-han,

399
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,622
and that young physician right over there

400
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,458
can take in a patient or let them leave.

401
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:31,965
Do you really want to take this
to the government officials?

402
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,385
Madam! It was you!

403
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,012
My goodness.

404
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,513
My goodness.

405
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,265
We should go there right away…

406
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,936
If we go all the way
to the government office to argue,

407
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,023
then the entire village
will hear about it.

408
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,489
I am so sorry.

409
00:26:56,573 --> 00:27:00,118
The incident with your hair
was quite funny.

410
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,580
What should I do?

411
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,499
Should I call Chil-sung
from the government office?

412
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:10,712
Never mind.

413
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,674
I do not want
any unwanted rumors from this.

414
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,094
Let us go.

415
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,680
Take care, madam.

416
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,500
Drink the tonic. You will feel better.

417
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,463
At the very least, eat something.

418
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,430
Lady Eun-woo was poisoned.

419
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,021
That means she ingested poison.

420
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,485
I think somebody
might have given it to her.

421
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,614
Watch your tongue.

422
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,991
Who would dare to poison her in my house?

423
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:25,954
May I take a look at the tonic
that Lady Eun-woo drank?

424
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,998
Mr. Gye said to give her
the medication consistently

425
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,917
so her condition would not worsen.

426
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,710
I gave it to her today as well.

427
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,379
Allow me to take a look then.

428
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,091
Did you not use this pot

429
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,343
to brew the tonic for Lady Eun-woo?

430
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,428
Yes, madam.

431
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,264
And is this bowl the one you used
to give her the tonic?

432
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:48,351
Yes, sir. I did not get to wash it
because Lady Eun-woo collapsed.

433
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,979
So some of the tonic
should be left in there.

434
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,538
Are you happy now?

435
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,500
Act like a proper physician.

436
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,921
Watch your tongue from now on.

437
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,131
I apologize, madam.

438
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:21,551
I spent so much money and energy

439
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,345
brewing this tonic
for my widowed daughter-in-law,

440
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,973
and now you think I have poisoned her.

441
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,768
How ridiculous.

442
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,066
I think you should go back now.

443
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,403
Please take good care of Eun-woo.

444
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,656
Mother.

445
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,243
The madam is not in a good mood

446
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,913
because the young master
failed his exam again.

447
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,498
Please be understanding.

448
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,760
After I gave her an antidote
to clear her bloodstream,

449
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,678
her pulse returned to normal.

450
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,683
She has definitely been poisoned,
but nobody gave it to her.

451
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,269
What is going on here?

452
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,030
I am sorry.

453
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,200
I am so sorry. I will never do it again.

454
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,410
I am sorry.

455
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,830
It is fine.

456
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,999
It is because Lady Eun-woo
is sick, that is all.

457
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,335
Would you mind bringing me a new one?

458
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,011
What are you doing?
We are all trying to save you here.

459
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,972
I never asked you to.

460
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,058
Why do you keep trying to save me?

461
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,477
Then why did you save me
back on the cliff?

462
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,150
You must remember who I am.

463
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,324
No, I do not.

464
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:28,094
Goodness, somebody looks unhappy.

465
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:31,055
What? Did Lady Eun-woo reject you again?

466
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,977
It is cold outside.

467
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,687
Go inside if you are done drinking.

468
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,190
There is a right time for everything.

469
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:44,652
You think you can solve
anything, do you not?

470
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,446
Always blabbering about
being from the Royal Infirmary.

471
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:53,036
Just do not do anything for now.

472
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,371
You must let go of everything
to gain anything.

473
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,084
So just wait.

474
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,670
Give her some time,
and she will open up about herself.

475
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,214
I meant…

476
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,257
Dad.

477
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,175
Gosh!

478
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,927
Have you been drinking again?

479
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:14,098
Stop babbling in front of this refined,
sober young man and get inside!

480
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,141
What? "Refined"?

481
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,935
This guy? Unbelievable.

482
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,145
I have never seen an idiot like him.

483
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,189
He is the biggest idiot ever, all right?

484
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,776
GYESU INFIRMARY

485
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,287
Eun-woo.

486
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:37,789
Eun-woo.

487
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,290
Eun-woo.

488
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,668
-Eun-woo.
-Eun-woo.

489
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,754
Oh, dear. Eun-woo.

490
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,174
Magistrate Seo, what brings you here?

491
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,886
Is she your daughter?

492
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,055
Yes, she is.

493
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,599
What exactly is wrong with Eun-woo?

494
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,602
A number of things. She drowned--

495
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,313
I just had a bad cold.

496
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,356
Right, Mr. Yoo?

497
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,567
She almost died--

498
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,409
She will have to undergo
some careful treatment,

499
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,786
but you do not need to worry, madam.

500
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,998
Do not lie to me.
I know it was your mother-in-law.

501
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:24,168
I am not sending her back there.
She is going to stay with me.

502
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,837
What?

503
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,964
Mr. Gye, will you make a house call?

504
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:31,592
Of course I will.
Anything for your daughter.

505
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,137
Mr. Yoo here was in the Royal Infirmary.

506
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,348
He will visit her every three days
and treat her.

507
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,059
I will pay you even more than usual.

508
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,270
Please make sure that she gets better.

509
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,399
You must work very hard
to make sure that Lady Eun-woo recovers.

510
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:49,652
Go to the house every morning
and treat her.

511
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,906
Eun-woo belongs to another family now.

512
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,994
Can you not see the state she is in?
We are not sending her anywhere.

513
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,328
Even a year ago,

514
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,664
you were so anxious
to see her get married.

515
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:05,376
Now she has become a widow.

516
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,882
That evil woman
must have been so awful to her.

517
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,010
Still, the law--

518
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:17,764
Will you finally be satisfied
when she gets sick

519
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,265
or collapses again back there?

520
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,561
I will…

521
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,482
go back to my mother-in-law's house.

522
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,671
Wake up.

523
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,467
Mr. Yoo.

524
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,804
Yes.

525
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,726
-Mr. Gye.
-Right.

526
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,728
Consume hot food and beverages.

527
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:07,688
Take care.

528
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,652
That little…

529
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,445
What is he doing there?

530
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,613
Move!

531
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,573
Beom-sik, go up there.

532
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,784
Yes, Mr. Gye.

533
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,286
Granny, where are you going?

534
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,664
I am too busy for this.

535
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,833
Go after her
since you are not doing anything.

536
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:30,962
Hey, idiot.

537
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,967
Remember what I said yesterday?
Do not do anything for now.

538
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,510
Just wait.

539
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,096
Let her do whatever she wants,

540
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,764
and watch carefully.

541
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,852
Go on, quickly.

542
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,021
Poong.

543
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,194
Poong.

544
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,445
Poong.

545
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,505
A rabbit!

546
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:23,931
It is a rabbit.

547
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:18,861
Flowers…

548
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,995
Who are you?

549
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,165
I could ask you the same thing.

550
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,876
What are you doing in front of my house?

551
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:39,423
Is your name Poong, by any chance?

552
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,390
Is your mother…

553
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,435
She passed away a long time ago.

554
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,565
I am sorry.

555
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,209
This one is a pain reliever.

556
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,712
Wild ginseng. It gives you energy.

557
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,132
No matter which way I look at it,

558
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,092
they all look the same to me.

559
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,011
No! You cannot mix them up!

560
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,555
Hey, do not bully the kid.

561
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,473
Who? Me?

562
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,058
Yes, you are…

563
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:33,936
Young Master.

564
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,190
Look at how good Jang-goon
is at separating these.

565
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:44,613
Even the physicians at the palace
make mistakes while doing this.

566
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,781
Impressive, Jang-goon.

567
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:46,907
Right?

568
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,659
This is hard for you too, right?

569
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,577
Hey, idiot.

570
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:54,081
That wild ginseng is much more expensive
than the other one.

571
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,833
Do not dare mix them up.

572
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,668
If you do, I will add it to your debt.

573
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,130
He will not shut up about the debt.

574
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,467
Poong!

575
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,511
Poong.

576
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:12,016
Poong, where were you?

577
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,605
I was meeting my friends.

578
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,192
But your friends must be unhappy with you.

579
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,988
Why would Poong's friends
be unhappy with him?

580
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,950
Because I came back alive.

581
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:35,039
She passed away a long time ago.

582
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,208
I am sorry, Poong.

583
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,627
You must hate me, Poong.

584
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,420
You must be embarrassed by me.

585
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,093
Not at all.

586
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:51,389
I bet everyone would have preferred
if I had not returned.

587
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,642
I bet they would have been happier.

588
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:59,063
Same thing with your girlfriend.

589
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:03,025
Make sure your girlfriend
does not run away.

590
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,868
Why?

591
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:37,912
Just why?

592
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,248
Why do you keep trying

593
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,626
to save me?

594
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,086
Why?

595
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,842
I will not let you die,

596
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,345
because I am a physician.

597
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,180
Let me heal you, Lady Eun-woo.

598
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,849
I am not a patient.

599
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,102
Just look at me. I am completely fine.

600
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,979
Do I look like a patient to you?

601
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,690
Then what is the name of my illness?

602
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:14,365
If you do not even know that,
how are you planning on treating me?

603
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,867
Just,

604
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,328
just leave me alone!

605
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,664
Have you forgotten everything
that you have said to me?

606
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,250
I do not know what you are talking about.

607
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:27,378
There are things that you can only see,
hear, and feel

608
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,631
when you are alive.

609
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,592
You told me to stay alive,

610
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,052
that I must live.

611
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,557
That is what you said, did you not?

612
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,227
There are things
that you can only see, hear,

613
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,271
and feel when you are alive.

614
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,442
Do not break yourself.

615
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,530
You are not someone who breaks people.

616
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,448
You save people, do you not?

617
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,120
Do not break yourself.

618
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,665
You cannot do that to yourself

619
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,500
after saving my life.

620
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,017
I…

621
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,604
I have nowhere to go now.

622
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:31,191
If I stay with my parents,
then the law of this country will kill me.

623
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:35,279
But if I go to my mother-in-law's,
then they will kill me instead.

624
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:40,034
This was the only place
that I could think of.

625
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,000
It is not your fault, my lady.

626
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,170
I promise you

627
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,589
that it is not your fault.

628
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,510
You told me that I will save
a lot of people.

629
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,347
Will you give me a chance
to save you then?

630
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:07,645
I will find a reason for you to live.

631
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,497
Grandmother.

632
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,918
Hey.

633
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,044
You are here, Poong.

634
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:43,180
Please take care
of Lady Eun-woo for tonight.

635
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,316
Sure. I am glad you are all right.

636
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,199
You cannot sleep?

637
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:09,706
Do you want me to ask Poong
to place a needle on you?

638
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,172
Do you think that I am in pain too?

639
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,763
Where do you think it hurts?

640
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,059
It hurts right here, does it not?

641
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:34,314
That is why you need a needle right there.

642
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:40,154
If that bad woman comes back,
I will make her go away.

643
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,574
So I hope you recover.

644
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,624
You are so pretty.

645
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:56,170
Your husband is so lucky.

646
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,219
Do you know

647
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:10,309
when I first saw my husband's face?

648
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,467
My son!

649
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,934
I knew nothing about him when I wed him.

650
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,647
The first and last time
that I saw his face

651
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,943
was when he was lying in his coffin.

652
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,947
Then…

653
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,492
You have killed your husband.

654
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,538
My son is dead because of you.

655
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:16,542
There is a reason why they say
a bad wife can ruin the entire family.

656
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,794
This is all because of you!

657
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,464
You never once mourned for his loss.

658
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:26,593
You cold-hearted brat.

659
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,638
You should have died instead.

660
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:32,558
You should have died instead, you brat!

661
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:48,865
Eun-woo, it all depends
on how well you do.

662
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,118
You can hang yourself or slit your wrists,

663
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,372
but make sure
that you die for sure next time.

664
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,166
Maybe I really should have died.

665
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,838
If I am more helpful to my family
when I am dead,

666
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,842
then perhaps it will be better if I die.

667
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,805
Like you said,

668
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,435
Would a needle right here
make me feel better?

669
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,482
Why is everyone blaming me?

670
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:30,616
That woman is ill too.

671
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,203
Not here.

672
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,333
In her head.

673
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,125
Looks like I owe you

674
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,543
-Gosh!
-only two nyangs now.

675
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:28,048
Of course, since I am bringing you
so many patients nowadays.

676
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,301
No, this is your wage.

677
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,762
Let us see.

678
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:37,432
Since Man-bok ate
much more than anybody else.

679
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:40,602
You are saying that my debt
will just increase as I keep working.

680
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:44,064
I am supposed to work here forever
just because of a few nyangs?

681
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,774
That is basically a slave contract.

682
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,821
Hey, honestly speaking,

683
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,614
you cannot even use your needles.

684
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,492
Nobody else will hire you,
the way you are right now.

685
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:56,535
Jeez.

686
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:04,584
But not a lot of places
will let you treat patients

687
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,587
without using acupuncture,

688
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:11,341
especially when all you have
is your face and words.

689
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:15,429
No other infirmary will accept
an idiot physician like you.

690
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,890
Who knows?

691
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,435
If you stay here, you might become better

692
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,104
like that rope dancer.

693
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:34,614
Young Master, why do you look
so unhappy again?

694
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,700
Did Mr. Gye say something weird
to you again?

695
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:39,953
Just stop eating so much.

696
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:41,413
Are you eating rice cakes
before breakfast?

697
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,294
Why is he taking it out on me?

698
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,630
Rice cake tastes the best before a meal.

699
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,472
Tomorrow is the day!

700
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,515
I am so excited.

701
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,810
What are you talking about?

702
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,606
Tomorrow night,
there will be a Women's Market.

703
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,816
I bet there will be delicious food there.

704
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,069
But only women are allowed?

705
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:15,947
Why do not you eat other things?

706
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,532
Are you addicted to ramps?

707
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,619
Side dishes from a nobleman's family
taste the best.

708
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,372
How do you put up with him?
He eats like a cow.

709
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,087
Hey, that is perfect!

710
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,298
We will be the only ones here
during the Women's Market, right?

711
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:37,803
Jang-goon, can you teach me
how to tell those herbs apart?

712
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,638
I admired you doing that.

713
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,515
It is not that easy to learn.

714
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:42,557
What?

715
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:43,600
Moktong and banggi.

716
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:46,269
Korean angelica and gobon,
banha and cheonnamseong.

717
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:47,813
HERBS THAT LOOK SIMILAR BUT ARE DIFFERENT

718
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,189
There are too many.

719
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,608
Come on. Teach me.

720
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:56,112
-No, I cannot have them getting mixed up.
-I bet you can.

721
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,490
Gomchwi and kingcup,
atractylodes and scopolia rhizome.

722
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,951
You might end up killing a patient.
They will die.

723
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,583
They cannot get mixed up.

724
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:21,847
Yes. They cannot get mixed up.

725
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,024
So that is what happened.

726
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:54,838
You are working so hard by yourself.

727
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,631
You really need someone to help you.

728
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,633
Where is that young physician?

729
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,887
Did he run away already
because he got scared?

730
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:06,308
No, that brat is trying
to save a patient too.

731
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,351
Two patients, I guess.

732
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:14,190
How are you planning
on harming Lady Eun-woo this time?

733
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,402
Are we talking about this again?

734
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,037
Are these not ramps?

735
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:30,457
I sent those to your infirmary
some time ago.

736
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,791
Yes, you did.

737
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,002
You planned it out very carefully.

738
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:37,672
I cannot believe you sent the ramps
to Gyesu Infirmary too.

739
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:40,467
You almost fooled me
by giving me that delicious side dish.

740
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,267
Would you like to try this as well?

741
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,942
There was nothing wrong
with Lady Eun-woo's tonic.

742
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,903
However, while eating alone
in an outhouse,

743
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:03,031
ramps for her were switched
with something else.

744
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,283
This is…

745
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:10,080
not Alpine broad-leaf allium.
It is veratrum oxysepalum.

746
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,917
It looks like Alpine broad-leaf allium,
which is used for the side dish.

747
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,252
However, it is a poisonous plant
that can kill you.

748
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:24,928
Look.

749
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,889
In the past, hunters used to put
this plant on their arrowheads

750
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,391
to hunt animals.

751
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,144
What a meticulous plan, madam.

752
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:37,899
What do you want from me?

753
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:41,820
Since you have not reported me already,

754
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,905
I am guessing you want something.

755
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,866
Let Lady Eun-woo go.

756
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,787
Just consider her a dead woman,

757
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,747
which is what you wanted.

758
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,419
Is that it?

759
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,631
I am guessing that you have grown
rather fond of her--

760
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,091
By that,

761
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:07,470
I mean that I do not want you
to even speak of her again.

762
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,181
I have collected the veratrum oxysepalum
from her quarters.

763
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:13,018
I can report you
to the government office when I want,

764
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,270
so you better be careful.

765
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,732
Is there a reason

766
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,943
why you are trying to threaten me
with these foolish guesses?

767
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,904
What would I gain
from killing my daughter-in-law?

768
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,364
You would.

769
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,949
You would gain something.

770
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:30,285
You are planning
on bringing glory to your family.

771
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,454
What?

772
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:35,373
How would her death
bring glory to my family?

773
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:37,375
If your widowed daughter-in-law
kills herself,

774
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,461
you will get a virtuous
widow's memorial gate from the government.

775
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:42,630
Your unworthy son will get a position
as a government official. Am I wrong?

776
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,508
That is…

777
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,261
You will get a memorial gate
if Lady Eun-woo kills herself.

778
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:51,514
But if you murder her,
then forget about the memorial gate.

779
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,308
Your family will be destroyed.

780
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:58,813
Is that what you want?

781
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:01,566
All done.

782
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,401
All right, next.

783
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,820
Who is next?

784
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,411
A person who should not have lived.

785
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:16,956
Somebody who would
have helped everyone by dying.

786
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,295
No, you cannot wear red makeup.

787
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:23,546
They will call you crazy.

788
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,257
We shall look elegant today.

789
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,719
-Here, say "woo."
-"Woo."

790
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:35,100
You look so pretty, just like a new bride!

791
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,861
You look beautiful.

792
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,453
The girlfriend should go too.

793
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:58,373
Girlfriend? You are embarrassing me.

794
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,208
Go where? Am I going too?

795
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:06,840
We are going to look at the flowers.
You should come too.

796
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,050
I am fine.

797
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:12,846
No, you need to come.

798
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,407
You are so thin.

799
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,497
I will get you some wild ginseng
next time instead of berries.

800
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,958
Do not do this again.
That is all that I have to say.

801
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,464
That physician told me
to tell you in person.

802
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:37,388
Tell my mother to stop visiting me.

803
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,474
To us, she died in the last war.

804
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:42,685
We are getting by just fine without her.

805
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,858
Poong…

806
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,322
Do not ever

807
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,158
try to visit me again.

808
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,703
Please.

809
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:12,966
Just how much longer will you…

810
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,308
let other people's opinions
define who you are?

811
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:28,273
Are you really going to abandon that hand

812
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,276
that you never could hold onto properly?

813
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,531
"Live as if you have already died."

814
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,243
"Even if they are alive,
bury them in your heart."

815
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,289
Those are cowardly words from people

816
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:47,292
who did not manage to protect
this country or its people.

817
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,086
She is still alive.

818
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:52,088
She is still here.

819
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:55,466
She is still breathing.

820
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,429
Did you not ever miss her?

821
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:03,308
Do you not have anything
that you wanted to say to her?

822
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,561
Do you have any idea
how many people look down on me

823
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:09,063
because I am the son of a Returning Lady?

824
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,483
I am sorry, Poong.

825
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:15,570
I will never become
a government official now.

826
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:18,197
Why did you come back?

827
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,033
I wish you had just died instead.

828
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,176
Poong.

829
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:51,689
If you do not want berries
and wild ginseng,

830
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:53,983
then take this.

831
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:55,777
I kept this with me

832
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,696
so that I could give it to you
on your birthday.

833
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,742
I wanted to give you this
because I have never been able

834
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:06,537
to buy you some new clothes.

835
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:08,748
And…

836
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:13,127
I wanted to give this to you
when you went to school.

837
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:18,341
I wanted you to wear these
at your coming of age ceremony.

838
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:23,429
Did you get wed yet, Poong?

839
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:30,478
I wonder if this will fit.

840
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,446
Did you…

841
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:43,574
prepare this every year?

842
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:46,244
Your mother

843
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:48,496
has never taken that bag off of her back.

844
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,625
How could you…

845
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:57,130
Every single year…

846
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:02,969
My baby.

847
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:06,055
Do not cry.

848
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,933
I am sorry.

849
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:11,269
It is all my fault, so do not cry.

850
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:12,854
No.

851
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,232
I knew it was not your fault,

852
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:18,067
but I was so harsh to you

853
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,821
because I am

854
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,366
such a terrible son.

855
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:27,827
Mother.

856
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:33,374
Mother, please forgive me.

857
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,127
No.

858
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,840
I am sorry that I am a Returning Lady.

859
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:45,303
So do not cry, Poong.

860
01:02:55,772 --> 01:03:00,651
I am sorry, Mother.

861
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,973
You asked me
why I keep trying to save you.

862
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:38,523
I think it is
because I can see myself in you.

863
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,193
A year ago,

864
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:44,987
I thought I could do everything.

865
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:49,408
But I lost everything overnight

866
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:52,537
and almost killed myself.

867
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:54,497
However,

868
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,500
seeing Granny today
made me realize something.

869
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:01,045
I need to stay alive and wait.

870
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:07,844
If I die now, I will be remembered
as a disloyal subject to the king,

871
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:11,389
as well as a bad son, a bad friend,

872
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,433
and a cowardly physician.

873
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:23,025
Are you really all right

874
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,696
being remembered as you are right now?

875
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,119
Poong.

876
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:37,039
I look pretty, right?

877
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:43,212
Yes. You are prettier than any flower
that I have ever seen.

878
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:51,846
I guess she considers
Gyesu Infirmary her home,

879
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:54,891
son, and family.

880
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:59,103
Yes. I do not know
why she wants to go back there

881
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:01,105
instead of her son's enormous house.

882
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:05,776
Poong.

883
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:09,030
Poong.

884
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,449
Poong.

885
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:18,456
From now on, I shall go by Poong.

886
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,542
Yoo Se-poong.

887
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:25,171
Poong.

888
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,008
It is just a name.

889
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,261
I would change my name a hundred times

890
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,430
if it meant that I could help somebody.

891
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:39,685
Poong.

892
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:07,338
Are you really not going, Lady Eun-woo?

893
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:11,676
You can just pack afterward.

894
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,680
Go right back home
once you are done looking around.

895
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:17,181
I can pack by myself.

896
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:20,142
-Still.
-Do as I say.

897
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:22,520
Hurry up. We are leaving.

898
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:25,564
Go.

899
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:29,276
I will be right back.

900
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,462
Are you in there?

901
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,001
Look over there.

902
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:35,634
Do all women act like that?

903
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:42,433
We do not all act like that.

904
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:46,729
Anyway, I do not know if we will be able
to find Dan in this crowd.

905
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:49,065
Right.

906
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:52,234
If we do not have money,
we will not be able to buy anything.

907
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:55,613
She is not one to forget
bringing her money.

908
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,532
Is Lady Eun-woo not going?

909
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:00,034
She is going to pack.

910
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,248
Could I

911
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:08,793
borrow your money pouch?

912
01:08:09,376 --> 01:08:10,711
Why?

913
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:14,799
Let us look for her.

914
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,097
FORTUNE-TELLER

915
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:25,059
My goodness. Since you are both so pretty,

916
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:27,478
I will lower the fortune-telling fee
just for you.

917
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,897
Which one of you wants to go first?

918
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:35,611
Oh, dear.

919
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:37,571
Thank goodness that you are a woman.

920
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:41,242
If you were a man, you would have lost

921
01:08:41,325 --> 01:08:44,245
both your job and your money this year.

922
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:45,621
What?

923
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:47,706
Next year, you will meet
the love of your life

924
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,625
and live with him until the day you die.

925
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:51,877
Your husband will be very handsome.

926
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:57,508
My lady, you have
a great future ahead of you.

927
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:03,681
My lady, what about this pendant?

928
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:05,015
It will look good on you.

929
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,018
Here is a hairpin.

930
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:09,979
This looks great on you.

931
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:17,361
Let us look at the next one.

932
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:28,247
It is delicious.

933
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:40,217
Here, let us try it too.

934
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:41,802
You want to go on the swing?

935
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:43,888
I do not really…

936
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,557
No, I want to go on the swing.

937
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,350
I have always wanted to try it.

938
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:51,687
When will I ever get to try it,
if not today?

939
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:01,697
What are you doing?

940
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:04,992
You need to push me.

941
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:51,247
I cannot believe only women were allowed
to do something this fun.

942
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,049
You know, you smiled a lot today.

943
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:47,678
You should smile more.

944
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:51,515
When you are not smiling,
you look like you are angry.

945
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:13,579
Eun-woo.

946
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,208
Shin-woo.

947
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:47,529
Find a man named Yoo Se-yeop.

948
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:49,990
I need you to find somebody for me.
Yoo Se-yeop.

949
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:52,201
He just needs a well-placed needle.
How long will this take?

950
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:53,702
Move aside!

951
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:57,164
From now on,
I am going to treat all of my patients,

952
01:12:57,247 --> 01:12:59,166
even if I have to use
every medical text that I know.

953
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:01,335
I heard that the Nine-Tailed Fox
reappeared last night.

954
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:02,544
Please be careful.

955
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:05,172
There has been another murder.

956
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:06,590
Before I got married,

957
01:13:06,673 --> 01:13:08,592
I helped the government office
with autopsies.

958
01:13:08,675 --> 01:13:10,386
Then you worked directly with the corpses…

959
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,262
Do you not think there was a motive?

960
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:16,892
Did you hear that?

961
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:24,149
