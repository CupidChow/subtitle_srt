1
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,368
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,040
I will apologize for tonight, then.

3
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,669
Well, if you ever feel sick,
feel free to--

4
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,430
I did not do anything, sir.

5
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,100
People say that you are a bold man.

6
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,311
And they are right.

7
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,320
Yoo Hoo-myung and Shin Gwi-soo.

8
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,696
They were both students
of Jeon Gyu-hyeong,

9
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,074
the master of poisonous plants
who wrote the Haedong Book of Herbs.

10
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,582
All of the books were burned
after Gyu-hyeong died.

11
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:25,919
But I heard that

12
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,713
you used to be
one of Gyu-hyeong's students as well.

13
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,553
If you know anything about this,
bring me the answer to my question,

14
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:40,350
unless you wish to face
the same fate that killed your teacher.

15
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,755
You knew my father?

16
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:16,136
Are you sneaking around
and eavesdropping now, you idiot?

17
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,390
That is nothing to be proud of.

18
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,392
I know what I heard.

19
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,477
You learned under the same teacher
as my father.

20
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,895
Learn under the same teacher?

21
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,107
Me, with the noble Minister Yoo?

22
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,733
Be straightforward with me.

23
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,322
Have you known my identity all along?

24
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,117
Yes, I did.

25
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,161
It is the hottest gossip in Hanyang.

26
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,330
Hoo-myung's sudden death,

27
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,375
and how you killed the King.

28
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,628
If you knew,

29
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,256
then why did you not say anything?

30
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,925
Are you saying we should have
held hands like best friends

31
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,261
and had a little heart-to-heart
about your past?

32
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,808
You should be happy that I let you
stay here and work as a physician.

33
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,730
Then what does the inspector
want with you?

34
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,565
Do not ask me.

35
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,318
He just barged in here
and talked nonsense.

36
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,111
How am I to understand what he meant?

37
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,989
I am asking
because my father may have been involved.

38
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,240
That is enough!

39
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,369
From now on,

40
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,622
do not talk to me about your father

41
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,999
or Hanyang ever again.

42
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,251
It makes me sick.

43
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,253
If I hear another word about this,

44
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,589
you are out of here.

45
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,843
Do you understand? Then go to sleep.

46
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,484
Yoo Hoo-myung and Shin Gwi-soo.

47
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,528
They were both students
of Jeon Gyu-hyeong,

48
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,697
the master of poisonous plants
who wrote the Haedong Book of Herbs.

49
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,409
So this book

50
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,706
has something to do with my father?

51
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,045
Sir…

52
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,990
-Ip-boon.
-Yes?

53
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,825
What about it?

54
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,037
Mr. Gye told you to look
for the expensive ones.

55
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,956
Rumex japonicus is used to stop bleeding.

56
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,791
For treating nosebleeds or hemoptysis.

57
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,501
Dry the roots in the sun to use.

58
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,295
We should stock up
on the herbs that stop bleeding.

59
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,756
You never know
when you will get injured patients.

60
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,965
My goodness.

61
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,092
You have grown up, Ip-boon.

62
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,386
Who do you think I am?

63
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,602
Man-bok.

64
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,937
-Snake.
-What?

65
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,399
That looks like an Amur viper.

66
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,111
Stop messing with me.
I am dying from the heat already.

67
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,323
If you get bitten,
you will die before you take seven steps.

68
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,365
What?

69
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,328
Jang-goon.

70
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:13,581
It is not cool to mess with me like that.

71
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,960
Do not move, Man-bok.

72
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,879
Seriously, Young Master? You too?

73
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,799
I know I might not look like it,

74
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,009
but I am really pretty smart
about these things…

75
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,803
What is this?

76
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,314
Do not look at me!

77
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,732
Just throw it.

78
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,734
I cannot.

79
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,153
I cannot move my hand.

80
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,532
Then, just hold onto it.

81
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,242
Hold onto it.

82
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,244
If you cannot stare down a snake,
you will get bitten by it.

83
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,787
Look straight into its eyes.

84
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,774
The snake is going that way.

85
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,360
-Be careful, my lady.
-Where?

86
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,785
You stupid snake!

87
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,787
What?

88
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,998
You stupid little snake! Go away.

89
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,667
Man-bok.

90
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,675
Did you wash it well?

91
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,136
My goodness, Dad!

92
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,389
What is going on?

93
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,434
-What?
-He was bitten by a venomous snake.

94
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,435
What?

95
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,520
It was an Amur viper.

96
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,647
I am cold…

97
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,654
Mr. Gye.

98
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,700
I think Myeong-wol drank herself sick.

99
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,160
Really?

100
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,831
What about Man-bok?

101
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,209
He will be fine.

102
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,586
Do you have any idea
how rich Myeong-wol is?

103
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,795
-Let us go.
-All right.

104
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:32,094
How heartless. All he cares about
is his money!

105
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,846
Unbelievable.

106
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,807
I am embarrassed to call him my father.

107
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,852
No, Man-bok.

108
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,812
He is going to die now.

109
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,149
-I will perform acupuncture on him.
-All right. Here.

110
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,028
Se-yeop.

111
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,740
What?

112
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,576
I am dying. It is hard
for me to speak politely.

113
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,540
Since I am older than you,
let me say a few words.

114
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,751
Your life is awesome.

115
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,962
You are handsome,

116
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,506
you are a nobleman,

117
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,343
and you are so popular with women.

118
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,059
Even Lady Eun-woo likes you.

119
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,605
If I get reincarnated,

120
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,607
I definitely want to live as you.

121
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,821
But…

122
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,948
You really…

123
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,285
should learn some tact, you idiot.

124
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,537
Thanks…

125
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,956
For everything…

126
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,171
Oh, my.

127
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,508
Man-bok.

128
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,219
-Man-bok.
-Man-bok.

129
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,470
Man-bok.

130
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,729
It is a rat snake.
Kids play with them all the time.

131
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,689
It is not venomous.

132
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,651
Here.

133
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,490
So it is just a rat snake?

134
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,284
It is just a rat snake.

135
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,872
Why was I so out of breath, then?

136
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,053
What? Where is Myeong-wol?

137
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,057
Have a seat.
I called you over for a drink.

138
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,392
What the…

139
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,644
You see, I have something

140
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,313
to talk to Ip-boon about.

141
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,121
Here, have a drink.

142
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,292
Let us see. How long has it been
since we last drank like this?

143
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,170
It has definitely been
more than ten years,

144
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,047
but not quite twenty.

145
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,591
Cut the nonsense.

146
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,468
What do you want?

147
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,930
And you have still got
that fiery temper of yours.

148
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,773
You have no idea how hard it was
to dig this one up.

149
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,412
It is a debt acknowledgment form.

150
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,624
Remember the 50 nyangs
that Gyeong-sook borrowed from me?

151
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,252
If you ever say her name again,

152
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:56,298
I will rip your mouth open.

153
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:57,883
Gosh.

154
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,179
Can I call her "Ip-boon's mother," then?

155
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,389
Shut your mouth!

156
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,645
You still have not forgotten?

157
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,320
What a waste of food.

158
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,491
Why are you giving this to me now?

159
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,535
You need to pay me back since she is gone.

160
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,872
If you add up all the interest,
the debt is over a thousand nyangs now.

161
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,624
Of course you do not have the money.

162
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,542
Well, then.

163
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,004
Let me have Gyesu Infirmary.

164
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,798
Then I will consider your debt repaid.

165
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,052
Have you gone senile?

166
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,681
Gyeong-sook asked you
to raise Ip-boon, did she not?

167
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,600
So, you need to pay me back.

168
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,103
I could go find Ip-boon right now.

169
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,105
Do not underestimate this form.

170
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,446
If I take this
to the government officials,

171
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,199
I could even sell Ip-boon
for a good price.

172
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,493
My goodness.

173
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,995
Is it fine if she knows, though?

174
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,623
I mean, her mother died

175
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,790
because of you,

176
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,920
the useless physician and crazy murderer.

177
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,007
Now, give me Gyesu Infirmary.

178
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,259
If you do not,

179
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,345
I am going to go find Ip-boon right away.

180
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,517
I can see you hesitating.

181
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,313
Want me to go tell her all about

182
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,484
how she is not your real daughter?

183
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,737
Shut your mouth!

184
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,622
That prick.

185
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,585
Here.

186
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,175
What is this?

187
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,343
Yam extract.

188
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,596
Could you not have told us
that it was a rat snake?

189
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,598
We all thought Man-bok was going to die.

190
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,141
Here, drink it.

191
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,519
I made this for you with love

192
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,105
so that you can start eating better.

193
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,281
Jeez.

194
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,302
Hey.

195
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,554
Wake up.

196
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,018
Come on, wake up.

197
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,021
No.

198
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,238
No!

199
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,384
Well…

200
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,136
Do not think too much

201
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,973
about what Man-bok said earlier.

202
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,225
You know,

203
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,646
people say all sorts of things
when they are about to die.

204
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,816
It is fine. I understand.

205
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,027
Getting insulted is
not really that big of a deal.

206
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,575
Did you not get offended
when he said that to you?

207
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,619
"Learn some tact."

208
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,914
I heard that countless times
in the Royal Infirmary.

209
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,627
They always told me that
after I used my skills to treat a patient.

210
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,006
So I do not mind it.

211
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,510
Hey, stop!

212
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,055
She is going in there again.

213
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,058
Seriously?

214
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,686
Somebody grab her.

215
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,944
Come on, please!

216
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,616
Stop it!

217
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:16,910
Yoo-jung?

218
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,829
Do you know her?

219
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,122
-Stop it.
-Yes, I do.

220
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:35,637
Put her down.

221
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,639
-Lay her down on the ground.
-All right.

222
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,061
What is going on?

223
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,146
Whenever she sees water,
she jumps into it.

224
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,231
It is like she was bitten by a rabid dog.

225
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,525
Rabies?

226
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,319
Did she ever do this before?

227
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,489
We just fished her out of a gorge,
but she just jumped in again.

228
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,784
I will place needles…

229
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,331
-Please perform acupuncture on her.
-Yes.

230
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,833
It is daereung and sinmun.

231
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,628
Daereung of Pericardium Meridian.

232
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,144
Arson?

233
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,522
What did she set on fire?

234
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,858
She threw a burning piece of firewood
on top of somebody's house.

235
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,944
The house belonged to a single woman.

236
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,864
Her mother-in-law saw her leaving
with the firewood.

237
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,283
There is no way…

238
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,411
Is there bad blood
between her and that woman?

239
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,540
No. They do not even know each other.

240
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,876
How do you know the woman
who committed arson?

241
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,963
Do you know the bookstore
that I used to go to?

242
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:54,049
The biggest one in the village?
She is the only daughter of that family.

243
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,051
The bookstore?

244
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,887
They ran a store
that sold various items as well.

245
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,806
I thought they were a powerful family.

246
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,893
Yoo-jung used to bring me
a lot of wonderful books.

247
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,981
I heard they married her off
to a poor noble family

248
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,399
with a generous wedding gift.

249
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,570
Maybe she set the house on fire
because of an illness.

250
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,990
Do you really think it is rabies?

251
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,491
She is drawn to water.

252
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,082
Did I not tell you to bring back
only the expensive ones?

253
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,585
Who dug these up?
They are such a hassle to prepare.

254
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,212
They are good for nosebleeds
and hemoptysis.

255
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,797
I know that, obviously.

256
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,716
Patients with external injuries
do not make us money.

257
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,177
You are a potty mouth
who only cares about money.

258
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,681
That is what Ip-boon said.

259
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,766
My goodness.

260
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,185
Jeez!

261
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,271
Mr. Gye.
I heard you put this place up for sale.

262
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,191
Are you moving your infirmary
somewhere else?

263
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,610
Feel free to look around. Take your time.

264
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,654
This is a great location with nice energy.

265
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,324
Are we selling our house?

266
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,035
Hey, you cannot sell my house
without my consent.

267
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,537
How can you lie
like this as a real estate agent?

268
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,081
I am not lying.

269
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,375
Mr. Im said that Gyesu Infirmary
is up for sale.

270
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,127
Soon-man does not own this place.

271
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,629
I do!

272
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,130
Get lost!

273
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,301
That was completely unnecessary!

274
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,137
Why did you throw water at us? Let us go.

275
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,056
Good work, Granny.

276
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:35,567
Why did you buy so much?
Do we have a memorial ceremony?

277
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,402
We have so many mouths to feed.

278
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,737
This is what I usually get.

279
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,490
You will end up spending
all of our money on food.

280
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,244
From now on,
just eat some herbs with soy sauce!

281
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,496
Darn it.

282
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,414
What has gotten into him?

283
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,169
Gosh.

284
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,010
You can eat all by yourself today.

285
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,639
I do not think I will be able to
digest my food

286
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,890
if you sit with us.

287
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,571
Come on, let us eat.

288
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:36,962
What?

289
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,589
We are eating herbs because you said so.

290
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:44,094
You should not mess with people
while they are eating.

291
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,644
I think I have indigestion already.

292
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:01,153
Ipchun, woosu, gyeongchip, chunbun,
chungmyeong, goku, ipha, soman.

293
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,572
-Jang-goon.
-Hold on.

294
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,891
Do you think I’m an idiot?

295
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,693
Yoo-jung.

296
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,906
Remember me? I am Eun-woo.

297
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,617
I missed you.

298
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,368
Why did you never write?

299
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,920
Did you really set
a stranger's house on fire?

300
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,589
I do not believe it.

301
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,800
You did not, right?

302
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,184
Yoo-jung, what are you doing?

303
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,187
Yoo-jung, stop it.

304
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,153
Water.

305
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,781
Water.

306
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,158
Water.

307
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,286
Why is she acting like that?

308
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,040
It is because she has too much
anger and frustration in her heart.

309
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,544
Do you think that is because
of her in-laws?

310
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,004
Let us see for ourselves.

311
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:52,013
Yoo-jung obviously set that house on fire.
There is nothing to see here.

312
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,183
If Mr. Seo was here,

313
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,853
then his officers would have
messed up the entire place.

314
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,230
I never knew what she was thinking.

315
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,274
She was always zoning out
and acting stupid.

316
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,902
How dare she burn down somebody's house?

317
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,532
But Yoo-jung was an outspoken person

318
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,576
who always said what she wanted to say.

319
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,844
Did she have a child?

320
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,139
The child died of an illness.
She brought so much bad luck with her.

321
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,184
I should have picked out
a better daughter-in-law.

322
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,357
You do not wear
mourning clothes for your child's death.

323
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,317
But Yoo-jung was wearing a white dress.

324
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,612
Do you think she had so much anger
in her heart

325
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,072
because she was grieving?

326
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,784
Her room looked like a servant's quarters.

327
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,786
But all of the other rooms

328
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,538
had hwacho cabinets and silk geum-chims.

329
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,960
Yoo-jung was such a bright person
before she got married.

330
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,878
I thought she would become happy.

331
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,255
It is not too late yet.

332
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,340
If we treat her anger syndrome
by finding the cause,

333
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,259
and take care of the arson issue,

334
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,718
she can become happy.

335
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,474
Come and make some money.

336
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,143
Find the cup with the marble,
and double the money.

337
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,812
Double it.

338
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,524
Double it.

339
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,442
-Here.
-I will try it.

340
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:13,530
Double it.

341
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,122
Yay!

342
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:25,125
Jang-goon, it is your money now!

343
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:28,503
You can never fool Jang-goon.

344
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,929
What do you think you are doing?

345
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,681
You asked a child to earn you money?

346
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,308
I never asked him to do it.

347
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:44,019
I said I would kick him out
if he wasted my money.

348
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,312
That is the same thing.

349
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,397
As an adult, have you no shame?

350
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,024
Hey!

351
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,276
Do you know the cost of food?

352
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,864
Jang-goon needs to know how to earn money.
I will not raise him like some flower.

353
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,784
We need to be more frugal from now on.

354
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,119
I do not care who you are.

355
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,498
Did you lose the house
to a loan shark or something?

356
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,637
You cannot hide your dirty blood.

357
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,893
How dare you set fire
to a house that I was in?

358
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,729
Obviously you know nothing
about the teachings of Confucius.

359
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,564
You have absolutely no virtue.

360
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:36,279
Are you even listening to me?

361
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:41,534
Unbelievable.

362
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,134
Open the door.

363
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,844
Again?

364
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,304
Lady Eun-woo.

365
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:09,437
Yoo-jung, do you recognize me?

366
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,285
You must have suffered so much
after losing your daughter like that.

367
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,003
Yoo-jung.

368
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,047
Yoo-jung.

369
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,468
Seriously?

370
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,351
Stop it. Yoo-jung, stop it.

371
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,103
Please stop it.

372
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,356
Stop it.

373
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,360
It is hot.

374
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:59,446
It is so hot.

375
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:27,515
No.

376
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,727
What if she runs away?
Who will be responsible then?

377
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,395
But because of her illness,

378
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,564
she cannot stand trial
in her current state.

379
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:40,236
Why are you always begging me
to release the prisoners?

380
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,363
On top of that,

381
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,950
are you really so good
that you can cure that "anger syndrome"

382
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:46,910
in just four days?

383
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,453
Yes, I am.

384
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,000
Of course he is.

385
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,960
He is the best physician in Joseon.

386
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,641
What is the problem here?

387
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:12,727
I will treat her, and I will pay
for her treatment with my labor.

388
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,063
Anger syndrome is not easy to treat.

389
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,065
Who will pay for her while she stays here?

390
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,192
We are having a hard time
feeding ourselves.

391
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,903
She lost her daughter, Mr. Gye.

392
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,616
We need to find out what happened to her,
and if she was framed by any chance.

393
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:31,955
Then you can

394
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,333
eat less.

395
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,295
Tell Man-bok to eat less too.

396
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,882
I will tell Man-bok to eat
only two bowls of rice, then.

397
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:48,012
Tell Lady Eun-woo
to only eat one bowl too.

398
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:52,809
Here.

399
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,896
I heard that the inspector
gave this to us.

400
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,150
Yes. He helped out
when I was framed last time too.

401
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,529
He seems like such a nice guy.

402
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,740
He is great with his sword too.

403
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,994
No, his face is the best part.

404
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,996
The handsome guys always carry a sword.

405
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,998
Come on, Granny.

406
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:19,711
By the way, Lady Eun-woo,

407
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,046
you have known him for a long time, right?

408
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,215
Honestly, you two would
make the cutest couple.

409
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,385
You should have just married him.

410
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,396
Young Master.

411
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,940
You are eating again?
I thought you just ate.

412
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,776
Oh, dear.

413
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,363
Are you jealous, Poong?

414
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,115
You are all grown up now.

415
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,076
I think

416
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,537
that you have gotten too fat
because of overeating.

417
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,915
You may suffer a stroke.

418
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,876
Starting tomorrow, only eat
one bowl of rice at a time.

419
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,296
One bowl? That is a bit harsh.

420
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,054
Oh, gosh!

421
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:28,279
When you feel depressed
because of worry or anger,

422
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,490
your energy flows in reverse
and make you ill.

423
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,325
So, which one is it?

424
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,328
Worry, or anger?

425
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,251
Anger, then.

426
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,797
We will perform moxibustion
on taechung and gwanwon a hundred times.

427
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:35,722
Goodness.

428
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,029
My goodness!

429
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,575
What are you doing at this hour?

430
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,745
Would you like some water?

431
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,541
Where are you going?

432
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,792
Are you all right?

433
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,638
My goodness.

434
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,641
You never improve

435
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,103
because you always have
your nose buried in these boring books.

436
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,731
You are stubborn and annoying,
just like your father.

437
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,944
Where else am I supposed
to look for a treatment?

438
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:36,074
A physician should have already
mastered all of the medical texts.

439
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,408
As a physician,

440
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,411
you need to read some books
that feel more human

441
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,580
in order to deduce the causes

442
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,248
of your patients' illnesses.

443
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,375
Is that why you read books with stories?

444
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,711
All right.

445
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,006
Look. Anything is possible in a story.

446
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,342
The characters cross
the rivers of the underworld,

447
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,303
and even meet people who are dead.

448
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,692
Go and see your daughter.

449
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,201
This is the underworld.

450
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,703
In the old stories,

451
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:26,374
they say that you can meet people
who are dead in the underworld.

452
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,169
"If you dig a hole in the ground,
spring water will come out."

453
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,546
"That is the underworld."

454
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,843
So just think of this place
as the underworld.

455
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:44,767
Yoo-jung, please just try this for us.

456
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,103
Believe that your daughter is there.

457
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,130
Seol.

458
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,237
Seol.

459
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,449
My daughter.

460
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,388
We will help you lessen

461
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,016
the anger buried in your heart.

462
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,186
Yes. You can tell us anything, Yoo-jung.

463
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,575
My daughter died

464
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,413
because of me.

465
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,209
I am in the upper middle class.

466
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,504
My father wanted
to marry me off to a nobleman,

467
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,632
so he made me marry
into a poor noble family

468
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,177
and gave me the dowry
and the house I am living in.

469
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,721
But I was always lonely

470
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,182
in that house.

471
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:17,313
Are you seriously taking a break?

472
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,649
As a woman in a noble family,

473
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:25,196
you should be doing
everything you can to make money!

474
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,782
It is obvious that you are lowly.

475
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:31,410
I have to teach you everything.

476
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,370
Darn it.

477
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,415
But I finally got a companion

478
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,876
after I gave birth to my daughter.

479
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:39,794
Mom.

480
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,253
Yes?

481
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,715
I am cold.

482
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,928
Just take some more medication, all right?

483
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,891
Lord Im sent somebody for you.

484
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,893
If you promised to help them out,

485
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:58,354
then you must keep your word.

486
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,149
I cannot leave when Seol is so sick.

487
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,442
She is our daughter.

488
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:07,780
Well, I will take care of her.

489
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,366
Go on.

490
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:15,204
Make sure to take good care of Seol, then.

491
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,497
Hey.

492
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,500
How dare you tell your husband what to do?

493
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,505
I will be back, Seol.

494
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,469
Do not go, Mom.

495
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,514
Come on, hurry up and go.

496
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,810
I will be right back.

497
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,022
Unbelievable.

498
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,195
Seol.

499
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,573
Look.

500
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,284
It is the hairbrush that you wanted.

501
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:10,926
S-Seol?

502
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,055
Seol.

503
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:17,933
Seol, wake up.

504
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,979
Seol.

505
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,816
Seol, no! Seol!

506
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,196
Seol, wake up!

507
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,614
Mommy is here, Seol. I am here.

508
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,200
Seol.

509
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,284
I killed her.

510
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,662
She suffered so much before she died

511
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,748
because I am not a noblewoman.

512
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,886
Even after Seol died,

513
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,390
my husband and mother-in-law did not care.

514
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,187
I think that is when I started

515
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,899
to feel an everlasting fire
burning in my heart.

516
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:11,570
Once, I looked into the furnace
while making dinner.

517
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,573
It suddenly made me so angry.

518
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,912
So I picked up a piece
of burning firewood.

519
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,790
Then I just kept on walking.

520
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,961
I do not remember anything after that.

521
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,969
Where did you send people
to look for your husband

522
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,595
after your daughter died?

523
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,933
Where do you think it is?

524
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,229
How dare you set fire
to a house that I was in?

525
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:59,410
Hello. We are physicians.
We heard that there was a fire here,

526
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,912
so we wanted to make sure
that you are all right.

527
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,206
We are from the government office.

528
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,294
Thank the gods that the fire
went out quickly. I almost died.

529
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,255
I cannot believe that crazy woman
set fire to my house.

530
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:15,259
By the way, will the government
office send me any medicine?

531
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,764
I thought you lived alone.
Is there somebody else in there?

532
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,726
What is it to you?

533
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,979
I just said that because
I did not want any rumors to spread.

534
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,273
Well, if your husband
inhaled any smoke as well,

535
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,442
you might both need some medication.

536
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,902
Yes, we did! We inhaled a lot of it!

537
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:38,282
Do you know the woman
who set fire to your house?

538
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:40,659
No, not at all.

539
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,170
What brings you back here?

540
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,381
I left my needles here last time.

541
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,343
They are very precious.
Would you like to take a look?

542
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,219
Mr. Yoo got this from the king

543
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,929
when he passed
the medical exam with honors.

544
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:05,392
These needles can cure
any kind of illness.

545
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,144
Right, Mr. Yoo?

546
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,399
Yes.

547
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,902
Is that so? Well, come on in.

548
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:42,930
She has indigestion because
she gorged herself on delicacies.

549
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,438
Well, what do you think?

550
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,275
You have indigestion, madam.

551
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,319
You have had it for a while.

552
00:44:58,862 --> 00:44:59,738
That is right.

553
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:03,033
I think it is because
those beef ribs were too oily.

554
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,411
Beef ribs, madam?

555
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,704
I need to eat rice with meat.

556
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,457
Is there a medication that could

557
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,502
make meat easier to digest?

558
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:21,635
I think we will have to use
the royal needles.

559
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,389
The royal needles?

560
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,390
Yes, madam.

561
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,062
To make the oil from the beef
easier to digest,

562
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,856
I will place needles
on the bottoms of your feet.

563
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,023
Sure.

564
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,197
Please hurry.
My stomach feels uncomfortable.

565
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,574
Yes, madam.

566
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,840
It will be over soon, madam.

567
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,433
It will be over soon.

568
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,277
I am sorry about that.

569
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,322
She was living luxuriously
with Yoo-jung's money.

570
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,698
So it made me very angry.

571
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,951
She must be worried
because Yoo-jung was arrested.

572
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,996
Yongcheon will help her
feel better for sure.

573
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,289
You did well.

574
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:33,665
YONGCHEON: AN ACUPUNCTURE POINT
THAT AIDS DIGESTION AND SLEEP

575
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,585
You should have put some needles
in tonggok and taechung too.

576
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:40,422
Why did you want to go back
to that house, though?

577
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,301
I do not think that

578
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,553
Yoo-jung set fire to that house.

579
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,228
Did you really set fire
to that house, Yoo-jung?

580
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,981
I saw the firewood at that house…

581
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,066
I did it.

582
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,401
What?

583
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,821
I probably could not contain my anger

584
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,782
because I am from a lowly background.

585
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,745
I am not a noblewoman
like Eun-woo, after all.

586
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,047
What are you thinking about?

587
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,050
Come on, you can tell me.

588
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:26,802
It is fine.

589
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:29,179
Seriously, I can give you
some romantic advice

590
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,098
or make a love confession for you.

591
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,225
Move over a bit.

592
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,810
-Come on.
-What?

593
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,022
Why are you putting down so many blankets?

594
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,774
Oh, dear.

595
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:45,362
Do you not know how bad
your sleeping habits are?

596
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,322
You roll around from here,

597
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:48,782
to there.

598
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,828
You snore and grind your teeth too.

599
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:53,954
Who, me?

600
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,581
That is not true.

601
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,208
I lie down completely straight,

602
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:01,086
and wake up exactly the way I went to bed.

603
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:02,629
Oh, dear.

604
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:08,510
You only think that because

605
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,095
you go back in the morning

606
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:13,140
after rolling around all over
the place during the night.

607
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:17,227
Do you not want to admit it
because you are a nobleman?

608
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,856
Being a nobleman is
not that big of a deal.

609
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,065
Gosh.

610
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:27,446
Here.

611
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,364
What is this?

612
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:33,118
It is snake stew, made with the snake
from the other day.

613
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:35,287
Hey, drink up. Meat is great
for hand tremors.

614
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,289
This is disgusting. I cannot eat this.

615
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:44,379
It will taste even better
because Lady Eun-woo made it.

616
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,257
You know, for a noblewoman,

617
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,509
she is so strong and fierce.

618
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,470
Even us commoners cannot catch a snake,

619
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,222
but she just beat it up like this.

620
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:58,060
Right. Being a noble
is not that big of a deal.

621
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,854
-That is it, Man-bok.
-What?

622
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,147
That is exactly it.

623
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,943
After Yoo-jung married
into a noble family,

624
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,446
she was insulted
for coming from a "lowly background."

625
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:13,408
So, she probably thought that
a noblewoman should be graceful, quiet,

626
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,744
and never talk back to her husband.

627
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:18,830
That is why she did not say
anything about her husband's mistress.

628
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,376
Then how can we fix Yoo-jung's illness?

629
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,838
I think I might need your help for it.

630
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:31,259
But I am not sure if you can…

631
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:34,304
What is it? I will do anything.

632
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:39,434
I do not think that you will be able to…

633
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:48,777
No.

634
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:52,906
Never mind.

635
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,744
Come on, just tell me.

636
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,835
You are a noblewoman.
You should not be carrying that.

637
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,129
Well, I wanted to eat with you.

638
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,383
Come on, eat.
That way, you will feel better.

639
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,678
Oh, my…

640
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,890
-What if somebody sees?
-Why? I want to eat my rice with the stew.

641
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:22,394
I was taught that a noblewoman
should not act that way.

642
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:25,480
What is special about noblewomen?
Your in-laws were wrong.

643
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:39,953
That was good.

644
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,711
No matter how I think of it,
your husband is…

645
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,924
an awful damned bastard.

646
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,384
Eun-woo!

647
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,011
You damned bastard.

648
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,138
Cut the nonsense.

649
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,392
You damned…

650
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,981
Damned…

651
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,649
Eun-woo.

652
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,194
I think we should try
a different approach.

653
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,322
No, I can do it.

654
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,993
You damned bastard.

655
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:22,996
Cut the…

656
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,749
You need some experience
to be good at cussing.

657
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,751
You need more time to make it sound right.

658
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:30,378
Why is he being so stingy all of a sudden?

659
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,006
What is it now?

660
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:35,592
He told me to make some stew

661
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,302
with the leftover fish scales
from the market.

662
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,055
That prick!

663
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,389
Oh, right.

664
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:44,518
-Mr. Gye said that you eat like a pig.
-Pardon?

665
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,436
So you can only eat
one bowl of rice from now on.

666
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,771
A pig…

667
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:48,688
Hey, idiot!

668
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,024
You know that you are useless
without your needles, right?

669
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:52,859
Do not just sit there and chit-chat!

670
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,069
Go do some work!

671
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:56,279
-I told you to visit the patient.
-Ji-han…

672
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,157
-You prick…
-That lady really likes you,

673
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,409
so she will definitely pay you extra.

674
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,327
Go on!

675
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:03,912
You prick…

676
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,542
Ji-han, that prick.

677
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:16,550
I wish I could wring his neck
like dirty laundry.

678
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,218
That son of a…

679
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:23,390
You cannot say things like that.

680
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,808
You are a noblewoman.

681
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:27,644
I told you,
being a noblewoman is nothing special.

682
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,940
It is just a label you are born with.
Nothing more, nothing less.

683
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,609
Why should we always hold ourselves back?

684
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,653
We should laugh out loud
when we are happy,

685
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,655
and curse and yell when we are angry.

686
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:40,490
Yoo-jung.

687
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,450
We are all just people.

688
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,295
Do you think it worked?

689
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:57,674
I feel so much better now
after cussing like that.

690
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:00,176
That is good.

691
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,930
I should really start
doing that more often.

692
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:07,893
-What?
-It was so satisfying.

693
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:12,022
I know I was meant to help Yoo-jung,
but I think I helped myself too.

694
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,284
I remember now.

695
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,706
I did not set fire to that house.

696
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,712
When are you going to kick that woman out?

697
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:39,257
She is from the upper middle class,
but I am a noblewoman.

698
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,509
I am obviously more fit to be your wife.

699
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:44,971
Then I shall call you
like you are my wife.

700
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,222
"Honey."

701
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:50,560
If you bring me all of the money
that she is hiding,

702
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,771
I will give you a kiss.

703
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,733
-Come here, you.
-Oh, no.

704
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,361
Come here.

705
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,405
Do not be so shy.

706
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,202
Do you like that?

707
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:16,670
Then shall we go

708
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,172
and actually start a fire this time?

709
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:57,961
I am here.

710
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:00,463
Come out, Gwang-tae, you damned fool!

711
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,929
How dare you?

712
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:12,851
-Have you finally lost your mind?
-I should be saying that to you.

713
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:14,853
Yes, I am not a noblewoman.

714
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:18,314
But I lived a better life
than you, you cheating bastard.

715
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,233
I was just born into a world

716
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:22,694
that only cares about nobles.

717
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:24,070
That is all.

718
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,242
What are you talking about?
You set fire to our house!

719
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,661
Yoo-jung did not set fire to your house.

720
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:32,579
It was you.

721
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,211
What are you talking about?

722
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,923
It is true that Yoo-jung came here
with a piece of firewood,

723
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:45,925
but you staged the arson.

724
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:52,599
There is the firewood that Yoo-jung
could not bring herself to throw.

725
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,938
Your firewood is oak,

726
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,607
but Yoo-jung's in-laws use pine.

727
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:06,988
That is oak,

728
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,531
and this is pine.

729
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:09,908
Look closely!

730
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:17,457
That day,

731
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,918
you probably saw Yoo-jung
walking back home.

732
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,140
But the fire did not spread

733
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,601
because it had just rained.

734
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:40,146
You must have wanted it
to burn down, though.

735
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,440
Why would I set fire to my own house?

736
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,276
I will tell you that in a bit.

737
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,742
Your last name is Heo,
and your name is Myung, right?

738
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,996
Yes, why?

739
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,333
Well, the Heo family told me
that Myung died a long time ago.

740
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:03,503
Do not be foolish.

741
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,839
She has the Heo family record.

742
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,006
She forged it.

743
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,884
She has been to prison for doing that.

744
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:13,721
She started the fire

745
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,682
to kick out Yoo-jung,

746
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,809
so that she could become your wife

747
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:21,521
before her identity was revealed.
All she wanted was your money.

748
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,400
Arrest her.

749
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,609
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

750
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:30,613
That is defamation and document forgery.

751
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,991
Add arson to that list too.

752
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:44,252
Well, she was just a mistress.
In order to be a kind, loving wife,

753
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:48,047
you must overlook
the faults of your husband.

754
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,967
You have not forgotten, right?

755
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,720
Yoo-jung.

756
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,932
Shut your damned mouth, you bastard.

757
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,270
Do not say my daughter's name.

758
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,941
What did you just say?

759
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:09,027
What, you damned bastard?

760
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,570
I wish I could wring your neck

761
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,405
and shove you into a pile of cow dung.

762
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,324
So cut the nonsense.

763
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,411
How vulgar!

764
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,871
-You little…
-Stop right there!

765
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:24,167
If you move a single step,

766
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,961
I will make sure
that you will never walk again.

767
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:31,382
You stupid idiot. You little
piece of dung. You are garbage.

768
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:34,177
Yes, cut the nonsense, will you?

769
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,388
Just shut your mouth.

770
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:40,266
I will rip out your beard,

771
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,602
and crush every single
bone in your pathetic body.

772
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:45,313
-Oh, my.
-Oh, dear.

773
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:48,483
With shameless people like him, use this.
This will do the trick.

774
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,030
Please do not kill me.

775
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,115
I am sorry.

776
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,200
I am so sorry.

777
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,712
Do not you dare come back.

778
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:16,803
You can have him.
I do not need a pathetic man like him.

779
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:18,721
Honey.

780
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:20,807
Good job.

781
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,229
That was great.

782
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,355
Great job.

783
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,567
You are not mad at me
about anything, right?

784
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:39,784
I feel like I can finally see clearly.

785
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:43,204
That anger in my heart has gone as well.

786
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:48,001
Thank you, I will never forget
what you did for me.

787
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,421
Where are you going?

788
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:54,215
My brother told me
that I could stay with him.

789
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,675
Don’t worry, Eun-woo.

790
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,557
Well, you will always be welcome here.

791
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,396
Here.

792
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,316
I was going to give this to my daughter.

793
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:12,984
You can have it.

794
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,404
Yes.

795
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:18,448
Oh, right.

796
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,199
Here.

797
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,135
Thank you.

798
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,682
You are such a good artist, Ip-boon.

799
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,731
I hope that you will not

800
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,650
suffer from now on.

801
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:59,822
Please, be happy.

802
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:43,282
This tastes terrible.

803
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:50,331
Are you really eating rice wine residue

804
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,500
because you do not have
the money for drinks?

805
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:55,920
You useless piece of garbage.

806
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:57,964
What are you doing here so late at night?

807
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:00,633
Are you ready?

808
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:04,470
I want my money back.

809
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:14,147
Here. Go away.

810
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,107
-Go.
-What?

811
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,484
Are you worried that I will start talking?

812
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,570
This is 50 nyangs.
That is the original amount.

813
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:21,821
Where is the interest?

814
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,614
I will give you the interest later

815
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:25,658
Ip-boon.

816
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,827
Hey, shut it!

817
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:31,456
-Ip-boon, your mother…
-Yes, Jang Gyeong-sook. That is my mom.

818
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:40,465
-Actually, your mother…
-Was my dad's first love?

819
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,425
Yes, I know. Everybody knows.

820
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,762
She was so pretty.

821
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,724
Maybe I got her looks.
That is why I am so pretty.

822
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,559
No.

823
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:53,895
Because of what Ji-han did,

824
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:56,105
your mother…

825
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:58,775
Died? Is that what you want to say?

826
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:06,240
Your mother died

827
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,201
because he did not use his needle on her.

828
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:10,703
Even Hua Tuo himself
could not cure the plague.

829
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,539
You use herbs
for the plague, not acupuncture.

830
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,957
Right, Dad?

831
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,167
Yes.

832
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,543
That is right.

833
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,212
Really?

834
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,966
Well, your name is not Gye Ip-boon!

835
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,177
You are not his real daughter!

836
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,136
I know.

837
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,889
Was my biological dad's last name, Ahn?

838
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,600
So, I am not Gye Ip-boon…

839
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:33,893
I am Ahn Ip-boon?

840
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,687
-Ahn…
-I do not like it.

841
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,981
"You are not his real daughter"?
That is so cliché.

842
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:41,943
How did you…

843
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:43,277
How?

844
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:46,739
What are you so shocked about?
You always say that when you get drunk.

845
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,199
You guys heard it too, right?

846
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,789
I see.

847
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,878
Get lost.
I will pay you the interest next time.

848
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:03,923
"Get lost"?

849
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:06,592
How will you pay me the interest?

850
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,678
You still have about 1,000 nyangs left.

851
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:11,013
Here is the interest.

852
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:13,391
What?

853
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:16,185
In Gyeongguk Daejeon,
the total amount of interest on a loan

854
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,604
cannot exceed six-tenth
of the original amount.

855
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,106
You did not know?

856
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:23,901
You idiot, do you not know how to do math?

857
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,112
One nyang is not even close
to being six-tenth of that amount.

858
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:28,489
If he pays even a single nyang,

859
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:30,533
then he can slowly pay off his debt.

860
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:33,494
And Mr. Gye is not even the debtor, is he?

861
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:37,373
How about we hire a lawyer with this money

862
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:38,499
and open up a trial?

863
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,010
Good job, Granny.

864
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:50,887
That was great. Good work.

865
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:52,805
That is my piss, you jerk.

866
01:04:58,603 --> 01:04:59,562
Good job.

867
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:10,489
I am going to take this land from you,

868
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:14,911
no matter what.

869
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,628
GYESU INFIRMARY

870
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:49,820
I do not want it.

871
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,281
Are you trying to assassinate me?

872
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:57,954
Nam-hae made this, not me.
I never inherited any cooking skills.

873
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,456
Was Mom also a terrible cook?

874
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,626
She was even worse than you.

875
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:05,086
But…

876
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,971
She is bad at cooking,
but she made up for it with her looks?

877
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,648
Nam-hae made this, all right.

878
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,987
So that is why I am pretty,
although I am a terrible cook.

879
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:35,116
Dad, I think I can justify
my cooking skills now.

880
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:36,993
Darn it.

881
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:39,787
Then I can no longer blatantly say
that your cooking is bad.

882
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:42,581
But we are kind of alike.

883
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,586
-What? I am not ugly.
-No, we both like good-looking people.

884
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:49,672
My goodness.

885
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:52,091
I know you do, but I do not.

886
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,551
Do you remember Chil-deuk?

887
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:55,886
He fell from a persimmon tree
when you were five.

888
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:58,723
You had a crush on him,
so you were always in front of his house.

889
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:01,517
Everybody called you his future bride.

890
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:17,950
Shin-woo.

891
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,368
What brings you here?

892
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:22,955
I do not see Mr. Gye anywhere.

893
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:37,011
Whose is this?

894
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:40,264
It is mine.

895
01:07:40,347 --> 01:07:41,849
I can perform acupuncture now.

896
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:49,857
Is this really yours?

897
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:51,942
Yes.

898
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,155
Mr. Yoo gave it to me.

899
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:59,325
He said that the King himself
gave it to him.

900
01:08:10,544 --> 01:08:11,629
This is…

901
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:18,344
Mr. Yoo's?

902
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,599
It looks like the needle
that changed colors.

903
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:25,810
So, that needle

904
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:28,521
belonged to Yoo Se-yeop?

905
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:31,565
What is wrong?

906
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:39,448
HAEDONG BOOK OF HERBS

907
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,751
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED
IN THE MAKING OF THIS EPISODE

908
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,429
It is the plague!

909
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:04,140
It is the plague!

910
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:05,975
The patients are swarming
to the infirmary.

911
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:08,769
-Somebody bought them all as well.
-Who bought them?

912
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:10,813
We are getting all of the herbs

913
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:12,106
from Soon-man's storeroom.

914
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:13,315
A hut has been set up

915
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,734
in the mountains for the sick.

916
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,987
This disease is
nothing like I have ever seen,

917
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:19,822
and the blisters are different
from those mentioned in medical texts.

918
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:22,533
They must believe it is the plague.

919
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:24,910
Please save the people of this village.

920
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,997
Please allow us
to burn down the hut in Sorak.

921
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,331
I will find those plants,
and I will save them.

922
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,751
You need to stay awake. Se-yeop, get up!

923
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:38,132
