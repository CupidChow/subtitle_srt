1
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,368
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,956
Wait. Hold on.

3
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,710
I am sorry.

4
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,462
I did terrible things.

5
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,674
But I did everything
under Councilor Cho's orders.

6
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,428
I did not want to do it, I swear.

7
00:00:55,722 --> 00:01:00,143
It is time for you
to reveal the entire truth.

8
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,730
Reveal the orders you received
from Councilor Cho,

9
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:07,650
and every single crime
that you committed to bribe him.

10
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,487
Of course I will.

11
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,490
I will tell you everything.

12
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,407
So,

13
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,204
please spare me this once.

14
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,539
Please, Se-poong.

15
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,543
I mean, Lord Yoo.

16
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,515
I will tell you everything
that he made me do,

17
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,141
and everything that I gave him.

18
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,727
I will tell you everything.

19
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,854
Just trust me.

20
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:52,028
I swear that I will tell you
everything that Councilor Cho did.

21
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,548
It came from over there! Go!

22
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,091
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

23
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,851
Hey, Se-poong.

24
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,644
Here…

25
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,272
Do not speak. I need to stop the bleeding.

26
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,109
Take this.

27
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,072
My gold.

28
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,831
You cannot take them.

29
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,295
These are mine.

30
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,237
Councilor Cho must have used

31
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,698
the dan sedge to kill the King.

32
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,244
What are you going to do now?

33
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:09,832
Mr. Im must have recorded everything
that he gave to Councilor Cho.

34
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,501
We must find that ledger.

35
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,710
Guess what?

36
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,173
I found the ledger.

37
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,386
Here.

38
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,934
He gave various things to Councilor Cho

39
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,478
that were tributes to the King,
including marten pelts.

40
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,523
What does this line mean?

41
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,110
After he stopped
sending the martens and tributes,

42
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,028
he sent vast amounts of money and gold.

43
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,698
He probably got that money through opium.

44
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,326
He sent in the gold
according to the harvest cycles.

45
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,413
We can strike Councilor Cho
with the needle and this ledger.

46
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,133
While I work against him in the palace,

47
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,802
I need you to look
into the damage caused by the opium.

48
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,345
All right. I can do that.

49
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,723
Young Master.

50
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,641
Make sure to eat well.

51
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,644
-I will be back before you know it.
-Yes.

52
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,187
Let us go.

53
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,737
Eun-woo. I think you should stay.

54
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,904
Come on, let us go.

55
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,364
I thought we were in a hurry.

56
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,287
Have a safe journey.

57
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,955
Go on.

58
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,251
Was she supposed to go with him?

59
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,919
No clue.

60
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,514
You have been performing
acupuncture for me all this time,

61
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,391
and now you are getting involved
in something dangerous.

62
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:55,772
I told you that I am not going
to let you go off by yourself again.

63
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,525
Since we have come all this way,

64
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,652
I will stay with you until the very end.

65
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,241
Right. I am going to end everything.

66
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,745
I will

67
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,830
bring Councilor Cho to his knees.

68
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,656
That ledger shows that Councilor Cho
was taking advantage

69
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,658
of your people for his own profit,

70
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,326
and that is the needle that was used
on your father.

71
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,416
Are you saying we can use these

72
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,920
to throw Councilor Cho in jail?

73
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,256
It is not the right time, Your Majesty.

74
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,508
We must wait until

75
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,010
Councilor Cho destroys himself.

76
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,556
And when that happens,

77
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,891
he should be punished
for killing your father.

78
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,898
But Councilor Cho has too many allies

79
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,525
in the Royal Court.

80
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,402
Even if we come up with more evidence,

81
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,238
Councilor Cho will cut off his tail
like a lizard and escape.

82
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,198
Maybe you can burn his tail first

83
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,118
so that he cannot cut it off.

84
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,584
Burn the tail first?

85
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,468
Here.

86
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,262
Can you write down the food
that was prepared on the day

87
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,973
when it says, "His Majesty's boils
have gotten red?"

88
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:54,891
Sure.

89
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:04,025
Red ginseng was served
as a late-night snack.

90
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,115
On another day, it was red bean soup.

91
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,626
Do you think Mr. Gye got here safely?

92
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,505
His Majesty's guards went to get him,

93
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,089
so he must be here by now.

94
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,301
Things will

95
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:31,761
work out, right?

96
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,556
You told me that bad things

97
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,559
come from unexpected places.

98
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,812
I am sure that you will be able
to sort everything out.

99
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:04,961
If

100
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,296
something happens…

101
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,052
I will be all right.

102
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,190
It has been a while, Gwi-soo.

103
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,079
I thought you would be dead by now.

104
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,582
Yes, I am sure.

105
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,418
You killed everybody else, after all.

106
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,839
You probably want to kill me.

107
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,341
If you know that, then why are you here?

108
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,927
I am here to give you a chance.

109
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,975
You should be begging
for your life right now.

110
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:01,934
A chance?

111
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,397
You think you can give me a chance?

112
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,025
Did you really hope to lead a normal life

113
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,613
after poisoning the King?

114
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,575
How dare you?

115
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,412
Watch your mouth.
You have no proof of that.

116
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,122
His Majesty has the needle

117
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,917
that was used that day.

118
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,880
What?

119
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,175
Do you think I am lying?

120
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,637
We know that you are the one

121
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,139
who assassinated the previous King

122
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,682
under Councilor Cho's orders.

123
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,811
You killed your mentor and your friend
to join forces with Councilor Cho.

124
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,356
How do you call yourself a physician

125
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,399
after poisoning another human being?

126
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,692
Do you only care about

127
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,612
becoming a royal physician?

128
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,700
What mentor? What friend?

129
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:03,746
Gyu-hyeong was no mentor of mine.
He only cared about hypocrites like you.

130
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,206
Our mentor

131
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,421
treasured your skills as a physician.

132
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,098
His Majesty made me a promise.

133
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,683
If you confess,

134
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,144
then he will spare your family
from getting executed.

135
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,901
Your children are innocent.
Do you not want to save them?

136
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,448
This is your last chance
to atone for your crimes.

137
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,242
Just think about it.

138
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,796
What do you mean,
you did not find the needle?

139
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,425
It must have melted in the fire

140
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,677
when Im Soon-man died.

141
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,346
What about Yoo Se-yeop, then?

142
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,973
He disappeared

143
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,184
while I was handling Im Soon-man.

144
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,603
You useless brat.

145
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,314
You wanted a second chance.

146
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,025
Do not make me say this again.

147
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,653
I want that needle and Se-yeop

148
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,114
completely wiped from this world.

149
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,242
Yes, Father.

150
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,995
I will do that.

151
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,748
Gwi-soo became agitated

152
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,959
just as Mr. Yoo predicted.

153
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,795
What shall be done?

154
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,173
If I am correct, Your Majesty,

155
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,843
Mr. Shin will go
to Councilor Cho right away.

156
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,597
Where is Councilor Cho?

157
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,684
Right at that moment,

158
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,728
your soldiers who are on standby

159
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,772
should arrest Mr. Shin
right in front of Councilor Cho.

160
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,486
You must arrest the royal inspector

161
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,030
Cho Shin-woo as well.

162
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,825
What is all this ruckus about?

163
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,290
How dare you?

164
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,292
This is the house of the Left Councilor!

165
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,212
This is an order from His Majesty.

166
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,341
Arrest the physician Shin Gwi-soo
and royal inspector Cho Shin-woo.

167
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,342
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

168
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,723
-Let go of me!
-Councilor Cho.

169
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,479
Did you say that you have
an order from His Majesty?

170
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,855
Yes, sir.

171
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,823
All right, then.

172
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,369
Carry out your orders.

173
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,286
Councilor Cho.

174
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,289
His Majesty should be well aware

175
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,042
of the consequences of imprisoning my men

176
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,169
without sufficient evidence.

177
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,592
There is no need to worry.

178
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,388
His Majesty cannot punish

179
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,473
his loyal subject
who has done nothing wrong.

180
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,559
Do not be afraid.

181
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,686
Take them away.

182
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,728
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

183
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,538
I have obtained

184
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,790
numerous pieces of evidence and witnesses.

185
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,961
How could you poison my father

186
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,839
as a royal physician?

187
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,258
Your Majesty.

188
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,177
I am always being supervised
in the royal palace.

189
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,930
Every single thing I do
is recorded in a journal.

190
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,099
The court ladies test dishes for poison.

191
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,351
How could you accuse me of such a thing?

192
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,729
I did nothing wrong, Your Majesty.

193
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,648
I see that you
have not given up on your lies.

194
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,318
Does Councilor Cho

195
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,487
terrify you more than I do?

196
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,720
I will not be holding court today.

197
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,388
Yes, Your Majesty.

198
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,023
How long has this been going on?

199
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,652
His condition deteriorated
after he talked with Gwi-soo yesterday.

200
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,404
But His Majesty does not trust
the Royal Infirmary anymore.

201
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,949
Se-yeop. I cannot…

202
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,576
I cannot breathe.

203
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,330
You have developed palpitations
from shock and anxiety.

204
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,416
You should rest, Your Majesty.
I will brew some medication for you.

205
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,127
Will you not perform acupuncture on me?

206
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,130
Your needles have saved my life

207
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,466
numerous times.

208
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:13,347
I can no longer perform
acupuncture, Your Majesty.

209
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,558
What do you mean by that?

210
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,937
I am not sure why,

211
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,231
but I can no longer hold a needle.

212
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,609
However, this female physician
is assisting me.

213
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,528
Please allow her to perform acupuncture.

214
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,409
All right.

215
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,448
Your Majesty.

216
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,283
Councilor Cho requests to see you.

217
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,123
Will you be fine, Your Majesty?

218
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,044
This is not a good time.

219
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,839
Your Majesty, perhaps you should
tell him to go back.

220
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,883
You can meet him next time.

221
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:31,925
No.

222
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,554
If I do not do this now,

223
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,141
I will not get a chance
to talk with him again.

224
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,232
Your Majesty.

225
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,360
You are not looking well.

226
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:55,908
I have brought you some herbs
from the medicine room.

227
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,331
That is not important right now.

228
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,543
I have found out

229
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,171
that my father…

230
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,095
was poisoned.

231
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:23,727
Your Majesty.

232
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,398
How could you say such a terrible thing?

233
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,279
After investigating this
for the past year,

234
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,657
I found out that
the royal physician Shin Gwi-soo

235
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,827
is the one who killed him.

236
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:53,048
Did you find the evidence to prove that,
Your Majesty?

237
00:18:56,009 --> 00:19:00,305
I would not be talking to you about this
if I did not.

238
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,813
Gwi-soo must have been working
with an accomplice.

239
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:14,444
I must thoroughly investigate
to find this accomplice.

240
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,742
Do you not think so, Councilor Cho?

241
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:31,253
I shall look into it
to the best of my ability, Your Majesty.

242
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,264
That reminds me.

243
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,143
Are you not curious
about your adopted son?

244
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,855
Someone sent in a letter
regarding the death of a court lady,

245
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,191
so he is under investigation right now.

246
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,820
Do not worry,
for he will be released soon.

247
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:17,966
Father.

248
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,346
Does anybody else know

249
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,931
that you killed the court lady?

250
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,184
Is that why I have been imprisoned?

251
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,690
Since Soon-man is dead,

252
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,401
one of the assassins might have
leaked the information.

253
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,695
That would be troublesome.

254
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,949
You will be released soon.

255
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,825
So just keep silent and wait for me.

256
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,411
-Do you understand?
-Yes, Father.

257
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,372
Do not worry about me.

258
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,387
Do you think His Majesty
will be all right?

259
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,349
Since you performed acupuncture on him,
he will sleep for a short while.

260
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,519
We must give him cheongshimhwan
and ondamtang when he wakes up,

261
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,437
but we cannot trust the Royal Infirmary.

262
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,774
Do not worry. I have prepared
everything already.

263
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,452
Young Master! Lady Eun-woo!

264
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,538
Stop jumping around and get back to work.

265
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,206
Yes, get back to work.

266
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,166
We need to finish before sunset.

267
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,584
Why is it always me?

268
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,212
When did you guys get here?

269
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,257
I sent them a letter

270
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,842
since Sorak would be dangerous.

271
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,302
Thank you.

272
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,680
Jeez.

273
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,850
Councilor Cho should not
be underestimated.

274
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,476
We might have shaken him up,

275
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,854
but we do not know what he will do.

276
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:59,901
Gwi-soo was completely certain
that Councilor Cho would save him.

277
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,945
At this rate,

278
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,114
Councilor Cho might simply save himself.

279
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,618
How could he? The evidence is irrefutable.

280
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:13,749
We do not have a way to link Councilor Cho
to the death of the previous King.

281
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,876
If he never admits that he was involved,

282
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,919
then only Gwi-soo will be punished.

283
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,132
How can we get Councilor Cho
to admit that he was involved?

284
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,176
Is there no way?

285
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:25,927
Darn…

286
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:26,845
Excuse me.

287
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,893
Since we are all busy,
let us eat some red bean soup.

288
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,728
I love red bean soup.

289
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,146
Eat up.

290
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,444
The sweet rice balls look good.

291
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:54,623
Red ginseng was served
as a late-night snack.

292
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,793
On another day, it was red bean soup.

293
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:01,713
Red bean soup.

294
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,012
Red bean soup.

295
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,434
I have a great idea.

296
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,361
Last time,

297
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,988
I had a very bad cold.

298
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,616
I am sorry that you had to come
all this way for nothing.

299
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,993
That is why

300
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,288
I have prepared
a special tea table for you.

301
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,582
Go on, you may eat.

302
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,103
Go ahead and enjoy the food.

303
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,781
My father used to enjoy those.

304
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,419
After my most recent sickness,

305
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,881
I felt the need for
a very proficient physician.

306
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,090
Therefore,

307
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:30,385
I am going to call a skilled physician
back to the Royal Infirmary.

308
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,139
Come in.

309
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:03,460
I shall forgive the physician Yoo Se-yeop,
who has previously been in exile.

310
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,837
He shall become
the head acupuncturist again.

311
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,965
Your Majesty,
that man killed your father--

312
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:09,925
Regarding that,

313
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,970
the royal physician Shin Gwi-soo
is being interrogated

314
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,224
Soon, Se-yeop will be cleared
of all charges.

315
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,028
Councilor Cho.

316
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,530
How come you did not take a single bite?

317
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,908
How dare you

318
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,952
run your mouth in this room?

319
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,331
I apologize, sir.

320
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,794
However, everybody else
has eaten the food.

321
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,797
But you have not even touched it.

322
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,549
Why is that?

323
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,098
The two dishes that you just ate

324
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,684
were served to the previous King

325
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,727
right before he passed away.

326
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,981
Somebody slipped poison into the food.

327
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,868
The previous King passed away
after eating this food.

328
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,454
Perhaps you did not touch the food

329
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,623
because you knew about that fact.

330
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,214
How preposterous.

331
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,008
You are the one who killed the King.

332
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,801
How dare you try to blame it on me?

333
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,304
You gave the dan sedge to a court lady

334
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,222
saying it was a spice from Qing.

335
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,475
You put the dan sedge
in the sweet rice balls

336
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,019
to slip it past the court ladies
who were tasting the food.

337
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,855
Councilor Cho, you are the one
who assassinated the King.

338
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,634
Do you have evidence?

339
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,889
Everything that you just said

340
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,682
is a product of your imagination.

341
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,269
Evidence?

342
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,275
Do you know what this is?

343
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,405
You stole the goods
that were meant to be for His Majesty,

344
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,617
allowed the sale of opium,
which was forbidden by the King's Court,

345
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,620
and received gold in secret.
This ledger is evidence of that.

346
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,583
This proves that you stole
your country's money

347
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,461
and made the people suffer.

348
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,254
Your Majesty.

349
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,841
I am being framed.

350
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,760
We will see about that.

351
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,596
What are you waiting for?

352
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,348
Arrest Councilor Cho.

353
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,808
Yes, Your Majesty.

354
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,488
Councilor Cho.

355
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:45,223
Sir, are you all right?

356
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,810
What is Councilor Cho doing?

357
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,064
I do not know if I can endure this
for much longer.

358
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,153
It seems like His Majesty already knows.

359
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,488
Do not worry, Mr. Shin.

360
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:05,201
My father talked with His Majesty.

361
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,871
He told me that
we will be released very soon.

362
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,292
All right.

363
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,590
Come out.

364
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,596
I guess it is my turn.

365
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,728
Why did you do it?

366
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,983
Why did you kill Wol?

367
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,443
Just why?

368
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,533
Did you kill my father as well?

369
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,217
Follow me, sir.

370
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,645
Goodness.

371
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,565
I told you I could do it.

372
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:23,029
Our wise Lady Eun-woo,
you can eat all you want.

373
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,909
I had no idea that he used
the sweet rice balls in the red bean soup.

374
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,620
Still, if the royal physician
does not change his mind,

375
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,747
it will be hard to punish Councilor Cho.

376
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,834
Gwi-soo has been backed into a corner.

377
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,460
He will make up his mind soon.

378
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,754
The ministers will also change
their attitudes.

379
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,090
Come on. Eat up.

380
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,176
I think the food tastes a lot better

381
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,429
because we cooked it
in a nobleman's house.

382
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,099
Actually, I cannot tell the difference.

383
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,476
I like scorched rice better.

384
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,105
Jang-goon knows his stuff.

385
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,232
It is not like this is your house.

386
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,359
You just cannot be quiet
about how nice it is.

387
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,736
Do you really like your old house so much?

388
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,947
How on earth did you stay
at Gyesu Infirmary?

389
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,826
You ate so much more at the infirmary.
And you like this place better? You pig.

390
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:12,620
You pig.

391
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:31,639
Do you think
there is any alcohol around here?

392
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,474
Are you kidding me?

393
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:37,145
My Young Master is a weirdo,
but his father loved to drink.

394
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,646
Give it to me.

395
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,358
The baekchulju that was for my father
should still be there.

396
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,571
I know how to make baekchulju too.

397
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,407
Really? But you cannot even drink.

398
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,366
You are a good son.

399
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,516
Run! Take the others and go.

400
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,476
Mr. Gye.

401
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,277
Mr. Gye.

402
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,210
Mr. Gye.

403
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,095
Dad.

404
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,347
Dad.

405
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,311
I have taken care of his wound.

406
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,730
I will use herbs to regenerate
his blood and watch him.

407
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,275
Please prepare some medication
with Jang-goon for blood regeneration.

408
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,193
Yes.

409
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,695
I hope he does not get a fever.

410
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,074
I will prepare some paedoktang.

411
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,910
I need to stop the bleeding.

412
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,622
No. I need to replenish his blood supply.

413
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,749
No. I need to treat his physical injury.

414
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,501
Mr. Yoo.

415
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,212
You tried your best.

416
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,880
It will be fine.

417
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,054
I will go and brew all of the herbs.

418
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,518
Lady Eun-woo, can you stay with Dad
since you know how to perform acupuncture?

419
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,145
I will brew the medicine with Jang-goon.

420
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,192
I wish I could perform acupuncture too.

421
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,537
Maybe I should not have started this.

422
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,460
I cannot even protect
the people I love. Why…

423
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,473
-Mr. Gye.
-Mr. Gye.

424
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,646
Why the long face?

425
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,316
Did somebody die or what?

426
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,904
Do not talk.

427
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,330
You know, your father…

428
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,959
was a good man.

429
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:53,424
Do not run away like I did.

430
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,555
I think I might have been waiting

431
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,975
for somebody like you to appear

432
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,355
and set everything right.

433
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,530
I am sorry for always telling you

434
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,369
to run away,

435
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,414
and that it was all useless.

436
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,511
Mr. Gye.

437
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,889
Mr. Gye.

438
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,563
I think he momentarily lost consciousness.

439
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,413
I am going to bring them to justice,

440
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,125
and make things right.

441
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:12,879
You will.

442
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,339
We are almost there.

443
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:17,842
It is all right.

444
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,220
It will all be fine.

445
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,322
I want the head acupuncturist's report.

446
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,722
The maid of honor, Gwak Gyo-yeong,

447
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:09,018
was murdered by a poison
that cannot be detected by silver.

448
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,733
But this needle

449
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,528
was specially made to change color
when it touches that kind of poison.

450
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,034
Gyo-yeong's blood

451
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,578
changed the color of the needle.

452
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,581
On top of that, the corpse
had very distinct purple blisters.

453
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,376
Those blisters are caused
by the dan sedge.

454
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,129
However,

455
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,301
this needle also changed colors
in the same way.

456
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,012
I used this needle

457
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,349
to treat the previous King
for the last time.

458
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,436
It looks just like the needle
that I used on the maid of honor.

459
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,023
Why do you think that happened?

460
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,443
Councilor Cho murdered my father

461
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,153
using the dan sedge.

462
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,074
-He poisoned the King?
-Councilor Cho?

463
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,617
-How did this happen?
-Poison?

464
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:11,372
I swear that I did nothing wrong,
Your Majesty.

465
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:17,545
I am not the person
who is the expert on the dan sedge.

466
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,339
The person who killed the previous King

467
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,050
is Yoo Se-yeop himself.

468
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,055
His father, Minister Yoo,

469
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,683
must have died
while he was leaving the city

470
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,935
in order to get rid of the evidence.

471
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:37,982
Your Majesty, I believe
that Councilor Cho is speaking the truth.

472
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:44,280
There are numerous witnesses right here
who saw Se-yeop perform acupuncture

473
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,906
on the previous King.

474
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,452
You were there too, Your Majesty.

475
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,830
So you think that I used the dan sedge?

476
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:57,001
Well, did anybody see me
or the royal physician Shin Gwi-soo

477
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,336
actually poison the King?

478
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,924
You ordered Wol, the court lady,

479
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,052
to put the dan sedge

480
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,263
into the previous King's food.

481
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,807
Well, that court lady is dead.

482
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,188
Your Majesty.

483
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,940
Please do not listen to the voice of evil.

484
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,610
-Please, Your Majesty.
-Please, Your Majesty.

485
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,445
One of Councilor Cho's assassins

486
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,238
killed your father,

487
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,781
not me.

488
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,287
And the court lady is not dead.

489
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,501
She is still alive.

490
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:24,106
Councilor Cho poisoned the King
so he would not strike the north.

491
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,818
Your father got this evidence
from Hanyang before he died.

492
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:29,945
It says that Councilor Cho
ordered the royal physician

493
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:33,073
to collect every single dan sedge
in the city and burn them.

494
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,826
I started suspecting Councilor Cho
because of this,

495
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:40,247
and this is why I hid
the needle and the court lady.

496
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:48,464
Tell His Majesty who you are.

497
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,969
I am Wol, a court lady
from the Royal Kitchen, Your Majesty.

498
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:08,567
Were you told to put the dan sedge
into the previous King's food?

499
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,861
Yes, I was.

500
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,657
He told me that
it was an expensive spice from Qing.

501
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,243
He made me put it on the red ginseng
for His Majesty,

502
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:21,997
and the red bean soup.

503
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,044
How exactly did you put it
in the red bean soup?

504
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,798
I put it in the dough
for the sweet rice balls,

505
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,217
as I was told
that they would taste better that way.

506
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,058
And who told you

507
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,852
to do that?

508
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,823
The royal physician, Shin Gwi-soo,

509
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,076
gave me the dan sedge
with the inventory list.

510
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:07,751
Your Majesty.

511
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,380
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

512
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,302
I was terrified of his power,

513
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,720
and if I did not cooperate,

514
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:22,016
he threatened to kill my family.

515
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,810
I did not want to do it, Your Majesty.

516
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,193
There is something else.

517
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:34,987
What is it?

518
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:37,781
I witnessed

519
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:44,038
the murder of Minister Yoo.

520
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,337
Did he not fall from a horse?

521
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,591
Tell us

522
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:58,552
what you saw.

523
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,683
Minister Yoo was walking somewhere.

524
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:09,229
And somebody hit him with a club.

525
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,243
Did you see who it was?

526
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,293
He was wearing a belt
with a jade butterfly on it.

527
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,720
The black butterfly…

528
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:48,310
is the coat of arms for the Cho family.

529
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,524
Shin Gwi-soo, answer me.

530
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,404
Who told you to use the dan sedge

531
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,365
on my father?

532
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,373
It was Councilor Cho.

533
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,709
He gave me the dan sedge,

534
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:17,131
and I just handed it to Wol, Your Majesty.

535
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:31,979
I am being framed.

536
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,691
I am being framed!

537
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,112
If you are being framed,

538
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,535
then why did you steal this letter
and nearly put our country in danger?

539
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,924
Get rid of him,

540
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,887
and hand over the King's secret letter
to the Qing.

541
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,472
You assassinated the King,

542
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,765
stole the letter
ordering a strike on the north,

543
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,310
and used that letter to try
to bring the Qing's soldiers

544
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,604
over to Joseon in order to save yourself!

545
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,817
Protect His Majesty.

546
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,368
What are you doing?

547
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:11,930
I was just

548
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:14,933
trying to

549
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,854
save this country from another war.

550
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,441
I was

551
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,737
the most faithful subject

552
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,405
of the King.

553
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,326
Se-yeop.

554
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:19,623
Yes, Your Majesty.

555
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,044
I have always been so sick and frail.

556
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:27,798
I never thought that this day would come.

557
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,473
You made all of this possible.

558
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:42,896
Your Majesty, you are an admirable
and powerful King.

559
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,566
You are the one who saved me.

560
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,860
You never gave up on revealing the truth.

561
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:52,864
You chose to shoulder all of the burdens

562
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,741
even though it made your heart sick.

563
00:49:56,827 --> 00:50:00,330
I am so sorry, and so thankful.

564
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:08,422
You must have suffered as well
from being unable to perform acupuncture.

565
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:14,469
I am worried that you might be hiding
a sickness of the heart, just like me.

566
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,265
Maybe you are not paying attention
to your own illness

567
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,641
because you are a physician.

568
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,518
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

569
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:24,855
It looks like I have made you worry again.

570
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,984
But it seems like you can do
something even greater

571
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,360
than performing acupuncture.

572
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,530
You know how to treat illnesses
of the heart and mind.

573
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,532
I think I will call you a mind doctor

574
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:38,660
instead of the head acupuncturist.

575
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,835
I am still unwell.

576
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,755
I need a competent physician
to stay by my side.

577
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:56,511
Will you become the royal physician
of the Royal Infirmary?

578
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:13,320
Hey, you are spilling the glass noodles.

579
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,908
Dad! Are you seriously drinking right now?

580
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,452
Of course not. No way.

581
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:22,370
Hurry up and give people some food.

582
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,706
I better not see you drinking again.

583
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,249
I will toss them all out.

584
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:42,265
He looks amazing.

585
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:47,854
Gosh, Mr. Yoo. You look great.

586
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,397
Did I not tell you?

587
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:52,442
My Young Master is
the most handsome man in Hanyang.

588
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,860
He is stunning like the sun.

589
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,033
Poong is getting married.

590
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:03,411
All right. Listen up.

591
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:04,621
Everybody, listen up.

592
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:08,708
Se-yeop got framed and exiled,

593
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,043
but it turns out that

594
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,838
he was a very skilled physician

595
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:16,132
who saved His Majesty.

596
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,512
-All right!
-All right!

597
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:23,014
I am not done yet.

598
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:26,643
You know Minister Yoo Hoo-myung?

599
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:30,772
He was one
of the King's most loyal advisors.

600
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:37,571
Make sure to eat a lot, all right?
It is a party.

601
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,949
Go and spread the word.

602
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:43,326
Spread the word!

603
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,414
Spread the word.

604
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,420
Let us all have some fun
for the head acupuncturist Yoo Se-poong,

605
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,839
I mean, Se-yeop,

606
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,633
who was called back by His Majesty!

607
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,305
Is that not nice?

608
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,610
The Royal Infirmary?

609
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,905
His Majesty wants you
in the Royal Infirmary?

610
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,533
You are going to be the head acupuncturist

611
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,453
and the royal physician too?

612
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,999
This is unbelievable.

613
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,586
Granny, do not say that.

614
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,796
Being the royal physician
makes you important, right?

615
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,882
I bet you will get a lot of money.

616
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:41,009
No, it is not like that.

617
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:42,969
The government never pays a lot of money.

618
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:46,431
They are going to underpay him
but overwork him.

619
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:50,143
His Majesty wants you
to return to your position as well.

620
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:51,978
Me?

621
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:54,522
Wait, why me?

622
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,774
What do you mean?

623
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:58,443
You used to be a good physician
back in the day, right?

624
00:53:58,526 --> 00:53:59,361
Yes.

625
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,655
I think it is time for you to shine.

626
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:02,572
Yes.

627
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,617
If both of you go back
to the Royal Infirmary,

628
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,410
then who will take care
of Gyesu Infirmary?

629
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,582
That is true.

630
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,878
Hold on.

631
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:21,466
How about we just move
Gyesu Infirmary to Hanyang?

632
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:22,467
That hurts.

633
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,928
It would make it Hanyang Infirmary,
not Gyesu Infirmary.

634
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:28,348
-That is right.
-Then Hanyang Infirmary…

635
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:32,769
Hold on. The storage for the herbs
can go right there, and…

636
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,896
If Mr. Yoo becomes the royal physician,

637
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,107
can he order you around?

638
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,942
Unbelievable.

639
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:06,052
Will you become the royal physician
of the Royal Infirmary?

640
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,054
Father.

641
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:12,100
What am I supposed to do now?

642
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,688
Mr. Yoo, are you in there?

643
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,783
Are you going somewhere?

644
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,412
I am leaving this country tonight.

645
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:36,332
Where will you be going?

646
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,420
I am not sure.

647
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,839
Maybe the Ryukyu Kingdom,
where it is warmer,

648
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:45,050
or far away to the West.

649
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:53,433
None of this would have been possible

650
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,393
without your help, Inspector Cho.

651
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:04,694
I was merely repenting
for the sins of my family.

652
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,822
I am a traitor
who deserves to be executed.

653
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,618
But His Majesty allowed me to live

654
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,787
because I helped you.

655
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,624
You could have seized power

656
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:21,586
if you had worked with Councilor Cho.

657
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,923
But you chose to do otherwise.

658
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,135
You know, I hated it.

659
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,725
I was living a luxurious life
as the adopted son of a noble family,

660
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,937
but there were innocents
out in the world who were dying.

661
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:44,609
I started using my sword
in order to survive,

662
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,030
but I have never used it thoughtlessly.

663
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,866
So that is the reason

664
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:56,329
you saved me and Wol.

665
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,292
Are you going back to the Royal Infirmary?

666
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,045
I heard you will be the royal physician.

667
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,631
I have not made up my mind.

668
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,051
Is it because of Eun-woo?

669
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:16,724
I advise you to think about
what you truly want

670
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:20,728
instead of living in pain like I did.

671
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:27,735
Take good care of Eun-woo.

672
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,202
Inspector Cho.

673
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,664
Be well.

674
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,038
What is wrong with me?

675
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,054
Here…

676
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:49,776
What did you wish for?

677
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:52,946
You first, Mr. Gye.

678
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:58,701
I wished for the prosperity
of Gyesu Infirmary.

679
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,499
-Are you not going to the Royal Infirmary?
-No.

680
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:07,168
They do not pay you that well,

681
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:09,170
and they are always telling you

682
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,297
to treat your patients this way or that.

683
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,465
So I will not go.

684
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,009
Ip-boon will be disappointed.

685
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,972
Ip-boon will be happier in Sorak County.

686
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,848
I do not want her
to become caught up in a dream.

687
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,310
Lady Eun-woo,

688
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:30,191
you are also very important
to the women in Sorak County.

689
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,947
Just forget about that idiot
who cannot even perform acupuncture.

690
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,032
Let us start anew.

691
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,580
Why would Eun-woo "start anew"
with you, Mr. Gye?

692
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,458
My goodness.

693
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,549
Mr. Yoo.

694
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:09,355
You can have your needle case back.

695
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:17,530
No, it is fine. It was a gift.

696
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,118
You are the royal physician Yoo Se-poong…

697
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:26,706
I mean, Yoo Se-yeop.

698
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,418
You should get back to work.

699
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,129
His Majesty

700
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,507
gave me a new needle case.

701
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:49,729
I am worried because His Majesty

702
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,155
is not doing very well.

703
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:06,704
Well, you will be with him.

704
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,642
The boar is not following us.

705
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:30,978
We need to go get him.

706
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:34,857
Man-bok is going to live in Hanyang now.
That is where his home is.

707
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:40,613
You should have stayed
at the Royal Infirmary, Dad.

708
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:45,118
There are a lot of patients
waiting for us in Sorak.

709
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,452
We need to hurry up.

710
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:49,414
You are right, Jang-goon. We need to run.

711
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:51,541
Gosh. Let us go.

712
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:52,625
-Be careful.
-Jeez.

713
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:55,586
Let us run.

714
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,236
GYESU INFIRMARY

715
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,487
3 MONTHS LATER

716
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:28,953
What on earth did you eat overnight?

717
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:31,539
-The barbarians are coming.
-What?

718
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:34,208
The barbarians are coming.

719
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,334
Get her.

720
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:37,295
Oh, my…

721
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:38,921
-They are coming.
-Get her.

722
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,011
Poong.

723
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,721
-You are back.
-Goodness!

724
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:56,689
I told you, the barbarians
have gone back to their country.

725
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,232
It is Poong.

726
01:02:58,316 --> 01:02:59,525
Poong.

727
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,778
How have you guys been?

728
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:04,947
Hey, Jang-goon.

729
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:09,577
-How have you been?
-I have been well.

730
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:11,704
Mr. Yoo.

731
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:16,501
Did you get kicked out
of the Royal Infirmary again?

732
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,129
What are you doing here?
What about His Majesty?

733
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,590
His Majesty has gotten much better,

734
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:24,258
thanks to my amazing skills.

735
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,385
Yes.

736
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,720
I missed you.

737
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:33,226
You know, Mr. Yoo,

738
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,686
I feel like you have gotten
a bit more mature.

739
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:41,150
Man-bok, you are still super immature.

740
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,568
What?

741
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:46,155
People will start thinking
that Mr. Yoo is older than you.

742
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:50,910
What are you talking about?
I am three years younger than him.

743
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,036
-What?
-What?

744
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,748
-What?
-What?

745
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:58,960
Hey, idiot.

746
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:03,172
We are very busy right now,
so go and see some patients.

747
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:05,174
Sure thing.

748
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:08,761
-Look at him.
-Back to work.

749
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,226
Hey, stop hitting me.

750
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:19,814
Next patient, please.

751
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:42,480
PHYSICIAN OF THE HEART

752
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:50,321
PHYSICIAN OF THE HEART, YOO SE-POONG

753
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:51,864
YOO SE-POONG

754
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:05,670
My first patient
who had an illness of the heart…

755
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:41,664
Eun-woo.

756
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,335
Mr. Yoo.

757
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,926
I need to tell you something.

758
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:59,015
Not right now. Tomorrow afternoon.

759
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:04,603
Meet me under the tree on Sorak Mountain,

760
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,188
near the hill with the big rock.

761
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:14,989
I will see you tomorrow, then.

762
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:19,368
Yes.

763
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:21,370
What…

764
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:53,879
Father.

765
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:40,718
Eun-woo.

766
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:56,150
We have been ordered to go to Heuksan.
Prepare your belongings.

767
01:09:56,233 --> 01:09:59,361
It is very urgent.
We must leave as soon as we can.

768
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,578
No.

769
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:09,872
I will tell him this time.

770
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:19,715
What is going on?

771
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,474
All of you, stand down.

772
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,230
Mr. Yoo.

773
01:10:45,699 --> 01:10:47,493
I have an order from His Majesty.

774
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,746
Physician Yoo Se-yeop,
obey the order of your King.

775
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:18,357
Eun-woo.

776
01:12:23,547 --> 01:12:28,552
