1
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,368
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:48,006
The head acupuncturist, Yoo Se-yeop.

3
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,424
He was born in Hanyang.

4
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,552
He has never ventured
beyond the four main gates of Hanyang

5
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,888
making him a true Hanyang man.

6
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:09,319
At age 15, he enrolled at Sungkyunkwan,

7
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,571
and at age 17,
he passed the Special Liberal Arts Exam.

8
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:12,947
But that is not all.

9
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:13,907
When he was 18,

10
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,328
he easily passed both parts
of the Triennial Liberal Arts Exams.

11
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,249
But after his mother died of an illness,
he gave up on liberal arts

12
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,211
and went into medicine.
He is completely crazy.

13
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,883
Anyway, after he passed
the Medical Exam with flying colors,

14
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,010
he immediately entered
the Royal Infirmary.

15
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:37,680
He has read every single medical text
in the country.

16
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,557
As for his acupuncture skills,

17
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,186
he was so talented that he was named
the head acupuncturist by the king.

18
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,232
He was born rich as the son of
the Minister of Personnel, Yoo Hoo-myung.

19
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,692
Honestly, everybody in the royal palace

20
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,904
wanted to be treated by him.

21
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,908
On top of that, he is very handsome too.

22
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,368
Oh, my. They are all swooning.

23
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,953
Ever since becoming a physician,

24
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:04,624
the extraordinary young master has saved
every patient who was treated by him.

25
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,086
But while he was on the road to success

26
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,755
with his perfect treatment record…

27
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:21,975
What is it?

28
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,227
What is going on?

29
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,149
Please do something, sir.

30
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,608
What if she dies?

31
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,789
She is already dead.

32
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,208
Dead?

33
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,501
Then what should we do?

34
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,044
She worked for the Royal Kitchen,

35
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,754
so tell Court Lady Park
to take the body away.

36
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,881
Hold on.

37
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,259
Please stop.

38
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,730
What? Are you so confident in your skills

39
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,773
that you think you can
bring her back to life?

40
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,902
No, I am doing this
because she is not dead yet.

41
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,322
You almost did kill her,

42
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,366
but she will live with my help.

43
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,498
What do you think you are doing?

44
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,628
She appeared dead because her energy
could not reach her brain,

45
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,795
but she is still alive.

46
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,299
Did she not scream
before starting to convulse?

47
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,969
Yes. She screamed
before she started convulsing.

48
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,055
It is cholecystitis.

49
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,681
Please move aside.

50
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,488
My goodness…

51
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,285
I will perform acupuncture…

52
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,912
OKDANG, HWAGAE, CHEONDOL

53
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,705
…on the three conception vessels.

54
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,137
One,

55
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,890
two,

56
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,433
three.

57
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,480
-She is alive.
-She is alive.

58
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,856
-She is alive?
-She is alive.

59
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,150
-I need a pair of scissors.
-What?

60
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:37,986
-Scissors.
-Right.

61
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,242
What on earth are you doing?

62
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,743
You just ripped a court lady's skirt…

63
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,786
My goodness.

64
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,414
You said she was dead 15 minutes ago.

65
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,874
Cutting a court lady's skirt
does not matter

66
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,377
when she could have been
carted away as a corpse.

67
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,215
Book of Medicine, chapter 64.

68
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,134
With cholecystitis, one might appear dead.

69
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,136
But you can save them quickly
with acupuncture needles.

70
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,473
-I knew that too.
-We are running out of time.

71
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,475
I will have to use another needle.

72
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,774
One,

73
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:17,775
two,

74
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,236
three.

75
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,370
He saved her.

76
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,927
What is all this noise?

77
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:50,058
The Crown Prince is on the brink of death!

78
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,318
The Crown Prince just recently
began suffering from malaria.

79
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,028
I told you to come
to the Crown Prince's Court.

80
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,696
Why did you not follow my orders?

81
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,240
I was told that he was suffering
from mild indigestion today.

82
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,826
-That court lady could have died…
-Who cares about her?

83
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,413
The Crown Prince's symptoms are
persisting after the acupuncture.

84
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,624
That is why His Highness called for you.

85
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,084
Do not be so thoughtless.

86
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,045
If you think you are allowed
to disrespect the King

87
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,963
just because you studied
with the Crown Prince,

88
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,965
I will kick you out. Do you understand?

89
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,383
Yes, sir.

90
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,559
None of the needles or medicine
have managed to cure him.

91
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,481
-Do you think you can do it?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

92
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,817
However, you must step away

93
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,986
before I apply the acupuncture needle.

94
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,614
That rude brat!

95
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,574
Please forgive him, Your Majesty.

96
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,668
-Like this, you mean?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

97
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,245
One,

98
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,581
two,

99
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,548
three.

100
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,138
Help me sit up. Quickly!

101
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,657
Is this why you told me to step away?

102
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,493
Yes, Your Majesty.

103
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,161
This can settle indigestion.

104
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,206
However, if it cannot be settled,
the patient will vomit instead.

105
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,626
I did not want your royal robes
to get wet.

106
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,296
So you were thinking one step ahead
before applying the needle?

107
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,589
You truly are a good acupuncturist.

108
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,092
Crown Prince.

109
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,637
Are you feeling better?

110
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,846
I feel much better.

111
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,223
That is good.

112
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,268
I am sorry for telling you
to not become a physician.

113
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,605
You said that
because he wanted to be a physician

114
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,190
even after he passed
the Liberal Arts Exam.

115
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,236
Even his father, Minister Yoo,
is still angry at him.

116
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,363
Is that true, Minister Yoo?

117
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,615
Pardon me, Your Majesty.

118
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,785
I think I will make you
the head acupuncturist.

119
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,412
Pardon me, Your Majesty,

120
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,456
but I am already the head acupuncturist.

121
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,707
Is that so?

122
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,376
Goodness.

123
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,797
So your only other option
is becoming the royal physician.

124
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,633
All right, then.

125
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,220
Give the physician Yoo Se-yeop
the title of Top Acupuncturist,

126
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,514
as well as twenty seom of rice.

127
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,266
Yes, Your Majesty.

128
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,393
Your acupuncture skills are unparalleled.

129
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,531
You have gotten much better.

130
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:37,201
However, you must never act arrogant
and always stay humble.

131
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,327
Yes, Father.

132
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,870
I will keep that in mind.

133
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,750
Is something on your mind?

134
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:49,171
His Majesty has made me
the Overseer of the Royal Infirmary.

135
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,840
OVERSEER: THE HIGHEST RANKING OFFICIAL
IN AN OFFICE

136
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:55,511
Is something the matter
with His Majesty's health?

137
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,808
Se-yeop,

138
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:04,145
His Majesty is planning
on waging war to our north.

139
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,733
But Councilor Cho and his allies
will never let that happen.

140
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,610
A storm is approaching.

141
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,863
If the energy in his liver stagnates
due to stress,

142
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,074
the boils on his skin
will become much worse.

143
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,118
You must not, Your Majesty.

144
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,623
Councilor Cho, you have been
telling me since five years ago

145
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,834
that I must wait
until the moment is right.

146
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,714
Do you even wish to conquer the north?

147
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,800
Once you start a war, you cannot stop it.

148
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,595
You must wait for the right time.

149
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:41,641
The Qing Dynasty is in a disarray
because of their frontier's rebellion.

150
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,893
I cannot miss this opportunity.

151
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:48,773
I shall raise the armies of the generals,
so make sure that we are prepared.

152
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:49,982
Your Majesty,

153
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,235
you cannot make your people bleed

154
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,781
for your own desires.

155
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,867
Please do not do this, Your Majesty!

156
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,993
Councilor Cho!

157
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,122
My people who were dragged off
on the Year of the Red Mouse

158
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,791
are still living in terror.

159
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,417
It is my duty to rescue them

160
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,546
as soon as possible.

161
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,600
I thought we had been
watching him closely.

162
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:28,145
When did His Majesty contact the generals
without us knowing?

163
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,189
This is like running into a fire
while drenched in oil.

164
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,191
We must stop this.

165
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:43,577
His Majesty will not be able
to conquer the north.

166
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,401
Your Majesty, they have brought
your late-night meal.

167
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,246
Your Majesty, did you suffer
from a nightmare?

168
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,417
I need to conquer the north
sooner than I had planned.

169
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,801
There is little time to waste.

170
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,262
Run and deliver this message
to General Lee.

171
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,027
Your Majesty, please give the order

172
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,280
to stop your conquest of the north.

173
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:55,895
Please do not do this, Your Majesty.

174
00:14:55,978 --> 00:15:01,025
Think of your pitiful people,
Your Majesty.

175
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:05,654
-Please do not do this, Your Majesty.
-Please do not do this, Your Majesty.

176
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,159
Why can you all not understand…

177
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:18,250
what I am attempting to do?

178
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,006
Your Majesty.

179
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:25,841
Your Majesty!

180
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,177
What are you doing?

181
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,012
Take His Majesty to his quarters.

182
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,765
Your Majesty, can you hear me?

183
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,900
Young Master, where are you going
looking like that?

184
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,568
I was called to the palace.
I will be right back.

185
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,278
Stop.

186
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,368
I told you that I need to hurry.

187
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,125
All done. You must hurry.

188
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,769
He has been healthy so far.
What has happened to him?

189
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,396
The energy in his liver
is trapped in place

190
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,314
because of his stress and worries.

191
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:26,235
If I make an incision and drain the boils,
the pain will go away in an instant.

192
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,903
-But…
-But?

193
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,491
How did the boils get bigger
so quickly overnight?

194
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,327
How bizarre. It does not make any sense.

195
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,622
I cannot administer the treatment.

196
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,749
You should call for the royal physician.

197
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,464
You are the head acupuncturist,
are you not?

198
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,134
I trust you.

199
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,847
Your Majesty, please wait
for the royal physician.

200
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,603
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

201
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,939
Se-yeop, apply the needle to my father.

202
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,693
What are you waiting for?
Treat His Majesty right away.

203
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,988
No, he must not.
Let us wait for the royal physician.

204
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,453
You need to hurry, sir.

205
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,538
All right.

206
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,754
What if His Majesty becomes even more ill
while waiting for the royal physician?

207
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,133
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

208
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,343
What if somebody used poison

209
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,596
to hasten his blood flow
and make the boils swell?

210
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,014
No, that cannot be.

211
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,516
This is an order.

212
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,020
Make this pain go away.

213
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:44,646
Quickly.

214
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,819
-Your Majesty.
-Se-yeop, just do it.

215
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,741
Se-yeop, you cannot.

216
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,034
You must not do it.

217
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,330
Se-yeop, hurry.

218
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,831
Do something.

219
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,462
I, the head acupuncturist Yoo Se-yeop,
shall treat His Majesty.

220
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,611
Blood?

221
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,413
This is not right.

222
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,165
This kind of bleeding is not normal.

223
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,796
-Your Majesty.
-What have you done?

224
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,506
Father.

225
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,800
Stop the bleeding, quickly.

226
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,468
Se-yeop, what happened?

227
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,857
You should not have made an incision
for his symptoms!

228
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,281
Look at what you have done!

229
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,930
That is the head acupuncturist,
Yoo Se-yeop.

230
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,974
Yoo Se-yeop, you are under arrest.

231
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,547
This is the needle that Physician Yoo used
when treating His Majesty.

232
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,048
It was custom-made,

233
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,759
so only a deadly poison
would change the color like this.

234
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,847
Someone dared to poison my father?

235
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,932
Who? How?

236
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,270
I do not know yet, Your Highness,
but I shall find out the truth.

237
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,274
-There is nothing here.
-Are you sure?

238
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:00,027
Were there any suspicious herbs or foods?

239
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,278
Nothing yet, sir.

240
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,196
What about the court ladies' rooms
and their belongings?

241
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,948
There was nothing unusual.

242
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,871
Please forgive me, sir.

243
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,166
Are you not a court lady
who works in the Royal Kitchen?

244
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,837
I am so terrified
I cannot bear it any longer.

245
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,548
I think,

246
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,593
I think that I may have
killed His Majesty.

247
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,307
I did not even know what that was.

248
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,769
I was simply told
that it was an herb from Qing.

249
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,696
Please take a closer look.

250
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,865
-I do not know what that is.
-Wait…

251
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,202
Do you have any idea what this is?

252
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,080
I have never seen it before in my life.

253
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,122
Hey.

254
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:59,169
Minister Yoo is digging through
the medicine collection records.

255
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,895
Poisonous herbs were collected and burnt

256
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,397
under the orders of the royal physician,
Shin Gwi-soo.

257
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,110
I must hurry and show this document
to the Crown Prince.

258
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,787
-I think he fell.
-What happened?

259
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,312
Young Master.

260
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,527
Minister Yoo…

261
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,909
Minister Yoo…

262
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,999
Minister Yoo has…

263
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,066
No.

264
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,318
That cannot be.

265
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,446
It cannot be true!

266
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,934
As you all know,

267
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,854
Minister Yoo fell from
his horse last night

268
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,190
and passed away.

269
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,235
This is another tragedy
in these sorrowful times.

270
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,154
However,

271
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,533
his death does not erase his crimes.

272
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,661
Minister of Personnel, Yoo Hoo-myung,

273
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:23,540
shall have his position taken away
and erased from the records

274
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,876
in order to hold him responsible
for the King's death

275
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,586
while he was the Overseer.

276
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,591
The financial powers
that were given to him

277
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,260
shall be forfeited as well.

278
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:39,639
As for his son, Yoo Se-yeop…

279
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,948
Although he was responsible
for the death of the King,

280
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:02,245
No royal physician has ever been
executed for this reason.

281
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:05,790
Therefore,

282
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,252
Yoo Se-yeop, the head acupuncturist,

283
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,671
shall be stripped of his title

284
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:15,550
and will be banned from entering Hanyang.

285
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:30,982
He is a physician

286
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,318
who made the King pass away
with the wrong treatment.

287
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,903
He should be executed.

288
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,613
Yes, he should be killed.

289
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,991
His Majesty ordered a harsh punishment
for Yoo Hoo-myung, who is dead,

290
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,785
to spare Yoo Se-yeop's life.

291
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:45,288
It is the first order
that he has given as our King.

292
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,457
So let us follow it.

293
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,841
Se-yeop, you must survive.

294
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,221
You are the only person
who can discover the truth now.

295
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,955
Miss.

296
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,916
That scared me. Gosh.

297
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,919
Dan, blood should appear

298
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,630
if it comes into contact with this herb.

299
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,173
So can I not see anything?

300
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,926
-Where do you think she got stabbed?
-Pardon?

301
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,345
I do not know.

302
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,848
Miss, you do not have the time
to do this right now.

303
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,767
I have told you that you need
to get your wedding dress fitted today.

304
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,687
She definitely was not poisoned.

305
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,773
The chickens that ate the rice
that was placed in this woman's mouth

306
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,109
must still be alive.

307
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,736
Let us go and check.

308
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,362
-Wait for just a moment.
-What?

309
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,240
No. They are all waiting for you.

310
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,658
We need to go, miss.

311
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,369
-Gosh.
-Fine.

312
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,495
Miss.

313
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,374
Did you sneak into the mortuary again
and look at a corpse?

314
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,127
If Lord Seo sees, he will be enraged.

315
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,755
Do not worry. I will make up
a good excuse for him.

316
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,549
Please, you cannot…

317
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,885
I will catch the perpetrator
and make you take the credit.

318
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,303
Just wait a moment.

319
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,063
You are still so young.

320
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,608
I think the other family
is hurrying too much.

321
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,736
Such a good husband
is hard to come by, ma'am.

322
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:43,740
Look at how smooth
and shiny the fabric is.

323
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,742
We just need to take in a few places, and…

324
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,788
-That hurts.
-Hey, be careful.

325
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,623
Are you all right, Eun-woo?

326
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,832
I apologize, miss.

327
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,670
This is it.

328
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,548
Thank you. We are all done, right?

329
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,843
-Hey, Eun-woo.
-Miss.

330
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,054
-Where are you going?
-Miss.

331
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,600
Where did all of the chickens go?

332
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,435
I saw them in the cage not long ago.

333
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,020
Maybe a tiger caught them.

334
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,273
I just looked at Ms. Choi's corpse.

335
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:18,942
And?

336
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,403
There was no bleeding.

337
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,489
So the officials thought she was poisoned,

338
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,158
and locked up the servant
who brought her breakfast.

339
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,785
Release the servant right away.

340
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:30,870
Right now?

341
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,957
We cannot release the servant
without the perpetrator.

342
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,922
The perpetrator killed Ms. Choi

343
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,925
by stabbing the top of her head
with a needle.

344
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,677
That is why there was no bleeding.

345
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,303
The perpetrator…

346
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,058
is the one who stole the chickens.

347
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,729
Why would Ms. Choi's murderer

348
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,481
steal the chickens
of the government office?

349
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,985
He was trying to disguise
the stabbing as a poisoning.

350
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:05,321
So the perpetrator was
trying to frame the servant.

351
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,994
What happens when rice is placed
in the mouth of someone poisoned?

352
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:14,831
Well, the poison will seep into the rice.

353
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,083
And if you feed that to the chicken?

354
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:21,170
Then the chicken that eats
the rice will die.

355
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,339
But what if the chicken does not die?

356
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:34,142
Then people will know
that the woman was not poisoned.

357
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,227
That is why the chickens were stolen.

358
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,856
-You are so smart, miss.
-That is right.

359
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,734
Then how are we going
to go and catch the perpetrator?

360
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:49,157
The perpetrator must have hidden
in a cave at Sorak Mountain.

361
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,583
All right.

362
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,044
Miss.

363
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,087
What are you going to do?

364
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,632
It is too dangerous to go alone.

365
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,102
There you are.

366
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:42,961
Hey.

367
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,756
How dare you steal the evidence
in a murder case?

368
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,044
Wait.

369
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,963
Wait, what are you doing?

370
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:14,886
So…

371
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,596
By any chance

372
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,348
have you seen my chickens?

373
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:23,770
You are heavy.

374
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,149
Oh, my.

375
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,406
ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLE CASE

376
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,283
HIGH-END TASSEL BELT

377
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,703
JADE PINS

378
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,541
You were…

379
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,130
not thinking of jumping from here,

380
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,383
were you?

381
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,763
Mind your own business.

382
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,225
You are a nobleman.

383
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,770
Someone who is from Hanyang.

384
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,730
And…

385
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,733
you are a physician.

386
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,862
You were in the Royal Infirmary, right?

387
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,993
How did you know that?

388
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,332
You have saved many other people

389
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,835
but why are you not trying
to save yourself?

390
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:36,217
There are things that you can only see,
hear, and feel when you are alive.

391
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,523
Look at those trees.

392
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,819
Have you ever seen a tree
break its own branch?

393
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,867
No, for trees do not break
their own branches.

394
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,244
But humans

395
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,164
break the hearts of their loved ones

396
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,417
and even their own.

397
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,053
Do not break yourself.

398
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,142
You are not someone who breaks people.

399
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,269
You save people, do you not?

400
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,738
Young Master.

401
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,866
What are you doing over there?

402
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,828
Please come back here.

403
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:29,789
Hurry.

404
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,918
Looks like you have a companion.

405
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,254
Oh, the chicken thief.

406
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:38,631
Well…

407
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,300
You will probably save a lot of people,

408
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,344
so please live, all right?

409
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,786
GYESU INFIRMARY

410
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,246
ONE YEAR LATER

411
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,086
Granny, time to eat.

412
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,464
Jang-goon, come eat.

413
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,687
What are you doing? Eat up.

414
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,023
You will get gastric cancer
if you eat burnt rice.

415
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:41,193
This is not burnt.
This is savory scorched rice.

416
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,612
What is a rag doing up on the table?

417
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,449
It is not a rag.
I cut it so that it is easier to eat.

418
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:47,366
Try it.

419
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,287
Then is this a "well stew"?

420
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,789
-It is pale like a well.
-Exactly.

421
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,543
Let us eat. You will not die from it.

422
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,378
We must survive until Nam-hae returns.

423
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,548
You are just being picky.
This is delicious.

424
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,553
What do we have in the herb inventory?

425
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,556
Two mals of Korean angelica,
one mal of goji,

426
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,974
one mal of milkvetch roots,
three mals of licorice,

427
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,851
two geuns of antlers,
and three geuns of ginseng.

428
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,062
We do not have any rehmannia
or barberry root.

429
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,647
We need to get more rehmannia.

430
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,816
-Granny.
-What?

431
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,568
What do you do after you wake up?

432
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,904
After I wake up?

433
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:25,905
I poop.

434
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,990
Measure my poop too.

435
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,534
One doe of dry poop,
and two doe of wet poop.

436
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,578
What about liquid poop?

437
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:33,621
You do not need to…

438
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,502
I told them not to rope dance.

439
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,920
Those rascals.

440
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,873
Chae-yeon, come here.

441
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,553
Young Master, we have
nothing more to sell.

442
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,811
No, we cannot sell this.

443
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,813
This was for passing
the Liberal Arts Exam.

444
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,398
That is why we should sell it.

445
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,984
I no longer have any use for it.

446
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:46,944
But…

447
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,731
Hey, are you all right?

448
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,236
Just keep playing the music.

449
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,592
Gosh, that tastes good.

450
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,385
What would you like?

451
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,638
I would like some jeho-tang.

452
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:59,558
We do not have something like that here.
All we have is rice wine.

453
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,477
I cannot drink.

454
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,064
Then I would like some cinnamon punch.

455
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,694
Hey!

456
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,613
What is wrong? Hey! Wake up!

457
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,032
Help!

458
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,159
Somebody help!

459
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,828
-What is going on?
-Hey, there is a physician.

460
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,664
He is a physician.

461
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,291
Please help.

462
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,337
-What if he dies?
-Oh, no.

463
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,298
Please save him.

464
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,300
-Oh, goodness.
-Help him.

465
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,932
-It is a needle.
-Is that a needle?

466
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,400
Why is he not doing anything?

467
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,991
-Come on, do something.
-Quickly.

468
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,164
Get out of the way.

469
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,178
-He is all right now.
-He is saved.

470
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,141
It is fine.

471
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,476
Thank you, sir.

472
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,313
How can I ever repay you?

473
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,440
Do not worry about paying me back.

474
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:35,321
I shall take care of this evil rice cake
that tried to kill you.

475
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,866
Of course. You can take them all.

476
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,367
Thank you.

477
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,661
-Thank you.
-Go drink some water.

478
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:43,871
-Water.
-Have some water.

479
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,205
-The rice cake…
-Goodness.

480
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:46,832
With those hands,

481
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,210
it will be hard
to practice as a physician.

482
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,465
I do not need somebody like you
to worry about me.

483
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,885
And here I was planning to fix your hands.

484
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:05,392
I am not interested in getting treated
by an alcoholic.

485
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,729
You are an idiot
who cannot even place needles.

486
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,731
I suppose you have not suffered enough.

487
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,400
If you change your mind,

488
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,695
you can come to find me at the infirmary
in the village down there

489
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,572
near the cassia tree.

490
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:17,774
Hey.

491
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,151
Wake up.

492
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,319
Hey.

493
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,866
You will probably save a lot of people,

494
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,409
so please live, all right?

495
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,007
Please.

496
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,660
Hey, wake up.

497
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:10,911
Hey.

498
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,247
Please wake up!

499
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,543
GYESU INFIRMARY

500
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:20,879
How many major veins are there?

501
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,258
Twenty…

502
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,135
eight?

503
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,178
That is right.

504
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,348
If you know the four major types,

505
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,725
bu, chim, ji, and sak,

506
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,519
you can identify most illnesses.

507
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,354
Here, try it.

508
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:46,989
Do you feel my pulse?

509
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:50,826
Dad, are you sick? I cannot feel anything.

510
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,870
Hey, I am not dead.
Of course my heart is beating.

511
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:57,082
Do not grab it so tightly.
Be gentle, like a feather.

512
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:59,543
You are indeed alive, Dad.

513
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:03,630
This is so frustrating.
I am getting more patients,

514
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,550
but I do not have anybody to help me out.

515
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:07,801
Is there a physician here?

516
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,720
Come outside.

517
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,432
Wait, you are…

518
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,809
You are that idiot from earlier.

519
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,227
She was drowning.

520
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,396
She is breathing, but her pulse is weak.

521
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:20,814
This way.

522
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:29,865
You need to place the needles
between her eyebrows and on her hands.

523
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:31,950
Stop running your mouth.

524
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,841
Where did such a pretty woman come from?

525
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:49,009
Change her clothes,

526
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,054
and massage her limbs with Granny
to improve blood circulation.

527
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:55,807
Get out.

528
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,018
Are you going to watch
as she gets changed?

529
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,030
Now that she is alive,

530
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,741
she just needs to have a bowl of tonic.

531
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,242
Hey.

532
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,536
You idiot, stop right there.

533
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,625
Where are you going in such a hurry?

534
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:25,796
She almost died.
Please take good care of her.

535
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:28,882
What the hell are you saying?
I asked you where you are going.

536
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,426
What?

537
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,178
"Hell"?

538
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:36,807
You cannot speak like that
to my young master.

539
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,267
And who may your young master be?

540
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,270
My young master

541
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:46,441
passed the Liberal Arts Exam
and the Medical Exam with flying colors,

542
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,985
and he is the son of Minister Yoo.

543
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,031
He performed so well
in the Royal Infirmary

544
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:56,868
that the King himself called him
the Top Acupuncturist.

545
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,418
You are from the Royal Infirmary?

546
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,421
I get it now.

547
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,715
People there are famous
for sucking up to others

548
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:13,510
rather than being good at acupuncture.

549
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:19,891
So you are like this
because you learned from those idiots?

550
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,769
You were shaking as you held the needle.

551
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:24,563
Jang-goon.

552
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,231
Yes.

553
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:34,364
-I am here. I need to boil poppy flowers.
-Go and get Chil-sung.

554
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,991
He can come to get these two.

555
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:36,908
Okay.

556
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:41,496
Jang-goon, what does Chil-sung do?

557
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,123
He is an officer of the government.

558
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,332
Let us see.

559
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:47,377
The tonic, acupuncture, and clothes.

560
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,337
That should be at least ten nyangs.

561
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,673
Give me ten nyangs or get arrested.

562
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:55,510
I saved somebody from drowning,
and you want me to pay you?

563
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,721
Then who else will pay me? Myself?

564
00:50:57,804 --> 00:51:00,182
Cut the nonsense.
If you do not want to get arrested,

565
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:02,517
then stay right here
until the patient wakes up.

566
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,610
The space inside this line belongs to you.

567
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,028
You heard that, right?

568
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:15,614
You are under my control now.

569
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,574
If you cross that line,

570
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:20,494
then that will be the end for you.

571
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:36,802
Hey.

572
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,095
I told you that you cannot drink.

573
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,680
Oh, come on.

574
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,183
I was going to have just one cup.

575
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,227
Do not give me that nonsense.

576
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:48,396
These guys need to stay with you
for tonight.

577
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:52,818
Sorry for bothering you.

578
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:56,404
Do not worry about it.
I am happy to have you here.

579
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,702
Here, drink.

580
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,705
Do not tell him to drink.

581
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,999
He changes into a different person
with alcohol.

582
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,793
Do not give him even a single drop.

583
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,630
Your life must be no fun.

584
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:17,717
Young Master, I have not seen bedsheets
in such a long time.

585
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,762
That feels so nice.

586
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,641
This feels divine.

587
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:27,686
Come on, lie down. I am not kidding.

588
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,442
Why would you sleep there instead of here?

589
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,547
Hey, come out here.

590
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,508
Come outside.

591
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,969
Coming.

592
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:10,020
Looks like my master is sleeping well
without nightmares.

593
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,314
This house must have good energy.

594
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:18,153
Young Master, get up.
Mr. Gye is calling for you.

595
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,155
Young Master.

596
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,582
Goodness, she really ran away.

597
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,837
My gosh, you saved her life,

598
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,173
and she stole your money
without saying goodbye?

599
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:42,052
This is why I kept you two here.

600
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,763
Hey, Chil-sung.

601
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:46,765
How is your mother's back nowadays?

602
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:49,267
When it is not raining,
she can even go to the market.

603
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,186
Bring her to see me some time.

604
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:54,689
I will either make the rain stop
or fix her back once and for all.

605
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,483
Thank you, Mr. Gye.

606
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:02,364
Right, then let us run the calculations.

607
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:06,493
The acupuncture is three nyangs,
and the tonic is five.

608
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,620
The clothes are two nyangs.

609
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,497
Are we still talking about money?

610
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:15,126
Hey, you should always be accurate
when you are calculating money.

611
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,461
Now, for the interest…

612
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:19,839
Just stop it.
You are a physician who saves people.

613
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,841
Why are you so obsessed with money?

614
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:26,638
-What the hell are you saying now?
-I have seen many corrupt physicians,

615
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:29,557
but I have never seen one like you
who likes alcohol and money,

616
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,018
and spews profanities so much.

617
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:41,820
I am already famous for being corrupt.

618
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,280
But,

619
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,409
you two obviously have no money.

620
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:52,956
And I need more workers at this infirmary
because we are so famous for being good.

621
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,668
So, I will be nice.

622
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,462
To pay ten nyangs for the treatment
and one nyang for the stay,

623
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:02,007
you will treat patients
at Gyesu Infirmary for 11 days.

624
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:05,343
If you do not, then you will be punished
by government officials.

625
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,803
What do you think?

626
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,763
Is that not kind of me?

627
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,099
Your fingerprint.

628
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,145
Do you think I will agree to this?

629
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:16,646
And if you disagree?

630
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:26,406
I am being considerate
because you are a physician.

631
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:29,159
I told you. I have never seen her before.

632
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,038
So you say.

633
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:37,125
Perhaps that widow fell in the water
while running away with you.

634
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,460
And after falling in the water,

635
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:41,713
she ran away
because she was not impressed with you.

636
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,341
What did you just say?

637
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:49,262
Hey, Young Master.

638
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:51,598
Goodness, how scary.

639
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,768
You brat. You are being very rude
just because I cussed at you once?

640
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,187
Fine, hit me.
I will make you pay for it too.

641
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,230
Hit me. Go on.

642
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,858
-Hit me.
-My goodness.

643
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:06,237
Young Master, it will do no good
to get involved

644
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,448
with the government office
while you are banished.

645
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,574
Just agree to it.

646
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,576
No, I cannot agree to such unfair terms.

647
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:14,370
You did not pay and committed fraud.

648
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,624
You will be arrested right away.

649
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:22,170
Young Master, I will get ten nyangs
tomorrow somehow.

650
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,880
Just agree to it, all right?

651
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,424
Come on.

652
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,552
Just do as I say, just for today.

653
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,684
I have followed your orders
for the past year.

654
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:39,479
Do you want to end all of this right here?

655
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,115
Relax. You might get hurt.

656
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,463
Here you go.

657
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,176
Ip-boon, it is time to visit the patients.

658
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,347
Patients will not come in the morning,
for they are all working in the fields.

659
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,932
Treat that guy first.

660
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,394
He does rope dancing but he has vertigo.

661
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:20,937
Take care of him.

662
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,647
Do not let him drink alcohol.

663
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,035
Dad, do you know those guys?

664
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:39,330
How do you know a nobleman
from the Royal Infirmary?

665
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:43,501
And he is the son of Minister Yoo.

666
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,879
He performed so well
in the Royal Infirmary

667
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:50,675
that the King himself called him
the Top Acupuncturist.

668
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,597
Come on, tell me. Do you know those guys?

669
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,057
Of course I do.

670
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,894
I have opened up countless corpses
during the war.

671
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,687
I know how people think.

672
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,315
That is not what I am asking.

673
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:07,484
You do not actually know them, do you?

674
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,569
You told strangers
to take care of a patient?

675
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:10,487
Is that fine?

676
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,156
He needs somewhere to lean on,

677
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:14,782
so he will not try anything stupid.

678
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,037
It is as if you know
something that I do not.

679
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,252
I have brought a royal physician
to feel your pulse,

680
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,088
-So do not worry.
-A royal physician?

681
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,760
May I see your wrist?

682
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,317
Bu, chim, ji, and sak.

683
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,278
You just had to figure out one of them,
and you found nothing.

684
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,864
I swear, I did not feel any of them.

685
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,241
She is totally crazy.

686
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:58,493
Her pulse was just
dancing around everywhere.

687
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:00,328
Why would a person's pulse be dancing?

688
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,455
Unbelievable!

689
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:07,085
I was so scared

690
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,297
to go into the water,

691
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:17,512
but she walked right in

692
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,348
without any hesitation.

693
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,810
All this happened
after she told me to live.

694
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,188
I am still alive,

695
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,899
so why…

696
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:41,703
How can you let a patient have alcohol?
And you call yourself a physician?

697
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,581
I am not a physician

698
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:47,834
anymore.

699
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,920
"Not a physician anymore"?

700
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,548
You are saying that
because you do not want to pay me back.

701
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,467
You are talking about money again.

702
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:03,683
I used to be called

703
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,354
the Top Acupuncturist.

704
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:11,024
But now,

705
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:14,193
I cannot place needles anymore.

706
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:19,032
I am no longer a physician!

707
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,116
Fine.

708
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:23,953
So because you were sad
about not being able to place needles,

709
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:26,664
you gave a vertigo patient alcohol?

710
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,249
That just means

711
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:32,045
that you do not know the first thing
about being a physician.

712
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,756
You just did not treat him
like a proper patient.

713
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,527
Anyway,

714
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:59,322
you have a long way to go.

715
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:07,622
All right, come at me.
I will fight you right back.

716
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:12,293
He never acts like this when he is sober.

717
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:15,171
He just goes crazy when he drinks alcohol.

718
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,665
Water…

719
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,423
Sir.

720
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,925
Am I going to die?

721
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:03,469
No,

722
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,221
at least not yet.

723
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,433
Thank you.

724
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,519
Thank you so much, sir.

725
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:13,980
Do not drink from now on.

726
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,358
Sir.

727
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:21,487
You see,

728
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,199
I really need to do rope dancing.

729
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:30,872
Life is meaningless
if I cannot dance on the rope.

730
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:37,545
I started drinking
because I could not enjoy life anymore.

731
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:41,841
Now I cannot go a single day
without drinking.

732
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:48,890
You are amazing.

733
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:50,850
Hey, this is nothing to applaud me for.

734
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:53,811
-How many?
-Four.

735
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,980
Only four? Here I go.

736
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:09,744
Sit down.

737
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,012
Watch what you eat, all right?

738
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:35,144
I will treat the vertigo patient.

739
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,605
But I will leave
as soon as I am done with him.

740
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:39,190
Please tear up the contract as well.

741
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,943
Of course you need to treat him.

742
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:45,530
But you need to give me something else
for a promise like that.

743
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:47,532
What else do you want from me?

744
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,953
Make him able to dance on the rope again.

745
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,122
If you cannot,
then that will be ten more days.

746
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:05,758
About three months ago,

747
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,927
I fell from the rope.

748
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:11,097
Ever since then, I have been unable
to rope dance without drinking.

749
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,982
As I have treated his alcohol poisoning,

750
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:23,025
I will begin treating his vertigo.

751
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,862
There are six types of vertigo,

752
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:29,365
but what you have
does not directly match any one of them.

753
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:32,618
I will treat you for peripheral vertigo,
which you seem to have symptoms for.

754
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:33,828
PERIPHERAL VERTIGO: A TYPE OF DIZZINESS

755
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:39,166
The foot.

756
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,335
The vein on the shin.

757
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:45,172
Then needles in the veins
of the hands and feet.

758
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:50,386
Goodness.

759
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:53,890
I feel very relaxed,
and my body feels strong.

760
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:57,685
I feel like I could go
and rope dance right now.

761
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,356
You will recover little by little.

762
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,358
Just thinking about being able
to rope dance again

763
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,987
makes me breathless with joy.

764
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:10,740
When I am on that rope,

765
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,618
everybody is under my feet.

766
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:17,705
It makes me feel
like I am on top of the world.

767
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:35,890
Mr. Gye!

768
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:39,226
Hey, take a look!

769
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:41,604
Mr. Gye, come outside.

770
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:46,150
After that physician
treated me yesterday, look!

771
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:48,945
I can do this now!

772
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:04,085
I should strike while the iron is hot.
I will go and try to rope dance.

773
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:08,839
You should come and watch.
I will put on a great show for you.

774
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,680
Wait for me.

775
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:19,266
You said I can leave if he can rope dance.

776
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,476
Have the contract ready.

777
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:39,620
Are you feeling dizzy? Do not overdo it.

778
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:42,707
I am fine.

779
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,375
No, I think you should come down.

780
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:45,668
I am fine!

781
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:47,795
If I go down right now,

782
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,256
I might never come back up.

783
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:19,326
-Hey.
-Hey!

784
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:24,123
I do not think it worked.

785
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,250
I do not think I can do it.

786
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,170
The treatment has just started.

787
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:30,171
No, that is not it.

788
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,006
I think…

789
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:35,509
something is seriously wrong with me.

790
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:37,511
Nothing is wrong with you.

791
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,972
Without acupuncture,
you will have to recover slowly.

792
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:42,058
What?

793
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:44,602
You did not use your needles?

794
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:47,605
Then how did you treat his vertigo?

795
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:52,651
I told you,
I cannot place my needles anymore.

796
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:56,447
You are not an idiot, you are a fraud.

797
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,657
You must not even be a real physician.

798
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,618
My young master is an amazing man.

799
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:02,870
He was even called the Top Acupuncturist.

800
01:08:02,953 --> 01:08:05,498
He is simply like this
because of the shock.

801
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:07,583
This is all temporary, I swear.

802
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,085
Then try to place a needle.

803
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:12,463
I want to see if the damage
is temporary or permanent.

804
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:17,551
What?

805
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:21,180
Do you carry around that needle case
to commit fraud?

806
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:41,200
If I had rope danced just one more time,

807
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:43,702
I would not be so sad.

808
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:47,873
If I had known that day
would be my last time on the rope,

809
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:51,460
I would have been on the rope
for so much longer.

810
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:53,087
What?

811
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:56,507
Are you feeling guilty
because you think it is your fault?

812
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:59,093
Or are you sympathetic
because you see yourself in him?

813
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:04,098
Vertigo itself is not that hard to treat.

814
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,977
But something else seems
to be the problem for him.

815
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,771
He thinks he will die
without rope dancing.

816
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:15,192
That obsession has given birth
to a mental illness.

817
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:21,157
Life is meaningless

818
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,033
if I cannot dance on the rope.

819
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:24,368
I am not a physician

820
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:27,037
anymore.

821
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,498
Please.

822
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:17,338
Try going on the rope.

823
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:19,757
What?

824
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,593
Close your eyes and get on the rope.

825
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:25,679
That rope is your entire world.

826
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,598
So you could do it with your eyes closed.

827
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:31,060
Do not cry.

828
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:35,147
You said you wanted to rope dance
just one last time, right?

829
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,440
Well, here is your chance.

830
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:40,319
It is on the ground.

831
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:42,321
A rope does not have to be up in the sky.

832
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:45,074
A rope does not always
have to be above everybody else.

833
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:15,354
Play the music, please.

834
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:19,191
Let us play!

835
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:31,912
When I am on that rope,

836
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:34,331
everybody is under my feet.

837
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,501
I am the king,

838
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:40,504
and I am the sky.

839
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:45,968
On this rope,

840
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:50,264
I own the world.

841
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:07,656
You have to be kidding me.

842
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:28,510
Is that what they teach you
at the Royal Infirmary?

843
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:32,139
Using your tongue to sway people's hearts?

844
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:35,142
All right.

845
01:12:35,225 --> 01:12:38,937
He was trying to figure out
which instrument to play.

846
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:43,692
Now that he has something to do
besides rope dancing, he will live.

847
01:12:45,944 --> 01:12:48,947
Is being unable to place your needles
really so embarrassing?

848
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:55,245
Now that my patient found a way to live,
I shall take my leave.

849
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,874
If you cannot do acupuncture,
perform moxibustion.

850
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:01,001
If you cannot perform moxibustion,
use tonics.

851
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:05,339
Or you can use your words
to save your patients.

852
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,300
Running away will
not solve anything, you idiot.

853
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:11,970
If you are suffering, then yell for help,

854
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,514
wave your arms around,

855
01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:18,227
or you could even
listen to an alcoholic like me.

856
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:22,898
Then you can start living again.
Just like that vertigo patient.

857
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:31,198
Seeing that you do not understand,
you are as dumb as you look.

858
01:13:31,281 --> 01:13:34,410
Anyway, since you did not make him
actually rope dance,

859
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:37,746
you need to work here
for 20 more days as we agreed.

860
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:04,398
Are you not going to eat?

861
01:14:04,481 --> 01:14:06,150
There is egg in it too.

862
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:09,153
Do I really need to visit the patients?

863
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:11,238
That was not part of the contract.

864
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:14,992
The contract said nothing
about not visiting patients either.

865
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:19,663
Delicious.

866
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:27,087
Your energy is not circulating.

867
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:29,047
Have you been stressed recently?

868
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:31,383
How did you know that?

869
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,844
You are in pain
because your energy is not circulating.

870
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:36,805
The pain is concentrated in your neck,
so it is hard to swallow.

871
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:39,016
This very old physician

872
01:14:39,099 --> 01:14:42,102
will prescribe the right tonic for you.

873
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:46,440
Yes, ma'am.
I shall prepare the tonic right away.

874
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,239
Since I am done, I shall leave.

875
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,543
Sir, can you please save my lady?

876
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:08,504
-Excuse me, I am…
-Hurry.

877
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:12,633
This way. Hurry.

878
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:04,017
Physicians from Hanyang are just better.

879
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:06,353
His face is the perfect medicine.

880
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:08,689
There is a patient here!

881
01:16:08,772 --> 01:16:11,149
Stop being nosy
about other people's business.

882
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,818
It hurts right here, does it not?

883
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,112
Stop right there!

884
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:17,114
You have killed your husband.

885
01:16:17,197 --> 01:16:19,533
My son is dead because of you.

886
01:16:19,616 --> 01:16:21,702
Just listen to what the patients
have to say.

887
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:23,954
Try to cheer up those who are furious too.

888
01:16:24,037 --> 01:16:26,540
Why do you keep trying to save me? Why?

889
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:28,375
Will you give me a chance
to save you then?

890
01:16:28,458 --> 01:16:31,253
I will find a reason for you to live.

891
01:16:32,337 --> 01:16:37,134
