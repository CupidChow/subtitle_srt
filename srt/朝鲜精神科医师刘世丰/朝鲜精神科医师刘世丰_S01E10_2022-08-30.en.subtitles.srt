1
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:35,368
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,830
I killed the previous King

3
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:41,332
with my own hands.

4
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,215
That is the reason

5
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,385
I was banished from the royal palace,

6
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,512
and why I cannot
perform acupuncture anymore.

7
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,056
Also,

8
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,809
somebody has been chasing after me
because of what happened.

9
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,357
I do not want to leave.

10
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,693
But…

11
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,905
I must reveal the truth.

12
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,117
Will you…

13
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,954
wait for me?

14
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,465
No.

15
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,472
You should do what you need to do.

16
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:42,435
Go and reveal the truth.

17
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,983
But I will not just stay and do nothing.

18
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,568
I am going to find a way, too.

19
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,615
Together. Just like right now.

20
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,723
Did Councilor Cho order this?

21
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,541
Hurts a bit, does it not?

22
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,467
You would have ruined everything
without me.

23
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,677
You should thank me.

24
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,897
You can run, but you cannot hide.

25
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,566
That is what you get, you arrogant prick.

26
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,715
Looks like this is mine now.

27
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,820
JEON GYU-HYEONG
YOO HOO-MYUNG, GYE JI-HAN, SHIN GWI-SOO

28
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,994
Who on earth managed to use the dan sedge

29
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,912
while avoiding being discovered?

30
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,499
Why did Inspector Cho
come to Sorak County?

31
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,376
To kill me?

32
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,378
To find evidence?

33
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,013
Mr. Yoo.

34
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,348
I am coming in.

35
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,295
CHO SHIN-WOO, CHO TAE-HAK

36
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,635
So Shin-woo is involved in this as well.

37
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,474
I do not know anything for sure yet.

38
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,560
Do you think Councilor Cho sent him?

39
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,774
This belongs to

40
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,776
Mr. Yoo?

41
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,739
Maybe this needle case
has something to do with all this.

42
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,575
Did something happen?

43
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:08,910
A couple of nights ago,

44
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,704
Shin-woo got very surprised when he heard

45
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,748
that this was yours.

46
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,418
Maybe Shin-woo knows about

47
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:21,089
the thing that you are looking into.

48
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,348
We should go and ask him.

49
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,689
What do you mean, he left?

50
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,150
He was called to Uigeumbu last night,

51
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,653
and I could not find him
in his quarters this morning.

52
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,155
He probably left in a hurry.

53
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,198
My goodness.

54
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,868
He could have told us
that he was leaving, you know?

55
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,915
He would not have left
without a single word.

56
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,125
I wonder what happened.

57
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,837
But those who are after you
are like wild beasts.

58
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,798
They will only stop
once they have torn you apart.

59
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,049
They are cruel men.

60
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,427
I think Inspector Cho may be in danger.

61
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,222
Where are you going?

62
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,352
You must take this mountain path
to go to the government office.

63
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:21,941
Look at this.

64
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,908
It is blood.

65
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,596
Inspector Cho.

66
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,849
Inspector Cho.

67
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:55,766
Wake up.

68
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,314
We must take you to the infirmary.
Hold onto me.

69
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,357
No.

70
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,695
You must not tell anybody

71
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,739
that I am alive.

72
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,162
Inspector Cho.

73
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,247
Inspector Cho.

74
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,058
Who on earth did this?

75
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,563
The adopted son of Councilor Cho,
who was trying to kill me, was attacked.

76
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,023
Who did it?

77
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,149
Why was he attacked?

78
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,486
You need to wake up.

79
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,572
I am not letting you die like this.

80
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,627
I took care of him, sir.

81
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,678
How weak.

82
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,017
Your Majesty.

83
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,728
You have not been tending
to your country's affairs for days,

84
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,772
and now you are not even
showing your face.

85
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,150
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

86
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,237
The sores on my legs
have gotten so terrible

87
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,823
that it is hard for me
to even remain seated.

88
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,993
-Sores?
-Sores?

89
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,829
Therefore,

90
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,833
I wish to visit the hot springs in Onyang.

91
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,919
Famine has spread throughout the land.

92
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,213
The journey to Onyang may be too far.

93
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,675
It may worsen your condition,
Your Majesty.

94
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,138
I would like to recover at Onyang,

95
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,974
just as my predecessors did.

96
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,935
I hope that you will all understand.

97
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,606
Yes, Your Majesty.

98
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,399
Your good health means

99
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,943
the prosperity of our country, after all.

100
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,112
We will get everything ready,
Your Majesty.

101
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,615
Since my illness is very serious,

102
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,783
I would like to leave as soon as I can.

103
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,161
Yes, Your Majesty.

104
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,960
He is heading to his royal villa already?

105
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,879
But he just ascended to the throne.

106
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,714
Well, he is ill.

107
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,469
He suddenly wants
to go to his royal villa?

108
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,848
Councilor Cho.

109
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,226
They found the court lady
from the Royal Kitchen, Wol.

110
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,646
But His Majesty

111
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,024
has her, sir.

112
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:50,983
What?

113
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,286
I get it now.

114
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,583
Call Soon-man right away.

115
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,542
Yes, sir.

116
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,931
What happened?

117
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,183
Who tried to kill you?

118
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,770
You need to take Eun-woo and go back.

119
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,816
You will be in danger if you stay with me.

120
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,484
Inspector Cho.

121
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,072
It looks like you saved my life yet again.

122
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,161
Do you know something
about my needle case?

123
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:48,791
Please tell me. Does it have something
to do with my father?

124
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,795
Are you asking me to repay my debt?

125
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,221
Your late father

126
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,641
was holding
a discolored needle in his hand.

127
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:11,981
I was investigating the case
as an advisor to the police chief.

128
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,860
But…

129
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,989
I no longer have that needle.

130
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:23,784
I think

131
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,790
the man who stabbed me took it with him.

132
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,750
Who was it?

133
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,429
Here, Jang-goon, you can have one.

134
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,349
And I can have two.

135
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,851
Come on.

136
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,229
It is so good.

137
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,483
You know, Mr. Yoo was acting
so weird today.

138
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,819
Well, my young master
is always acting very weird.

139
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,739
But I saw him taking a bunch of food

140
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,199
-and sneaking it out.
-What?

141
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,742
Eun-woo was acting weird, too.

142
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,452
She carried out some food earlier.

143
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,121
My scorched rice basket was empty too.

144
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,708
Right. If they stole
from his scorched rice basket too,

145
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,461
it is obvious.

146
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,087
-What?
-What is going on?

147
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,259
The two of them…

148
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,224
are obviously dating.

149
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,266
What?

150
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,809
They are dating?

151
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,103
-They are dating?
-They are dating?

152
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,731
So they are finally dating.

153
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,441
What? What do you think?

154
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,444
-The two of them must have…
-Yes.

155
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,655
settled down in secret.

156
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,156
-What?
-What?

157
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,033
Is that not a big deal?

158
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,202
They cannot get married.

159
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,162
No, there is no way.

160
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,249
See, my young master has
never dated before.

161
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,292
He does not have the guts for that.

162
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,546
You can never be too sure
about romantic relationships.

163
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,009
We should take a look
at where Poong settled down.

164
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,637
Wait, no.

165
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:11,267
No. Just wait, Jang-goon.

166
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,062
They are dating.

167
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,654
Well…

168
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,784
Have you eaten dinner yet?

169
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,874
Yes. We ate outside.

170
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,126
Where?

171
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,340
-Do you want some honey cookies?
-Honey cookies…

172
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,342
Yes. You two can share one.

173
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,722
They are kind of alike.

174
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,168
Inspector Cho.

175
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,045
He has not even recovered yet.

176
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,464
His wound will reopen if he moves around.

177
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,798
He could not have gone far.

178
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:25,841
Let us look for him.

179
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,984
That inspector

180
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:48,530
was asking about a herb
that could discolor a needle, right?

181
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,324
Yes, he was.

182
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:58,248
This is the needle that he showed you.

183
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,960
Do you know what it is?

184
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,587
Did you find out anything about it?

185
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,216
I played dumb
because I did not want to get arrested.

186
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,971
But this is not a normal needle.

187
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,808
It is used to cut open boils.

188
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,938
So that is what it is?

189
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,650
Yes. It looks very precious.

190
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,446
Did you get a good look?

191
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,909
I want an answer as soon as possible.

192
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,329
Make sure to keep your tongue in check.

193
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,666
Of course, sir.

194
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,672
Anyway, did you bring what I asked for?

195
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,009
Yes, sir. It is right here.

196
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,679
Let me see.

197
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,940
Very nice.

198
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:20,330
If that idiot goes to Hanyang
without a plan…

199
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,460
Minister Yoo died
while he was looking into them.

200
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,670
So you better get lost

201
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,213
if you do not have a death wish.

202
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,924
But…

203
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,136
I cannot just hide it forever.

204
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,556
We are not seeing any more patients today.
Come back tomorrow.

205
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,981
Who is here at this hour?

206
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,872
Are you the physician?

207
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,499
As for him, this is…

208
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,881
I heard that there is
a very skilled young physician here.

209
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,509
Where is he?

210
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,428
A young physician?

211
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,889
Yes.

212
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:22,184
I would like to see the young physician
from the Royal Infirmary.

213
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,647
And how did you find out
about that young physician?

214
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,525
I am going to Hanyang
for my liberal arts exam,

215
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,693
but I was not feeling well,
so I ended up here.

216
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,862
Everybody in this village

217
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,115
was praising this young physician.

218
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,034
I told you, we are closed for the day.

219
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,913
Right, you can come back another day.

220
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,969
No, we are not seeing any more patients.

221
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,566
If it is very urgent,
we do offer some late-night care.

222
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,985
What are you talking about? Since when--

223
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,444
Go to your room.

224
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,824
If it is later at night,
you will have to pay an extra fee.

225
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,702
But getting better is more important
than money, right?

226
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,246
I will pay you what I have already paid

227
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,498
for the extra fee.

228
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,750
You can come inside right away.

229
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,545
This way, please. Come on.

230
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,676
You go inside.

231
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,582
I thought the young physician
was going to treat me.

232
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,544
He is my assistant.
I sent him on an errand.

233
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,214
I will feel your pulse
while we wait for him.

234
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,052
My goodness.

235
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,848
Your eyes are bloodshot,
and you have sores on your tongue.

236
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,892
You have a lot of heat in your sangcho.

237
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:30,729
I am sure you are always feeling ill.

238
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,397
That is right.

239
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,942
I always suffer from minor illnesses,

240
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,110
so I have to visit physicians
all the time.

241
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:42,241
Your servant is so skinny,
but you have so much fat on your belly.

242
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,034
So your energy cannot circulate.

243
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,078
You brought that upon yourself.

244
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,586
Then what should I do?

245
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,465
You should find a physician
who genuinely treats his patients,

246
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,592
not one who is after money and fame.

247
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,053
When you are looking for a physician,

248
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,682
consider his skill and personality.

249
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,655
We can look for him again
when the sun rises.

250
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,287
Hey! Where have you been all day?

251
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,038
Has he been up to no good again?

252
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,792
Who is there so late at night?

253
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,463
Some rich young guy
who will take a liberal arts exam.

254
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,965
He seemed suspicious at first,

255
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:43,051
but it looks like
he will be a precious customer.

256
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,053
What? Who is he?

257
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,514
Watch him while I go get the herbs

258
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,974
so that he does not run away.

259
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,700
-Your Majesty.
-Lower your voice.

260
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,162
Se-yeop.

261
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,331
Have you been well, Your Majesty?

262
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,833
You have gotten thinner.

263
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,586
It must have been hard for you.

264
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,381
-Your Majesty.
-You may raise your head.

265
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,967
Today, I am here to meet my old friend.

266
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,802
But…

267
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,098
I only picked out the very best…

268
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:31,892
What are you doing?

269
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:34,978
Here.

270
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,944
You must always be going around
drinking, gambling,

271
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,238
and seeing women.

272
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,325
Well, here is some medication.

273
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,160
It will heal your eyes

274
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,413
and get rid of that heat in your sangcho.

275
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,085
Mr. Gye, your finger looks stiff.
I think you have mamokjeung.

276
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,586
Hey.

277
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,629
Are you blind?

278
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,506
He is so young, but he is so fat.

279
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,550
He will be dead in a year or two.

280
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,260
You will crawl back to me later.

281
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,138
Just treat your illnesses
using this medication, and--

282
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,306
Get up.

283
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:12,766
Just go to bed.

284
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,726
-What? What is it?
-I will explain later.

285
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,686
Just go to your room tonight.

286
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,772
-Make sure to get a lot of money.
-Please go.

287
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,655
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

288
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,365
He means well, I swear.

289
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:31,868
He is a skilled physician who used to be
in the Royal Infirmary.

290
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,787
The Royal Infirmary?

291
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,374
I see.

292
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,043
Everything he said made sense.

293
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,212
But…

294
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,965
What are you doing
in the countryside, Your Majesty?

295
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,384
Did you come all the way here to meet me?

296
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,348
I have a favor to ask of you.

297
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,477
A court lady from the Royal Kitchen
is being brought here.

298
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,062
Please help her.

299
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:03,650
A court lady from the Royal Kitchen?

300
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,652
The maid of honor
asked for her to be found

301
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,821
even at the cost of her own life.

302
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,659
We have a lot to talk about.

303
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,203
Please, sit.

304
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,266
You are saying…

305
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:40,187
That my father was looking
into the previous King and that needle?

306
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,025
The court lady who is coming here
right now

307
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,943
probably knows something about this.

308
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:51,239
You must treat her.

309
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,366
Yes, Your Majesty.

310
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:57,746
What exactly does
she need treatment for, though?

311
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,508
What is it?

312
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,483
Are you all right?

313
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:29,819
Come on, wake up.

314
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,785
I must go back now.

315
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,290
I will trust you with the rest.

316
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,001
Yes, Your Majesty.
I will do everything that I can.

317
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,804
-What happened?
-I am sorry, Your Majesty.

318
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,306
She got spooked for some reason
and ran away.

319
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,393
She was only frightened, Your Majesty.

320
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,355
You must save her. Do you understand?

321
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,233
You need to reveal the truth.

322
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,401
Yes, Your Majesty.

323
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,573
GYESU INFIRMARY

324
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,588
And who the hell is she?

325
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,756
How could you?

326
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,217
Be quiet.

327
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,220
His Majesty asked me to treat her.

328
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,349
What are you talking about? "His Majesty"?

329
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,654
-The King?
-The King?

330
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,036
You must have been out of your mind!

331
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,288
Did you really try
to take His Majesty's money?

332
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:06,333
It was not just money.
I heard he insulted His Majesty too.

333
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,127
You have some guts.

334
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,714
I heard he wagged his finger
at His Majesty

335
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,717
and scolded him like a child.

336
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,971
"Look at all that belly fat.:

337
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,392
That is what Mr. Gye said.

338
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,563
Your acting is stellar.

339
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,025
Wait, if he really did that
to His Majesty,

340
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,860
then we could all…

341
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,487
We could all, what?

342
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,406
Get arrested and then executed!

343
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:42,410
We will get beaten
before we are executed, too!

344
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,287
You crazy jerk.

345
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,581
You are crazy.

346
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,041
-Crazy.
-Jeez.

347
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,502
It looks like
I will have to open up an inn here.

348
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,171
Yes. My goodness.

349
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,673
He really should not have pointed
his finger at him.

350
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,217
My goodness.

351
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,102
She is awake.

352
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,562
Thank goodness. I thought she was dead.

353
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,815
Gosh. You scared us!

354
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,239
What is your name?

355
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,203
Do you not know your name and age?

356
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,580
Hey, do not scare her.

357
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,209
Where are you from?

358
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,502
Have you eaten yet?

359
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,630
Stop asking her questions.
She obviously cannot talk.

360
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,924
Yes, I guess she cannot talk.

361
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,217
I see.

362
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,511
Well, since you are awake,
you have got to eat.

363
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,263
I will bring some rice porridge.

364
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,312
You are awake.

365
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,400
Thank goodness.

366
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,615
It is all right. You are safe here.

367
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,118
They will protect you.

368
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,249
Yes, we will protect you.

369
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,420
Councilor Cho.

370
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:19,507
Thank you for calling me here again.
It is my greatest honor.

371
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,847
Just give me an order, sir.
I will do anything.

372
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,601
I am your true servant now.

373
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:37,942
A girl will go to Sorak County
and look for Se-yeop.

374
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:43,448
When you find her, notify me right away
and keep an eye on where she goes.

375
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,784
I will go down there myself.

376
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,202
Yes, sir.

377
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,244
Do not worry.

378
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,540
You know how I took care

379
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,418
of Inspector Cho too, right?

380
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,837
-Nice and clean.
-You must not act rashly.

381
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:08,723
I have something to offer to you, sir.

382
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:21,820
What is it?

383
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:26,491
This is a drug that seduces people.

384
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,369
If you try this once,

385
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:32,664
you will be seeing both heaven and hell,

386
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,666
and you will keep coming back for more.

387
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:38,002
You will end up selling
all of your livestock and your house,

388
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:42,507
and even your life.

389
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,426
How sinful.

390
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,346
The profit that I got
from selling a box of martens

391
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:51,349
is nothing compared
to the profit that I got

392
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,600
from selling this, sir.

393
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:57,564
You could even have Joseon
in the palm of your hand

394
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,233
if you wanted to.

395
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,989
That is easier said than done.

396
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,200
It is like trying to cover the sky
with your palm.

397
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,537
But you are my only sky, Councilor Cho.

398
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,998
You can be the sky

399
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,834
for everybody, sir.

400
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,422
You really are something else.

401
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,651
Thank goodness that
I did not bring this one out.

402
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:47,030
I will find a good time to use it later.

403
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:53,912
Gosh, I am smart.

404
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,501
She is not talking at all.

405
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:05,465
Her blood clot was due to shock,
and it is blocking the way to her heart.

406
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,676
We should use wonjihwan and bokshinsan.

407
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,345
All right.

408
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,722
Then I will place a needle
to help her calm down.

409
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,070
Do you not want to get better?

410
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,614
I promise that this will help.

411
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,661
Are you really so scared of it?

412
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,829
I cannot perform acupuncture on her.

413
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,332
You are right.

414
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,714
What is with the weather?

415
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,553
What?

416
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,687
-What?
-What?

417
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,481
-Here!
-Oh, no!

418
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,199
You crazy old woman!

419
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,118
Do you know how much these clothes cost?

420
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,577
Why did you come back?

421
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,663
It is a ruckus every time you come here.

422
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,498
That is no way to talk to your elders.

423
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,250
You there, teach her some manners.

424
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,710
I will deal with you later.

425
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,214
Hey.

426
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,591
What do you want now?

427
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,718
From now on,

428
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:35,013
you need to pay an entrance fee
whenever you come to our infirmary.

429
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,180
What?

430
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,557
Look at you.

431
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,058
I am your guest.

432
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,602
You should be asking me to come inside.

433
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:45,481
I am a paying customer, all right?

434
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,567
If you are not about to die, just leave.

435
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,777
We are pretty busy here.

436
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,988
That's why I need to go inside

437
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,032
so that I can receive detailed treatment.

438
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,159
Hey.

439
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:57,952
Let me go inside.

440
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,173
I washed the rag.

441
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,424
It is really clean now.

442
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,552
Good work, Granny.

443
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,763
You. Get lost.

444
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,767
What is so special
about that girl, anyway?

445
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,477
What is there to look for and hide?

446
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,270
Who cares? It is none of my business.

447
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,444
What really matters is that I am so close

448
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,196
to acquiring Gyesu Infirmary.

449
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,998
I would like to know what caused you

450
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,833
to lock up your heart so tightly.

451
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:56,594
If you would like to say something,
you can write it down.

452
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,392
Here.

453
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,083
It is all right.

454
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,212
You do not have to write it down.

455
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:49,272
I am afraid that Soon-man
came here for a reason.

456
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:54,110
I will see if there is a monastery
that we can go to.

457
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,153
Yes.

458
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,248
What should I do?

459
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,294
According to the Five Minds
Mutual Restriction Therapy,

460
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,337
only happiness

461
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,965
can overcome stress and worry.

462
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,552
Man-bok.

463
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,055
What might make her happy?

464
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,311
I heard that a lot of court ladies

465
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,646
fake being sick

466
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,690
so they can go and see their families.

467
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,818
She will love
getting to see her family again.

468
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:02,762
What on earth…

469
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,185
Wol, try drinking this.

470
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,533
Wol.

471
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,868
Wol.

472
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,382
Wol.

473
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,520
-We need to bring her inside.
-All right.

474
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,863
Is she breathing?

475
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,534
Yes. She might appear lifeless,
but she is still alive.

476
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,036
Eun-woo, place a needle
on cheondol, hwagae, and okdang.

477
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,954
Yes.

478
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,847
You are…

479
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,517
I am going to place a needle
on cheondol, hwagae, and okdang.

480
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,688
She is the girl from before.

481
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,356
From before?

482
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:51,829
One,

483
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,164
two,

484
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,373
three.

485
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,215
She has damganjeung.

486
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,300
The worst is over now.

487
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,302
She will wake up with a needle on geogwol.

488
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,179
All right.

489
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,479
Do you know her?

490
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,065
Yes.

491
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,983
I only just recognized her

492
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,611
when I saw the moles on her chest.

493
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:30,368
Her chest?

494
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,203
Yes.

495
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,372
They are in the shape of a triangle.

496
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,499
I remember thinking
that it was quite unique.

497
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:42,880
Mr. Yoo.

498
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,549
Were you a playboy
back at the royal palace?

499
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,220
What?

500
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,224
I bet you were.
All handsome guys are like that.

501
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,184
I knew it.

502
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:56,936
Gosh…

503
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,271
What the…

504
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,368
No.

505
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,703
There was nothing like that between us.

506
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,293
It is not true.

507
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:29,385
The court lady is with Se-yeop, sir.

508
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,766
Did I not tell you
to watch her movements carefully?

509
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,767
Of course I am, sir.

510
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:41,230
My slaves have been watching them

511
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,648
all day and all night.

512
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,405
Lead the way.

513
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:53,284
I shall end this myself.

514
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,505
It is all right.

515
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,424
It is all right.

516
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:13,804
You remember me,

517
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,308
do you not?

518
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,693
You can take your time.

519
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,112
Until you are ready to tell me

520
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,780
what is on your mind.

521
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,245
Do you miss your home?

522
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,498
Your family?

523
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,102
Do not worry. I will go with you.

524
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,732
What is going on?

525
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:09,235
Who made her cry?

526
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,028
Why did you do that?

527
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:14,031
My goodness, Mr. Yoo.
You are always making girls cry.

528
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:16,784
Young Master, can you explain
what is going on?

529
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,369
I did not do anything.

530
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,538
She is crying
because I brought up her family.

531
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,917
Oh, my goodness.

532
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,836
Do not cry.

533
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,589
It is all right.

534
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:33,926
You are all right.

535
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,392
I did not…

536
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:49,650
That poor girl.
I wonder what she went through.

537
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:54,572
Something must have happened
to her family.

538
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,411
So that is why she convulsed

539
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,745
and passed out, then?

540
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:06,000
She must have gone straight back home
after she ran away from the royal palace.

541
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,794
But now she is not saying anything.

542
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,472
She must have gone through
something unbearable.

543
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,186
That is the reason

544
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,564
we are going back to her home.

545
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,443
Would that not make it harder for her?

546
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,069
It is still her home.

547
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,780
She grew up there,

548
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,907
and that is where she spent
her happiest days.

549
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:43,370
I think she will get better
if she can remember those good times.

550
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,886
I think that

551
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:03,015
you cannot talk right now

552
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,933
because you have too many worries.

553
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:12,858
But do not let yourself suffer too much.

554
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,526
Do not hide from it.

555
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:20,658
There must be some happy and fun memories

556
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,242
mixed in with those worries, too.

557
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,712
I would like to help you remember
those memories back at home.

558
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,803
Do you not want to go?

559
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:47,559
Do this if you do not want to go.

560
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:52,523
What do you think? Do you want to or not?

561
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,028
If you do,

562
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:01,031
then the people at Gyesu Infirmary
and I will go with you.

563
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,368
You are not alone anymore.

564
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,556
I have never been outside Sorak County.

565
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,266
This is so fun.

566
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,602
Pretty, right?

567
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:31,979
Where is mine?

568
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,150
What is the occasion?

569
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,450
Inspector Cho is still injured.

570
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,784
I wonder where he went.

571
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,663
I am worried that something else
might happen to him.

572
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,499
Do not worry too much.

573
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,502
Shin-woo is strong.
He is very good with his sword.

574
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,505
It sounds like you trust him very much.

575
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,091
I have known him since we were little.

576
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,554
You must have a lot
of good memories together.

577
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,931
Yes.

578
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:13,812
But what I have right now
is much more important to me.

579
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,326
I want one too.

580
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,179
-We should get settled down.
-Yes.

581
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:48,722
Jang-goon.

582
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:52,100
Can you stay here
with Eun-woo and Wol for a moment?

583
00:46:55,646 --> 00:47:00,192
We will wait over there.

584
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,211
My gods.

585
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,507
How despicable!

586
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,179
I was right.

587
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,307
Ip-boon, go and get
some water with granny.

588
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,643
Man-bok, follow me.

589
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,353
We should clean this up.

590
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,394
Your house looks very warm.

591
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,739
-Ta-da.
-Ta-da.

592
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,013
I am about to starve to death.

593
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,641
You only think about food!

594
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,935
Yes, that is right.

595
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:02,147
I do not care about any books or scholars.
I just want food.

596
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,107
Wol.

597
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,568
Let me know if you want to eat anything.

598
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,362
I will make you anything you want.

599
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,072
Really?

600
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,949
Then we should eat beef.

601
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,619
Wol, you want beef, right?

602
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,580
Beef.

603
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,726
What is this, Dad?

604
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:34,114
You want to talk with me
through your drawings?

605
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,517
A brazier? Is it a brazier?

606
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:31,338
Young Master, I am going
to find some herbs.

607
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,297
Sure.

608
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,012
Jang-goon, could you get me
some Korean angelica

609
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:40,722
-and rehmannia from the room?
-Yes.

610
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,646
I am sure you miss them

611
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,649
so very much.

612
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,946
I also lost my father,

613
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,824
the only family that I had left.

614
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:46,246
You might have known him, too.

615
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:50,876
Do you remember Minister Yoo Hoo-myung?

616
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,005
Would everything have been fine

617
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:00,427
if I had not performed acupuncture
on the king back then?

618
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:07,934
If I had not been so arrogant,

619
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,313
then

620
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,484
my father might still be alive.

621
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,656
Those thoughts

622
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:27,245
have been haunting me every single night.

623
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:38,214
I want to apologize to you, too.

624
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,676
Maybe

625
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,681
everything that is hurting you right now

626
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,101
was caused because of me.

627
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:55,857
So, I hope you will not suffer too much

628
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,195
or blame yourself for any of this.

629
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:04,449
It is

630
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,828
all my fault.

631
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:30,684
What are you up to, Jang-goon?

632
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:41,736
Butterfly.

633
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:52,414
Mr. Yoo.

634
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,665
It is a butterfly.

635
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,375
She drew a butterfly.

636
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,381
So she was not scared of the needles,

637
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,425
but the butterfly on the hinge?

638
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,139
It is all right.

639
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:11,266
It is fine.
It is a drawing of a butterfly.

640
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:12,308
It cannot hurt you.

641
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:20,066
You were trying to say something
with the drawing, right?

642
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,862
That is why you drew the picture?

643
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:34,164
You can tell me anything.

644
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:35,832
I will be here to listen.

645
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:58,480
Mr. Yoo…

646
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:11,493
It was not your fault.

647
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,042
Your father…

648
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:25,173
was murdered.

649
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,557
What…

650
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,228
What are you talking about?

651
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:43,399
It was a man wearing a belt
with a black jade butterfly.

652
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,529
He is the one

653
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,364
who killed your father.

654
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:15,598
You need to die here.

655
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:21,020
Did he kill my father?
Is he trying to finish me off too?

656
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,481
I cannot disobey my order,

657
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,567
but I cannot kill somebody
who saved my life.

658
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,779
Just leave. Do not ever come back.

659
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:33,116
But he did not manage to kill me.

660
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,409
Why?

661
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,456
It was probably somebody else
wearing the same belt.

662
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:43,376
It cannot have been Shin-woo.

663
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,379
We need to find out who it was.

664
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,762
What a poor, unlucky girl.

665
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:57,515
I am just too persistent.

666
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,028
Oh, my…

667
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,657
Young Master.

668
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:15,783
Young Master.

669
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,872
Something is happening.

670
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:22,540
I do not know why,

671
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:27,086
but Soon-man is bringing
a bunch of soldiers this way.

672
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:33,218
They want me and Wol.

673
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,180
Why…

674
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:41,434
I am going to take Wol and run.

675
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,602
Eun-woo, take everyone

676
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:44,479
and go to the crowded street market.

677
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:48,149
No. What if something happens to you?

678
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,359
Come with us.

679
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,111
No, they are after the two of us.

680
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,113
I do not want to put all of you in danger.

681
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,616
Go straight to reach the market.

682
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,243
They cannot attack you there.

683
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,078
But…

684
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:02,121
My goodness…

685
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,126
Be careful.

686
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,759
I will be fine.

687
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,866
We must go. You must survive.

688
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,472
Do not be afraid.

689
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,224
I said I would protect you.

690
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,185
I will draw the assassins that way.

691
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,562
Stay here, and stay hidden.

692
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,734
-No, Mr. Yoo. Then you…
-This is an order from His Majesty.

693
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:16,321
You must live,

694
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:17,739
and I must save you.

695
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:22,118
So stay alive.

696
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,099
-Find them.
-Yes, sir.

697
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,517
-Find them.
-Yes, sir.

698
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,574
-Track them down.
-Yes, sir.

699
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:02,909
Track them down.

700
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,661
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

701
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,502
Lady Eun-woo, we need to go.

702
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,635
All of you, go to Gyesu Infirmary.

703
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:22,220
Try to blend into crowds.

704
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,555
Where are you going?

705
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:25,765
Take me with you.

706
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,851
You must lead the others

707
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,479
to Gyesu Infirmary. Keep them safe.

708
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,232
I will go and get Mr. Yoo.

709
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:40,279
-Go.
-My lady.

710
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,281
-Go.
-Lady Eun-woo.

711
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:16,774
Wol.

712
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:33,875
Mr. Yoo.

713
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,669
What happened?
Why are you all by yourself?

714
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,672
I told Wol to hide here,

715
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:40,882
but she is gone.

716
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,429
Maybe she went back
to her house to avoid them.

717
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:57,732
Councilor Cho.

718
01:02:57,815 --> 01:03:02,445
I think they ran away into the mountains.

719
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:04,864
I will bring them to you right away, sir.

720
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:10,805
Wol…

721
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,231
Wol is…

722
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,032
I will get rid of Yoo Se-yeop

723
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:12,909
and bring back the needle.

724
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,536
What can you do in Hanyang?

725
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,662
You will come with me.

726
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:18,581
Please help me.

727
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:21,292
Please give me just a little bit of opium.

728
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,252
Hey.

729
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:25,588
How dare you sell something like this?

730
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,381
Arrest them!

731
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:30,051
So Councilor Cho was involved, after all.

732
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:31,594
You must be more careful.

733
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:33,888
We brought the corpse
from the ice storage.

734
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:36,349
Her blood has traces of the dan sedge?

735
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:40,353
Please promise me
that you will not do anything dangerous.

736
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:45,942
