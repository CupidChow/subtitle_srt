1
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:35,410
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,550
-Hey, wait for me.
-Wait for me.

3
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,976
Eun-woo.

4
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,688
Shin-woo.

5
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,075
I heard that Councilor Cho adopted you.

6
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,452
So what are you doing in Sorak?

7
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,163
What are you doing out late at night?

8
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,499
And who is this?

9
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:28,463
He is a physician in this village.

10
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,006
A physician?

11
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,926
Are you sick?

12
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:34,928
I am all right now.

13
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,936
She is the daughter-in-law
of the Chungseong Lee family.

14
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,521
Eun-woo might get in trouble

15
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,357
if she is seen with a man late at night.

16
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,110
Be more thoughtful.

17
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,738
What is there to be thoughtful about?
I am her physician.

18
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,574
People will start talking.

19
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,953
A proper physician
would never abandon his patient

20
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,080
because he is afraid of some rumors.

21
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,631
I shall be going now.

22
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,919
How do you know that righteous man?

23
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,006
My father used to be
his mentor a long time ago.

24
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,174
Did he offend you?

25
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,970
If he said those things
because he cares for you,

26
00:02:59,053 --> 00:02:59,929
I am fine with it.

27
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,241
-Did you hear that?
-Yes, I did.

28
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,243
I will investigate it.

29
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,203
What? Investigate it?

30
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:30,793
Mr. Yoo, you saw
something white too, right?

31
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,923
It was probably a wild animal.

32
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,383
I am sure it was.

33
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,512
There used to be martens
and deer in Sorak Mountain,

34
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,432
but they have disappeared
after being presented to the king yearly.

35
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,767
Do you think…

36
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:47,936
It was…

37
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,856
a ghost?

38
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,319
"If you can empty your mind,

39
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,655
then even the spirits shall admire you."

40
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,990
What? Who said that?

41
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,785
It is what Zhuangzi said in his book,
Heaven and Earth.

42
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:07,956
I see.

43
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,540
I will take you back

44
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,918
to the government office safely,
Lady Eun-woo.

45
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,787
GYESU INFIRMARY

46
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,249
Have you all starved to death?

47
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,452
Nam-hae, you are here.

48
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,829
Who is this? I like the way he eats.

49
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,958
He always follows Mr. Yoo around.

50
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,878
What are you hiding? Let me see that.

51
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,715
-What? I am not hiding anything.
-Ip-boon!

52
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,682
I told you many times to make sure
that the vegetable pancakes look pretty.

53
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,856
Grab a big spoonful,

54
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,524
and make a circle here.

55
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,568
A circle.

56
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,195
Yes, a circle.

57
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,197
-Ip-boon.
-Why is it not working?

58
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,870
Enjoy.

59
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,039
Ip-boon, your side dishes need to improve.

60
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,918
There you are, Poong's girlfriend!

61
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,046
Come, you should eat with us.

62
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,507
Welcome, Lady Eun-woo.

63
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,675
Lady Eun-woo, you should eat with us.

64
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,677
I think you will enjoy the food now.

65
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,640
I am seeing a lot of new faces
around here, Mr. Gye.

66
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:35,311
Feel free to give us more food.
We were forced to eat her food to survive.

67
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,729
Father!

68
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,149
I heard that the Nine-Tailed Fox
reappeared last night.

69
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,234
Please be careful.

70
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,194
Yes. Everybody is talking about it.

71
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,781
They killed somebody
on Sorak Mountain and took the liver.

72
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,367
You mean, the Nine-Tailed Fox
from last year?

73
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,452
But they caught the perpetrator for that.

74
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,205
There has been another murder.

75
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,458
You know, Chil-sung asked me this morning

76
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,544
to help him with the autopsy.

77
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,547
I really do need to send somebody.

78
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:16,894
I mean you should go, you idiot.
You cannot even perform acupuncture.

79
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,857
I am a physician,

80
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,650
not a mortician or a law official.

81
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,152
So why on earth should I go?

82
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,738
This is the countryside.
We do not have our own mortician.

83
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,782
The village physician must help out.

84
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,534
Sure.

85
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,035
Lady Eun-woo.

86
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,830
Did you work in the fields all morning?

87
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,669
Oh, my.

88
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,841
I think you ate more and faster than him.

89
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,885
This is hurting my pride.

90
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,513
I am usually the biggest eater
at the table.

91
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,934
Sorry, I keep eating
when I am thinking about something.

92
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,436
This is really good, though.

93
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,371
Are you thinking about what we saw
on the mountain last night?

94
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,835
Yes. Something similar
happened last year too.

95
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,172
It was a murder that was disguised
as the doing of the Nine-Tailed Fox.

96
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,885
But the perpetrator got caught, right?

97
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,764
Yes. The murderer was caught
and punished, which is the problem.

98
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,475
They may say that
my father's investigation was flawed.

99
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,227
It will be troublesome for him.

100
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,774
By the way, how do you know
so much about this, my lady?

101
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,237
Before I got married,

102
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,364
I helped the government office
with autopsies.

103
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,867
Really? Then you worked
directly with the corpses…

104
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,747
Could you come with me, then?

105
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,292
You must remember the investigation
from last year.

106
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,047
If I go to the government office,

107
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,674
people might start talking.

108
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,720
I am sure that your father
will appreciate the help.

109
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,397
I know that you know
a great deal about this case,

110
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,525
but you cannot be seen by anyone here.

111
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,235
So make it quick.

112
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,319
Yes, Father.

113
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,114
Mr. Yoo, look at this.

114
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,324
Oh, goodness.

115
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,744
It is different from last year.

116
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,871
The liver is gone, which is the same,

117
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,291
but the wound from last year
was in a straight line,

118
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,043
and the cut was not this precise, either.

119
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,505
The perpetrator was a woodsman,
so his murder weapon was a wood hatchet.

120
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,383
The blade was dull,
which made the cut jagged.

121
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,845
Do you think the murderer
is pretending to be the Nine-Tailed Fox?

122
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,351
Yes. This was not a spontaneous murder.

123
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,270
It was carefully planned out.

124
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,065
The perpetrator is very intelligent.

125
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,818
They are probably angry at the victim
or you, Father.

126
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,239
That is impressive, Lady Eun-woo.

127
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,575
Have they identified the victim yet?

128
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,701
It will take some time,

129
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,871
since there is no identification
and his face is damaged.

130
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,417
They found a butcher's knife
next to the body.

131
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,544
The police are investigating
based on that.

132
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,757
Mr. Seo, I have some urgent news.

133
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,967
The inspector from Hanyang is here.

134
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:35,885
And,

135
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,763
Mr. Im is with him, sir.

136
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,434
If Mr. Im finds out that you are here,
he will throw a fit.

137
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,186
Go prepare a place for us to talk.

138
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,187
Yes, sir.

139
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,524
Darn it, move aside.

140
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,193
Mr. Seo, are you in here?

141
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,195
I am coming in.

142
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,701
This is the mortuary.

143
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,412
You cannot be in here.

144
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,998
The Nine-Tailed Fox murder
has happened again,

145
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,210
which means you got
the wrong man last year.

146
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,046
In my opinion, it makes no sense
to trust Mr. Seo

147
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,841
with this case after he completely
impeded the investigation.

148
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:17,968
Please come in, sir.

149
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,846
Shin-woo.

150
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,223
Hey.

151
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,893
He is an inspector
sent by His Majesty himself.

152
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,603
Show some respect.

153
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,694
I am here as the inspector.

154
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,906
Since the murder happened
before greeting you,

155
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,866
let us skip the formalities.

156
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,327
Please give me
all of the records and reports.

157
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,286
All right.

158
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,623
Let us take this someplace else,
since there is a corpse in here.

159
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:12,648
By the way, why did you hide, Mr. Yoo?

160
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,317
I do not know.

161
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,824
I wonder why the perpetrator
left the murder weapon.

162
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,325
Do you think it was a mistake?

163
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,413
I am also bothered
by how the knife appears so new.

164
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,708
How have you been?

165
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,551
Eun-woo.

166
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,055
What are you doing here?

167
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,850
I was just passing by.

168
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,146
It is almost my brother's
memorial ceremony.

169
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,941
You still have not fully recovered, right?

170
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:01,071
I will explain everything to Mother,

171
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,492
so just focus on getting well.

172
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,496
I will try my best.

173
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,248
Let us go, my lady.

174
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,599
This cannot be all that you have.

175
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,019
While the investigation records
were getting transported,

176
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,522
they were lost in a fire.
It is all that we have left.

177
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,232
How disappointing.

178
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,361
Anyway, since we have
a new murder on our hands,

179
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,155
it means that
last year's perpetrator, Dol-seok,

180
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,990
is innocent, right?

181
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,244
It is too early to conclude
that the perpetrator is the same for both.

182
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,622
-The investigation is still ongoing.
-Mr. Seo. I cannot believe

183
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,917
that you were so careless
with the investigation.

184
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,760
Is Councilor Cho doing well?

185
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,889
I am always hoping for

186
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,392
his good luck and happiness.

187
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,020
I need you to pay a visit
to your hometown.

188
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,730
What would you like me to do, sir?

189
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,151
Go down there
and find a man named Yoo Se-yeop.

190
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,991
If you find him, send me a letter first,

191
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,909
then keep an eye on him.

192
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,913
I need you to find somebody for me.

193
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,499
Yes, sir. Just give me a name.

194
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,167
I will go out right now and…

195
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,127
Yoo Se-yeop.

196
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,297
He is 27 years old.

197
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,257
He is from the Royal Infirmary
and was named Top Acupuncturist

198
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,342
because he is so good
at placing his needles.

199
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,845
Is that enough for you to find him?

200
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,807
I know Sorak like the back of my hand.

201
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,185
I could tell you how many
dogs there are in this village.

202
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,771
-I will look for him now.
-The faster, the better.

203
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,064
Yes, sir.

204
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,402
To the left, you idiot.

205
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,780
Darn it, I should be riding on a litter

206
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,616
lined with gold.

207
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,285
See, he is not even Councilor Cho's son.

208
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:15,456
He is just an adopted son.
Who does he think he is?

209
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,791
No.

210
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,668
If I want to get a promotion,

211
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,546
then I need to suck up to him.

212
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,133
Hey, to the right!

213
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,802
Do your jobs right!

214
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,262
Jeez.

215
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,056
We are going to Gyesu Infirmary.

216
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,682
GYESU INFIRMARY

217
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,476
What is all this?

218
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,894
Move.

219
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,562
Mr. Gye is here.

220
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,773
Come on, you need to form lines.

221
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,733
Married women, go over there.

222
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,360
If you are hurt, go over there.

223
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,694
Where is everybody?

224
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,446
Jang-goon.

225
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,822
Ip-boon.

226
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,157
What the…

227
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,586
Darn.

228
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,758
What are you doing?

229
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,594
This is jangsagu.

230
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,721
I know that it is jangsagu.

231
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,848
But this requires several physicians

232
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,101
to work on it for multiple days.

233
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,435
Get rid of it!

234
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,397
I can do it by myself
if I am persistent enough.

235
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,108
The first round is over,
so I need to do the second round.

236
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,734
Do you plan to do this all night?

237
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,319
And I should see all those patients alone?

238
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,655
-Come on, clean this up.
-Hey, Dad.

239
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,574
Mr. Yoo is trying to do something
without acupuncture.

240
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,118
Why can you not support him?

241
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,496
You have both lost your minds.

242
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,207
I can heal him with a needle,
so get this out of my sight.

243
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,918
It needs to go through the second round.
You have to wait.

244
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:45,671
What has gotten into you?

245
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:49,299
Is this your version of a protest?

246
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,218
He just has dyspepsia.

247
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,013
He just needs a well-placed needle.
How long will this take?

248
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,306
Just like you said,
I cannot place any needles.

249
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,308
So I am using medicine and moxibustion

250
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,520
in order to carefully examine
the roots of the illness.

251
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,110
Fine. That is great.

252
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,820
But what about this prescription?

253
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,448
Is this the Royal Infirmary?
Are they high-ranking officials?

254
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,658
Musk, agarwood, ox bezoars, deer antlers,

255
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,910
rhinoceros horn, and Bubalus bubalis horn?

256
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,955
Are you kidding me?

257
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,624
Just look at these expensive
herbs and medicines.

258
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,418
Mistletoe? Where would you get that?

259
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,378
Jang-goon and Man-bok went to get them.

260
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,089
From now on,
I am going to treat all of my patients,

261
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,550
even if I have to use
every medical text that I know.

262
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,386
What, you…

263
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,721
Step aside!

264
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,848
What the hell is going on here?

265
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,768
Is there a fire here or what?

266
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,227
Hey, Ji-han.

267
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,732
How is a quack physician like you
still in business?

268
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,900
Stop right there!

269
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,777
How dare you slither in here?

270
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,945
Slither? I walked.

271
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,239
This is such a great location.

272
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,658
An infirmary this pathetic
does not suit such a location.

273
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,285
If it had been up to me,

274
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,789
I would have built
a better and grander building.

275
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,416
I do not want to hear it. Get out!

276
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,877
Hold on.

277
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,880
I heard you have a new physician here.
Is that him?

278
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,008
Who said that you could come in? Get out!

279
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:18,305
Hey, if you cannot use your needles,
try to be resourceful instead.

280
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,432
Do something useful.

281
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,267
I will try my best.

282
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,310
"Try my best"?

283
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,521
Move aside!

284
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,731
-Go away.
-Dad.

285
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,942
Hey, let go!

286
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,485
-Dad.
-Let go of me. Let go!

287
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,695
A physician who cannot use needles?

288
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,031
I said, move!

289
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,909
-Poong.
-Hey, let go.

290
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,452
Do not bully Poong.

291
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,912
-Poong?
-Hey, Granny.

292
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,831
Stop bullying Poong!

293
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,166
I said it needs to go through
the second round.

294
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,001
No way.

295
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,795
It is definitely not him, then.

296
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,673
What a useless idiot.

297
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:53,674
Let go!

298
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,301
You have not changed at all, Ji-han.

299
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,261
Gosh.

300
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,012
You prick!

301
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,698
Why do you think Mr. Gye

302
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,909
tries so hard to get all of that money

303
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,328
from the noble families?

304
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,876
Probably so that he can buy more alcohol.

305
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,464
Three cabbages, five radishes,

306
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,384
two pieces of fish, and one pumpkin.

307
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,141
What is this?

308
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,434
This is what he got paid.

309
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,146
There were not any nobles
among the patients, were there?

310
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:54,818
Mr. Gye is like Robin Hood.

311
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:59,740
He only takes money from the nobles.

312
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,994
These are gifts from the patients.

313
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,012
What did you just hide?

314
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,389
It is nothing.

315
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,517
What is nothing?

316
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,689
MUWONROK

317
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,941
Muwonrok?

318
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,901
Well…

319
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:39,863
This book is…

320
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,805
When you compare the marks
left on somebody who was strangled

321
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,766
to the marks left on somebody
who hung themself,

322
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,311
they look different over time.

323
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,981
Yes, that makes sense.

324
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:19,569
Muwonrok is a book that explains
these things in great detail.

325
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:26,285
Is it not scary to read at night?

326
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:32,791
Not really. I have been helping out
with autopsies since I was very young.

327
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,670
You know, I have been thinking that

328
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,381
you are very fearless, Lady Eun-woo.

329
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,383
I am not very good with corpses.

330
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,386
As a physician,
you just need to treat your patients.

331
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,099
Nowadays, I cannot even do that.

332
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,813
It is the Nine-Tailed Fox.

333
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,983
It is the Nine-Tailed Fox.

334
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,152
It is the Nine-Tailed Fox.

335
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,945
The Nine-Tailed Fox has killed again.

336
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,574
Get up.

337
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,703
It is the Nine-Tailed Fox.

338
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,499
There has been another murder.

339
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,044
The Fox killed somebody else.

340
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,491
Who are you? What is your name?

341
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,961
After asking around on the streets
and showing his clothes to his family,

342
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,881
we found out that this is Choi Yoon,
who was the mayor of Uiju.

343
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,716
We confirmed he was missing as well.

344
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:09,596
This is Min Yu-gyeom, Mr. Choi's student.

345
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,348
He came to the infirmary very often.

346
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:14,601
I put in those stitches last year.

347
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,686
The mayor of Uiju and his student.

348
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,688
Do you not think there was a motive?

349
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,983
They captured the perpetrator
at the scene, did they not?

350
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,195
How could a child have killed
a man who is over two meters tall?

351
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,655
Lady Eun-woo is right.

352
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,406
The child's name is Yeon-hee,

353
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,034
and she is the daughter
of a butcher, who is a widower.

354
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,452
She is ill,

355
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,579
but she is not a murderer.

356
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,498
Ill, you say?

357
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,208
She sleepwalks.

358
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,001
It is an illness where she walks around
while asleep,

359
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,087
but she does not remember
anything later on.

360
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,507
Even if that were true,
the knife that was found next to the body

361
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,218
was a butcher's knife.
It is a definite piece of evidence.

362
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,179
Is she not the daughter of a butcher?

363
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,524
Are you really the Nine-Tailed Fox?

364
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,488
Do you not know who this is?

365
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,198
Answer him right away!

366
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,077
I…

367
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,579
Answer me.

368
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,416
Are you the Nine-Tailed Fox?

369
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:26,047
I think I am, sir.

370
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,136
You are confessing to killing somebody.

371
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,221
Think carefully before you talk.

372
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,145
I never wanted to kill him.

373
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,147
But…

374
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,860
I think I did.

375
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,575
How did you kill two fully grown men

376
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,286
with a child's body?

377
00:24:56,953 --> 00:25:00,332
I do not remember, sir.

378
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,251
I have many witnesses who saw you
wandering around Sorak

379
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,252
late at night.

380
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,379
I order you to speak the truth!

381
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,509
Is this butcher's knife…

382
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,931
not your father's?

383
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,265
Speak the truth!

384
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:24,773
Yeon-hee.

385
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,067
That little brat.

386
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,693
Wake up.

387
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:38,078
She kept looking for you
since it was so loud out there.

388
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,499
It is all right now. Go to sleep.

389
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,543
There was a man there.

390
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,586
A man.

391
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,466
He is not there anymore. It is all right.

392
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:56,137
Granny, stop being so weird.
Mr. Yoo's here, so go to sleep.

393
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,936
I am scared, Poong.

394
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,152
You should go and rest too.

395
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,865
Look after her for me, please.

396
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,954
Look after her.

397
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,511
Watch out.

398
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,646
There are 7,870 prescriptions,

399
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:50,233
and 18,082 patient records.

400
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,484
Good job.

401
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,820
Now, let us organize these by last name.

402
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:54,779
Yes.

403
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,907
You used to think
you were the smartest man on earth.

404
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,744
I kind of miss those days.

405
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:04,414
Even now, nobody knows medicine
better than me.

406
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:07,792
Why are you doing this
all of a sudden, then?

407
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,837
You are putting yourself through
so much suffering.

408
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,257
I am testing myself to see
if I am still worthy of being a physician.

409
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,634
Still, how are you going to read

410
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,136
all 18,082 pieces of paper?

411
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,305
How about you just

412
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:23,016
take a needle and stab it in there?

413
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:26,227
-If I could do that, I would not be here.
-Oh, my goodness.

414
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,064
Thank you, Jang-goon.

415
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,653
I see that Mr. Gye prescribes
a lot of orange peel tonic.

416
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,738
That is right.

417
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,450
Mr. Gye likes to prescribe
medication that only uses

418
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,701
one or two ingredients.

419
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,038
You will be doing this
until the sun rises.

420
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,959
My goodness, why are you working so late?

421
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,878
Would you like some snacks?

422
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:56,800
It is fine.

423
00:27:56,883 --> 00:28:01,388
We just ate a whole lot of food.
I am so full.

424
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,766
The pot was not even warm.
What on earth did you eat?

425
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,226
Well…

426
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,813
-Sweet potatoes.
-Roasted chestnuts.

427
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,902
-Roasted chestnuts.
-Sweet potatoes.

428
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,823
You can just make us anything.

429
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:24,077
What a stupid mosquito.

430
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:31,626
You worked hard all day
to help me perform moxibustion.

431
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:32,710
Go get some rest.

432
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,173
Yes.

433
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,270
Hey.

434
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,230
I told you to go and take care of Granny.

435
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,190
What do you think you are doing?

436
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,819
You said that the girl
is a patient here, right?

437
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:58,820
She sleepwalks?

438
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,572
Yeah.

439
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,658
She walks around at night
because of her illness,

440
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,493
but they think she is the murderer.

441
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,996
Their investigation is total crap.

442
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,623
Is there anything that we can do?

443
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,876
There is something…

444
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,288
My goodness.

445
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,684
Yeon-hee.

446
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,814
Yeon-hee.

447
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,789
I need to take her to the infirmary.

448
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,082
I cannot let you do that.

449
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,209
She was caught at the crime scene.

450
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,128
She is a murderer who killed two people.

451
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,464
It was simply a symptom of sleepwalking.

452
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,301
She should be treated for it,
not framed for a crime.

453
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:30,013
You think you can lecture me?
You, a small village physician?

454
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,599
I was once in the Royal Infirmary.

455
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,896
Are you not here because
you could not believe

456
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,940
that such a small child
could have killed two grown men?

457
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,902
Well, the law is the law.

458
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,945
She must go back to her cell.

459
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,490
Inspector Cho.

460
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,997
Did he say something stupid again?

461
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,833
-You must try to discover the truth…
-Stop.

462
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,545
Our idiot newbie

463
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,590
does not really know anything
about how the world works.

464
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:06,716
It is fine.

465
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,844
You are so forgiving, sir.

466
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,095
How kind of you.

467
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:16,684
Sir, what do you think about
me treating Yeon-hee

468
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,729
while she is locked in her cell?

469
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,147
That is a luxury

470
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,815
that a murderer cannot afford.

471
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,442
A murderer? You do not know that.

472
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,526
Shut up.

473
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,739
Of course, Inspector Cho.
You are completely right.

474
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:34,535
But, based on what I know
after treating Yeon-hee for so long,

475
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,538
her heart is weak, and her liver
is under a lot of pressure.

476
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,416
If she is in a new environment,
her life could be in danger

477
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,210
because of a lack of energy flow.

478
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,547
If the perpetrator dies
before the truth is revealed,

479
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,051
then you might take the blame for it.

480
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,013
Is her condition really that serious?

481
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,264
Yes, sir.

482
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,475
Please allow me to look at her

483
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,852
for just 15 minutes every day.

484
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,069
CHILD, WOMEN,
EXTERNAL INJURY, INTERNAL INJURY

485
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,003
Mr. Gye.

486
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,754
I need your help.

487
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,549
Could you help Yeon-hee, please?

488
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,717
Hey. Get up.

489
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,968
Sit down.

490
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,763
I was planning on talking to you.

491
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,767
I cannot believe that they think
Yeon-hee is the Nine-Tailed Fox, either.

492
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:44,063
Mr. Gye. You said that Yeon-hee
walks around at night like that

493
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:48,317
-because of her illness!
-Yes, I did.

494
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:51,029
Yeon-hee is ill.
She did not commit any crimes.

495
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:55,283
Could you please talk to Mr. Seo?

496
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:59,871
There is no way that Yeon-hee
could have killed two men.

497
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,707
Did Mr. Gye not say
to sleep with the doors locked

498
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,375
because of Yeon-hee's symptoms?

499
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,210
But why did you leave
the door open that day?

500
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,630
It is driving me crazy, too.

501
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,968
I do not know why the door was left open.

502
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,763
The door was left open on that day?

503
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,225
Did you lose a knife by any chance?

504
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,478
No, of course not.

505
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,480
I slaughter pigs for a living.

506
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,566
I cannot do anything without my knives.

507
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,151
Yes.

508
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,612
All right.

509
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:35,740
You should go back home for now.

510
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:38,409
I will help you to the best of my ability.
Let us get up.

511
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:50,213
Could you talk to Yeon-hee, my lady?
She might have seen something.

512
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,215
Hey, you.

513
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,134
Do not go around doing stupid things.

514
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:59,388
Yes. I am sure you want me
to only treat patients who will pay me.

515
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,517
Well, you never listen to me anyway.

516
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,062
I will make the money,
so do not get in the way of my treatments.

517
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,023
Just find some medical texts
to help Yeon-hee.

518
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,859
I will allow only that.

519
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,404
All right.

520
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:20,785
Yeon-hee.

521
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,496
What did you do
after you went to that forest?

522
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,792
I cannot remember.

523
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,754
You saw me leaving, right?

524
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,758
You went out this way
then ran into the mountains.

525
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,510
Do you not remember that, either?

526
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:56,028
Do it quietly, will you?
You almost gave me a heart attack.

527
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:59,198
I am sure the Nine-Tailed Fox

528
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,825
will love that.

529
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,455
Why do you keep chopping wood?
It is not even winter yet.

530
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,167
I am just earning my keep.

531
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,420
I am not that shameless, you know?

532
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,046
If you want to earn your keep,

533
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,048
you must chop down
all of the trees on Sorak Mountain.

534
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,176
Oh, please!

535
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,635
Stop messing around.

536
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,642
Jang-goon. What is wrong?

537
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:29,729
What is it? Are you all right?

538
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,147
Did somebody tease you again?

539
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,357
Who was it? I will break them in half.

540
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,610
I will break them into fours.

541
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,951
DECEASED

542
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,955
Did Mr. Choi really die?

543
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,793
Gosh, Jang-goon. You must be so sad.

544
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,881
He always treated you
like his own grandson.

545
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:02,386
He said he would let me see
the martens on Sorak Mountain again.

546
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,850
He said we could go
look at them next time.

547
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,439
Really?

548
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:16,567
Did Mr. Choi really say
that he will show you the martens?

549
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:23,074
Mr. Choi said that the martens
can play in the mountains again

550
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:27,620
once he catches all of the bad men
who hunted them down.

551
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,539
But…

552
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,548
I feel sleepy,

553
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,883
but I am so scared.

554
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,678
It is all right. You can sleep.

555
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,306
You drank the tonic
and received acupuncture as well,

556
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,348
so you will be fine.

557
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:47,408
Darn it, I feel like she is
not the real perpetrator.

558
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,785
You are right. She is not.

559
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,121
I found out earlier
that Mr. Choi had been investigating

560
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:56,584
those who were poaching martens and deer,
which were tributes to the King.

561
00:38:57,126 --> 00:39:00,212
He submitted a report
to the King's Court as well.

562
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,966
Did he find out who the poachers were?

563
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,468
No.

564
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:10,848
I think he was murdered
before he discovered the truth.

565
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:15,102
They stole the most luxurious tributes
for the royal palace.

566
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,730
They could have bought several mansions.

567
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,357
Those bastards.

568
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:23,527
Yes, there is some kind
of nefarious plan behind this.

569
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,029
Yeon-hee did not do anything.

570
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,657
A goblin!

571
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,285
-A goblin!
-Yeon-hee.

572
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,120
-A goblin!
-Yeon-hee.

573
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,664
Yeon-hee.

574
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,124
Wake up, Yeon-hee.

575
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,879
There was a goblin holding a knife.

576
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,340
The goblin

577
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:49,345
was standing in a tree
and it shot down a star.

578
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:54,475
I am scared. I am so scared.

579
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,854
What could she mean?

580
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,070
Yeon-hee.

581
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,285
I think Yeon-hee saw the murderer.

582
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,586
He is here, sir.

583
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,509
Yeon-hee.

584
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,846
What did that goblin look like?

585
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,349
A plum blossom.

586
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,021
A red plum blossom.

587
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:48,195
What does that mean?
I think that she saw something for sure.

588
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,030
We need to go back to the crime scene.

589
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,951
You all can go.
I will wrap things up here before I leave.

590
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,749
This is where the body was.

591
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,086
A goblin shot down a star
while standing in a tree.

592
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,479
But that tree is too far away.

593
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,897
Too far to stab someone.

594
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,335
We were too focused
on that butcher's knife.

595
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,837
The perpetrator left the knife
there on purpose.

596
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,465
-No, he shot him with a bow and arrow.
-If he shot him,

597
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,550
then there has to be evidence left behind.

598
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,681
Yes, Mr. Yoo. You are right.

599
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,558
That evidence

600
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,061
is right here.

601
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,731
This came from an arrow.

602
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,693
A war arrow.

603
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,532
The arrowhead that broke
after hitting the bone

604
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,283
stayed inside the body.

605
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,791
Then, somebody shot Mr. Choi from a tree,

606
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,292
then took the arrow

607
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,545
and covered it up
with that butcher's knife.

608
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,713
Yes.

609
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,799
Considering the depth
of the injury and the distance,

610
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,220
the arrow was shot from a heavy bow.
It was not a hunter.

611
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:38,264
That bow is only used
in the Military Service Exam.

612
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,307
How do you know all this?

613
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,062
MORTUARY

614
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,816
The patient records.
I need to look at them.

615
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,447
Here, have a drink.

616
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:59,994
Jang-goon, remember the day
when Yeon-hee came here?

617
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:03,581
Could you find the records of the patients
who came here around that time?

618
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,291
A piece of cake.

619
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,322
A 17-year-old with vomiting and diarrhea.

620
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,658
A 46-year-old with swollen lymph nodes.

621
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,578
A 20-year-old who fell from a tree,
pain in his lower back.

622
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,080
A 35-year-old with jaundice.

623
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:49,668
They are all patients who visited
the infirmary on the same day.

624
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,129
Did Jang-goon memorize all of the patients

625
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:54,340
who visited us on that day?

626
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,508
Of course. He is Jang-goon.

627
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,344
Thank you.

628
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,137
You are smarter than my young master.

629
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:04,683
Yeon-hee did not kill anybody.
But the murders occurred on the nights

630
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,519
when Yeon-hee was sleepwalking.

631
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:08,646
Is it a coincidence?

632
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,939
Stop asking questions. Just tell me.

633
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,942
You are saying that somebody
knows about Yeon-hee's sleepwalking

634
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:17,154
and they made her look like
the perpetrator, then tried to escape.

635
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,197
That is exactly it.

636
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,116
Who else knows about Yeon-hee's illness?

637
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,119
Yeon-hee lives with her father,

638
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,622
so aside from him and us,
nobody else knows.

639
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,707
Then the murderer must be

640
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:32,336
one of the patients who was there
when Yeon-hee was at the infirmary.

641
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,048
Since Mr. Gye's voice is loud,
someone must have overheard.

642
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,884
Make sure to lock the doors
from the outside.

643
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,683
I have never seen you sound so smart.

644
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,852
You have no idea how smart he really is.

645
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,730
These are the records of patients

646
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:55,192
who were at the infirmary on the day
that Yeon-hee was getting treated.

647
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:56,902
HEART PAIN

648
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:58,445
VOMITING AND DIARRHEA

649
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,197
SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES

650
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,074
LOWER BACK PAIN

651
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:04,451
JAUNDICE

652
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,162
Exclude the patient with lower back pain,
since he could not move.

653
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,288
EXCLUDED

654
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,083
The patient with heart pain
is over 70 years old,

655
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,960
so he probably cannot shoot an arrow.

656
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:18,674
The rest cannot move by themselves
or are children.

657
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,134
Then,

658
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,594
we only have one person left.

659
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,937
I think I know him.

660
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,443
Wait, this is…

661
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,322
Red plum blossoms.

662
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:52,499
I will explain everything to Mother,
so just focus on getting well.

663
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,168
He does have a red plum blossom

664
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,629
on him.

665
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:06,722
Mr. Seo is probably running around
trying to find the evidence.

666
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,225
If somebody finds out,

667
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,854
I will be beheaded.

668
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,857
You need to be more ambitious than that

669
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,901
to hold a position
as a government official.

670
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,613
Do you not know who Councilor Cho is?

671
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:25,157
Even if you committed high treason

672
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,201
instead of murder,

673
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,620
he could make sure that you get pardoned.

674
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:36,001
So, even if you happen to get caught,

675
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:39,087
you will score a position
in the government

676
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:42,674
if you just keep your mouth shut.

677
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,302
Yes, Mr. Im.

678
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:55,270
What is this, sir?

679
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,481
This is the evidence

680
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,107
that you are so scared of.

681
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:06,198
It is the appeal that Mr. Choi

682
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,825
and those scholars were trying to submit.

683
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,369
Those insolent bastards

684
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:13,372
were planning on
writing both of our names on there.

685
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:16,375
But I know everything
that goes on in Sorak.

686
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:21,797
I cannot bother Councilor Cho
because of some stupid martens.

687
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:27,052
Of course, Mr. Im. I completely agree.

688
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:31,181
Then, about my position…

689
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,310
Councilor Cho will take care of it.

690
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,858
Burn it to ashes.

691
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,862
And make sure to keep bringing me

692
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,906
the martens caught in Sorak.

693
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,952
I will make sure that they
make their way to Councilor Cho.

694
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:05,048
My goodness.

695
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,053
But we do not have enough evidence.

696
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,598
They will not arrest him
because of what Yeon-hee says.

697
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,433
Lady Eun-woo just found the evidence.

698
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,936
It is the piece of an arrowhead
found in Mr. Choi's body.

699
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,771
We just need to find the rest of it.

700
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,357
There is no way that
he still has that arrow.

701
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,651
You did not

702
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:29,197
do anything that might be traced
back to you, did you?

703
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,825
Not at all.

704
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,128
Mr. Im.

705
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,590
If you want everything
to go according to plan,

706
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,509
then you need to stop my sister-in-law.

707
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,472
What are you talking about?

708
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:57,309
She is the one who solved
the Nine-Tailed Fox case last year.

709
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:01,396
She does not know her place as a widow.

710
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,442
Even now, she is going around
looking for evidence.

711
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,862
Right. Mr. Seo is one of your in-laws.

712
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,491
How unfortunate.

713
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,118
What would you like me to do?

714
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:51,196
What is it, Mr. Im?

715
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,031
As a high government official

716
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,033
of Sorak County,

717
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:58,370
I will not put up with any more
of this disorderly conduct.

718
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,955
What on earth do you mean?

719
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,041
I am talking about your daughter.

720
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,796
Does she think that being a widow
is something to be proud of?

721
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:10,924
She ran away from her in-laws
under the excuse of an illness,

722
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:12,634
and now she is mingling with men.

723
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:16,012
It is unsightly and dishonorable.

724
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:19,015
I apologize.
As soon as Eun-woo gets better…

725
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:23,186
The person who is truly ill here
is Madam Noh of the Chungseong Lee family.

726
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,604
Would you not agree?

727
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:28,692
I am presuming that
you are letting her do whatever she wants

728
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,902
because you favor her
as your own daughter.

729
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:35,741
On top of that, you did not even conclude
the Nine-Tailed Fox case properly,

730
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,993
leading to the deaths of two men.

731
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:42,330
Therefore, if you do not send
your daughter back to her in-laws,

732
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,332
I will report you to the King's Court

733
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,334
for dereliction of duty
and disorderly conduct.

734
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:48,336
What will you do?

735
00:50:56,845 --> 00:51:00,265
I shall go back to my in-laws,

736
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:01,725
so stop this right now.

737
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,520
Eun-woo.

738
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:06,813
Just look at this.

739
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,650
You have got a woman walking
around in here.

740
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:13,320
So you are getting nothing done.

741
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,949
You better watch yourselves.

742
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,545
Are you sure?

743
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:34,299
I was planning on going back
once I got better anyway.

744
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,759
Do not blame yourself.

745
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,861
Lady Eun-woo is really something else.

746
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,739
I cannot believe she will go back
to live with a man like that.

747
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,367
I saw in the patient records
that you examined

748
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,661
Lady Eun-woo's in-laws as well.

749
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:03,745
Is that right?

750
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,126
Then you must have known.

751
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:11,711
What, you idiot?

752
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,798
Would you spill
all of your patients' secrets?

753
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:16,258
That is not what I mean.

754
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,134
Lady Eun-woo is suffering so much.

755
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,512
I told you not to get nosy
about other people's business.

756
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:24,474
If you thoughtlessly mess
with an illness, it will only get worse.

757
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:25,642
Wait for the right time.

758
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:28,812
Jeez.

759
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,876
I want you to show your dedication

760
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:54,129
by doing the ceremony all by yourself.

761
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,465
If a husband dies, a woman should be

762
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,886
mourning his death
for at least three years.

763
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,889
No matter how immature you are,

764
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,600
you should be the one to hold
your husband's ceremony.

765
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,477
My goodness.

766
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,146
You should go inside now, Mother.

767
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:02,197
Madam, you have a visitor.

768
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:47,325
Eun-woo.

769
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,721
What are you looking for now?

770
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,349
You know, going around and being nosy

771
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:14,310
is a bad habit. You should fix it.

772
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,605
Well,

773
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:22,235
did you find what you were looking for?

774
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:25,739
Yes,

775
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,241
I did.

776
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,243
But, if I am being honest,

777
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,078
I did not even have to look.

778
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,749
I have the appeal

779
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,459
that Mr. Choi kept hidden away.

780
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:42,756
The name of those who stole the tributes
is written here very clearly.

781
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,637
You are lying.

782
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,766
Why do you think I am lying?

783
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:56,436
Is it because you have gotten rid of it?

784
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:00,690
This is a piece of an arrowhead
that came from Mr. Choi's body.

785
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:03,485
I found the rest of the arrowhead
in this house.

786
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:09,199
How dare a woman like you
look through our ancestral shrine?

787
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,373
If I kill you,

788
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:21,044
nobody will find out what I have done.

789
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:24,464
You are scared, are you not?

790
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:25,924
According to federal laws,

791
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:28,176
you will be hanged for murder
at the very least.

792
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,552
What a shame.

793
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:38,353
You can go and be with your husband now.

794
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,272
"On the day of her
husband's memorial ceremony,

795
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,483
the widow took her own life."

796
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,070
Is it not beautiful?

797
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:51,324
Now, die.

798
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,083
Let go of her.

799
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,424
Lady Eun-woo.

800
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,887
Arrest him.

801
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,180
Yes, sir.

802
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:22,856
How dare you…

803
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,238
Listen closely.

804
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,074
You killed innocent scholars
to cover up your corruption

805
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,827
and even tried to kill an innocent girl.

806
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:39,372
You cannot do this to me.

807
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:40,999
I did not do anything.

808
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:43,918
"Did not do anything"?

809
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:45,962
Here is the irrefutable evidence.

810
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:51,676
You are the one who said that
you hid this in the ancestral shine.

811
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,763
This is a piece of an arrowhead
that came from Mr. Choi's body.

812
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:59,017
I found the rest of the arrowhead
in this house.

813
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,020
How dare a woman like you
look through our ancestral shrine?

814
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,276
You dared to lie to me?

815
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:10,570
After all I have done for you?

816
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,071
Stay still and stop flopping about.

817
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,574
Did you just realize that?

818
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:17,994
This is a fake.

819
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,500
We were all preoccupied with the knife.

820
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:26,377
However,

821
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,422
the real weapon was the bow.

822
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,092
You lured the victim out onto the path

823
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,678
that Yeon-hee usually takes
when she sleepwalks.

824
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,474
But Yeon-hee saw you.

825
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:42,018
She must have remembered
the arrow flying from the tree

826
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:45,063
as a shooting star,
as the moonlight reflected off of it.

827
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:53,321
She witnessed you taking out the liver,

828
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,490
making it look
like it was the Nine-Tailed Fox.

829
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:06,125
-Drag him away.
-I will do it.

830
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,502
Get up.

831
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:13,633
Mother.

832
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:16,177
-Mother!
-Ho-jun!

833
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,512
-Ho-jun!
-Mother!

834
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:19,347
Ho-jun!

835
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:22,267
Ho-jun!

836
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:34,988
You have taken both of my sons
away from me now.

837
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:39,617
I have protected my family with my life.

838
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:41,869
How dare you ruin everything?

839
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,871
You have no shame.

840
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,790
You should die too.

841
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,125
I am going to kill you.

842
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,211
How dare you…

843
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,468
What a pathetic family.

844
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:06,436
Your son suffered from gastric cancer.

845
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:10,607
He had dysphagia

846
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,651
as well as bloody stool,
and he was getting thinner by the day.

847
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,153
But you ignored
the physician's prescription

848
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:17,488
and used talismans and rituals instead.

849
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,365
That is why he died.

850
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,286
But you put all of the blame
on your poor daughter-in-law

851
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:24,829
and pressed her to kill herself.

852
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:28,875
You should be ashamed of yourself.

853
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:35,632
You do not know anything.

854
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,467
You are just a lowly physician.

855
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,552
Even if I am just a lowly physician,

856
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,764
I care for my patients.

857
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,392
I will do anything

858
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:49,020
to save my patients.

859
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:01,282
-Where is she going?
-What is she doing?

860
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,624
What is she doing?

861
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:14,379
How dare a woman bow
at an ancestral memorial ceremony?

862
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,941
-What is she doing?
-What has gotten into her?

863
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:50,373
I just bid my dead husband farewell.

864
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,168
And now,

865
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,589
I am cutting all of my ties
with the Chungseong Lee family.

866
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:32,999
How dare…

867
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,292
That little…

868
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:46,554
I did not know.

869
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:51,100
I tried to tell myself that

870
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,437
it was not my fault that
my husband had died,

871
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,523
but it slowly became my fault

872
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,735
because everybody was blaming me.

873
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:04,197
In the end, I began

874
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,200
to blame myself as well.

875
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:11,704
Why did they do it?

876
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:15,583
Why?

877
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:18,586
I suffered so much.

878
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,714
If I had known the truth,

879
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:25,092
I would not have felt so guilty.

880
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:29,806
It was not your fault, my lady.

881
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:34,977
So, you should live your own life now.

882
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,939
From now on,

883
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:40,191
they cannot mess with you anymore.

884
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,527
I will make sure of that, Eun-woo.

885
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,041
I did not mean to…

886
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,335
I apologize, my lady.

887
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:04,382
No.

888
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,760
You can call me by my name.

889
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:13,182
From now on, I want to live
like the person I truly am

890
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,811
without caring about
what other people think.

891
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:25,778
All right, Eun-woo.

892
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:31,075
I want to help other people

893
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:34,453
just like you, Mr. Yoo.

894
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:38,499
I am not sure how to get started, though.

895
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:43,963
How about you learn medicine

896
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,007
while staying at Gyesu Infirmary?

897
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,595
You have a warm heart, Eun-woo.

898
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:54,015
On top of that, you have the courage
and intuition that I do not have.

899
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:55,933
I think you will make a great physician.

900
01:04:58,352 --> 01:05:02,189
Do you really think I could do that?

901
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:32,822
You lost the court lady
from the Royal Kitchen again?

902
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:34,907
If you are going to keep doing
a crappy job,

903
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:37,702
then kill yourself right here and now.

904
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:42,957
I am sorry, Councilor Cho.

905
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,543
Have you already forgotten

906
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:48,921
that you almost ruined everything
a year ago as well?

907
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:52,717
I will find the court lady, sir.

908
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,678
If I make a mistake again,
then you can take my life.

909
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:57,722
Hurry up.

910
01:06:57,805 --> 01:07:01,767
If the king finds her first,
then it will be over for us.

911
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:21,787
-Madam!
-Madam!

912
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,039
Madam!

913
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:29,628
Can you hear me? What on earth happened?

914
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,047
Wake up.

915
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:35,926
There is a court lady

916
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:42,349
who was involved in your father's death.

917
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:55,988
Your Majesty.

918
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,740
She has passed.

919
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:11,629
This never happened.

920
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:15,257
I do not want anybody
to speak a word about this.

921
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:22,098
Arrange a funeral for her in private,
and move her body to the ice house.

922
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:23,641
I will look into this personally.

923
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:43,702
Yeon-hee was released safely

924
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,830
thanks to you two.

925
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:50,459
Is this the grave for Yeon-hee's mother?

926
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,254
How did you know?

927
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,799
A physician does not only look
at the symptoms.

928
01:08:57,383 --> 01:09:00,219
It is also the job of a physician
to carefully study a patient

929
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:03,556
and find out the cause

930
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:04,765
of the illness.

931
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,562
I think Yeon-hee started sleepwalking

932
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:11,564
because she missed
her dead mother so much.

933
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,357
That is why she came here.

934
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:19,196
I had no idea.

935
01:09:21,615 --> 01:09:23,284
Thank you, Mr. Yoo.

936
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:28,539
I will treat you, even if I have to read
a whole library to do it.

937
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:42,386
Mr. Yoo made this for you.

938
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:43,554
This is my doll!

939
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:55,149
Why did you make that doll for her?

940
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,694
I think her father accidentally burned

941
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:01,197
the doll that her mother made
for her before she died.

942
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:04,742
I see…

943
01:10:04,825 --> 01:10:07,786
That is when she started to sleepwalk.

944
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:12,583
You are such a kind person, Mr. Yoo.

945
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:15,961
Why did you not give it
to her yourself, though?

946
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:18,547
In the past,

947
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:21,967
I would have treated her with acupuncture.

948
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,178
But I can only give her a doll now.
I felt bad.

949
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:29,683
You used a needle to make that doll,

950
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:32,478
so you used acupuncture
to treat her, in a way.

951
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:35,356
I guess that is also true.

952
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:46,617
Were you behind the death
of Mr. Choi and Mr. Min?

953
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:52,957
Not at all, sir.

954
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,128
Are you sure about that?

955
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:04,301
Yes, sir. Why are you accusing me of this?

956
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:09,848
I thought for a moment that you might have

957
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,768
arranged all of this in order to

958
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,687
get into Councilor Cho's favor.

959
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:19,316
But a smart man like you

960
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:21,527
would not have committed murder

961
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:27,074
without even talking to me,
the adopted son of Councilor Cho.

962
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,953
Right?

963
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:34,206
Yes, sir. Of course.

964
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:41,171
I would never do something like that.

965
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:42,798
That is hot.

966
01:11:45,926 --> 01:11:47,011
So,

967
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:51,056
you know that insolent
young physician at Gyesu Infirmary?

968
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:55,227
I think he is from the Royal Infirmary.

969
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,355
Do you think that he is Yoo Se-yeop?

970
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:01,400
I am not sure, sir.

971
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:02,943
His name is

972
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:05,863
Poong, as far as I am aware.

973
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,577
-Poong?
-Yes, sir. Poong.

974
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:13,912
Poong.

975
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:34,224
-Did Councilor Cho send this?
-I do not know how to read, sir.

976
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:38,812
From now on, I want all of the letters

977
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:42,107
that are addressed to the Royal Inspector.

978
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,234
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

979
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:49,281
Now go.

980
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:55,537
Something is going on here.

981
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:58,916
The adopted son of Councilor Cho
would not have come to Sorak

982
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,085
to look for a mere physician.

983
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:14,491
I am giving you the chance

984
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:16,702
to work for me.

985
01:14:19,496 --> 01:14:21,206
And why should I do that?

986
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:29,465
Why?

987
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:32,968
Because…

988
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:37,181
Yoo Se-yeop

989
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:39,933
is your name.

990
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:47,941
I heard that you killed the previous King.

991
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:18,639
You need somebody
very powerful to protect you.

992
01:15:18,722 --> 01:15:20,015
What are you doing?

993
01:15:20,098 --> 01:15:21,517
No, you cannot.

994
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,477
It is wrong for a man
to hold a woman's wrist.

995
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,270
I did not kill anybody.

996
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,355
Even if they torture you,

997
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:27,773
you cannot confess
to something that you did not do.

998
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:29,316
Yes, Young Master.

999
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:31,527
Right now, Man-bok definitely
looks like the perpetrator.

1000
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:33,320
To save Man-bok…

1001
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:35,906
I must become
a proficient female physician.

1002
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:37,366
It is time to catch the perpetrator.

1003
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:40,577
I am also going to do
whatever I have to do to find evidence.

1004
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:42,037
The law is the law,

1005
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,830
and I shall follow it.

1006
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:46,250
A person's life depends on this.

1007
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:48,502
I cannot give up now.

1008
01:15:48,585 --> 01:15:53,590
