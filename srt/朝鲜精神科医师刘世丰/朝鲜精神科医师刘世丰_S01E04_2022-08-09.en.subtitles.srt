1
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,410
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,542
I am giving you the chance

3
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,837
to work for me.

4
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,174
And why should I do that?

5
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,514
Why?

6
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,059
Because…

7
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,771
Yoo Se-yeop

8
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,690
is your name.

9
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:17,452
I heard that you killed the previous King.

10
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,635
So you passed the medical exam
with flying colors

11
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,303
and were the head acupuncturist,

12
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,972
but you accidentally killed the King?

13
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,726
That probably ended
your career as a physician.

14
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:47,565
At a time like this,
you need somebody very powerful

15
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,611
to protect you.

16
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,947
If you just follow my orders,

17
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,907
you will have the chance to get rich,

18
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,576
and you will live a better life
than most people here.

19
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,663
It is a much better deal
than working for a physician like Ji-han

20
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,332
who kills his patients
instead of treating them.

21
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,167
I was

22
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,630
an arrogant and foolish physician.

23
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,634
I ought to live the rest of my life
repenting for my sins.

24
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,303
I can never go back
to doing what I used to do.

25
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,472
Yes, that is right.

26
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,850
That is why you need
somebody to protect you.

27
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,768
I will be going now.

28
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,647
Hey. Se-yeop.

29
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,648
Hey, Se-poong.

30
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,276
Gosh!

31
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,698
Darn it. The location of that infirmary

32
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,700
is such a nice one.

33
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:11,065
I heard that you killed the previous King.

34
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,759
Eun-woo.

35
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,888
These flowers are so beautiful,
just like you.

36
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,977
I found them in front of the gates.

37
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:31,646
My goodness.

38
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,280
Is she still sleeping?

39
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,161
She should be awake by now.

40
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,922
Shin-woo.

41
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,635
Eun-woo.

42
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,637
What are you doing?

43
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:09,100
Where have you been?
It is so early in the morning.

44
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,561
And what do you have there?

45
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:13,980
And

46
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,316
what is with your clothes…

47
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,735
and your hair?

48
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:25,116
I am going to stay at Gyesu Infirmary
from now on and learn medicine.

49
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,451
Learn medicine?

50
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,497
Eun-woo.

51
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,542
You just escaped that horrible family.

52
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,377
So why are you doing this…

53
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,839
Do you even know how hard it is
to be a female physician?

54
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,427
Why can you not just try to live
a happy life?

55
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,973
Happiness looks different for everybody.

56
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,852
Ever since you were young,
you found joy in learning martial arts.

57
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:57,065
And I loved reading books
and solving criminal cases.

58
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,612
But you are a noblewoman.
Will you really practice medicine?

59
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,572
Your father will never allow it.

60
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,826
He actually did.

61
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,246
He allowed it?

62
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,792
I cannot do anything now

63
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,502
as a noblewoman.

64
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,837
But if I become a physician,

65
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,090
I can begin a new chapter
of my life. It excites me.

66
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:27,011
From now on, I want
to do the things I want to do,

67
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,263
the way I want to do them.

68
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,415
Surprise!

69
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,127
Oh, my!

70
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,670
You scared me half to death.

71
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,716
Really? You like him that much?

72
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,262
I can almost see hearts
shooting out of your eyes.

73
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,765
You know, servants usually
hate their masters.

74
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,058
You are a weird one.

75
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,186
What? What are you crying about?

76
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,565
-What? He is crying.
-He is crying.

77
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,900
-Hey.
-The wild boar is crying.

78
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,652
No.

79
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,279
-I think you are crying.
-I am not.

80
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,156
-You are crying.
-I told you, I am not.

81
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,324
Stop it, seriously.

82
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,589
It is just, you know,

83
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:49,093
he used to treat the king, and now he is…

84
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,473
I mean, when he was
in the Royal Infirmary,

85
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,557
it was such a hassle

86
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,894
because everybody wanted him
to perform acupuncture on them.

87
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,438
But now he cannot even use his needles.

88
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,356
Gosh.

89
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,941
If he could just fix
the tremor in his hands,

90
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,818
the people in Hanyang
would call him back right away.

91
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,280
Move aside.

92
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,326
I have a question for you.

93
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,122
Which physician is an expert
in treating hand tremors?

94
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,376
Hand tremors?

95
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,387
-Let me feel her pulse first.
-No, you cannot.

96
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,557
It is wrong for a man
to hold a woman's wrist.

97
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,396
Can you not just estimate it?

98
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,653
How are your symptoms?

99
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:55,034
She plays the geomungo sometimes,
just for me,

100
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,704
but her hands tremble
every time she plays,

101
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,373
so it is a bit bothersome.

102
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,089
I will pay as much money as you want
for the treatment.

103
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,760
So please get
the most expensive medicine for her.

104
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,266
I think you should work
on building your strength

105
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,600
by eating some meat.

106
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,185
But if the tremors do not stop,

107
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,521
I will prescribe some deer antlers.

108
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,108
-Next.
-Thank you, sir.

109
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,045
Gosh, he is so nice to her.

110
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,256
-Move.
-He is so caring.

111
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:55,469
But he did not let her say a single word.

112
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,805
"Get the most expensive medicine for her."

113
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,474
How touching of him.

114
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,101
I am so jealous.

115
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,228
I wish I could date a guy like him.

116
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,481
He is very rich,
not to mention very kind and caring.

117
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,733
Hey, Ip-boon.

118
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,568
Snap out of it.

119
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,903
Money is not the only thing that matters.

120
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,406
Right. Rich people are usually criminals.

121
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,702
You are always insulting
the nice and cool people.

122
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,331
You should eat meat for hand tremors.

123
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,208
You should eat meat for hand tremors.

124
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,836
He cannot even memorize that one thing?

125
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,338
What an idiot.

126
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,093
My lady.

127
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,430
Are you hurt somewhere?

128
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,600
Get on my back.

129
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,271
How dare you stand in your master's way?

130
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,697
How dare you glare
at a nobleman like that?

131
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,705
That insolent swine.

132
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,167
Let us go.

133
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,670
Here.

134
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,632
You rude bastard.

135
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,151
Oh, no!

136
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,409
Oh, no! What are you doing?

137
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,120
The young master's hand tremors are
not getting better

138
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,164
because all he eats are vegetables.

139
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,667
That was the reason.

140
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,628
What are the rest of us
supposed to eat then?

141
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,675
If you are so broken up about it,
then go catch a rabbit or something.

142
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,431
That is true.

143
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,434
The King of the Ocean wanted a rabbit
when he was sick too.

144
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,018
Do not be ridiculous.

145
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,271
I said that
because rabbits are the easiest to catch.

146
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,356
The King of the Ocean wanted a rabbit.

147
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,524
What?

148
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,072
What…

149
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,617
It is too cute to eat.

150
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,577
I do not want it.

151
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,496
Young Master, rabbits have always been…

152
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,124
You know.

153
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,877
Even the King of the Ocean
told his servants

154
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,545
to get him a rabbit when he was sick.

155
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,297
Folk remedies are worth trying too.

156
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,174
That is not a folk remedy.
It is a folk religion.

157
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,176
I will just take some gongjin pills.

158
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,469
You want some rabbit stew?

159
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,971
Rabbit dumplings are good too.

160
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,931
The dumplings are the best.

161
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,144
Honestly, I never liked eating meat.

162
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,520
Really?

163
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,064
When you were in Hanyang,

164
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,109
you were completely obsessed with beef.

165
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,987
How did you eat those cows?
I mean, their eyes are so cute.

166
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,114
Can we keep the rabbit?

167
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,073
-Can we?
-No.

168
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,409
-Can we?
-No.

169
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,785
-No.
-Can we keep it?

170
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,454
Put the carrot away. What are you doing?

171
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,373
-Can we?
-No.

172
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,333
-Please?
-No.

173
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,501
-I want the rabbit.
-No.

174
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,920
My goodness, no, you cannot.

175
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,216
Hand tremors?

176
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,927
You need some good medicine for that,
like gastrodia elata.

177
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,473
I think I am almost there.

178
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,437
In the wild, you will find them
deep in the mountains.

179
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,858
But you might run into a tiger.

180
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:56,043
No. I am the most fearless person alive.

181
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,382
Oh, my.

182
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,636
He could have told me
what they look like, at least.

183
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,055
He said they are in the mountains.
That is useless.

184
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,057
Look at this. This is the wrong thing.

185
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,190
Wait, I think this might be it.

186
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,781
What the heck is going on there?

187
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,538
My lady, you need to get up.

188
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,789
You need to come with me.

189
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,879
Come on, we need to go.

190
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,298
Do you really wish to die?

191
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:46,218
I get what you are saying,
so just let go of my hand.

192
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,887
Wait.

193
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,934
I thought I saw you somewhere.

194
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,730
You are the lady who visited our infirmary
a while ago, right?

195
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,566
Is your ankle bothering you?

196
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,776
I will take you
to the infirmary right away.

197
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,403
And who are you?

198
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,325
Please let go of me.

199
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,205
She wants you to let go.

200
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,791
What do you think you are doing
to your master?

201
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,088
It is none of your business. Get lost.

202
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,840
"Get lost"?

203
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,135
Hey, why do you keep glaring at me?

204
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,305
You know, people used
to call me the Rock Fist.

205
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,358
You are kidding me.

206
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,239
I am not going to feel bad about this

207
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,452
because you hit me first, all right?

208
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,624
Oh, no.

209
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,006
Wait a minute.

210
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,634
We will have to stop
by the government office first.

211
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,631
Where is the boar?

212
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,509
Yes. He should be jumping around

213
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,803
in excitement by now.

214
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,180
Jang-goon, go find Man-bok.

215
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,349
-All right.
-Do you not have anything better to do?

216
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,351
Do not worry about him missing his meals.

217
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,688
He loves his food.
I am sure that he will show up soon.

218
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,731
That is true.

219
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,607
On the day Man-bok skips a meal…

220
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,526
Ji-han will stop drinking.

221
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,361
And dogs will stop pooping.

222
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,364
-What?
-Just be quiet!

223
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:20,372
I will explain yin and yang to you
after dinner then.

224
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,043
I want to learn more
until Man-bok comes back.

225
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,881
-Then shall we?
-Yes.

226
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,049
All right.

227
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,802
You do not have to learn yin
and yang from a book.

228
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:41,852
There he is!

229
00:17:58,827 --> 00:17:59,912
What is this?

230
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,923
Arrest him at once!

231
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,927
What? Why?

232
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,720
Why are you arresting me?

233
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,472
Hey, let go of me!

234
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,765
I did not do anything!

235
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:23,185
I know nothing about this! I am innocent!

236
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,822
Man-bok!

237
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,242
Young Master.

238
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,119
What happened to you, Man-bok?

239
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,038
I heard that there were some
gastrodia elata in the mountain,

240
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,082
so I went to dig some up for you, and…

241
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,459
Why were you looking for some?
I am not even ill.

242
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,920
I heard it is good for hand tremors.

243
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,759
Young Master, I did not kill anybody.

244
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,719
You know that, right?

245
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,806
Of course I do. I trust you.

246
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,391
Even if they torture you,

247
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,434
you cannot confess
to something that you did not do.

248
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,271
I will prove your innocence,
so just wait for me.

249
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,356
Yes, Young Master.

250
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,108
Do you remember what happened?

251
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,402
Anything at all.

252
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,116
Let go of me.

253
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,451
Do you really wish to die?

254
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,288
I…

255
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:28,000
I saw that lady with the hand tremors
before I passed out.

256
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,627
That servant was dragging
her away to kill her.

257
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,588
That is what happened.

258
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,387
This man is Mr. Jeong's servant, Gae-ban.

259
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,022
It looks like he died

260
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,232
after getting a hatchet to the head.

261
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,360
Right now, Man-bok definitely
looks like the perpetrator.

262
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,322
May I take a look at the hatchet?

263
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:11,293
Since the strike was to the head,
the attack was probably fueled by hatred.

264
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,045
Man-bok could not have done this.

265
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:19,885
Look at this.

266
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,558
I can see why the murderer
struck his head so violently.

267
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,978
Those are constriction marks,
are they not?

268
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,521
Yes.

269
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,482
It may look like he was killed
by a hatchet to the head,

270
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,609
but he was actually strangled to death.

271
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,986
Why would the perpetrator
try to hide that?

272
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,280
They were trying
to throw off the investigation.

273
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,450
They wanted to make Man-bok
look like the murderer.

274
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,119
Well, you need to release Man-bok.

275
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:51,291
I cannot release the most likely suspect
because of some presumptions.

276
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:52,834
That is a shame.

277
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,046
Even though the victim was a slave,
it is still murder.

278
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,714
Man-bok will be executed.

279
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,840
Damn it.

280
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,098
Hey, snap out of it.

281
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,351
If you do not, then your servant
is going to die for sure.

282
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,771
He is not my servant. Man-bok is--

283
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,690
I do not want to hear it. Get ready.

284
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,110
We are going to the house
this guy used to live at.

285
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,195
Mr. Jeong's house.

286
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,698
Let us do some digging.

287
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,372
Mr. Jeong must have been so shocked
after hearing such terrible news.

288
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,208
I came here right after I heard
about what happened.

289
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,304
You, too. Your eyes are unfocused,

290
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,514
and your lips are dry.

291
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,934
Your skin is rough.
Your organs are malfunctioning.

292
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,396
For today, though,
I am doing a special acupuncture deal.

293
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,148
One plus one for the needles.

294
00:21:56,231 --> 00:22:00,152
Gyesu Infirmary is trying to lighten
the burdens of its neighbors.

295
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,405
I am saying that I will treat you too.

296
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,162
I mean, who even are you?

297
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:13,123
It is not like this is a party.
What are you doing here?

298
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,416
The government sent us.

299
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,714
Mr. Seo sent us physicians to this house

300
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,883
in order to protect
the family of the victims.

301
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:23,967
Mr. Seo?

302
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,764
Come on, move aside.
Do you want to disobey Mr. Seo's orders?

303
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,559
Right. You want to disobey him?

304
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,145
I mean, Mr. Jeong…

305
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,230
Good job.

306
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:48,075
You must be distraught after what happened
to your family member.

307
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:49,951
"Family member"?

308
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,704
I am a nobleman and he was a lowly slave.

309
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,706
Why is the government office

310
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,750
kicking up such a fuss
over a slave's death?

311
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,836
Of course it is not about the slave.

312
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,339
He sent us because he was
concerned about you, sir.

313
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:06,176
You are the wisest and most dependable man
in Sorak County, after all.

314
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,307
Well, he was never an obedient one.

315
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,227
I did not like the way
he looked at me, you see.

316
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,478
I am glad he is dead.

317
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,022
So you do not need to worry about me.

318
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,608
I have been wanting him gone
for a long time now.

319
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:26,071
I am guessing that Gae-ban
was a troublemaker, then.

320
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,032
Do not even get me started.

321
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,326
I am telling you, he is better off dead.

322
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,539
Here. Just place the needle.

323
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,083
I was planning on selling him anyway.

324
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,336
So I just want my money back, that is all.

325
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,882
How are you feeling?

326
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:50,887
Hand tremors are often influenced
by your mental condition.

327
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:54,474
The shock you just experienced
probably made the tremors worse.

328
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,643
Shock? That is nonsense.

329
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,229
She has been lying here the entire time

330
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,314
after she visited the infirmary.

331
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,401
The deer antlers should help,
do you not think?

332
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,570
I am going to feel your pulse.

333
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,238
My goodness.

334
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,866
I told you, it is improper.

335
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,494
It would be fine for a female doctor.

336
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:22,002
There are not any female doctors
who have truly mastered medicine.

337
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,673
Just prescribe some
good deer antlers for her.

338
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,926
She is eating premium beef
every single day.

339
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,512
Lady Hyo-yeon.

340
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,932
You were there when Gae-ban died, right?

341
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:45,150
I told you, she was at home.

342
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,986
I am talking to the lady.

343
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,574
Please, give me an answer.

344
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,742
If you had been there,

345
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,203
you must have seen a servant.
He is a big man.

346
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,371
He is like family to me.

347
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,876
Hey.

348
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,921
He is being framed
as Gae-ban's murderer right now.

349
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,256
He could be executed. Please.

350
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,010
If you were there,
please tell me what happened.

351
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,386
-Look here.
-Lady Hyo-yeon.

352
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:21,686
Ban…

353
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:26,942
Ban…

354
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,780
Ban…

355
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,241
"Ban"?

356
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,284
She had a nickname for him?

357
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,705
Lady Hyo-yeon.

358
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,750
Calm down.

359
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,049
As I have told you before,

360
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,218
Lady Hyo-yeon has been sick
this entire time.

361
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,553
Right?

362
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,140
You were lying in this room
yesterday too, were you not?

363
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:03,144
Because you are ill
and Mr. Jeong worries about you, right?

364
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,068
Yes, that is right.

365
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,070
What would you like to do?

366
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,365
Mr. Yoo looks like
he still has some questions for you.

367
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,117
Is it fine if he keeps
asking you questions?

368
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,744
Or would you like him to leave?

369
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,749
I want to rest a bit.

370
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:29,421
Lady Hyo-yeon,
you still have not given me a response.

371
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,298
Please tell me what happened yesterday.

372
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,174
What is going on here?

373
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,636
How dare you come in here
without my permission?

374
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,680
Get out, now!

375
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:46,479
Mr. Yoo.

376
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,901
I am sorry about that.

377
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,279
You see, Gae-ban did
so many horrible things.

378
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:58,116
That is why Lady Hyo-yeon
does not even want to think about him.

379
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,410
So that is why Mr. Jeong…

380
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,453
Yes.

381
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,249
Do not tell anybody I said this,

382
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,877
but he once suspected

383
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,338
that Gae-ban had a crush on

384
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,591
Lady Hyo-yeon.

385
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,594
Did he really?

386
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,309
Of course not.

387
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,228
I will be back.

388
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,357
I will bring deer antlers
so she can regain her strength.

389
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:35,278
Mr. Jeong ordered me
to never let you in again.

390
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,990
Good night, then.

391
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,244
You said that you would let
a proficient female physician

392
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,541
feel Lady Hyo-yeon's pulse.

393
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,168
You did not forget that, did you?

394
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,428
If such a female doctor really does exist,

395
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,514
I will be sure to call her right away.

396
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,645
The boar killed somebody.

397
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,481
The boar killed somebody.

398
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:12,899
-That is not true.
-The boar killed somebody.

399
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,859
He is not the type to kill people.

400
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,694
You know,

401
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,489
He cried because he killed
an ant while chopping firewood.

402
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,867
He is a big softie.
I bet he is crying in his cell every day.

403
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,994
They arrested the wrong person.

404
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,455
He will be back in no time,
asking for more food.

405
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,957
He better not complain
about the side dishes.

406
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,796
What happened? I thought
you were going to rescue him.

407
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,299
It will be hard.

408
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,971
None of this would have happened

409
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,724
if you had eaten
that damn rabbit, Se-poong.

410
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,025
Mr. Yoo, I need to talk to you.

411
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,450
We need Lady Hyo-yeon

412
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,244
to save Man-bok.

413
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:10,665
And there is only one way
to find out the truth from Lady Hyo-yeon.

414
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,713
I must become
a proficient female physician.

415
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,179
You said that you would let
a proficient female physician

416
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,265
feel Lady Hyo-yeon's pulse.

417
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,975
You did not forget that, did you?

418
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,395
So that is what you meant.

419
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,814
You are planning on doing it yourself.

420
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:42,071
However, it takes a very long time
to master medicine.

421
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,532
Man-bok will be executed before then.

422
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:49,954
Mr. Yoo.

423
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,332
Do you not know this?

424
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,335
"It is not because you cannot.
It is because you will not."

425
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,253
The teaching by Mencius…

426
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,008
There is another one.

427
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:06,012
"If you start learning something,
do not give up until mastering it."

428
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,764
That is from Doctrine of the Mean,
Chapter 20.

429
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,519
Alright.

430
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,730
Let us do it.

431
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:22,195
But medical texts are much harder
than Confucian texts.

432
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,947
This will be challenging.

433
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,490
Of course.

434
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,787
Let us tackle this one first.

435
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,374
I am not going to sleep until I am done.

436
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,000
No, you should sleep.

437
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,002
After my special cram session,

438
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,171
you will learn medicine
faster than anybody else.

439
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,551
The medical texts say that

440
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,302
in regards to body shapes,

441
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,680
thinness is preferable over obesity

442
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,599
and healthy skin is better
than yellow skin.

443
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,060
Also, the treatment method
is different for everyone.

444
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,896
Gokji.

445
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,609
GOKJI

446
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,486
Try finding susamri.

447
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,405
Right here.

448
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,906
Now, try finding hapgok.

449
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,199
HAPGOK

450
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,159
Good job.

451
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,499
This drawing shows
the 12 meridian vessels.

452
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:21,170
At this rate, I am sure you will be able
to learn it before sunset.

453
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:28,136
This diagram shows
the inside of the human body.

454
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,639
A person's body is just like a country.

455
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,767
Therefore, when the heart is not working,

456
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,644
the foundation of the body is at risk,

457
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,564
so you must be very, very careful.

458
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,364
Ouch!

459
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,164
There are ways to keep
yourself healthy through the seasons.

460
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,334
In the spring and summer,
you should sleep late and get up early.

461
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,961
In the fall, you should sleep early
and get up early.

462
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,595
Rehmannia radix and Rehmannia glutinosa.

463
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,680
The black Rehmannia glutinosa
and fresh Rehmannia radix

464
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,182
are the same thing.

465
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,892
Pick up the Rehmannia glutinosa.

466
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:22,106
If you wash Rehmannia,
then squeeze it, steam it, and dry it

467
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,068
until it becomes black and shiny,

468
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,110
it becomes Rehmannia glutinosa.

469
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:30,990
Rehmannia glutinosa
is sweet and delicious like candy.

470
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,202
Young Master.

471
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:42,752
I wonder if Man-bok is sleeping well.

472
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,882
I mean, he usually
falls asleep pretty quickly,

473
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,926
but he is picky about what he wears.

474
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,139
He used to fix my clothes for me
whenever I looked disheveled,

475
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,600
saying that people
would talk badly about me.

476
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:05,566
That is why your clothes have been…

477
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,654
I thought I have been dressing
pretty decently.

478
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,866
Let us try our hardest to save Man-bok.

479
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,121
Yanggye, yangji, and yanggok.

480
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,207
Try finding them.

481
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:26,879
Yanggye.

482
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:27,797
Yangji.

483
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,756
Yanggok.

484
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,306
I am sure that Man-bok is doing just fine.

485
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,022
This might sound strange,

486
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,776
but Man-bok is the only family
that I have left.

487
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,779
Try finding onyoo.

488
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,164
Do you not have any siblings?

489
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,875
No.

490
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:07,211
I have no siblings. My mother passed away,

491
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,216
and my father…

492
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,851
Man-bok is the only person
that I have left.

493
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:27,774
You should eat.

494
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:35,448
Are you feeling bad for me right now?

495
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,659
Try finding joktonggok.

496
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,500
It is around here.

497
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:53,549
Lady Hyo-yeon is a lot like you.

498
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,386
-Me?
-Yes.

499
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,015
Wait, I mean,

500
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,060
I am talking about the way you used to be.

501
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:09,732
You acted like you had nobody left
in the world to rely on.

502
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,487
Is it not strange?

503
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,073
Her betrothed cares so much for her,

504
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:20,368
and Mr. Jeong seems like
he loves her as well.

505
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,287
But she looked so lonely to me.

506
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,751
No, I…

507
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,628
I think she is more like you, Mr. Yoo.

508
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,633
Why is that?

509
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,178
She looked a lot like you

510
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:43,307
when you were trying to save Man-bok.

511
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,519
Ban…

512
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,398
Ban…

513
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,068
What do you mean?

514
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,779
Poong.

515
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,450
Poong…

516
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,499
Poong.

517
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,302
Why did she say it like that?

518
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:26,142
Why do you think Lady Hyo-yeon

519
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,894
called Gae-ban "Ban"?

520
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,571
Judging by the records alone,
it looks like Man-bok killed him.

521
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,200
A slave who lives at Gyesu Infirmary?

522
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,784
What is there to think about?

523
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:47,955
A slave has committed murder.
He should be executed at the very least.

524
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,917
My daughter's betrothed
acquired this from Qing.

525
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,877
It is very precious,

526
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,629
so make sure to keep it safe.

527
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,839
From Qing, you say?

528
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,301
I am having trouble dealing
with the government office

529
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,011
because my slave was killed.

530
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,223
I do not want to deal with this
for very long.

531
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,808
I will make sure to take care of it
right away, sir.

532
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:14,023
You are so reliable, Mr. Im,
unlike the stubborn Mr. Seo.

533
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,609
The investigation is not over yet.

534
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,319
There is something fishy about this case.

535
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,946
Mr. Seo.

536
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:23,324
The King's Court wants to stop
all disorderly conduct in this country.

537
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:27,328
There is no reason to waste so much time
on a couple of slaves.

538
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,246
Three days.

539
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,208
If you cannot find
new evidence in three days,

540
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,626
the slave will be executed.

541
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,462
I only care about the records,

542
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:39,674
and the records are telling me
that he is the one who killed him.

543
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,761
GYESU INFIRMARY

544
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,320
Stop that!

545
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,615
What is the occasion?

546
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,284
Why are you making all this?

547
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,953
I am making some gongjin pills.

548
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,289
Man-bok needs to stay healthy in prison.

549
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,416
I am cooking some food for Man-bok.

550
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:18,170
They probably do not give him
enough food in there.

551
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,549
These are some rice balls for the boar.

552
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:25,720
Should you not put something
in there for flavor?

553
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:29,724
If you want it to last for a long time,
you can only use salt and sesame oil.

554
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,475
If you add anything else, it will go bad.

555
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,020
You do not know
because you have never been imprisoned.

556
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,607
Nam-hae, have you ever been imprisoned?

557
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,359
I killed my ex-husband.

558
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,571
Me too.

559
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,782
What? Really?

560
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,160
No, I have never been married.

561
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,873
Nam-hae gets a lot of requests
to make food for prisoners.

562
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:59,003
This is all for Man-bok? That is amazing.

563
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,254
How can I help?

564
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,380
Here.

565
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,175
-Wrap them up.
-All right.

566
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,509
Thank you, everyone.

567
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,430
But these look like they are for a feast.

568
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:13,059
He said he has a use for them.

569
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:14,518
Who?

570
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,937
I asked for them.

571
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,941
We are going back
to Mr. Jeong's house, right?

572
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,738
What is with that look?

573
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,582
Go back.

574
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:39,877
Mr. Jeong will actually kill me this time.

575
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,129
Come on.

576
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,465
Just take a peek at the food.

577
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,509
You will not be able to resist it.

578
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,135
No.

579
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,346
I do not want to die over some food.

580
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,141
We are from the law enforcement office.

581
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,939
Oh, yes?

582
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,732
You said that last time too.

583
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:05,236
You can go right back there.

584
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,323
If you throw away food
given by the government…

585
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,830
From the government?

586
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,833
Will it not be problematic?

587
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,168
People are talking
about how Lady Hyo-yeon's health

588
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,462
has taken a turn for the worse
right before her marriage.

589
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:26,465
So, the royal inspector
who was sent by the King himself

590
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,968
told us to bring you this food.

591
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,095
My goodness, should we just go back?

592
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:34,014
No, not at all.

593
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,767
If that is the case,
then I will ask Mr. Jeong about this

594
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,895
as soon as he comes back.
Please just wait a bit.

595
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:43,232
Let us do this, then.

596
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,901
Mr. Yoo and I will wait outside.

597
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:49,989
Nam-hae over here will go in
and just deliver the food.

598
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:03,586
A murderer is not allowed
to get outside food.

599
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:04,795
A murderer? Says who?

600
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,798
You have been a constable for so long.
How are you so clueless?

601
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:08,966
I did not bring him in.

602
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,886
Jeez. You guys are all the same.

603
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,306
What?

604
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,641
How horrifying.

605
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:21,687
You are acting all innocent after killing
somebody's property with a hatchet.

606
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,855
That is not true.

607
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,774
I did not kill anybody.

608
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:26,734
I swear I did not.

609
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,361
Do not make me laugh.

610
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,449
Your head is going to fly in three days.

611
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,076
You know what that means, right?

612
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,662
They are going to chop your head off.

613
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,584
What?

614
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:49,006
If you threaten my family member again,
you are dead.

615
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,758
What are you going to do?

616
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,428
What? You may have been
in the Royal Infirmary,

617
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,679
but you are nothing now.

618
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,478
Shut up.

619
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,188
Come on.

620
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:08,442
You got fired because you were
acting so stupid

621
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,236
while supporting the wrong person.

622
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,029
Shut your mouth.

623
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:17,284
Are you planning on cutting him open
once he is dead, too?

624
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,620
You are the nutjob of the Royal Infirmary.

625
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,789
Gye Ji-han, the useless physician.

626
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,250
How dare you?

627
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,546
I will make you crawl on all fours.
You know my skills with needles.

628
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,048
How terrifying.

629
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,425
Of course I know.

630
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,470
Those miraculous
acupuncture skills of yours

631
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,972
killed the woman you loved too.

632
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,106
You have gotten so tall, Ip-boon.

633
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,399
Do you remember your mother's face?

634
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,329
I thought you were
just delivering the food.

635
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,331
What are you doing?

636
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,542
Well, I cannot serve cold food.

637
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,252
What if the royal inspector…

638
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:12,089
No, His Majesty becomes unhappy with me?

639
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,049
-Still, seriously--
-Eat!

640
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,138
It is good.

641
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:21,890
It is delicious.

642
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:25,978
-Can I eat this though?
-It is fine.

643
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,396
Eat as much as you want.

644
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:32,067
Only commoners can understand each other.

645
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:35,487
I cooked so much because I know
you all are working so hard.

646
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,865
Come on, call everybody here.

647
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,822
Hold on.

648
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:21,825
Look at that.

649
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,202
Be patient.

650
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,913
I want you to eat them warm,

651
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:26,872
so just hold on.

652
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:32,544
You cannot.

653
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:36,298
You said you would
leave the geomungo alone.

654
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,598
When we get married next month,

655
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,726
you will be taking care
of my household as my wife.

656
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:51,522
You cannot seriously keep playing
something like the geomungo.

657
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:54,274
This is…

658
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,195
not something I will give up.

659
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:15,587
Do not talk back to me from now on.

660
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:19,716
Answer me.

661
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,594
Answer!

662
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:27,182
Fine.

663
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,942
When you become my wife,

664
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:40,737
you must always look beautiful and noble.

665
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,657
Do you like it?

666
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:45,784
But…

667
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,788
How can I wear something so bright

668
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,665
after such a horrible thing happened…

669
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:52,875
"A horrible thing"?

670
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,752
What are you talking about?

671
00:45:58,839 --> 00:45:59,673
Ban…

672
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,135
I mean…

673
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:05,471
Gae-ban was killed.

674
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,890
That has nothing to do with us.

675
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,854
You did not go anywhere that day,

676
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,315
and you did not do anything.

677
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,150
Is that not right?

678
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:22,863
It is all right.

679
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,073
It is all right.

680
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,576
Lady Hyo-yeon.

681
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,580
The ribbon looks beautiful on you.

682
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,620
Is this all right?

683
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:14,706
We have no choice.

684
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:18,335
You do whatever you have to do
in order to save your patients, right?

685
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:22,047
I am also going to do
whatever I have to do to find evidence.

686
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,008
We need to save Man-bok.

687
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,889
Yes, we do. We need to.

688
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,193
But what are you looking for?

689
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,314
Sir.

690
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,567
Would you like to try some of this?

691
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:08,654
Sure.

692
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:12,449
You know, I would have gone
to the kitchen eventually.

693
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,493
I am sorry you brought it
all the way here.

694
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:19,498
He kept telling me that you had not gotten
to taste the food yet, sir.

695
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,875
-Is it not good?
-Yes.

696
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,022
I found it.

697
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,608
PERSONAL SLAVE
BAN

698
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:47,818
This is…

699
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,028
It is Gae-ban's identification.

700
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,117
But his name is Ban, not Gae-ban.

701
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,411
Yes.

702
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:01,081
The character means "friend"
or "companion."

703
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,467
My goodness, Young Master.

704
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,474
What are you doing here
instead of treating your patients?

705
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:26,273
I have already treated them perfectly.

706
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,066
They all went back home.

707
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,569
I knew it. You are the best physician
in this country.

708
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,404
You just need to perform acupuncture…

709
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,409
Sorry.

710
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,832
My goodness.

711
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:47,544
You know, you could have brought me
some rice balls or something.

712
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,380
You are still kind of thoughtless,
you know that?

713
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,758
I forgot about that.

714
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,932
Wow.

715
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,852
You are the best. Thanks.

716
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:15,489
Young Master.

717
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,744
Please bury me when I die.

718
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,371
Do not say that.

719
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,415
I told you that I am not letting you die.

720
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,293
It is all right. It is natural for slaves

721
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:30,420
to get killed and tossed aside.

722
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,882
Honestly, I do not even want a grave.

723
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:35,842
I just want to get buried in the ground.

724
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,889
I bet the dead guy
just got left somewhere.

725
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,559
My god, I hope that

726
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,937
his spirit has moved on by now.

727
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:50,690
I do not want to meet him
after I die and become a ghost too.

728
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,122
Here it is.

729
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:10,585
You leave it here for a fortnight,
and the animals take care of it.

730
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,215
This is a person's body.

731
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,135
How can you just leave him here?

732
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:20,887
He was just a slave.

733
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,941
-Shin-woo.
-Eun-woo.

734
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,735
Why…

735
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,322
How long have you been waiting?

736
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,241
I want to ask you something.

737
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:44,369
Is the execution happening so quickly

738
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,872
because both the victim
and the prisoner are slaves?

739
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,586
It would be the same
even if they were not slaves.

740
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,921
I only pass the judgment,

741
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,299
and that judgment
is based on the evidence.

742
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,051
Can you not push back the execution?

743
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:01,761
There is no motive for murder here.

744
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,847
You cannot just call him a murderer

745
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,974
because he was discovered
next to the corpse.

746
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,519
There may be no motive,
but the evidence is there.

747
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,524
I have already filed a report
to the King's Court. I cannot delay it.

748
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,735
Not unless new evidence is discovered.

749
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,613
But this is all so fast.

750
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:22,490
You know, I might ask your father
to call you back home.

751
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:26,620
I do not want you to get involved
in these situations with the physician.

752
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:32,500
You used to be so bright
and happy, Eun-woo.

753
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,676
Shin-woo.

754
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,596
Nobody is born bright and happy.

755
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,267
I shall take my leave.

756
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:08,870
One, two, three.

757
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,530
My lady, we are physicians
from Gyesu Village…

758
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,741
We visited you a while ago.

759
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,243
We will be coming in.

760
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:57,335
The left vein in her wrist feels empty.

761
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,547
Her pulse has gaps as well.

762
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:05,593
Her hands are trembling
because her heart is weak.

763
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,430
We must use acupuncture and moxibustion
to help her regain strength,

764
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:10,140
and then she needs some tonic.

765
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,143
Shall we perform acupuncture next?

766
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,104
Right.

767
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:30,910
You know how to perform
acupuncture as well?

768
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:34,748
Of course.

769
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:39,711
Have you always been
so proficient in medicine?

770
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,675
I am envious.

771
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,137
Nobody is born a certain way.

772
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:52,682
People must choose what they want,

773
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,142
then change in that direction.

774
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:58,021
It has not been that long
since I learned medicine.

775
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,858
Could you…

776
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:05,111
go somewhere with us?

777
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,218
We found this where Gae-ban used to live.

778
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,428
PERSONAL SLAVE
BAN

779
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,514
This is his identification, right?

780
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:37,644
"Ban,"

781
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:41,064
meaning friend, comrade,

782
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:42,941
and companion.

783
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:48,947
The "ban" in Gae-ban
originally meant “food,”

784
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,532
making his name mean "dog food."

785
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:54,077
Mr. Jeong probably gave him
that name out of spite

786
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,121
after tossing him some food.

787
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,087
Here, eat this.

788
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:07,632
From now on, I shall call you Gae-ban.

789
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:09,217
It means "dog food."

790
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,554
But you, Lady Hyo-yeon,

791
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:16,599
called him Ban, not Gae-ban.

792
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,017
BAN

793
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,689
This is your name.

794
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,820
It means "best of friends,"

795
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:30,155
does it not?

796
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:32,657
Because you grew up together
like best friends.

797
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:38,121
Eun-woo assumed that

798
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:41,124
a friend of his who had grown up with him

799
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:44,169
helped him get that identification.

800
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:45,295
Is that right?

801
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,272
Ban.

802
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:09,652
I am sorry.

803
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,492
I am sorry.

804
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:38,306
I remember now.

805
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,559
I was there

806
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,980
when Ban died.

807
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:48,733
Perhaps…

808
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,071
I am the one who killed him.

809
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,536
I will confess everything
to the government office.

810
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,829
Just give me one day.

811
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,258
Lady Hyo-yeon.

812
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,635
I am glad that you are feeling better.

813
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:18,179
But I cannot have you

814
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:20,014
collapsing again.

815
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:22,767
Let us go back home.

816
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,103
Lady Hyo-yeon has something to confess.

817
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:26,396
That is enough.

818
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:28,022
A person's life depends on this.

819
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:31,776
I care about my lover
much more than some stupid slaves.

820
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:34,821
So you are threatening your precious lover
with your pathetic money?

821
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:41,452
Mr. Yoo.

822
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:45,206
Did you say "pathetic money"?

823
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:48,126
Your pathetic slave

824
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:50,503
strangled our pathetic slave to death.

825
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,590
I want some compensation.

826
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:55,592
But are you not doing this

827
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,385
because you do not have money?

828
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,095
How sad.

829
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:05,643
Let us go.

830
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:07,478
Come on.

831
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,990
Please do what you said
you would do, Lady Hyo-yeon.

832
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:36,841
Stop.

833
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:46,809
Why the long faces?

834
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,937
Is it not a bit early to be mourning?

835
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:52,982
What the hell are you doing here?

836
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,484
You do not know?

837
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:58,196
I came here on this fancy litter
to piss you off.

838
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,157
Have you heard?

839
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,242
The executioner in Woohwang

840
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:05,828
is sharpening his sword.

841
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,834
Make sure to come to the execution
tomorrow between 5 and 7 p.m.

842
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,336
and pick up his head.

843
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:14,545
You little…

844
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:21,094
What are you going to do?

845
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:24,681
You stupid old woman. Get away from me.

846
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,560
Now that I have delivered
that wonderful news,

847
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:30,478
I am leaving.

848
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,564
No need to see me off.

849
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:40,947
Bye.

850
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:50,498
Do you think Lady Hyo-yeon
will come to the execution?

851
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:54,836
We have no choice
but to trust what she said.

852
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:57,463
What do you mean trust?

853
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:01,801
You two are too naive and kind.

854
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,178
Naive? Poong and his girlfriend?

855
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,179
No, they are not.

856
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:13,896
GAE-BAN

857
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:16,399
GIL-SOO

858
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:19,026
So please get
the most expensive medicine for her.

859
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,403
HYO-YEON

860
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:22,071
I was there.

861
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,365
What do you think you are doing
to your master?

862
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,033
GAE-BAN, GIL-SOO

863
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,161
Were you not lying
in this room yesterday too?

864
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,620
Do you really wish to die?

865
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,247
I might have killed him.

866
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,582
I did not kill anybody.

867
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,086
WE MUST PROTECT MAN-BOK AND HYO-YEON

868
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:42,425
That is what we know so far.

869
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:43,468
Jeez.

870
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:46,345
Can we not just tell the officers
that Lady Hyo-yeon did it?

871
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,431
You said she confessed, right?

872
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:50,641
Do you really think
she killed Gae-ban, though?

873
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,729
They were like siblings, right?

874
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:58,566
I thought Gae-ban was a bit rebellious,
not like a slave, you know?

875
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:00,943
Do you think

876
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,445
he did something bad
because he loved Lady Hyo-yeon?

877
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:04,655
Hey.

878
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:07,700
Let us not make this
into some kind of trashy love story.

879
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:11,412
Gae-ban or that handsome nobleman,
they are both trashy love stories.

880
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:15,875
I do not think that lady
could have lifted a hatchet.

881
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:19,712
Well, he was strangled to death
with a rope, not killed with a hatchet.

882
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,631
So it is not impossible.

883
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:24,425
What? It was not a hatchet?

884
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,595
That is what people
were saying at the market.

885
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:31,140
They were saying that Man-bok

886
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:33,267
had finally killed a man

887
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,102
with those enormous arms of his.

888
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:42,485
The law enforcement office
never announced the cause of death.

889
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:46,072
They just let people talk
amongst themselves.

890
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:52,787
Then…

891
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:56,249
How did Gil-soo…

892
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,543
Your pathetic slave

893
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:02,129
strangled our pathetic slave to death.

894
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,924
He definitely knew

895
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:07,426
that he had been strangled to death.

896
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,309
It is time to catch the perpetrator.

897
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,897
Time to catch the perpetrator!

898
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:29,365
-Why are you here again?
-I am a physician. What do you think?

899
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:31,450
I am here to see
if Mr. Jeong is doing well.

900
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:33,286
Mr. Jeong.

901
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:35,705
What are you doing here at this hour?

902
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:41,460
I need to meet your daughter.

903
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:53,890
We are too late.

904
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:57,393
They have already left.

905
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:02,064
Let us put up flyers.

906
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,108
That handsome guy
was the bad guy after all.

907
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:07,111
We do not have the time to draw
and make the flyers.

908
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:09,030
Ip-boon can draw them.

909
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:13,618
I cannot remember much about him,
other than that he was handsome.

910
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,413
Jang-goon can remember anything.

911
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:21,292
Jang-goon, did you see his face?

912
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:22,209
Did you?

913
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:29,258
His eyes look a lot meaner.

914
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:31,427
No.

915
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:34,430
-That looks nothing like him.
-Damn it.

916
01:05:37,558 --> 01:05:39,393
That is also wrong. It looks weird.

917
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:40,728
That doesn’t look like him.

918
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:44,732
Nope.

919
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:52,198
Good job.

920
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:53,991
That is it.

921
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,242
A bit darker.

922
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:56,285
You are almost there.

923
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:57,870
That is it.

924
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:01,082
-Great.
-Alright.

925
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:12,969
My lady, we just need to go
over this hill.

926
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:15,763
I will make sure
that you are happy forever.

927
01:06:15,846 --> 01:06:17,515
so just keep walking for me.

928
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:23,104
Please let me go.

929
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:26,983
Please.

930
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:29,819
Come on.

931
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:39,161
If you let me go,

932
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:41,330
I will not tell anybody
about what happened.

933
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,002
You will not tell anybody?

934
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,004
Tell them what?

935
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:52,174
You did not see anything, remember?

936
01:06:57,304 --> 01:06:58,597
Are you crying?

937
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,144
This is all your fault.
You have no right to cry.

938
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:06,397
This would not have happened
if you had not played the geomungo.

939
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,774
You are the one who put me
in this situation.

940
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:09,817
Do you understand?

941
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,319
I am trying to stop myself
from killing you here,

942
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:13,529
and you are crying?

943
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:35,676
I am sorry.

944
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:38,429
I should not have done that.

945
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:39,972
Please forgive me.

946
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:42,725
You are everything to me.

947
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:45,603
I would do anything for you.

948
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:49,607
I no longer fear death.

949
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:51,442
What I am afraid of

950
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:55,279
is losing you.

951
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:59,533
So, please keep walking.

952
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:09,752
Have you seen her?

953
01:08:14,548 --> 01:08:15,800
Have you seen these people?

954
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,343
Have you seen them?

955
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,594
Just look at it.

956
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:19,762
Go away.

957
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:21,222
Hey.

958
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:22,473
That stupid old woman.

959
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:23,933
She is a pretty noblewoman.

960
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:26,227
Look, he has these scary eyes.

961
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,229
You have not seen them?

962
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:30,147
-No, I have not.
-No.

963
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,738
SON, YOO SE-YEOP

964
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,997
SON, YOO SE-YEOP

965
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:50,084
Hey, idiot.

966
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:54,630
Somebody saw Gil-soo on a path
leading to Sorak Port.

967
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:58,300
Sorak Port? The merchants
from Qing frequent that place.

968
01:08:58,384 --> 01:08:59,802
A ship from Qing comes in

969
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:01,011
between 3 and 5 p.m.
on the 15th of each month.

970
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:03,931
He used to be a merchant from Qing,

971
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:06,308
-so he must know that.
-The 15th? That is today.

972
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:08,894
-What?
-If it is between 3 and 5 p.m.

973
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,521
we do not have much time.

974
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:15,442
GOVERNMENT OFFICE

975
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:16,527
Shin-woo.

976
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:19,488
I heard that we can utilize
the horses and officers

977
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:21,448
with the royal inspector's permission.

978
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:23,826
Government resources cannot be used
for personal matters.

979
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:26,370
We are doing this
for a fair enforcement of the law.

980
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:28,038
These matters are not personal.

981
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:31,417
And that murderer
is holding Lady Hyo-yeon as hostage.

982
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,752
The law is the law,

983
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,754
and I shall follow it.

984
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:36,839
Shin-woo.

985
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:42,178
Please trust me.

986
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,722
He is the real murderer.
We must catch him.

987
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:48,559
If I am wrong,
then I will accept any punishment.

988
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:53,689
Who do you think you are?

989
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:57,234
You shocked everyone last time as well
by requesting he be released.

990
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:02,156
This is not just about
an individual's punishment.

991
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,200
This is a matter of life or death.

992
01:10:06,243 --> 01:10:07,953
I cannot give up now.

993
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,748
If you help me,

994
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:12,750
I will do whatever you tell me to do.

995
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:20,758
Do you know where Gae-ban's corpse is?

996
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:48,327
Get up.

997
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,084
You said it is urgent, right?

998
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:56,543
I will lend you a horse.

999
01:11:00,714 --> 01:11:02,925
The execution will take place
between 5 and 7 p.m. as planned.

1000
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:06,095
You need to catch him by then.

1001
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:11,642
Move!

1002
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:13,852
-Move out of the way.
-Move!

1003
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:16,647
Help…

1004
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:17,940
-Man-bok.
-Man-bok.

1005
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,777
-Please help me.
-Man-bok.

1006
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:24,154
-Man-bok.
-Man-bok.

1007
01:11:26,573 --> 01:11:27,700
Man-bok.

1008
01:11:43,215 --> 01:11:44,258
I will be back.

1009
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:51,765
You can ride a horse too?

1010
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:53,225
We are running out of time. We should go.

1011
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,184
Giddy up!

1012
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:56,103
Giddy up!

1013
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:44,860
YOO SE-YEOP

1014
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,221
Stop!

1015
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:13,514
-Get out of my way!
-Stop this.

1016
01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:15,432
Young Master!

1017
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:17,142
Did you find Se-yeop?

1018
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,185
Kill him.

1019
01:13:18,268 --> 01:13:23,273
I shall survive, even if I must
uncover every secret hidden here.

1020
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:24,608
You said that he was seeing things?

1021
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:26,402
Has this happened before?

1022
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:28,362
A bruise. It is another wound.

1023
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:30,114
Who hit him?

1024
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:31,407
I have a question for you, madam!

1025
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:35,202
You know, you really need
to learn some tact.

1026
01:13:35,285 --> 01:13:38,580
I told you to not get involved
with that physician.

1027
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:39,623
We need to save Seok-chul.

1028
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:42,709
Is that not why you said
you would visit the patient?

1029
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:44,169
Will you help me?

1030
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:49,216
