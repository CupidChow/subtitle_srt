1
00:00:20,897 --> 00:00:23,226
Eunsung, what are you doing here?

2
00:00:23,476 --> 00:00:25,358
Ah, just going through my phone.

3
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:26,943
Let’s go.

4
00:00:32,476 --> 00:00:36,272
Hey, what a nerd.

5
00:00:39,443 --> 00:00:42,616
What, only us?

6
00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:45,546
Lazy freshers, so spoiled.

7
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,077
Hey, watch your words.

8
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:20,718
(End of Spring)

9
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,238
Yes, manager, Eunsung speaking.

10
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,569
No, It's alright. Go ahead.

11
00:02:11,706 --> 00:02:13,968
You want some?

12
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:31,577
Are these all yours?

13
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:35,741
Used to be more. Now that's all.

14
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,038
Do you get this?

15
00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:20,038
Pass me that.

16
00:03:51,877 --> 00:03:53,231
Perfect.

17
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:56,332
When did you learn it?

18
00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:59,731
I've never done it before.

19
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,658
This one's easy though.

20
00:04:01,683 --> 00:04:04,856
Easy? Not for me.

21
00:04:05,943 --> 00:04:07,863
Usually. I'm not good at this.

22
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,090
I might get you a cup of tea.

23
00:04:15,144 --> 00:04:16,199
Earl grey?

24
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:39,027
Aren't we lucky to have similar tastes?

25
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:41,770
My previous roomie was a peaky one.

26
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:46,619
So was mine, that's why we ate separately.

27
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:49,684
Chores must have been doubled.

28
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:56,027
My ex never joined me, too.
For spicy foods. Never.

29
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,324
- I love spicy taste.
- Really?

30
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:05,363
You should've told me.

31
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,246
We could have been good
lunchmates in college.

32
00:05:09,738 --> 00:05:12,074
Too bad it's late.

33
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:27,255
Hey.

34
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:29,122
Waiting someone?

35
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:34,325
Yerin and I were going to have lunch.

36
00:06:34,553 --> 00:06:36,721
Really? I was also about to.

37
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:38,012
What's the menu?

38
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:41,776
Casserole, just nearby.

39
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,802
Casserole? Can I join?

40
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:48,112
Okay.

41
00:06:49,063 --> 00:06:50,559
What's that you are listening to?

42
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,915
No need to be that surprised...

43
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,608
I'm not eating you.

44
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:00,364
Thanks.

45
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,500
This is good.

46
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,755
Can I try?

47
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:23,091
Oh, that's the book I read because of you.

48
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:25,481
Because of me?

49
00:08:25,777 --> 00:08:27,309
I saw you reading it in college.

50
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:39,130
You loved reading books.

51
00:08:40,342 --> 00:08:43,239
That's why I went to the library often.

52
00:08:44,653 --> 00:08:45,747
.. Did you?

53
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:48,949
Why?

54
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,137
Well,

55
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,544
I just wanted to get to know you more.

56
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:59,770
I thought we were close enough back then.

57
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:03,262
It wasn't bad.

58
00:09:04,522 --> 00:09:06,536
Just, you were a bit awkward to me.

59
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:09,982
Did I...

60
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,301
Yes. I even thought you hated me,

61
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:14,200
when we were both freshman.

62
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:19,286
I mean, avoiding me on purpose.

63
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:21,567
But now,

64
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:25,998
somehow we came to live together like this,

65
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,356
and it's nicer than I expected.

66
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:33,512
So maybe it was me to be too young then,
or too sensitive.

67
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:38,497
I didn't know that.

68
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:56,395
How do you think? Back then.

69
00:10:01,574 --> 00:10:03,294
You really did hate me?

70
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:09,294
No, It wasn't like that.

71
00:10:21,257 --> 00:10:23,593
I'll be back after a cigarette.

72
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,778
Eunsung.

73
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,216
This truly matters to me.

74
00:11:03,011 --> 00:11:03,684
What?

75
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:14,473
Just let me know
if there was any issue with me.

76
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:33,091
Eunsung...

77
00:11:56,387 --> 00:11:58,247
If I got to know you,

78
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:01,997
and get closer,

79
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:28,153
I thought I'd fall in love with you.

80
00:12:31,424 --> 00:12:33,020
That just scared me.

81
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:08,427
That just scared me.

82
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:11,083
That's all.

83
00:14:25,606 --> 00:14:29,520
