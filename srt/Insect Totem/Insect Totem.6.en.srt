1
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,519
Line up. Line up.

2
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,519
You can take a fancy to them.

3
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,760
Don't worry.

4
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,400
Line up.

5
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,840
Don't be messy or crowded.

6
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,039
Be patient.

7
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,039
Get out of the way!

8
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,000
Get out of the way!

9
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,000
Step aside!

10
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,759
Get out of the way!

11
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,639
Get out of the way!

12
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,159
When you are our

13
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,599
young master,

14
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,000
Get out of the way!

15
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,319
Well,

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,120
wait for me outside.

17
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,039
Thank you, Dr. Pan.

18
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,800
Our inspector came here to see a doctor today,

19
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,840
because you're the one who's looking down on him,

20
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,560
Why don't you show it to our detective first,

21
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,360
Detective Fang?

22
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,639
If you want to see a doctor here.

23
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,479
Line up.

24
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,319
You asked our detective,

25
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,800
to be behind these poor people,

26
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,560
Sir, as you can see,

27
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,840
these are all the people who come to see me.

28
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,919
If you really can't wait,

29
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,199
go to Tongrentang in the east of the city,

30
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,400
Or the North Zhou Hospital in the west of the city,

31
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,719
if you don't need money,

32
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,840
We can also go to the Yaxin Club.

33
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
But,

34
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,919
if you really want to watch it from me,

35
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,840
Just line up at the back,

36
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,280
and you let me

37
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,479
line up behind these scumbags.

38
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,319
You're just like your father.

39
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,080
You can't distinguish between high and low,

40
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,479
but when you mention me as your father,

41
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,879
I'm angry.

42
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,319
He has been idle

43
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,520
for more than ten years,

44
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,080
You left me a mess.

45
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,840
I'll write a prescription. Two copper plates

46
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,680
to dig a corns, three copper plates

47
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,199
to make a diagnosis. It's tiring and tiring,

48
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,560
I can't make much money.

49
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,800
Isn't it because of what he said?

50
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,080
The patients in Cordyceps Hall

51
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,719
can score clearly who is expensive and who is cheap.

52
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,479
Okay,

53
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:53,800
Remember,

54
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,240
I'll let you know sooner or later.

55
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,680
Who is expensive and who is cheap?

56
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,199
Auntie, slow down.

57
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,719
Get out of the way!

58
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,400
Are you sure?

59
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,680
I'm sure.

60
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,720
Feng Wanchun is being held in Northern Zhou now.

61
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,560
In half a month,

62
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,079
they'll take him to Ling City's lair.

63
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:24,800
Yaxin Club and Yin-Yang Road have been scheming

64
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,240
for more than 20 years.

65
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,439
Or do they

66
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,759
still want to die?

67
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,079
Who says it's not?

68
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,079
If you say that a native gentleman and my master

69
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,560
are like brothers,

70
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,639
Unexpectedly,

71
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,399
it's all in the hands of Yin-Yang Road.

72
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
Wan Chun, we must do our best to save him.

73
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,480
Yes.

74
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,639
You must do your best to save her.

75
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,319
Uncle,

76
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,399
I've brought you the message.

77
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,160
The Zerg is such a big deal.

78
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,680
I … I … I won't be a part of it if I'm

79
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,439
a jerk.

80
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,920
Stop!

81
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,439
Kid,

82
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:08,639
are you worthy of your master?

83
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,079
At the moment of my master's great enemy,

84
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,399
he didn't pass on the position of gentleman to me.

85
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,000
What about me?

86
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,920
It's just mud that can't reach the wall.

87
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,480
Don't expect me to take you with me

88
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,000
when your mother was wandering around,

89
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,600
Don't forget,

90
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,560
it was your master who carried you out of the brothel.

91
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,439
Take this first.

92
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:44,879
Remember,

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,800
don't do evil or evil things

94
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,199
with employers.

95
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,639
The situation is critical.

96
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,879
The Zerg can't be done without the Gold Department.

97
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,399
Thank you for taking care of me,

98
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,120
Jin Shun

99
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,519
I can't thank you enough.

100
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,120
Mr. Jin, this must be mink.

101
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,360
Mr. Jin,

102
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,680
don't move. It's expensive.

103
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,040
Mr. Jin,

104
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,800
it's urgent.

105
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,199
The next batch of girls must hurry up.

106
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,439
I know.

107
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,720
Brother,

108
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,360
please come in.

109
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,639
Feng'er,

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,360
Fusheng went to play.

111
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:46,920
I'm telling you,

112
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
I'm rich now,

113
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
The gambling debt has been paid off.

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,920
I even made a lot of money.

115
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,000
Mr. Jin, I congratulate you

116
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,000
for making money just for fun,

117
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,240
Hurry up.

118
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,360
Feng'er, I have guests behind me.

119
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,759
Don't delay me from making money.

120
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,560
What do you mean?

121
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,759
You treat me like Jin Shun.

122
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,920
I'm telling you,

123
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,040
I've played everything I need to play.

124
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,959
I've seen everything I need to see.

125
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,120
I don't think it's interesting.

126
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,720
I don't want anything from you.

127
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,120
I'm poor and blessed.

128
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,839
You two wait here.

129
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:26,920
I've earned money,

130
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,279
so I can redeem you two.

131
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,120
With what?

132
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,519
Where does the money come from?

133
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,720
Bring more girls

134
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,680
to this hellhole.

135
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,920
From now on,

136
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,319
I won't do this anymore.

137
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,319
I work for my employer.

138
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,480
If he's rich,

139
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,000
how can he make a lot of money?

140
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,439
Why are you so nice to us?

141
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,920
It's not too much to pour me

142
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,199
a glass of wine, is it?

143
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,759
When I was Fusheng's age,

144
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,360
my father died of illness.

145
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,199
It cost a lot of money to treat him.

146
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,759
My mother,

147
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,720
in order to pay her debts,

148
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,039
She sold herself to a pimp

149
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,200
and let others spoil her,

150
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,320
When I was young,

151
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,159
I didn't know anything.

152
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,519
I remember,

153
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,480
I was very hungry.

154
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,159
I'll go to the temple

155
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,759
and eat Guanyin soil.

156
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,879
I just don't want Fusheng to know.

157
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,960
What does mud taste like in your mouth?

158
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,039
It can be used as some money,

159
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,960
so that you don't have to pick up customers tonight.

160
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,360
Got it

161
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:26,679
I went to make money.

162
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,559
Feng'er,

163
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,759
I forgot to ask you,

164
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,440
What do you think of this outfit?

165
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,360
It's good.

166
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,440
Close the door,

167
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:09,159
Detective Fang. Please take care of

168
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,559
the director's wife inside.

169
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,519
As police officers,

170
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,360
we wear stars and the moon all day,

171
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,559
Do you really have this kind of leisure?

172
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,519
About the pneumonic plague last time,

173
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,320
please don't mind it.

174
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,679
I dare not.

175
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,480
Yaxin Pharmaceutical is Shangfeng's own son,

176
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,759
My godson is in a hurry with you.

177
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,159
Does it work?

178
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,559
Detective Fang, there are a lot of grown-ups.

179
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:42,799
Please have a seat.

180
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,120
Have a cup of coffee to calm down the fire.

181
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,399
Detective Fang?

182
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
I heard that the security of the pre-Qin cultural relics exhibition,

183
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,080
is entirely up to you.

184
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,679
It seems that Detective Fang is outstanding.

185
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:07,320
It's all hard work in the sun and rain.

186
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,000
How can I compare to you?

187
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,879
It's so comfortable

188
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,000
to be a director's wife in this mansion.

189
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
Look at this sofa.

190
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:16,960
It's so soft,

191
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,039
You don't know,

192
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,679
I've been sitting on the hard stool

193
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,679
of our police station for more than ten years.

194
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,600
The sun and rain

195
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,559
depend on whether the reward is worth it, right?

196
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,559
This is the deposit from AsiaInfo Club.

197
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,879
After the job is done,

198
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,679
there will be the same final payment.

199
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,600
Your Ladyship is really generous.

200
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,480
It seems that this matter is unusual.

201
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,120
The secret letter from the water system allows the Zerg to gather in the Northern Zhou Dynasty,

202
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,919
Pan Jun and the others

203
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:11,879
will be desperate to find the secret treasures of each department,

204
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,039
I'll use the secret treasure of water system to lure the snake out of the hole,

205
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,039
and then,

206
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,480
Take them out of Cordyceps Hall.

207
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,200
Let them go to the warehouse of the railway station to trade the secret treasure,

208
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,799
and it will be done.

209
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,960
If you take the money and I take the people,

210
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,639
everyone will be happy.

211
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,240
What do you think?

212
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,720
However,

213
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm in charge of the security of the exhibition.

214
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,720
What's going to happen at the exhibition?

215
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,480
I won't be able to keep my black hat.

216
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,919
Money can't solve this problem.

217
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,559
Don't worry,

218
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,840
he'll be known as a treasure thief.

219
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,039
You just need to show your face

220
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,360
at the critical moment.

221
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,960
As for the rest of the fights,

222
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,080
I'll do it.

223
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,600
After it's done,

224
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,879
not only did you take the money,

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,639
He also got a reputation for plotting strategies

226
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,559
and catching treasure thieves.

227
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,519
I want my treasure of water system

228
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:10,440
to appear in the exhibition.

229
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,279
Miss Shi is really smart.

230
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,559
No wonder Mr. Matsui

231
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,559
is so obedient to you?

232
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,279
I'm flattered.

233
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,519
I'm announcing,

234
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:28,840
we

235
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,759
Zerg treasure hunt team,

236
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,840
the first meeting begins now.

237
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,000
Why isn't anyone clapping?

238
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,440
Can you cheer up?

239
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,519
Guys,

240
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,279
I've been selling the family emblem from dawn to dusk lately,

241
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,879
I just want to raise more money.

242
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,720
I know it's too early and everyone is sleepy,

243
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,159
but think about it,

244
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,679
Is Yaxin Club

245
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,240
richer than us?

246
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,720
Is he more powerful than us?

247
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,759
Is he more capable than us?

248
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,679
What are our strengths?

249
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,720
Our strength lies in our diligence.

250
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:12,360
We can do better than them, run better and toss better,

251
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,320
right?

252
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,080
If you go on like this,

253
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,480
will you find your father?

254
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:18,000
Are you looking for your father?

255
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:20,480
And you … Are you looking for your master?

256
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,080
You're fooling around every day,

257
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,759
who knows if it's just a whim?

258
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,799
Okay,

259
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,000
That's to show my determination.

260
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,799
I'll leave it to you today,

261
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:39,120
and I'll mortgage all my possessions here.

262
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,360
I'm here to support all the expenses

263
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,039
of our treasure hunt,

264
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,879
I'll let you eat, drink and have fun,

265
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,519
then,

266
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,279
If I say if,

267
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,279
we can't find this treasure,

268
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,759
How about distributing all my possessions

269
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,919
to everyone as compensation?

270
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,279
Big fudge,

271
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,360
Pan Jun,

272
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,720
All your possessions.

273
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,039
Are you out of your mind?

274
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,720
You sound like you're rich.

275
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,440
Me

276
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,879
Why is there no money?

277
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,720
If I don't talk about my treasures,

278
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,840
I... I'll just talk about my yard,

279
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,600
Do you know how much the yard is worth

280
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,879
when it comes in and out?

281
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,039
I can't even find my father.

282
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,840
Why do you keep a yard?

283
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,519
Have you really made up your mind?

284
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,440
A man of honor cannot be recalled by his word.

285
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,720
Well,

286
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,720
Then I have to make a condition.

287
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,840
If you agree,

288
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,399
I will do my best.

289
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,320
Tell me,

290
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,159
I want you to promise me.

291
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,879
After we find the Zerg treasure,

292
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,919
are you going to fulfill your father's engagement?

293
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,000
I want to personally propose to my grandfather in Ba Song.

294
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,879
Also,

295
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,679
I want the biggest Zerg wedding.

296
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,799
Pan Jun, let me do it.

297
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,039
Yan Yun,

298
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:16,320
Marriage is a major event in life.

299
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:19,639
I think you should think it over.

300
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:22,559
Right?

301
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,000
Don't you think we've reached an agreement?

302
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,320
That's the request of our parents,

303
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,080
the order of our parents and the words of the matchmaker.

304
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,159
You have to promise your engagement in the future.

305
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,879
This is the condition for our Fire Department to join you.

306
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,679
Do you agree or not?

307
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,159
Look at you.

308
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,360
-I promise. -Promise

309
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,320
me. What should I do?

310
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,240
You're stupid. Let's get over there first.

311
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,600
What are you two talking about?

312
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,080
Nothing.

313
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,240
Let's say,

314
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,000
treasure hunt

315
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,359
Treasure hunt treasure hunt treasure hunt that,

316
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,440
what we're looking for later is the water system secret treasure,

317
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:13,279
The Water System Secret Treasure is a piece of different metal,

318
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,839
no one knows what it is made of.

319
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,359
Some people say that in the Chu Wu era,

320
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,599
it was used as a sacrifice,

321
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,559
Others say it's a compass,

322
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,599
which is thousands of years old anyway,

323
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,640
In the eyes of ordinary people,

324
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,079
it is a bronze ware,

325
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,680
We need to find it.

326
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,319
We have to lock in a place first.

327
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,359
It's a ghost market where antiques are traded.

328
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,440
Or a bigger antique tile factory street,

329
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:38,759
I see.

330
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,279
If this secret treasure is lost in the underworld,

331
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,400
it might be in the ghost market,

332
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,400
If it's bought by rich people,

333
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,119
it might be in the relatively decent Wachang Street,

334
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,960
You must be

335
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,720
smart for once.

336
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,319
Let me assign the task.

337
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:55,359
Next, we'll split up into two teams,

338
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:56,400
the first team,

339
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,160
Keep an eye on the ghost market before it gets dark,

340
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,680
and ask me from house to house.

341
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,119
Don't leave any details behind.

342
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:02,799
Team two,

343
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,920
go to Wachang Street.

344
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,119
To get information from those Jinshi players,

345
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,599
let's do both.

346
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,559
I'm sure I can find the secret treasure of the water system,

347
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,720
Then.

348
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,559
How are we going to team up?

349
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,200
Yan Yun

350
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,400
Ziwu and Yan Ying go to the Ghost Fair,

351
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:19,079
you two are strong in yang,

352
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,240
I'll go tonight.

353
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,200
Yes.

354
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,480
My sister and Pan Jun are on the same team.

355
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:27,480
What are you talking about?

356
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,000
Are you silly?

357
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,559
I don't know. I didn't.

358
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,160
That's it. I can be

359
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,319
on anyone's team anyway.

360
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:37,440
I'm familiar with Beizhou City,

361
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,880
I'm on your sister's team,

362
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,359
So that she can spend money recklessly, right?

363
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,400
It's settled then.

364
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,960
That's it.

365
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,519
Shut up!

366
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,039
What kind of place are you talking about?

367
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Nothing.

368
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,759
Didn't you bring me here?

369
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:03,680
Okay,

370
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,160
Let me take you to another place.

371
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:06,359
Let's go.

372
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,799
Sir, what would you like to see?

373
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,839
Antique or calligraphy and painting?

374
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,279
Have you ever seen the Black Ice Ancient Iron?

375
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,079
I've seen her before.

376
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,799
Where is it?

377
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,119
Please wait a moment.

378
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,079
Dude,

379
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:35,640
bring me our Black Ice Ancient Iron.

380
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Okay.

381
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,200
Have you seen enough?

382
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,880
Pan Jun,

383
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:51,839
we have no progress here.

384
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,200
Even beggars and hawkers have it now,

385
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,400
how can it be true?

386
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,599
Don't lose heart.

387
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,119
Do you think it's so easy to find?

388
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,519
Of course not.

389
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,240
We've only been looking for it for one day.

390
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,759
We couldn't find it for two days,

391
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:11,759
two days and three days,

392
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:13,279
I couldn't find it for three days.

393
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,440
I don't believe in ten days and a half,

394
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,559
we still can't find it.

395
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,519
Now the streets are full of fakes,

396
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:19,799
if we look for them for ten days and a half months,

397
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,079
What if I still can't find it?

398
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,680
Young man,

399
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,680
you need perseverance and courage in doing things.

400
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,480
Look at my father and look at your father.

401
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:31,160
I've been searching for a treasure for more than ten years.

402
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:33,400
I'll do whatever it takes to achieve my goal.

403
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,440
I'll never give up in order to achieve my goal.

404
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,160
You don't even want your son.

405
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,079
Nonsense.

406
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,759
It won't take more than ten years for us

407
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,119
to find a secret treasure of water system.

408
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,720
Jun'er,

409
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:53,799
Look,

410
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,599
Here,

411
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,839
this is not.

412
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,240
This is the secret treasure of the water system. Today,

413
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,799
the Northern Zhou Exhibition Hall will hold

414
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,000
an exhibition of Qin and Han cultural relics,

415
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,759
The English Auction House is responsible for the exhibition,

416
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,279
and the North Zhou Police Department is fully responsible for the security work.

417
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,440
Guests attending the meeting will be invited.

418
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,680
No one is allowed to enter without an invitation letter.

419
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:24,839
The specifications are quite high.

420
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,960
We can't read the Zerg's secret treasure by ourselves.

421
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,240
Sister, what should we do now?

422
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:30,119
If you ask me, I won't do anything and I won't stop robbing it.

423
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,599
Don't be so impulsive.

424
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,720
You too.

425
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,920
Look at the person you're asking,

426
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,039
first of all,

427
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,519
We don't even know if this water system secret treasure

428
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:41,079
is true or not.

429
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:43,319
We have to figure this out first.

430
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,440
Black Ice Ancient Iron and Earth Secret Treasure, the Secret Key of Fate,

431
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,839
are made from meteorites with the same magnetic properties.

432
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:52,240
So they can sense,

433
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,759
and if there's no sense,

434
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,079
The secret treasure

435
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,279
must be fake.

436
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,880
I have the earth secret treasure.

437
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,279
But I always think about this matter,

438
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:03,319
what's wrong?

439
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,400
What's wrong?

440
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:07,799
The secret treasure of water system has been missing for so many years,

441
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,400
but it suddenly appears

442
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:12,039
and there is a secret letter to gather before the exhibition,

443
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,920
And now it's widely advertised in the newspaper,

444
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:17,400
as if we're afraid we won't know,

445
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,079
I'm worried that

446
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,480
this is a trap of Yin and Yang.

447
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,079
Anyway, no matter what,

448
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,440
we have to figure it out.

449
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,680
Is this secret treasure real or fake?

450
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,039
So it's just a trap.

451
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,000
We have to jump in, too.

452
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,279
Then we have to go inside to find out if it's true or not.

453
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,039
I don't even have an invitation now.

454
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,759
How can I know?

455
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,400
I have an idea.

456
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,200
Pan Jun

457
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,200
I told you

458
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,279
to customize a suit but you refused to go.

459
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:01,839
Look at them all

460
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,279
dressed up,

461
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,079
How are we going to get in like this?

462
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,079
Do you know how much

463
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,240
a haute couture suit costs?

464
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:10,000
You're poor and you don't pay for it?

465
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,200
Didn't someone say what they want just now?

466
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:15,519
Go bankrupt.

467
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,759
Pan Jun, you're too stingy.

468
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,559
Yes

469
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,960
You two have big families and big businesses.

470
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,759
Why didn't you pay for it?

471
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,799
Here, bring me 100 acres of fertile land first,

472
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,079
Me

473
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,319
Ziwu,

474
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:37,960
does your treasure work or not?

475
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,200
Are you talking about Zhenlong?

476
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,839
Although it's scary-looking,

477
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,599
it's been domesticated by our native land.

478
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:44,160
And you're eating seven insects and seven flowers,

479
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,480
don't worry.

480
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,240
We've been waiting for a long time.

481
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:49,839
What's the problem?

482
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,400
We've been waiting for a long time.

483
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,160
Why don't you let us in?

484
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,680
Why?

485
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,720
Why can't I get used to

486
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,240
this kind of domineering clothes

487
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:00,920
for foreigners?

488
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,839
What's wrong with foreigners?

489
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,839
Just wear the right clothes. Go

490
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,000
Okay,

491
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:06,759
Zhenlong,

492
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,599
we've been waiting for a long time.

493
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:09,720
Why?

494
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,319
You've kept us waiting for so long.

495
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,119
How do you do things?

496
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,480
Please line up.

497
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,680
Are you David?

498
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,119
Yes.

499
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,759
Are you Victoria?

500
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,799
She's Victoria.

501
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:07,880
No problem. Please come in.

502
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,079
I didn't expect you to sneak in.

503
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,720
It seems that we are still a little foreign-looking.

504
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,359
Are you silly?

505
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,599
Third uncle said,

506
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,000
Pan Jun is here. Let them all go.

507
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:30,240
Yan Ying, let me tell you,

508
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,680
just accept your fate.

509
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:33,920
Your sister doesn't want to dress like a lady.

510
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,000
We can't beat her again. She's here.

511
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,440
Why are you talking so much?

512
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,240
Tell me,

513
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:46,440
these are all Chinese stuff.

514
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,160
I was taken away by foreigners and brought back to do business.

515
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,599
Shameless.

516
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,680
There are so many exhibits here.

517
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,720
Let's split up.

518
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,799
I'll go over there.

519
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,640
Cordyceps Miscellaneous Post,

520
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:16,960
Liverpool Museum,

521
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,799
Pan,

522
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:19,880
David! David!

523
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,440
Hurry up!

524
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,680
Look at this

525
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,640
Cordyceps Miscellaneous Disease Post,

526
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,359
Why are you here?

527
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,839
This is my father's life.

528
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,519
It records the unique learning

529
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,799
of all my ancestors,

530
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,599
Including the Zerg secret arts,

531
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:40,759
but when I was little,

532
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:42,079
It disappeared with my father.

533
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,799
In that case,

534
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,680
your father took it to England.

535
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,359
Liverpool Museum?

536
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,799
Why did my father go there?

537
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:58,400
Pan Jun,

538
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,559
no matter what,

539
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,680
Your miscellaneous disease post,

540
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:02,880
as well as the water system's secret treasure,

541
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,480
We'll get it back.

542
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,400
Not a single one is missing.

543
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,720
Yes.

544
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:09,319
Not a single one is missing.

545
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,160
Let's go.

546
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,680
Find the secret treasure.

547
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,920
Pan Jun Pan Jun.

548
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:00,000
This is exactly the same

549
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,079
as my grandfather's description.

550
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,440
Take out the secret treasure.

551
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,519
Try that method. Okay. You guys

552
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,440
block it for me.

553
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:28,400
Pan Jun

554
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:29,599
There's a reaction.

555
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,480
Let's go.

556
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,160
Doctor Pan, Ziwu.

557
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,119
Go and tell Yan Yun that you've found it.

558
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:51,960
Hurry up!

559
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:55,960
Detective Fang?

560
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,759
You haven't become a foreigner for a few days.

561
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,240
I didn't expect that you are also interested

562
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,400
in these antiques returned from overseas.

563
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:05,960
Isn't there something new in North Zhou City?

564
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,519
I'm curious.

565
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:09,960
What a pity,

566
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:13,240
They have to be taken away as soon as the exhibition is over.

567
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,079
Where to?

568
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,640
Organizers say

569
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,079
it looks like

570
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,599
it was shipped back to British Museum,

571
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
They were shipped back to England,

572
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,319
but they are all from China.

573
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,319
Who says it's not?

574
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,920
How many good things our ancestors left behind,

575
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,519
all of them were robbed by foreigners.

576
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,279
And now he wants us to pay for it.

577
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,440
I can't be mad at you.

578
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:43,279
I really can't tell that

579
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,160
you still know that you are loyal and patriotic.

580
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,519
Among these things,

581
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,279
do you have anything you can like.

582
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,160
Just pretend I didn't say anything.

583
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:09,319
You two didn't hear anything.

584
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,200
Detective Fang,

585
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,000
you mean

586
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:16,440
there's a way to keep these things, right?

587
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,759
As for the security of this exhibition,

588
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:43,480
I'm fully responsible for it.

589
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:46,359
From the Great Britain Empire to us,

590
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,279
this time and again,

591
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,680
It's inevitable that there will be a damage on the way.

592
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,559
Detective Fang, what you mean is,

593
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,160
this damaged object,

594
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,880
Do you have other plans?

595
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,920
Are they all Ancestors'belongings?

596
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,400
If you can stay, you can stay.

597
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:13,240
A lot of high-ranking officials are asking me for money,

598
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,400
before leaving Beizhou Railway Station,

599
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,720
I dare not say anything big,

600
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,599
but I want you to take a fancy to it,

601
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,000
I have plenty of ways for you to stay.

602
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:26,880
I was afraid that

603
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:29,000
you wouldn't dare to ask for the price.

604
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,079
Money is not a big deal.

605
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,000
I do have a crush on something.

606
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,640
Cordyceps Miscellaneous Disease Post,

607
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,519
I want to know its origin.

608
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,759
Name your price,

609
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,559
the Cordyceps Miscellaneous Disease Post is not worth much?

610
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:49,519
I heard that

611
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,839
a ship from Foshan

612
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:55,880
to the British Empire sank

613
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:58,799
and foreigners scoured it for it.

614
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,200
The ship sank,

615
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,079
What about the people on the boat?

616
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,640
How would I know?

617
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,279
Detective Fang?

618
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,880
Actually, what we want,

619
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,759
I'm afraid you won't be able to keep it.

620
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,119
Tell me

621
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,519
about us,

622
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,000
I want the Black Ice Ancient Iron.

623
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:28,880
Well,

624
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,480
We have a buyer

625
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:33,960
for this Black Ice Ancient Iron.

626
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:37,319
Who has a buyer?

627
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:40,319
The Yaxin Club is the one who likes this thing,

628
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,200
and I dare not offend

629
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,400
the Yaxin Club.

630
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:48,200
Is it her?

631
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,559
I'll pay more for what they pay.

632
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,680
It's not about the extra money.

633
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:56,400
By rights,

634
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,720
there should always be this first come, first served.

635
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,519
But as far as I'm concerned,

636
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:02,519
I don't want to take the things of our ancestors,

637
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:03,599
Sell it to Toyo people.

638
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,759
Well,

639
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,160
let me give you an idea.

640
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:14,720
What about up there?

641
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,160
I really like one of your things,

642
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,240
but what about this thing,

643
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,440
There is no Yaxin Club.

644
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
What is it?

645
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:29,680
Since the pneumonic plague last time,

646
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,279
this insect drug,

647
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,720
They pay special attention to it,

648
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,640
and they hope,

649
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,079
I bought your Cordyceps Hall for research.

650
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,799
If you exchange Cordyceps Hall

651
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,880
for this Black Ice Ancient Iron,

652
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,279
How much more money

653
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,680
do I think Yaxin will pay,

654
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:47,480
These are all yours.

655
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,480
Let me tell you the truth.

656
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,559
At 8 p. m. the day after tomorrow,

657
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,039
these things will be shipped to the south.

658
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:02,079
Please think about it.

659
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,480
Think about it.

660
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,440
Let's hand in the deed,

661
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:07,359
Hand in things with one hand.

662
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,880
That's what happened.

663
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,800
The price of returning the water system's secret treasure,

664
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,119
is my Cordyceps Hall.

665
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,519
Let me tell you, Young Master,

666
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,199
we can't do this.

667
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,880
This is our Pan Family's ancestral property.

668
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,360
Before the investigation is clear,

669
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,679
you can't put all your eggs in one basket.

670
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,719
How much do you want from the Yaxin Club?

671
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:32,320
I'll give you twice as much as them.

672
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,719
Yingxuan's hard work,

673
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,320
is also a part of our Zerg.

674
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,039
We can't give it to them so easily.

675
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,039
But Senior Ouyang,

676
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,840
what they want is not money.

677
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,119
They want 128 herbs

678
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,280
in the backyard,

679
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,920
That's even worse.

680
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,320
Let me tell you,

681
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:48,719
these 128 herbs.

682
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:51,119
It's all Old Master's hard work.

683
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,199
We can't ruin any of the plants and trees.

684
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,159
They won't ruin it.

685
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,400
After seeing Pneumonic Plague,

686
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:01,280
they think the herbs in our backyard

687
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,400
are valuable for research.

688
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:03,960
Uncle Pan,

689
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,840
only when you give up can you get what you want.

690
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:10,280
Okay,

691
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,719
Now that you've made your decision, we all support you.

692
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,760
It's okay. I object

693
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,599
to staying at my place

694
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,519
in the future.

695
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,800
Overruled.

696
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,320
Dismissed.

697
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,360
Where are you going?

698
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,480
Stop right there!

699
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:48,960
Father,

700
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,280
Where are you going this time?

701
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,760
How long will you be away?

702
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:58,920
Jun'er

703
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,880
If you advance, you will save the people. If you retreat,

704
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:06,440
you will save the people. Although you can't be a good wife,

705
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:09,199
But at least you have to be a good doctor.

706
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,639
Am I right?

707
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:18,000
Remember, after I leave,

708
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,760
you have to study hard,

709
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,199
Physician's benevolence,

710
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:24,440
you must have the world in mind,

711
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,480
When the Zerg treasure is reactivated,

712
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,719
I promise you.

713
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,119
He will definitely come back.

714
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:40,760
Father,

715
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,320
Young master,

716
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:41,760
Father,

717
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,559
Young master,

718
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:44,519
father, don't go!

719
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:47,559
Dad, you have to take Jun'er with you!

720
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:33,280
All my possessions are here.

721
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:34,960
From now on,

722
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,920
I'll pay for the treasure hunt,

723
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:39,320
Pan Jun,

724
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,079
are you really willing to give up?

725
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,119
As I said,

726
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,880
none of the Zerg's things can be left behind.

727
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,199
Master,

728
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,360
Cordyceps Hall is over.

729
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,960
It's just a small incompetence.

730
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:56,320
Uncle Pan

731
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,079
-Let's go. -Let's go.

732
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,719
Brother,

733
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,400
from today on,

734
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:10,679
You have my full support.

735
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,559
In the future, no matter how difficult or dangerous it is,

736
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,920
I'll stay with you and never retreat.

737
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,280
So are we.

738
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:23,920
However,

739
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,119
there's one thing we need to discuss.

740
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,119
What is it?

741
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,280
What is it?

742
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,039
Logically speaking,

743
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,920
after the treasure is found,

744
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:36,960
We should split it equally among the three families.

745
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:38,559
However,

746
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,960
because we're looking for the water system's secret treasure,

747
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,599
I've lost everything.

748
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,360
Should we redistribute it?

749
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,639
I did it for the unity of our team.

750
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:53,239
I won't have conflicts sometimes.

751
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,519
What do you think, Ziwu?

752
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,000
When you were in front of my house,

753
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,760
I didn't know who you were.

754
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,679
Hold on.

755
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,519
You saved my life.

756
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:09,440
That's true.

757
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,559
But my master said,

758
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:14,079
after finding the treasure,

759
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,480
No matter how you divide the money,

760
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,719
you have to use it on the common people.

761
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,320
That's what I thought.

762
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,320
What do you think, Yan Yun?

763
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,039
Okay, I promise you.

764
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,039
A real man never goes back on his words.

765
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:26,039
Cool,

766
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,199
that's it then,

767
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,000
You haven't asked me yet

768
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:31,880
because you have no evidence.

769
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,039
It has nothing to do with you, you little brat.

770
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:36,280
Your share belongs to your sister.

771
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:37,599
Divide it from her.

772
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,519
After you find the treasure,

773
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,440
my sister will marry you.

774
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,320
I'll give her share to you.

775
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,119
We live and die together and face difficulties together,

776
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,719
Sign it,

777
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:47,880
Come on,

778
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,760
Use this pad.

779
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,559
I'm well prepared.

780
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:05,800
Let me sign it for you.

781
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,920
Sign it for me.

782
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:08,159
Why not?

783
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,840
Fine.

784
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,119
All right,

785
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,320
move your stuff now.

786
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,119
We have to find Jin Shun later,

787
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:22,880
and go to Warehouse 3 together.

788
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,199
Bring back the water system's secret treasure.

789
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:30,039
Young Master,

790
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:33,039
Sister Hua,

791
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,519
Have you packed everything?

792
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:39,039
What flower clothes

793
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:40,440
and rouge?

794
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,760
Young master.

795
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
My young master

796
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:56,800
has grown up,

797
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,960
I'm relieved, Sister Hua.

798
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,599
I won't go with you.

799
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:05,239
No way.

800
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,199
The three of us have to be together all the time.

801
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,199
I'll wait for you here.

802
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:12,719
I'm waiting for you to come back.

803
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,880
How can I do that, Sister Hua?

804
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,559
How can you live without us?

805
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:21,719
Why not?

806
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,960
I've served you and Master for so many years,

807
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:28,360
from settling accounts in the front office to being the shopkeeper,

808
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,119
And your smelly clothes and pants,

809
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,360
sewing and mending,

810
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,480
Every meal I eat at home,

811
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,119
I cook them all.

812
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,480
In such a big Northern Zhou City,

813
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,960
I can support myself no matter what.

814
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,679
All right,

815
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,599
Mr. Yanxi, remember,

816
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,519
I'll stay here in the Cordyceps Hall,

817
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,880
guard it,

818
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,760
Look at it.

819
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,519
Don't worry.

820
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,239
My good young master,

821
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,119
my good handsome son,
