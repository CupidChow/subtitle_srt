1
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:58,879
Let me go back.

2
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,480
Ziwu,

3
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,200
let go of me! Let go of me!

4
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,400
I don't want to. Let me go.

5
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:05,879
I don't want it.

6
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't want it.

7
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,639
Let go of me!

8
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,919
Let me go back.

9
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:17,000
It seems that he has had some kind of shadow.

10
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,360
That's why you're so resistant.

11
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,000
Ziwu,

12
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,599
Ziwu, Ziwu,

13
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,280
Ziwu.

14
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,560
Is that why

15
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,159
you're like this?

16
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,280
If you want to overcome it,

17
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,800
you have to face it.

18
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,520
You must have the courage to face it.

19
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,919
Are you ready?

20
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,879
Ziwu, remember,

21
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,280
everything you've done,

22
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,680
It's all for the people.

23
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,280
Let's get started.

24
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,959
Here,

25
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,480
I'll reward you with candied haws.

26
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,519
Congratulations,

27
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,600
Thank you for finding Ziwu

28
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,079
and saving the people and the entire Northern Zhou City.

29
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,279
How can I put this?

30
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,319
Thank you.

31
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,680
You're welcome.

32
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,240
Actually,

33
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,279
I should thank you.

34
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,560
Mrs. Matsui.

35
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,680
You poisoned Yan Ying, didn't you?

36
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,240
You guessed it.

37
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,040
Your Ladyship,

38
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,600
AsiaInfo Pharmaceuticals has deployed overseas resources,

39
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,439
The Ghost Beauty you asked for

40
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,600
has arrived.

41
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,399
Since you've guessed 78 points,

42
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,519
why do you have to ask me?

43
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,959
Because I don't want it to be you.

44
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,800
So,

45
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,160
I want to hear you deny it yourself.

46
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,600
Do you know what I care about?

47
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,959
What I care about is why did you use Ghost Beauty?

48
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,560
Are you trying to frame me

49
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,800
and our Pan family?

50
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,360
Pan Jun,

51
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,279
if you know what I've been through in the past,

52
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,439
Then you will understand me.

53
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,839
How is it going?

54
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,959
Any good news?

55
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,759
It's going very well. Look,

56
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,160
Ziwu's physique is indeed different from ordinary people.

57
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,600
The immune cells in his body

58
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,160
can quickly kill Plague Bacillus,

59
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,480
He's completely immune to pneumonic plague.

60
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,160
That's great.

61
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,120
That's great.

62
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,560
The serum was quickly isolated and cultured.

63
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,839
The fever is gone,

64
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,759
the first batch of patients are all gone,

65
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,720
After a while,

66
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,199
everyone will recover.

67
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,120
Folks,

68
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,120
the pestilence tea of Cordyceps Hall,

69
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,279
Free distribution,

70
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,080
so don't crowd.

71
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
Everyone has a share.

72
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,200
Enough management.

73
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,120
Thank you.

74
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,200
This is yours.

75
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,799
Remember to take it during the day,

76
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,360
three times a day, on time,

77
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,240
Use boiling water.

78
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,200
This is yours.

79
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,200
Take it.

80
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,159
Dr. Pan,

81
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:09,000
thank you, Dr. Pan.

82
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,120
Get the medicine now.

83
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,480
Hunian, this is yours. Take it.

84
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,120
Take it three times a day and take it on time.

85
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,440
Brother Pan Jun,

86
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,559
Miss Yan Yun.

87
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,919
There must be no good news when this girl comes.

88
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:48,919
Unload

89
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:49,720
the goods.

90
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,320
Come on. Get off the car. Come on.

91
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,200
Come down.

92
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,080
Where are we?

93
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,039
Hurry up!

94
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,679
Let's go!

95
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,600
Mr. Jin, are you all right?

96
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,399
How would I know?

97
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,279
I'm just a poor carter, not a boss.

98
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,519
None of your business, you scoundrels.

99
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,360
I have to meet an old friend later.

100
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,559
Where are we?

101
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,039
Where are we?

102
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,720
Don't touch me.

103
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,559
We're here to work in a pharmaceutical factory.

104
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,159
The laughing business won't do it

105
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,360
even if you kill me. Where's the pharmaceutical factory?

106
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,000
Where is the pharmaceutical factory?

107
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,240
-Where are you going? -Don't touch

108
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,320
me.

109
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,120
Fusheng, Fusheng, don't touch my child.

110
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,480
Mother,

111
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,720
Keep it in mind.

112
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,559
From now on, you can't call her mother.

113
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,840
If you call me sister,

114
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,639
this little doll is white and tender,

115
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,120
When you grow up in the future,

116
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,600
maybe something good is waiting for you.

117
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,279
Sir,

118
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,200
I beg you to save my son.

119
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,039
I kowtowed to you. Sir,

120
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,600
I beg you. Sir,

121
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,480
I beg you.

122
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:09,960
Mother,

123
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,480
Behave yourself.

124
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,279
Drag him in.

125
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,360
Come on. Drag him in.

126
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,840
Mother.

127
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,559
Don't cry,

128
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,360
kid. It's okay.

129
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,320
What's the matter, Mr. Jin?

130
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,159
Mother

131
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:45,639
You want to have a child to raise at home.

132
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,120
How can I do that?

133
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,320
Then what should I eat?

134
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,360
Give me milk.

135
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,000
Go. Go.

136
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,080
Gamblers who can't be helped by mud.

137
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,519
Stop crying.

138
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,600
I'll leave first.

139
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:23,039
I've been busy with business these days,

140
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,720
and I've neglected Uncle Ouyang.

141
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,480
My nephew, how could you be so down and out?

142
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,480
Laugh at me,

143
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,080
Uncle.

144
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,519
You came to the Northern Zhou Dynasty

145
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,720
because of the water system, right?

146
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:37,600
What?

147
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,720
Your gold department also received a secret letter from the river system,

148
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,600
exactly

149
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,240
In the battle of Bamen Mountain,

150
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,519
Shi Shiyu, a gentleman of the river system, died,

151
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:49,480
The water system has almost disappeared.

152
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,039
It's been 24 years.

153
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,960
The clue of water system suddenly appeared

154
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,039
in the Northern Zhou Dynasty. What the hell?

155
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,000
Nephew,

156
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,600
you know,

157
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,600
Only when we get together,

158
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,799
can we find the treasure.

159
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,120
There are still a few months, 12 years to go

160
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,759
before the date of treasure opening,

161
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,720
In another 12 years,

162
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,120
all forces are eager to move.

163
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,279
They covet the Zerg's treasure.

164
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:20,720
Tomorrow night,

165
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,240
we Zerg will gather together to discuss countermeasures,

166
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,759
By then,

167
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,120
we can't afford to lose the gold department.

168
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,440
Uncle still thinks highly of Jin Shun.

169
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:48,200
You thought Jin Shun was a member of the Zerg.

170
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,600
Thank you,

171
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,639
Jin Shun. Don't worry,

172
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,639
I'll definitely go tomorrow night.

173
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,600
A month ago,

174
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,080
I received a secret letter from the river system,

175
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,039
He said he had something important to meet,

176
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,200
so,

177
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,440
So I came to the Northern Zhou Dynasty.

178
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,320
Well,

179
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,879
these two kids

180
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,279
came here secretly,

181
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,000
Master also received a secret letter

182
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,440
from the river system a month ago,

183
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
But it was the Yin-Yang Road

184
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:20,960
who came to the appointment.

185
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,960
Was the gentleman of the previous generation called Shi Shi Yu?

186
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,799
That's right.

187
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,960
At that time,

188
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,039
Shi Shiyu died tragically.

189
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,960
By the way,

190
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,360
she also has a daughter,

191
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:35,440
About the same age as Pan Jun and Yan Yun,

192
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,000
but over the years,

193
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,279
Our Ouyang family has inquired about her everywhere,

194
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,559
but we still can't find her.

195
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,320
In my opinion,

196
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:48,480
the one who used the water system to kill us is the Yin-Yang Road.

197
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:49,799
These grandchildren

198
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,840
have been keeping an eye on the Zerg treasure.

199
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,360
Then Yaxin Club gave it a large sum of money.

200
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,000
Brothers,

201
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,039
we managed to get out of here,

202
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,519
Qian Qian, don't invite them

203
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,080
to have a drink.

204
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,840
I know who poisoned Yan Ying.

205
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,639
There's only one person who has the chance, the ability,

206
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,360
and the ability to understand poisonous insects,

207
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,039
Ashin Pharmaceuticals,

208
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,039
Mrs. Matsui.

209
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,559
What happened again?

210
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,000
Madam Matsui.

211
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,879
I told you

212
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,000
not to call me Madam in private.

213
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,799
Yes, I remember.

214
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,240
Miss Shi,

215
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,759
according to the informant,

216
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,679
The Zerg are all gathered in the Cordyceps Hall.

217
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,519
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

218
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:38,639
Shall we?

219
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,960
When the Zerg masters gather together,

220
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:46,840
we'll go there at this time,

221
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,159
It must be a fierce battle.

222
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,159
Don't cause yourself unnecessary trouble.

223
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,879
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

224
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,960
Why not?

225
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:07,080
Because I'm not sure.

226
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,559
Are they gentlemen from different departments?

227
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:10,799
I'm not sure.

228
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,919
Whether they have a secret treasure or not,

229
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,320
if they act rashly,

230
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,080
I'm afraid I'll alert the enemy.

231
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,480
It's not good for us

232
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,639
to get all the secret treasures,

233
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
I remember you … Shi Miaomiao never cared about the secret treasure and

234
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,519
treasure,

235
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,000
All you want is revenge,

236
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,759
to kill all the remnants of the Zerg,

237
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,600
How can it be said to alert the enemy?

238
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,440
That's true,

239
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,240
but I'm working for Shangfeng after all.

240
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,240
What Shangfeng wants,

241
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,559
how can I not fight for it?

242
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,840
We've known each other for so many years,

243
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,600
but we've never seen you soft-hearted,

244
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,840
This is the first time.

245
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,200
Absolutely not.

246
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
You misunderstood.

247
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,000
Miaomiao,

248
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:08,160
I know you better than you do.

249
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,519
I don't think so.

250
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,839
How can you be sure it's not her?

251
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,519
Do you have any proof?

252
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,680
What more evidence do you want?

253
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,680
She's been fighting the pneumonic plague with us,

254
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,680
and she's doing everything she can to help us.

255
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:23,720
That's because she still has a conscience.

256
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,400
Are you sure

257
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,839
she won't go against the Zerg?

258
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,119
Do you know that you're making trouble out of nothing?

259
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,000
You.

260
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,359
Shut up!

261
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,480
Let's not care about her.

262
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,359
I'm not familiar with her,

263
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:36,000
but Yaxin is behind her.

264
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,799
Yaxin should be our enemy.

265
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,200
Yan Ying is right Pan Jun

266
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,559
Yaxin Pharmaceutical Lab,

267
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,680
It's to use my native people to do human experiments.

268
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,440
I don't believe anyone

269
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
who works for a place like this.

270
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,519
That Matsui's wife you're talking about.

271
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,799
I've dealt with her in the casino before.

272
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,039
Guess.

273
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,160
Why is she here?

274
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,039
Why?

275
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,200
For you.

276
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,839
Are you cheating and bluffing?

277
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,000
She went around to sell the river family emblem,

278
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,559
so she came to the casino to investigate the family emblem.

279
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,200
She has extraordinary skills.

280
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:20,440
She was holding the lead you made.

281
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,640
Don't mention how fierce his eyes are.

282
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,240
You must say that she is the famous lady.

283
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,279
I don't believe you even if you kill me.

284
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,960
So here's the problem,

285
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,200
someone who cares so much about the emblem of the river system,

286
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,079
Who is she?

287
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:37,319
Who could she be?

288
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,559
If you know me well,

289
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,079
you shouldn't doubt my determination to take revenge.

290
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,519
I've always believed in you.

291
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,519
It's up to you.

292
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,799
I know you're the only one left

293
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,640
in the Water System Clan.

294
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,839
The Zerg is your enemy,

295
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:59,039
so I gave you the identity of Mrs. Matsui.

296
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,359
I'm worried

297
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,400
that they'll kill you all.

298
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,359
I give you power,

299
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,400
I give you wealth,

300
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,119
And you?

301
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,119
How did you treat me?

302
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,240
After you arrived in the Northern Zhou Dynasty,

303
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,759
I feel like you've changed.

304
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,880
What have you done for me

305
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,039
and Yaxin Club?

306
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,799
The whereabouts of the gold department

307
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,839
are still unknown.

308
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,720
Fire Branch

309
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:36,839
is still strong.

310
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:40,480
A local gentleman,

311
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,759
but he's locked up for us.

312
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,799
But the secret treasure.

313
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,119
The wood one is more interesting.

314
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,960
You and Pan Jun,

315
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,039
both became the saviors of Northern Zhou.

316
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,279
Mr. Matsui, you're drunk.

317
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,200
Lin,

318
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,759
Mr. Matsui is drunk.

319
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,039
Take good care of him first.

320
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:06,759
Yes.

321
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,799
Miaomiao,

322
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,960
we've made a deal.

323
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,960
After killing all the Zerg,

324
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,359
come back to your hometown in Tokyo with me.

325
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,960
Do you still remember?

326
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,119
Go away!

327
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:52,920
Back then,

328
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,000
the Zerg was so helpless,

329
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,119
When I saw Xiaoyu go crazy and kill innocent people,

330
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,519
I had no choice but to,

331
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,200
Let's do it together.

332
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:03,480
Kill him.

333
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,640
What do you dare not admit about

334
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,480
the things you've done?

335
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:17,119
Well,

336
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,400
Let's go then.

337
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,079
I'm tired.

338
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:22,720
Wait a minute.

339
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,480
Sit down.

340
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,079
For this Zerg gathering,

341
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:32,240
we have an important announcement to make.

342
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,319
It's about the marriage of Yan Yun and Pan Jun.

343
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,400
Why are you looking at me?

344
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,480
It's not like I made the engagement.

345
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,759
I have the marriage contract

346
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:55,880
signed by the father of Yan Yun and Pan Jun as evidence.

347
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:58,960
No, this … This is just a letter and you got engaged to

348
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,119
me.

349
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:02,599
If it's not your second grandfather,

350
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,559
I won't marry him,

351
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,240
I don't want to marry him yet.

352
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,200
Don't marry him.

353
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,240
I won't marry him.

354
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,400
If you want to get married, just get married. Ziwu,

355
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,799
don't. Don't make so much noise.

356
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,480
Nonsense,

357
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,000
Parents'orders,

358
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,119
How can I ask you to make trouble here?

359
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,519
Congrats to the newcomers,

360
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,839
you look like a double wall in the world.

361
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:31,759
A perfect couple

362
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,039
will have many children and grandchildren

363
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,920
and be rich and expensive in the future.

364
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,400
-Let's go. -I'm tired.

365
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,400
Yanyun,

366
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm going to visit my sister.

367
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,519
Why is this happening?

368
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:14,960
Miss Shi,

369
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,559
Mr. Matsui has fallen asleep.

370
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:18,799
Lin,

371
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,079
thank you.

372
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,440
Have a seat.

373
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,880
Lin wouldn't dare.

374
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,720
May I ask,

375
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:38,359
what are you thinking?

376
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,720
I'm thinking,

377
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,240
if a person does something wrong,

378
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,279
You have your reasons.

379
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,880
You can be forgiven, right?

380
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:55,319
Miss Shi has always been clear about love and hate and hated evil as hatred?

381
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,680
I didn't expect to have such an idea.

382
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,200
I've never thought of it that way.

383
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,920
You've been through a lot

384
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,680
all these years.

385
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,079
Kobayashi shouldn't have discussed it.

386
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:14,640
I'm sorry,

387
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,440
You've been with me for so many years,

388
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
it's okay to say a few more words.

389
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,839
Don't be afraid of me.

390
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,160
Do I look

391
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,920
so unkind?

392
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,160
Miss Shi,

393
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,079
after all, Her name is

394
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:34,599
Madam Matsui,

395
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,119
All members of Yaxin respect him.

396
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,559
How dare we treat it with a normal attitude?

397
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:42,880
High above.

398
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,279
Yeah,

399
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,160
All these years,

400
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,319
I don't even have a true friend.

401
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,720
But Lin,

402
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:57,599
I trust you.

403
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,759
Thank you, Miss.

404
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:01,920
I've never heard

405
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,880
such words from Miss Shi before,

406
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,279
Matsui said,

407
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:06,640
I've changed.

408
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,039
What do you think?

409
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:12,799
Is it good or bad?

410
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,680
Kobayashi doesn't study much,

411
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,640
but what his mother said is always fresh in his memory.

412
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,519
I remember she once said,

413
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,359
when you meet someone who makes you gentle,

414
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,480
It's the rarest thing in the world.

415
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,039
Have you read the marriage proposal clearly?

416
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
I didn't see it clearly.

417
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,200
Senior Ouyang is just in a flash,

418
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,519
who can see it clearly?

419
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,920
I don't think it's right.

420
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,240
Uncle Pan is vague,

421
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,039
but the most important thing is that I didn't hear my father mention it.

422
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,039
It's so weird.

423
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,200
It's a good thing,

424
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,559
but you're making it sound like

425
00:25:58,759 --> 00:25:59,720
there's a conspiracy,

426
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,680
I'm telling you, there must be a conspiracy here.

427
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,240
We can't just sit back

428
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:09,400
and do nothing. This concerns my good friend.

429
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,559
About Ziwu and Yanyun's life-long event,

430
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:13,640
what did you say?

431
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,759
Tell me, do you want to see the engagement?

432
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:16,400
Me

433
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,200
Do you want to?

434
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
Do you want to see it?

435
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,440
Me.

436
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,440
Erer, grandpa,

437
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,160
come here.

438
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:26,359
I know you're curious about this marriage proposal.

439
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:31,920
I'm old,

440
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,079
you've all grown up,

441
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:38,480
I have something to tell you.

442
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
I have to tell you,

443
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:43,440
there's nothing to be afraid of.

444
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:50,839
Take a look.

445
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:54,599
Yes,

446
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,440
this is my father's handwriting,

447
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,680
It's also my father's handwriting.

448
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:05,200
The same courtesy as the ruling,

449
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:07,640
and the two surnames are like Jiayin,

450
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,720
Conclude a good relationship.

451
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:14,839
The first of his life is white and the moon is full forever,

452
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,079
so I hereby make this agreement.

453
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,680
As the older Zerg people know,

454
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:29,519
on the day when Smoke Thunder and Yingxuan were expelled,

455
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,680
After they signed this engagement,

456
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,720
my father was expelled from the Zerg.

457
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,000
When did that happen?

458
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,720
Why didn't I know?

459
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,960
Looks like

460
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:41,759
Pan Pu really didn't have the heart to tell you,

461
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,359
those years

462
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,279
After the treasure hunt failed,

463
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,839
the Zerg was not as good as before.

464
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,400
The Bamen Mountain Forest

465
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,599
is regarded as the forbidden area of our clan.

466
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,079
No one is allowed

467
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,160
to enter without permission.

468
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,599
However,

469
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,720
Smoke Thunder and Yingxuan,

470
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,759
Ignoring the ban,

471
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:07,200
they broke into

472
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:08,839
Pan Yingxuan together,

473
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,720
Ouyang Yanlei,

474
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:15,519
you broke into the forbidden zone without regard to the ancestral training,

475
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:16,720
The crime can't be punished.

476
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,279
Master,

477
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,599
Master.

478
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,400
A Zerg gentleman broke into the forbidden area and committed the same crime as the disciples.

479
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:31,240
What else do you have to explain?

480
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:36,480
Even if Yanlei and I

481
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,599
were tortured by a thousand insects eating bones,

482
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:41,200
I have no regrets.

483
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,559
But for the sake of years of love,

484
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:48,440
please agree to an unkind request,

485
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:49,759
Well,

486
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,359
Yingxuan's youngest son is young,

487
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,279
No one can take care of you.

488
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:58,680
Fire Branch and Wood Branch have been friends for generations,

489
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,279
so I want to betroth my daughter Yan Yun

490
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,400
to Mu Branch Jun'er.

491
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,160
From now on,

492
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,920
let's invite Dai Yingxuan,

493
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,440
Take care of Pan Jun,

494
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:15,000
a poor kid.

495
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,240
Okay,

496
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:21,960
Okay,

497
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:24,880
If the youngest son is innocent,

498
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,519
I'll promise you that

499
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:34,319
the punishment of a thousand insects eating bones will be terrible.

500
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:35,960
Pan Pu

501
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,599
jumped into the altar.

502
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,680
He tried his best to resist it with his own body.

503
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,039
That's why you saved your father.

504
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:54,440
It turns out that Uncle Pan's wound

505
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,839
was to save my father.

506
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,960
Your father

507
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,400
will be spared from death and will not escape

508
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,359
the day when they were expelled from the Zerg.

509
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,720
So I left this marriage letter.

510
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:12,759
It turns out that my father suddenly left 12 years ago,

511
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:16,079
because he was driven out of the Zerg.

512
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,119
So this

513
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,440
Zerg treasure,

514
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,960
You've caused so much harm to everyone.

515
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,079
My father must be trying to save everyone.

516
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,480
I'm not greedy for money.

517
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,279
Why did he get kicked out of the Zerg?

518
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,880
But according to the ancestral motto,

519
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:36,480
we Zerg are required to protect the treasure from generation to generation.

520
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,640
Don't go against it.

521
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,880
So you have to deal with my father and mother one after another

522
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,759
just because of the ancestral precepts?

523
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,240
This is not a treasure.

524
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,680
It's a curse to separate your parents.

525
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,119
Your ancestors

526
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:53,400
worked hard and worked with one heart and one mind,

527
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:55,400
Pan Pu is the Savior.

528
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,839
Think about it,

529
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,759
people of your generation,

530
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,359
He cares about everything all day long and doesn't forgive people.

531
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:04,079
Are you worthy of the ancestors of the Zerg?

532
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:30,359
Who is it?

533
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,799
Young master,

534
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:34,960
it's late at night,

535
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:36,839
You startled me.

536
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,839
Why don't you go back to sleep?

537
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,000
Thank you, Uncle Pan.

538
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:44,279
You startled me.

539
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,079
Just to thank me.

540
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,799
Go back to sleep.

541
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:02,319
Wait.

542
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:08,960
It hurts, doesn't it?

543
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,199
I'm used to it.

544
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:22,400
You used to say it was a scald,

545
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,840
but today I realized it was for my father.

546
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,400
Why am I so stupid?

547
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:34,719
Let me put it this way,

548
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,360
for Old Master's sake,

549
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,320
For Young Master,

550
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,039
for the Pan Family,

551
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,679
I think

552
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,639
it's all worth it.

553
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:48,119
That day,

554
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,840
you sent Hua Hua and me out of town,

555
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,920
As soon as the truck started,

556
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,400
I felt

557
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,960
so sad.

558
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,679
On your own,

559
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,840
you decided to fight the plague

560
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,239
to save the lives of the people in the city.

561
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,519
When I was in the car, I thought,

562
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,920
I didn't hurt you for nothing.

563
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,559
I didn't teach you for nothing.

564
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,519
Your tolerance,

565
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,960
integrity and cultivation.

566
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,599
If His Lordship sees it,

567
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,199
tell me,

568
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:24,079
He must be very pleased.

569
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:30,559
All right. Go back to sleep.

570
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,480
Let's go.

571
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,440
I'm so sleepy.

572
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,719
I really want to take a nap.

573
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,320
Can you go out first?

574
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,079
Stop pestering me.

575
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:49,639
Is that okay?

576
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,000
You lied to me!

577
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,800
Get up!

578
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,840
I'm up.

579
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,480
What's wrong?

580
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:03,840
Do you like Yan Yun?

581
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,800
Absolutely not. You misunderstood.

582
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,920
You lied to me.

583
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:07,920
Pan Jun,

584
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,719
this is a sophistry,

585
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:10,599
I really didn't.

586
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:13,239
I treat you like a brother and you treat me like this.

587
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,039
Me,

588
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:16,599
I can't believe you miss your sister-in-law.

589
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,800
Pan Jun, you, me, me,

590
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,239
I'll give you two choices,

591
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:21,440
One,

592
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,000
I'm going to tell Yan Yun right now.

593
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,599
Two,

594
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,400
Take the secret treasure and come with me to look for it.

595
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:27,679
No, Pan Jun, this is.

596
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,280
Me

597
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,280
You don't want to choose, do you?

598
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:30,599
Then now I'm just

599
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,679
… Brother, brother,

600
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:34,320
I choose

601
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,760
Can you choose the second one?

602
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,000
Then you have to promise me,

603
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:45,679
after you find the treasure,

604
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,480
I have to save my master first.

605
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,800
We can't take it all for ourselves,

606
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:49,559
Okay,

607
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,880
It's easy to say.

608
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,719
I knew you would choose the second one.

609
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:00,679
It's not you.

610
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,760
You're here,

611
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,280
This is a frame-up.

612
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,800
What frame-up?

613
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,639
We're not going to get the treasure.

614
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,119
Do you know that other people will get it too?

615
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,159
If we can't get the treasure.

616
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:16,440
I don't want to see my father anymore.

617
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:18,960
If the other person you're talking about

618
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,960
is Yaxin Club's

619
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Yin-Yang Road,

620
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,800
Then our native land

621
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,800
will be at odds with them!

622
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,920
I'm coming.

623
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,480
I'm coming.

624
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,039
You two didn't listen to me.

625
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:48,920
I must make your grandpa angry with me.

626
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,679
Son Jun, Wu, you two are

627
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,079
Zerg's Floral and Terrestrial Clans,

628
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:58,800
Fire Branch is invited to search for the treasure together.

629
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
The Fire Fighting Department has the money to contribute forcefully,

630
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:04,000
and sincerely unites and conspires for great events.

631
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:06,039
Okay. Get up. Get up.

632
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,400
Come on, get up.

633
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,079
How can we disobey the ancestral precepts?

634
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:13,760
The treasure hunt that year led to a fight in the same room,

635
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,079
causing heavy casualties.

636
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,400
It's not worth the loss.

637
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,519
But in the battle of Bamen Mountain,

638
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:19,880
because of the greed of the Qing court,

639
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:21,519
It's not for the relief of the people,

640
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,400
but we have different intentions.

641
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,199
Jun,

642
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,480
have you thought about it?

643
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,719
Isn't this treasure greed?

644
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,159
Besides, four of the Five Clans

645
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:32,639
are still missing

646
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:33,880
and the secret treasure is nowhere to be seen,

647
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:35,960
It's just empty talk that you two want to find treasure.

648
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,519
My grandpa is the only one now.

649
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,760
The fire gentleman Ouyang Leiyun is healthy,

650
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,679
while the wood gentleman,

651
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,760
Pan Jun's father has been missing for 12 years.

652
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,079
The water system is even worse.

653
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,480
It's been 24 years and it's been nowhere to be seen.

654
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:46,920
Senior Feng from the Department of Earth

655
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,360
is still in jail.

656
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:51,119
Senior Jin Wu Yi has retired for many years,

657
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,320
where can we find him?

658
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,360
As for the gentleman,

659
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,280
my master told me,

660
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,440
He asked Pan Jun and I

661
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:58,880
to look for Old-timer Jin Wu Yi,

662
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,599
After he found it,

663
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,760
he witnessed us becoming gentlemen of the two departments.

664
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:03,239
By the way,

665
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:05,440
this is my local secret treasure. Please have a look.

666
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,800
As for the inheritance of a gentleman,

667
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,039
the gentleman of the previous generation must be present to testify.

668
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:12,000
However,

669
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,559
since your master passed the secret treasure to you,

670
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,840
You are a gentleman, no doubt.

671
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,280
As for Jun'er,

672
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,159
you're Yingxuan's son,

673
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,039
You must be the gentleman.

674
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,880
As for Brother Jin Wu Yi's secret treasure of gold,

675
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:28,239
it's probably in Jifang Cove,

676
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:30,519
Zhoushan, where they tried it.

677
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
Since there is a place to find the gold secret treasure,

678
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:34,800
we only need to find

679
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,079
the water system secret treasure.

680
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:37,679
Where the secret letter of the river system appeared,

681
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,000
disaster happened.

682
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:40,480
Can you two do it?

683
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,079
No, you're everywhere.

684
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,320
A group of gentlemen are talking here.

685
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,119
Just say a word.

686
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:46,280
You kept interrupting,

687
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:50,400
but the secret treasure of Fire Branch has been given to my sister.

688
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,320
She is the future gentleman of Fire Branch.

689
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,039
What did I say? Ziwu,

690
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:00,760
the natural aura of a general,

691
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,480
It's a gentleman's style.

692
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:03,400
What do you think?

693
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:04,119
Am I right?

694
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:05,159
When did you say that?

695
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,039
I said it that night,

696
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,920
in my room that night,

697
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,440
didn't I?

698
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,119
In my room,

699
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,320
your room or mine?

700
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,239
Your room.

701
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:31,280
Adjutant Wan has been working hard all the way,

702
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:32,719
please come on,

703
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,519
please ask Jiacheng to congratulate Detective Fang.

704
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:40,199
Successfully completed the mission,

705
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:41,920
successfully contained the epidemic,

706
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:46,760
You are a great hero of the people of Northern Zhou.

707
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,719
It's my duty to protect the peace of Northern Zhou Dynasty.

708
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:52,559
The point is that Shangfeng knows people well

709
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:53,760
and trusts his students,

710
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,480
Hang it up.

711
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:57,199
Being honest and upright,

712
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:59,039
taking the lead Let's not talk about it,

713
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,159
Just say that you never put on airs

714
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,360
when dealing with people,

715
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,960
From the inside out, you have to do everything yourself.

716
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:08,599
Brother Rude,

717
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:10,880
that's what the coach

718
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,239
admires most about you,

719
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,280
You should learn from Detective Fang,

720
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,880
sacrifice yourself for others,

721
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:20,360
I'm not proud of myself for taking credit.

722
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,280
Yes

723
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,880
Brother Rude,

724
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,599
the big things in this city

725
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,840
will depend on you in the future.

726
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,000
Rude,

727
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,920
you can rely on the teacher's orders.

728
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,000
The coach often tells me about the past,

729
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:38,639
when he fought in the Northern Zhou Dynasty and shed blood,

730
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,320
North Zhou City is the source of our army

731
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,239
serving the country faithfully,

732
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:44,400
one may well say

733
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,599
Husband,

734
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,239
The wind was born on the ground,

735
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,760
and it started at the end of Qingping.

736
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,519
Now,

737
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,119
the Wan Army is still here,

738
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,559
But I wonder

739
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,639
if North Zhou City is still the same?
