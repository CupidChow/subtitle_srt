1
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,560
Line up.

2
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,240
Line up for blood tests.

3
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,680
Line up. Line up. Come here.

4
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,360
Line up. Come on!

5
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,879
Why are you here again?

6
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,599
Their master asked me to come.

7
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,960
He has to be examined.

8
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,759
Beat him first.

9
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,599
Got it

10
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,639
Next.

11
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,919
I just saw

12
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,000
a lot of people out there have urticaria.

13
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,680
Your immunity is low.

14
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,159
Didn't you get infected when you came here?

15
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,840
You can't even protect yourself.

16
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,719
It's really kind of a doctor.

17
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,199
I'm fine.

18
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,800
I'm drinking the herbal medicine from our Cordyceps Hall.

19
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,360
Don't worry,

20
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,000
even if you're under the control of the embassy district,

21
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,759
But first of all, I'm a doctor.

22
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,479
Pneumonic plague is fierce,

23
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,680
But getting infected is also a matter of probability.

24
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,439
We'll disinfect it in real time.

25
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,879
I won't let innocent people get involved.

26
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:23,599
All right.

27
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,360
Feel free to call me if you need anything.

28
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,400
Okay,

29
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,479
Come on, slap me.

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Who's going to slap me?

31
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,240
Your Ladyship,

32
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,879
Pan Jun is at Beizhou Hospital near the mansion,

33
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,800
When I followed him,

34
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,479
I saw him save the health clerk who fainted.

35
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,960
Why did he go to the hospital?

36
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,280
Recently,

37
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,800
there have been pneumonic plague patients in many places in the city,

38
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,039
Detective Fang has been arresting people all over the streets,

39
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,439
making the city full of wind and rain.

40
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,919
Pan Jun stood up for the patients in the civilian area.

41
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,199
As a result,

42
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,400
he was sent directly to the quarantine zone.

43
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,120
Your Ladyship,

44
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,759
where are you going?

45
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,639
I'm not sure yet.

46
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,240
Is Pan Jun a descendant of the Floral Department?

47
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,319
If he's really a Zerg,

48
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,600
I can't let him

49
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,399
die so easily.

50
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,720
Let's go to Beizhou Hospital,

51
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,560
and we'll just rush forward like this?

52
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,319
You're right.

53
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,759
Say hello in the name of Yaxin.

54
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,160
Just say

55
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,759
Mr. and Mrs. Matsui are concerned about this.

56
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,040
Got it.

57
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,079
AsiaInfo Pharmaceuticals

58
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,959
has the top pharmaceutical technology in the world,

59
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,959
If you have any requests,

60
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:03,720
feel free to ask.

61
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,120
We will definitely support you.

62
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,519
Thank you so much.

63
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,240
Thank you for Yaxin's support to Beizhou Hospital,

64
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,120
you can go back to your work now.

65
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,560
Okay, bye.

66
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,120
It seems that the pneumonic plague is really strong.

67
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,839
Even Dr. Pan can't do anything about it.

68
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,879
I'm locked up here, right?

69
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,519
What can I do if I'm so capable?

70
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,000
Why are you here?

71
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:47,839
Is it strange?

72
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,240
Yaxin Pharmaceutical has a lot of cooperation

73
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,560
with Beizhou Hospital.

74
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,279
Can you take me out?

75
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,439
Why do you want to

76
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,680
sneak away?

77
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,759
I'm going to save lives.

78
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,959
I was dragged here by these people,

79
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,199
why did they have to draw blood for me?

80
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,319
You didn't give me the result after smoking for so long.

81
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,279
What's the difference between this and imprisonment?

82
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,439
Let me tell you,

83
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,279
Beizhou Hospital,

84
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,879
Now it's under the control of

85
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,920
Fang Rude and the others in the embassy district.

86
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,800
These people don't care if the poor are alive or dead.

87
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:34,800
First,

88
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,160
decentralize medical resources,

89
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,800
Two,

90
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,560
It'll increase their chances of infection.

91
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,759
Anyway, I can't wait here anymore.

92
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,240
We must find a way out.

93
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,279
I have to prepare more anti-epidemic drugs.

94
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,079
And come up with a treatment plan.

95
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,759
I'm here to draw blood.

96
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:52,639
If you don't smoke,

97
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,639
are you making a fuss?

98
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,319
That day, we helped our little brother into the room.

99
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,600
I didn't do anything.

100
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,079
How could he get sick?

101
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,000
That's right.

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,360
Pneumonic plague can be spread by fleas and mice,

103
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,439
You two have to take a blood test before you leave.

104
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,560
It's getting colder every day in Northern Zhou.

105
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,079
Where are you going to find fleas?

106
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,879
If you say so,

107
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,959
the whole North Zhou City will be sealed.

108
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,199
It's not impossible to ask us to stay here

109
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,480
if the situation is serious.

110
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,399
Make up for our lost time,

111
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,079
drive us away and we won't leave.

112
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,360
Am I right?

113
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,759
You smoke first.

114
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,879
I won't smoke.

115
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,279
Both of you,

116
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,160
everyone in the quarantine area must draw blood.

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,079
You two must cooperate.

118
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,240
Chunlan,

119
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,279
Chunlan,

120
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,160
Help! Help!

121
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,079
Help!

122
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
Someone fainted.

123
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,600
Help!

124
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,639
Help!

125
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,240
Help!

126
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,279
Help!

127
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Do you want to run away or not?

128
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,079
Over there,

129
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,800
do you think I don't exist?

130
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,600
Is this the toilet?

131
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,120
You can come and go whenever you want.

132
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,920
He works for Yaxin.

133
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,639
I'm taking him away now.

134
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,439
No way.

135
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
Do you need me to call Fang Rude?

136
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,879
Let's go.

137
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,680
Thank you.

138
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,120
As easy as lifting a hand.

139
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,480
I hope Dr. Pan

140
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,399
can find a cure soon.

141
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,360
Goodbye.

142
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,519
Back then, Old Master said,

143
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,279
this land is too shady,

144
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,080
If you don't plant medicine,

145
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,799
it won't be enough.

146
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,120
Be careful not to fall.

147
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,600
Be careful.

148
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,360
What the hell is this?

149
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,360
Slow down.

150
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,399
I thought it was a treasure.

151
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,840
It's a treasure.

152
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Warlords from all over the world,

153
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,320
maps,

154
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,799
Young master,

155
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
the flag of the Wanchao Sect,

156
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,080
Who is Wanchao Sect?

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,639
After the fall of the Qing court,

158
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,960
warlords from all over the world took over the mountain as kings,

159
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,480
Is it insane

160
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,559
to have a team exterminate humanity?

161
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,559
It's the Wan Army.

162
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,919
Who is George Yang Gao Huaiyuan?

163
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:35,120
Pan Pan Pan Pan Uncle Pan Look.

164
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,639
According to the description in the book,

165
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,799
it seems to be similar to my symptoms.

166
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,159
Someone really poisoned me.

167
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,879
He's also a colleague.

168
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,080
I know the cure.

169
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,679
Your nose is crooked and your eyes are slanting. Don't prick it blindly.

170
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,080
Your hands are shaking. You'll prick it later.

171
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,879
Can it be worse?

172
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,279
I mean, it can't be worse.

173
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,960
Can you stop being sarcastic here?

174
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,759
Go and prepare some medicines for me.

175
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,720
I'll exorcise evil spirits and poison later.

176
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,559
Mrs. Matsui, you're here.

177
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Is Dr. Pan here?

178
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,480
I'll call him,

179
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,679
Less.

180
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,480
Are your eyes healed?

181
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,159
With the medical skills of our Pan family,

182
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,440
the medicine can cure the disease.

183
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,159
It's just a small trick.

184
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,799
No problem.

185
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,480
You finally recovered.

186
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,399
What's wrong?

187
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,320
Mrs. Matsui,

188
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,039
what can I do for you?

189
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,399
I'm here to discuss cooperation with you.

190
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,200
Uncle Pan,

191
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,320
the medicine in the backyard,

192
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,679
Help me fry it.

193
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,320
Okay,

194
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,679
I'm sure nothing good will happen.

195
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,919
Mrs. Matsui,

196
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,159
why do you want to cooperate with

197
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,399
my tiny Cordyceps Hall?

198
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,960
From now on,

199
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,360
I want to invest in your Cordyceps Hall.

200
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,679
To invest in you,

201
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,639
you mean,

202
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,799
Your large company, Yaxin Pharmaceutical,

203
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,480
wants to invest in my small Cordyceps Hall,

204
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,279
Yes,

205
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,200
I'm very interested in your Cordyceps Hall.

206
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,879
In this way,

207
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,919
it is also convenient for the study of pneumonic plague.

208
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,679
What did I say about Cordyceps Hall?

209
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:07,000
It must be one of the best in North Zhou.

210
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,039
Just talking about the flowers, fish and insects in the backyard,

211
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,240
it's all hard work.

212
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,720
I'll give you twice the price.

213
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,039
I won't interfere in anything you do.

214
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,120
Divide it into half and half.

215
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,200
How about 46?

216
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,320
I'm six and you're four.

217
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,600
Deal.

218
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,200
No.

219
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,320
Well,

220
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:41,120
What do you think of Sanqi?

221
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,080
It's too late,

222
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,440
Mr. Pan.

223
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:50,440
What did you say?

224
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,080
Nothing.

225
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:54,840
Happy cooperation.

226
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:13,919
I didn't expect you

227
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,320
to have a different world in your family.

228
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,960
There are more places out there.

229
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,600
This is what I mean.

230
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:38,279
This side belongs to water flowers,

231
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,440
and this side belongs to soil flowers,

232
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,200
This is poisonous weed,

233
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,519
copper coin grass and rosemary,

234
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,879
No matter what kind of flower it is,

235
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,440
it can be fed in my Cordyceps Hall.

236
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,360
Don't move.

237
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:19,879
What are you doing?

238
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,000
This butterfly is poisonous,

239
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,120
so is such a beautiful butterfly.

240
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,120
Beautiful women are dangerous.

241
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,919
These butterflies are called ghost beauties,

242
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:29,960
they are hermaphroditic,

243
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,600
The left side is female and the right side is male,

244
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,080
also known as Yin-Yang Butterfly.

245
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,840
This butterfly is quite toxic.

246
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,080
You can't touch it at will.

247
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,080
This is one of the reasons why I'm not open to the public.

248
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,200
Your Ladyship, are you okay?

249
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,039
Mrs. Matsui.

250
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,399
Mrs. Matsui.

251
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,720
You,

252
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:17,879
Your lips,

253
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:20,879
I know.

254
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:22,600
It's okay.

255
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,200
It's less toxic,

256
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,679
And I threw up.

257
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:27,399
So the swelling will go down soon.

258
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:28,960
But if you didn't

259
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,000
suck it out in time,

260
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,000
It's very likely that you'll pass out soon.

261
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,840
Look,

262
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,480
we've become partners.

263
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,759
But I don't know your name yet.

264
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,559
Just call me Mrs. Matsui.

265
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:57,919
I know.

266
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,799
You take your husband's surname in Japan,

267
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:03,960
but what do you say?

268
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,160
You should have your own name.

269
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,480
Me,

270
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,920
I only know my name is Miaomiao,

271
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,279
but I don't know my real name.

272
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm an orphan.

273
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,119
I'm lucky that Yaxin is so important,

274
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:23,039
so it doesn't matter

275
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,359
what her last name is.

276
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,200
I'm sorry, Miaomiao.

277
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,000
It's better to call me Mrs. Matsui.

278
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,960
Actually, I want to tell you.

279
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,599
Why did you come out?

280
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,119
Excuse me,

281
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,000
where is this place?

282
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,720
Who are

283
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,200
you?

284
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,319
He's your patient.

285
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,000
Yes,

286
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:08,359
I found him at the back door of Cordyceps Hall.

287
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,720
At first,

288
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,079
his whole body,

289
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,680
These were just skin injuries,

290
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,720
but later he found symptoms

291
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:17,759
of late stage pneumonic plague on his body.

292
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,200
I was going to give up

293
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,000
because he had hardened all over his body,

294
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,880
But

295
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,920
He ran out on his own just now.

296
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,880
You're weird, too.

297
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,920
You carry acupuncture equipment with you,

298
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,039
making it look like a treasure.

299
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,319
This is a family heirloom of Pan family.

300
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,279
It's my third hand.

301
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,920
It's great that you're finally awake.

302
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,880
The doctor said,

303
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,240
your latest test results show that you're fine.

304
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,279
That's why I came in.

305
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,119
What's this? It's so bitter.

306
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,640
The one who saved you yesterday.

307
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,839
Dr. Pan asked me to cook it,

308
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,079
and he said you'll be fine after you finish it.

309
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,039
-It's Doctor

310
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,599
Pan. -Yes,

311
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,640
It was Dr. Smith who insisted on

312
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,319
using Dr. Pan's method.

313
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,960
Dr. Pan put a needle on you yesterday,

314
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,960
and what prescription did you prescribe for me?

315
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,599
The prescription is terrible.

316
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
There are bugs inside?

317
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:42,799
Worms.

318
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:52,079
Open the bag.

319
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,480
Why are you going to the embassy district?

320
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,640
Let's go to Director Wang's house.

321
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,039
Stop the car.

322
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,240
Your ID.

323
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,400
You must be Director Matsui and Madam

324
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,039
of AsiaInfo Pharmaceuticals.

325
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,039
Let him go.

326
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,519
Hurry up and let him go.

327
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,640
Excuse me.

328
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:21,480
Take care.

329
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,920
Are you sure

330
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,880
Pan Jun is a descendant of the Floragrims.

331
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,000
Of course,

332
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,440
his silver needle made me sure of that again.

333
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,200
Silver needle,

334
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
Silver needle

335
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,039
Her real name is Qingsi?

336
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,519
It's their unique hidden weapon.

337
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:46,559
Green silk has two uses,

338
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,480
You can usually save people with acupuncture,

339
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,039
and if necessary,

340
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:52,039
It's also a murder weapon.

341
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,640
Needles can be quenched

342
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,359
and kill invisibly.

343
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,240
Our men tested him over and over again

344
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,480
to look like a charlatan,

345
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,720
Is it possible that the silver needle

346
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,200
is also like the emblem of the river family,

347
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,599
He faked it.

348
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,519
I won't admit my mistake even if I die.

349
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,440
The poison of wood-based green silk originated from Ghost Beauty.

350
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,680
It's a rare butterfly.

351
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,960
As long as the dose is enough,

352
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:20,200
it will be an incurable poison.

353
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:22,039
And this Ghost Beauty

354
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,039
is the symbol of the wood system.

355
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,039
Shangfeng is looking for a treasure,

356
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,279
a secret treasure of the wood department,

357
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,119
It must be in Pan Jun's hands.

358
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:32,559
Let's

359
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,240
start with him first.

360
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,559
What's going on now?

361
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,319
The patient's condition is basically stable.

362
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:54,480
Besides,

363
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,599
the lab's test report has come out.

364
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,759
Identify the pathogen.

365
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:59,839
Similar to the pneumonic plague 15 years ago,

366
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,359
both of them are extremely strong Yersinia pestis,

367
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,599
And the germs this time

368
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:04,319
are more deadly than those 15 years ago.

369
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:10,640
In addition,

370
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,440
among the 37 patients

371
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,400
diagnosed in North Zhou City this time,

372
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,240
Except for Mr. Zhang from the Department of Health,

373
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,680
the germs in his body have disappeared.

374
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,799
The germs in Ouyang Yanying's body have also disappeared.

375
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:19,839
So,

376
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,039
in order to prevent cross-infection,

377
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,680
He can be sent out of quarantine now.

378
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,880
Ouyang,

379
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,960
the one from Ba Song,

380
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,440
Yes.

381
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,279
Let him go.

382
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,960
There are too many people and I can't take it anymore.

383
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,400
Got it.

384
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:36,400
What bad luck!

385
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:39,160
Let us out!

386
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,799
Go, go, go, go, go!

387
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,640
Xiaojiu,

388
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,759
Xiaojiu

389
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:44,640
Young master, take me away. Young master,

390
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,480
save him.

391
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,680
Please let him out.

392
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:47,319
Xiaojiu,

393
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,960
save my young master.

394
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,759
Xiaojiu

395
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,200
Young master! Young master,

396
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,799
take me away! Young master,

397
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:53,960
Young master.

398
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,599
Once the disease is out of control,

399
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,920
get rid of all the patients immediately.

400
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,039
You can't keep any of them.

401
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:20,880
Many people have died in Beizhou Hospital,

402
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,279
but fortunately, I met Doctor Pan,

403
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:23,519
That's why he cured me.

404
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,599
I'm glad you're fine.

405
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,440
just

406
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,000
Poor Xiaojiu.

407
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,880
I'm worried about him, too.

408
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:33,920
By the way,

409
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,720
where were those three people you followed that day?

410
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,960
Xiaojiu and I followed them all the way that day,

411
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,400
and then we were eager to save them,

412
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:43,279
So I fought with them.

413
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,680
Let him go. Don't make me do it.

414
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,960
After a fight,

415
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,720
Xiaojiu and I were both seriously injured.

416
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:36,240
When I woke up, I was already in Chunxiang Restaurant.

417
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,960
I suspect that those two are from the Yin and Yang side.

418
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,400
Dong Yang's Yin-Yang Road,

419
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,759
are you sure

420
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,839
it's close to each other.

421
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,200
When I was in Ba Song,

422
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,359
I fought with them.

423
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,880
So I still remember some.

424
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,680
Last time, they wanted to take away the Fire Department's secret treasure,

425
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,599
but this time they showed up in the Northern Zhou Dynasty.

426
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,400
Then this time,

427
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,039
they must be here for the Zerg treasure.

428
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:13,599
Master,

429
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,279
Master,

430
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,759
Young master is awake.

431
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:19,440
Come and take a look at Young Master,

432
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,720
Master,

433
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,039
Come on,

434
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,759
Stick out your tongue.

435
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:26,720
I'm a doctor.

436
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,119
Don't be afraid.

437
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,440
Stick out your tongue.

438
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,400
Be good,

439
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,119
Not bad.

440
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,079
My life is saved.

441
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:36,880
Sure,

442
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,240
Come on.

443
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,599
Thank you

444
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,359
for saving my life.

445
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,799
Ziwu has no teeth to forget.

446
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:53,039
It doesn't matter if you don't have teeth.

447
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,440
It's okay if you forget it.

448
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,319
I just need to pay for my accommodation

449
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,400
and medical expenses.

450
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,079
Three, seven, two, three, seven, two, three, seven, two, three, seven.

451
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:02,240
One, six, six, two, six, one.

452
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,519
Well,

453
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:04,440
how about

454
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,000
I give you 50 oceans?

455
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,920
Young master, stop being obsessed with money.

456
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,319
But,

457
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,480
I don't have money.

458
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,559
I don't have money.

459
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,599
What are you doing with me if you don't have money?

460
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,240
You're so funny.

461
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:24,240
Why are you lying at the door with me if you don't have money?

462
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,519
Why don't you lie in front of Chunxiang Restaurant?

463
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,839
Maybe I can still be happy.

464
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:27,559
childe

465
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,720
It's inappropriate to say that.

466
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,279
You're everywhere, aren't you?

467
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,920
Well,

468
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,960
I happen to need a long-term job outside.

469
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,960
Just stay here and work hard for me.

470
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,720
When are you going to pay it back and leave?

471
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,319
No problem.

472
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,640
I have plenty of strength.

473
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:50,960
But … But I have to go first.

474
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,359
Young master, it's a girl again. I'm telling you,

475
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,440
there's no but.

476
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,039
Don't leave

477
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,480
until you're done. Feed the medicine.

478
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,160
Lie down.

479
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,319
Let's go.

480
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,119
What are you doing?

481
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,680
Come with me.

482
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,880
Where are you going?

483
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:14,680
What is it?

484
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,519
Dr. Pan, please save the patient.

485
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,680
Why are you here?

486
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:18,799
In the whole North Zhou City,

487
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,440
you're the only one who cured Yan Ying and Mr. Zhang,

488
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,480
The rest of the patients are waiting for you to save them.

489
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,279
These days,

490
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,559
patients are having trouble breathing,

491
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,759
He coughed up a lot of blood,

492
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,720
and died every day for several days.

493
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,599
People die every day.

494
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,160
If it's true as you said,

495
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,319
they've already coughed up blood.

496
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,880
Then they are suffering from septicemia.

497
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,480
There may only be three days left.

498
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,200
So the next infection

499
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,000
must be old people and children,

500
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,200
Women, pregnant women,

501
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,240
and then the plague

502
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,799
will spread faster and faster,

503
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,480
North Zhou City will soon become a dead city.

504
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,039
So I hope you

505
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,920
can leave. Hurry up.

506
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,400
Go as far away as possible.

507
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,680
If you want to leave these patients behind,

508
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,240
the superior is afraid that the epidemic will spread to the embassy district,

509
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:26,839
If you don't save the patients,

510
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,319
they'll all be killed by the police.

511
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,319
What did you say?

512
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,119
No, but

513
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,359
even if I go, I'll,

514
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:37,519
They can only live.

515
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,480
I'm afraid I'm not good at medicine.

516
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,440
You have excellent medical skills but no medical ethics.

517
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,240
If these patients die,

518
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,119
what's the difference between killing them with your own hands?

519
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,039
After a famous doctor,

520
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,160
even if his medical skills are not good,

521
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,119
I won't run away,

522
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,119
but I'll just

523
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,279
go with you.

524
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,960
What a man. He's a man of his word.

525
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:07,559
Hua Hua,

526
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:08,720
hurry up.

527
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,079
Hurry up.

528
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:11,759
Young master,

529
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,200
you're so busy.

530
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,400
Are you going out for a long trip?

531
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,359
Hurry up and pack up.

532
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,640
You can take the valuable things away.

533
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,720
Hide it if you can't take it away.

534
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,480
We have to get out of North Zhou City.

535
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,440
Why? There's going to be a war.

536
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,839
The plague broke out in North Zhou City,

537
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,039
and it's about to be out of control.

538
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,079
We have to get out of here.

539
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:27,920
Didn't you cure those two people?

540
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,880
Who knows if it's a blind cat touching a dead mouse?

541
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:30,720
In Beizhou Hospital,

542
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,400
such sophisticated instruments can't cure it.

543
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:33,759
What can I do?

544
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,640
Hurry up

545
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:38,640
and pack up. Where's Ziwu?

546
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,880
Pack your things. Pack them up.

547
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,960
It's okay. You don't have to get up.

548
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,240
I'm here to see your wound.

549
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:53,839
Let me see.

550
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,279
Not bad.

551
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,599
The trauma is almost healed.

552
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:05,440
His condition is the same

553
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,319
as those in the hospital.

554
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,920
But how can you be fine by yourself?

555
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,240
Who on earth are you?

556
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,480
And what happened to those pinholes?

557
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,359
All I remember is that after I woke up,

558
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:05,119
I was in the graveyard.

559
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,559
Then I ran into some wolves

560
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,359
in the wasteland,

561
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,839
You're dishonest.

562
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,680
No matter what,

563
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,640
the plague is breaking out in North Zhou City,

564
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,720
Go back to where you came from.

565
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:22,680
Young master,

566
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,720
plague.

567
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,359
Slow down, young master.

568
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:31,079
Slow down, young master.

569
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:32,799
Slow down.

570
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,079
Young master,

571
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:37,039
you should save him now.

572
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:42,119
I can't stay in the city. I'm going out of the city

573
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:46,599
to talk to you. Get out.

574
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:49,160
Let's go.

575
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:50,680
Let's go!

576
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,799
-What are you doing? -What are you doing,

577
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,359
kid.

578
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,519
Why are you dying?

579
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,519
How about

580
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,960
taking two people for you?

581
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,359
Okay, let's go.

582
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,480
What are you doing?

583
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:12,839
Get in the car.

584
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm not leaving. I'm not

585
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,759
getting in the car.

586
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
I'm not leaving.

587
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:17,720
Let go of me!

588
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,480
In order to find my father,

589
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,200
all the money I saved is in the box.

590
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,799
The title deed and house deed of Cordyceps Hall are also in there.

591
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,240
If.

592
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,920
If I really don't hear from you,

593
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,440
you two remember to sell the house

594
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:40,119
to my partner,

595
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:41,599
Share some money.

596
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,200
Remember to leave some pension money,

597
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,279
Young Master. Young Master, you can't do this.

598
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:47,240
Young master, I'm not leaving.

599
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,519
Sit down and listen to me.

600
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,119
Thank you.

601
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,559
You've worked hard for Cordyceps Hall

602
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:06,759
all your life.

603
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,440
Take care.

604
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,719
Young master,

605
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:20,639
the master is gone.

606
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,440
Young master.

607
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,320
Young master.

608
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,440
You care about the world, don't you?

609
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:55,239
Please save us.

610
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:05,760
Doctor,

611
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,480
someone vomited blood. Doctor, save her.

612
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
Something must have happened.

613
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,639
I'll go take a look first.

614
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,719
Let's go.

615
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,519
Doctor,

616
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,400
save her!

617
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,480
Help us!

618
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,400
Doctor,

619
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:22,679
please save me.

620
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:24,679
Don't worry, everyone.

621
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,559
Don't worry. I'll do it one

622
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,079
by one, okay?

623
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:31,920
Excuse me.

624
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:33,480
Excuse me.

625
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,280
Save him.

626
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:41,880
Doctor,

627
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,239
tell us the truth.

628
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,320
Will we never get out of here?

629
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:45,880
Yeah,

630
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,639
it's not like that,

631
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,960
It's all a lie.

632
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,760
Dr. Smith didn't give up on everyone,

633
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,880
Dr. Pan risked his life to find the source of the infection next door,

634
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,519
I'm sure Dr. Pan will find it.

635
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,880
Everyone, be patient.

636
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:57,920
He has vomited blood.

637
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,719
How can you guarantee that?

638
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:01,800
But I've been trying my best to save everyone.

639
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,599
Please give us more time.

640
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,079
Who gave us time?

641
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,880
Who gave us time?

642
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,679
You've been lying to us, haven't you?

643
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,599
No, I didn't.

644
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,679
I … I didn't lie to you.

645
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,320
He's already dead and you said you didn't lie to us.

646
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,079
That's right.

647
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,119
Take me out.

648
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:20,199
We're going out.

649
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,280
We're going out.

650
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,239
Take me out.

651
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:27,119
Take us out.

652
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:29,760
Let us out.

653
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:36,880
Don't come near me! Get out of here!

654
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:38,880
Get lost!

655
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:40,400
Get lost!

656
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,239
Wait a minute.

657
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,400
I will definitely come back.

658
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,760
Please wait for me.

659
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:52,360
Wait for me.

660
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,679
I'll come back to save you.

661
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,000
Don't come near me!

662
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,800
Stop!

663
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:02,440
Detective Fang?

664
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:05,840
Detective Fang?

665
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,079
Behave yourself.

666
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:07,960
Help me!

667
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,519
Put the guns down!

668
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,559
Don't always carry the gun,

669
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:16,599
I advise you,

670
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,199
Let Dr. Lin go.

671
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,199
She's an epidemic prevention expert.

672
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:21,840
If you kill her,

673
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,679
everyone will die.

674
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,559
I finally get it.

675
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,760
You wanted to kill us early in the morning?

676
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:30,880
Don't think we'll continue to die.

677
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,320
Let us out! Let us out!

678
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,800
Everybody be quiet.

679
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,159
If the plague is not removed,

680
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:37,719
none of you can get out.

681
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:40,639
Let us out! Let us out!

682
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,960
Let us out!

683
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,079
Calm down, everyone.

684
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:45,239
We're trying our best to find a cure.

685
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:46,599
You have to be confident.

686
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:47,480
Rescue him.

687
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,280
Have you cured anyone?

688
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,599
What did you do?

689
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,719
Then who?

690
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,039
Get everyone here

691
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:54,840
after they are cured.

692
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,639
Xiaojiu,

693
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,760
don't come over.

694
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,280
Xiaojiu, don't mess around.

695
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,679
You have to trust Dr. Pan,

696
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:05,719
and you have to trust us.

697
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,800
Xiaojiu, calm down.

698
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,840
Our family won't give up on you.

699
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,119
Xiaojiu,

700
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,559
put the knife down!

701
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,679
Xiaojiu,

702
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:16,039
put the knife down!

703
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,800
Xiaojiu, I … Pan Jun, put the knife down.

704
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,199
I risked my life to come to the quarantine zone.

705
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,119
I have a good chance of

706
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,400
catching the same kind of pneumonic plague as you,

707
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,719
Why did I do that?

708
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:39,039
Because I'm confident that I can cure you.

709
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,599
Xiaojiu,

710
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,480
Mr. Zhang,

711
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,360
I cured Ouyang Yanying,

712
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,079
and I'm confident that I can cure you.

713
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,400
So put the knife down.

714
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:49,360
Xiaojiu,

715
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,400
trust Dr. Pan,

716
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,239
He will find a way to save you.

717
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,679
they

718
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,679
And I will never hurt you.

719
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:01,239
Xiaojiu,

720
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,280
trust us,

721
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:05,039
Put the knife down!

722
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,280
Put it down!

723
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,840
It's going to be okay.

724
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:24,800
Xiaojiu,

725
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,760
Xiaojiu,

726
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,880
Fang Rude,

727
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,760
lock them all up.

728
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,559
Let go of me!

729
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:33,679
Fang Rude.

730
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,239
Doctor Pan,

731
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,599
Doctor Pan,

732
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,880
How are you?

733
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,360
What do you want to say?

734
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,679
Do you not believe that I can kill you?

735
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:01,280
What are you talking about?

736
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:02,840
Who wouldn't dare to kill you?

737
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,079
Aren't you going to kill everyone here?

738
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:06,920
Who am I, Pan Jun?

739
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,280
If you're tough enough,

740
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:11,079
I'll burn this hospital to ashes tonight.

741
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:12,199
No tiles left.

742
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,400
I don't believe it. It's like this.

743
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,960
The plague can also kill people.

744
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,360
Do you know how the plague broke out

745
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,119
15 years ago?

746
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:21,199
There were nine Chinese loggers

747
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:22,440
working in the Urals at the time,

748
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,039
After seven people died of the plague,

749
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,239
two of them were sent back to China.

750
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,840
At that time, the Russians burned the shed and luggage,

751
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,280
but they still coughed and vomited blood.

752
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:34,960
Later,

753
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,800
nearly 60 thousand people

754
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:38,800
died in three northeastern provinces of China.

755
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,199
Because of those two Chinese workers

756
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:41,960
who were sent back,

757
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:45,280
As long as the source of the plague is not found,

758
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,519
even if you wipe out the entire Northern Zhou City,

759
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,559
We all die the same way,

760
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:53,159
regardless of officials, nobles and civilians.

761
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,440
So,

762
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,440
I didn't fight with you there before,

763
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:05,159
Plague kills people,

764
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,440
regardless of rank or rank.

765
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:12,840
Okay,

766
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,559
I'll wait until tomorrow at this moment,

767
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,480
to find out the source of the plague.

768
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,119
Otherwise, if Shangfeng blames you,

769
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:23,239
you'll be the first one to be shot.

770
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,320
Okay.

771
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,480
Then promise me,

772
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,880
as long as I find out the source,

773
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,280
Don't touch those people again.

774
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,559
He's a man.
