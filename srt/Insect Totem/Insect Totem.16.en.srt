1
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,560
If you don't have the Five Series Secret Treasure,

2
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,710
you won't be able to open the Zerg Treasure anymore.

3
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,920
Could it be that

4
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,280
you're willing to do it.

5
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,630
You don't need to talk nonsense.

6
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,470
As long as you let him go,

7
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,870
all these things will be yours.

8
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,000
I've heard of Pan Jun's great name

9
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,190
and a great doctor sincerely invites him,

10
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,360
If you want to trade with me with the Five Series Secret Treasure,

11
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,430
I feel honored.

12
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,520
I've always been very curious about wood medicine,

13
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,470
and I hope to have a chance,

14
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,360
I can have a good fight with you.

15
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,120
I also invited Miss Shi to accompany me,

16
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,870
and I prepared high-end coffee,

17
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,400
But you treat me

18
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,840
like an idiot, don't you?

19
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,280
I'm the one who has the secret treasure of water system, Black Ice Ancient Iron.

20
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,030
The secret key of destiny you gave me.

21
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,120
I didn't respond to it at all.

22
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,240
Is this what you call a deal?

23
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,360
This is the sincerity of the Zerg, isn't it?

24
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,400
Guards,

25
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,360
Somebody!

26
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,870
Guards.

27
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,560
Yan Ying.

28
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,870
Yan Ying,

29
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,830
what's wrong?

30
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,310
You're not feeling well. Let's go back.

31
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,390
No, I'm fine.

32
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,120
Let's go to the business in Lingcheng.

33
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,430
Let's go and relax.

34
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,360
We can eat something by the way.

35
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,310
Okay.

36
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,190
-Call your sister and Xiao'e. -No

37
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,160
need.

38
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,070
They have other things to do today.

39
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,830
Let me go with you.

40
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,360
You really

41
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,000
look like your father.

42
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,040
You tell the truth as soon as you lie.

43
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,720
I know it very well.

44
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,600
You hate me.

45
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,600
If there's nothing else,

46
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,720
He would never come to me.

47
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,720
No, it's not like that.

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,240
It's not what you think.

49
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,480
Yan Ying,

50
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,480
I don't care why

51
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,120
you're hiding it from me?

52
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,310
But I have to remind you,

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,120
in Lingcheng now,

54
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,070
It's really dangerous.

55
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,270
If you're not careful, you'll get yourself killed.

56
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,040
Before you make a decision,

57
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,680
you'd better think twice.

58
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,800
also

59
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm the only one

60
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,270
who can protect you and your sister,

61
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,390
The only person you can trust,

62
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,480
is me.

63
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
-I'm sorry. -I'm

64
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,720
sorry.

65
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,190
Actually, I came to see you today,

66
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,270
to buy time for my sister

67
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,870
to steal the river stone.

68
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,240
Pan Jun and Fengchen Jun have a deal today,

69
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,680
I'm afraid you'll come back to Yaxin,

70
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,270
Everything will change.

71
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,270
Yaxin,

72
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,160
I know everything about you Zerg like the back of my hand,

73
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,070
I've been to Mount Ba Men a few times,

74
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,920
and I've taken all those creatures here

75
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,480
to study them carefully.

76
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,830
Could it be that

77
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,430
I can't tell

78
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,160
if the secret treasure is true or not?

79
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,070
You're insulting me.

80
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,680
Are you questioning me?

81
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,360
Are you doubting my ability?

82
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,560
Why hasn't he been out for so long?

83
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,430
Ziwu,

84
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,510
Meridian

85
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
Wake up Ziwu,

86
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,070
Ziwu,

87
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:57,950
Ziwu,

88
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,070
Ziwu,

89
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,360
Meridian

90
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,070
Wake up. What's Ziwu

91
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,870
doing?

92
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,190
Stop!

93
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,360
Stop!

94
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,680
It's Brother Jin Shun!

95
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,390
Stop!

96
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,480
What are you staring at? Run.

97
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,320
Come on. This way. This way.

98
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,670
Run. This way.

99
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,320
Senior brother,

100
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,200
what's wrong with you?

101
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,870
Miaomiao's poison,

102
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,080
even if you give it to me now,

103
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,600
I'm afraid it's too late.

104
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,270
I won't.

105
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,000
Master used to say that you are gifted,

106
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,270
and you know the essentials of all the mechanisms of our Gold Department.

107
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,670
I'm sure he'll be fine.

108
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,870
What did you say?

109
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,390
Master,

110
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,440
you mean Master,

111
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,720
I'm leaving.

112
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,910
It's the Yin-Yang way.

113
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,390
Time is too fast.

114
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,910
This life is too fast.

115
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,960
Senior Brother.

116
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,720
Brother Jin Shun.

117
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,030
Senior Brother.

118
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,030
Senior Brother,

119
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,960
Senior Brother, you will be fine.

120
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,960
Senior Brother.

121
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,030
Senior Brother,

122
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,720
Jin Shun

123
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,510
What about Yan Yun?

124
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,960
Xiao'e,

125
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,960
Senior Brother,

126
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,360
If possible,

127
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,550
I'll go back

128
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,440
to the family tree of the Kim family,

129
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,910
Okay.

130
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,030
Senior brother, it's all right.

131
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,720
I'm sure he'll be fine.

132
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
I promised Feng'er

133
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,360
to redeem her body,

134
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,720
I promised Fusheng,

135
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,790
to let him grow up well.

136
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,750
Senior Brother.

137
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,480
Young Master, where are you going?

138
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,750
Chief Priest,

139
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,960
there can be no more casualties among our brothers.

140
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,790
Pan Jun and the others are in danger now.

141
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,120
We can't let them fall into Fengchen Jun's hands.

142
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,910
Young Master, you can't go.

143
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,630
The stone is dead and the person is alive,

144
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,030
I'll use the river stone to save Pan Jun's life.

145
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,270
Even Fengchen Jun wouldn't dare to hurt me rashly

146
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,960
and become an enemy of the whole Xue family,

147
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,550
If Zimo is alive in heaven,

148
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,670
he will follow the same path as me.

149
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,390
I stopped you three years ago,

150
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,120
and this time,

151
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,200
I respect your choice.

152
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,670
Thank you, Chief Priest.

153
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,120
Be careful.

154
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,480
I'll cover you.

155
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,390
Sister … Xiao'e, Yan

156
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,440
Ying.

157
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,030
Stop!

158
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,600
Yan Ying, stay away.

159
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,630
Yan Ying, stay away.

160
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,750
Yan Ying,

161
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,030
Yan Ying,

162
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,030
Yan Ying,

163
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,600
Yan Ying,

164
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,910
Yan Ying,

165
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,670
son.

166
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,080
No one is allowed to shoot.

167
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,240
Yan Ying, Yan Ying,

168
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,390
Yan Ying,

169
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,000
Son,

170
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,030
Yan Ying,

171
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,440
Yan Ying.

172
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,910
It seems that

173
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,750
there is no banquet that never ends in the world.

174
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,840
Fengchen Jun.

175
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,440
How are you?

176
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,790
Here comes another fearless

177
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,960
Jin Shun The river stone stolen from my Xue family

178
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,240
is a fake real

179
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,240
Zerg sacred object,

180
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,000
How could I give it to someone else?

181
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,840
If you say it's fake, then it's fake, right?

182
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,320
So they said these secret treasures were real?

183
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,840
Are they really real?

184
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,120
If you don't believe me,

185
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,790
just go and hurt them.

186
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,670
I'm going to break the river stone.

187
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,840
Let it go with my 30 people.

188
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,080
Then you can fall.

189
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,630
Conditions?

190
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,480
What conditions?

191
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,200
Let them go!

192
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:54,960
Young Master Xue,

193
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,960
you shouldn't get involved in this mess.

194
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,630
Three years ago,

195
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,360
I saw the insidious and vicious ways of Yin and Yang,

196
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,720
I've been worried that your trip will be in danger.

197
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,630
From now on,

198
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,120
the rise and fall of the Zerg will depend on you.

199
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,000
What are you talking about? Let's go.

200
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,510
Let's go!

201
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,550
Get lost!

202
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,480
Yan Ying, hang in there! Yan Ying,

203
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,600
hang in there!

204
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,600
Yan Ying!

205
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,910
Yan Ying! Don't scare me! Yan Ying!

206
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,510
Yan Ying! Say something! Yan Ying!

207
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,600
Yan Ying,

208
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,630
be careful!

209
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,240
Yan Ying,

210
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,440
you'll be fine.

211
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,600
Hurry up, doctor.

212
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:53,960
Everyone,

213
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,030
this is a sterile environment,

214
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,910
Please wait outside.

215
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,200
Yan Ying,

216
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,240
Yan Ying

217
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,960
Wait outside.

218
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,720
Yan Ying.

219
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,640
Boss Jin,

220
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,640
bullets don't grow eyes and neither do you.

221
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,240
I did it for He Luoshi.

222
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,030
Shut up!

223
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:17,960
Mr. Jin,

224
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,110
it doesn't matter if you kill a cat or a dog.

225
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,960
But don't get angry and hurt yourself.

226
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,720
Calm down.

227
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,550
I've called the best doctor

228
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,160
in Ling City for you.

229
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,440
I also ordered Fengchen Jun to personally supervise the operation.

230
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,750
Trust me,

231
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,160
your son will be fine.

232
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,720
Why you again?

233
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,160
Why did you come back after you left?

234
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,110
I will never leave you two again.

235
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,200
Yan Ying and I.

236
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,070
We have no parents since we were little,

237
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,720
I can't lose Yan Ying anymore.

238
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,200
You won't lose Yan Ying.

239
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,720
No one can stop our family from reuniting.

240
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,510
Neither can God.

241
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,400
Old Ancestor,

242
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,960
Young Master has fallen into the hands of Yin-Yang Road.

243
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,790
Where's my Qing'er?

244
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,310
Where's my Qing'er?

245
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,200
Chief Priest Qing'er and Young Master

246
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,110
fought while Yaxin Pharmaceutical

247
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,400
was preparing to meet Pan Jun,

248
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,160
Our casualties are very serious.

249
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,590
Young Master can't bear to see our brothers killed or injured again.

250
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,590
They took the river stone

251
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,070
and exchanged it for Pan Jun and the others.

252
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,000
My Qing'er,

253
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,200
my Qing'er, my Qing'er,

254
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,920
Old Ancestor,

255
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,000
my Qing'er.

256
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,200
Yin and Yang.

257
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,720
Fengchen,

258
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,880
Shangfeng asked me to praise you.

259
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,110
After all, you've contributed a lot.

260
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,000
But your men need to take good care of them.

261
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,680
It's going to be a big deal if you hit him so hard.

262
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,550
Shangfeng values you,

263
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,400
and he values Kim So-mi as well,

264
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,440
Don't forget,

265
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,880
most of Ashin Pharmaceuticals'profits,

266
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,790
Are you still pointing at Kim So-Mei's brain?

267
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,960
Fengchen will keep it in mind,

268
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,480
and thank Shangfeng for his understanding and consideration.

269
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,720
Please pass it on.

270
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,270
Of course,

271
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,240
you operated on her son yourself.

272
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,680
Kim So-mi wouldn't have held on to it.

273
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,640
Shangfeng and I will try our best to persuade you.

274
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,510
When her son recovers,

275
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,240
she will forget about it.

276
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,070
You should behave better in the future.

277
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,240
Just do it on your face.

278
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,440
Don't forget more important things.

279
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,680
Don't worry about that.

280
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,240
The Zerg treasure

281
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,510
must be in Shangfeng's pocket.

282
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,400
Okay,

283
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,030
I'll send more people

284
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,200
to wait for you in Ba Song.

285
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,680
Then wait a moment.

286
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,310
See you in Ba Song.

287
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,110
Mr. Jin,

288
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,590
beginning of spring is coming.

289
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,350
I'd like to invite you

290
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,550
to attend the Thousand Worm Sacrifice hosted by me,

291
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,110
I hope you can do me the honor.

292
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,480
You have Xue Qing, the young master of the Xue family.

293
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,880
The Xue family

294
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,640
has nothing to do with the sacrifice.

295
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,240
I have no enmity with the Xue family,

296
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,920
I'll avenge you if you explore your treasure.

297
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,240
The rest has nothing to do with me.

298
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,270
I'm not going.

299
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,270
According to Dr. Pan's prescription for the old sect master,

300
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,160
these days,

301
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,070
Clan Leader has fewer nightmares.

302
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,440
I'm starting to

303
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,920
recognize people.

304
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,640
However,

305
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,000
he remembered a lot of the past of the Battle of Mount Ba Men,

306
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,590
You always blame yourself.

307
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,750
Then do you still remember

308
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,030
the truth about my mother's death,

309
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,000
Twenty-four years ago,

310
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,720
why on earth?

311
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,830
The Zerg will kill each other?

312
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,590
Eventually, it will lead to a bloody disaster.

313
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,920
It's all He Luoshi's fault. He Luoshi,

314
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,510
your pulse is gloomy

315
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,480
and you lack Qi and blood.

316
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,720
Take it easy.

317
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,000
You need to rest.

318
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,920
A thousand insects devour bones.

319
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,510
It's horrible.

320
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,400
Mr. He's daughter

321
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,480
is innocent.

322
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,640
It's my fault.

323
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:20,750
It's all my fault.

324
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,110
Lord He's daughter,

325
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,030
are you talking about

326
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,440
the mother of Yan Yun and Yan Ying?

327
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,070
We've known each other for a long time.

328
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,400
All the disasters,

329
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:42,920
however, are caused by our Xue family.

330
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
What do you mean?

331
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,880
What do you mean it's all because of your Xue family?

332
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,880
Twenty-four years ago,

333
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,240
in the battle of Mount Ba Men,

334
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,550
You were there, too.

335
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,000
Back then,

336
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,200
Lord He got Luo Shi from the people,

337
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,000
You brought the river stone,

338
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,000
so it's reasonable that there shouldn't be any problem.

339
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,480
But the tragedy still happened.

340
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,350
When the Zerg were united,

341
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,920
no one would doubt it.

342
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,350
As the Chief Priest, you,

343
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,920
therefore,

344
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,350
Everyone insisted that Luo Shi was a fake,

345
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,070
but Lord He is dead?

346
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,160
As her own daughter, Jin Sumei

347
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,240
was naturally implicated.

348
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,270
I was tortured by thousands of insects eating bones.

349
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,640
Based on this calculation,

350
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,960
the river stone

351
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,110
you were holding back then,

352
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,400
It could be fake.

353
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,110
Even the river stone and Luo Shi are fake, right?

354
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,030
Clan Leader,

355
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,110
for the sake of my imperial jade,

356
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,110
Tell me the truth.

357
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,920
I need to know the truth.

358
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,030
Please tell me the truth.

359
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,590
Kid.

360
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,440
Get up first.

361
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,160
Twenty-four years ago,

362
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,960
the Zerg treasure was about to be opened.

363
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,480
Lord He ordered me to hand over the Xue family,

364
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,720
who has been in charge of the river stone for thousands of years,

365
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,680
River Rock,

366
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,200
I gave Lord He a fake river stone

367
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,110
to protect the Zerg treasure,

368
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,480
Unexpectedly,

369
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,960
your mother went insane because of the river stone

370
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,830
and lost all her humanity.

371
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,070
A gentleman of the Five Clans had to kill her.

372
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,160
The Zerg were forced to fight each other.

373
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,240
It's me.

374
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,750
It's all my fault.

375
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,070
Kim So-mi,

376
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,550
you're such a poor person.

377
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,590
The fault

378
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,640
lies in her status as a high-ranking official,

379
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,510
It's all my fault.

380
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,200
She has a father-in-law

381
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,240
who has put righteousness above family loyalty,

382
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,270
All her hatred,

383
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,350
is so reasonable.

384
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,270
It's me.

385
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,070
indirect

386
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,030
Your mother was killed.

387
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,030
Xue Gui,

388
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,440
the old priest of the Xue family,

389
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,440
I apologize to you.

390
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,750
Old Ancestor,

391
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,920
your difficulties,

392
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,750
I understand.

393
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,640
The Thousand Worm Altar has been stained with the blood of too many people,

394
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,030
and now the five families

395
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,830
have new descendants of gentlemen.

396
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,400
We Xue clan beg you

397
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,030
to put an end to all these years of bloodshed.

398
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,790
Give back the Zerg and my settlement,

399
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,510
a peace,

400
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,200
Please take advantage

401
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,750
of Ouyang's family,

402
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,720
Please ask Jin Sumei

403
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,030
to help my Young Master.

404
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,270
Please.

405
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,830
Please.

406
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,750
What do you think of this dress?

407
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,400
I designed it myself.

408
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,510
Not inferior to the Xue family.

409
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
What do you want to do?

410
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,510
Since you're not here,

411
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,160
of course, someone has to

412
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,350
preside over the Thousand Worm Sacrifice for you.

413
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
Life is like

414
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,550
spring, summer, autumn and winter.

415
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,510
The Thousand Worms Sacrifice of the Xue family,

416
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,590
is the beginning of spring,

417
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,550
What an important day.

418
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,680
Here,

419
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,030
I want to pray to everyone.

420
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,720
May everyone be safe and sound,

421
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,590
and may the weather be good,

422
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,200
A bumper harvest,

423
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,000
do you think what I just said,

424
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,240
Isn't it a bit exaggerated?

425
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,480
It's still not good enough.

426
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,440
Or should I add more modifiers?

427
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,270
What do you think? Do you feel better?

428
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,200
I won't let you succeed.

429
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,590
Really?

430
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,680
Anyway,

431
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,480
He Luoshi is back in my hands now.

432
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,880
I'll take you to the Thousand Worms Sacrifice.

433
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,960
Let's witness

434
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,110
the greatness of this sacrifice.

435
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,240
Is this a specific painkiller

436
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,110
developed by Fengchen Jun himself?

437
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,270
Yes, Mr. Jin,

438
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,680
it's very effective in relieving pain.

439
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,440
After all, with a gunshot wound to the bone,

440
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,000
only Dr. Toyotomi's medicine can work.

441
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,310
Yan Ying.

442
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,590
Yan Ying. Yan Ying.

443
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,240
Where is this place?

444
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,480
This is in Yaxin,

445
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,750
a room specially arranged for you by Mr. Jin.

446
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,200
All the most professional doctors and nurses in Lingcheng,

447
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,400
observe and serve Young Master

448
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,000
in real time. You are so blessed.

449
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,270
His name is Ouyang Yanying,

450
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,590
not a young master.

451
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,680
Mother.

452
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,880
Yan Ying

453
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,310
Mother is here.

454
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,880
I want to eat cold potatoes.

455
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,000
I'll prepare some for you.

456
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,590
Xiao'e,

457
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,830
Yan Ying

458
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,640
Xiao'e, are you okay?

459
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,270
I'm fine. I'm fine.

460
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,240
Yan Ying,

461
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,310
I want to sleep a little longer.

462
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,150
Boss Jin,

463
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,550
this is the first time I've seen you,

464
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,670
I think,

465
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,440
you are very close,

466
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,190
I'll do it.

467
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,110
If a girl goes out drinking is harmful to her health,

468
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,590
stop drinking.

469
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,400
Mr. Jin,

470
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,840
who are you?

471
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,000
You're the first one to tell me that

472
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,550
drinking can hurt your health,

473
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,110
My parents never told me that.

474
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,280
All right,

475
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,230
didn't you come back safely?

476
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,480
It's safe now.

477
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,630
Second grandpa,

478
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,150
second grandpa,

479
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,710
Second grandpa.

480
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,760
My little sister is alone,

481
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,150
why are you sitting in front of the bank in the cold weather?

482
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,840
Leave me

483
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,590
alone. I'll take you home.

484
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,630
Where are you going?

485
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,800
Just come with me.

486
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,920
Save

487
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,030
Sis,

488
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,590
It's okay. Yanying

489
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,630
is almost done.

490
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,920
It's okay now.

491
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,480
Yan Ying, it's okay.

492
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,280
It's okay.

493
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,440
It hurts

494
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,510
Grandpa … Grandpa … I … You went to look for that

495
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,400
lunatic, didn't you?

496
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,840
I'll hit you.

497
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,800
Grandpa, stop fighting!

498
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,480
Stop fighting!

499
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,320
Get out of the way

500
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,150
Your sister is a hundred times better than you.

501
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,360
Do you know

502
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:45,920
how to say it?

503
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,280
Do you want to say it or not?

504
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,150
Yan Ying, you're dreaming.

505
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,230
Wake up!

506
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,230
Do something about it, Mr. Jin.

507
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,440
Grandpa, stop fighting!

508
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,150
I'm going to find Fengchen Jun.

509
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,800
I was wrong.

510
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,590
What medicine did you give Yan Ying?

511
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,710
It's my special central painkiller.

512
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,880
Of course,

513
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,800
there must be addiction,

514
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,960
Mr. Jin, you know that.

515
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,960
But it won't be fatal.

516
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,710
Are you using my son to test medicine?

517
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,920
If I don't inject him, he'll die of pain.

518
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,190
Don't worry,

519
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,150
if there's withdrawal reaction,

520
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,630
As long as he gets through it,

521
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,070
he'll quit naturally.

522
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,840
But this process

523
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,070
will be very, very painful.

524
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,320
I'm sure Mr. Jin knows it better than I do.
