1
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,479
Are you here to throw yourself at me?

2
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,240
Tell me,

3
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,479
where is Miss Yan Yun?

4
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,759
I'm looking for her too.

5
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,199
It seems that you want to marry Yan Yun

6
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,080
to our Wan Family.

7
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,680
Let our battalion commander go.

8
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,319
Brother, what are you doing?

9
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,319
No,

10
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,560
I just heard a gunshot.

11
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,879
Where is the gunshot?

12
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,400
Yeah, it was a gunshot.

13
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,240
Look,

14
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,319
Wait here. I'll take a look.

15
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,400
Be careful.

16
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,120
Okay.

17
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,360
Let our battalion commander go.

18
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,000
Where's Miss Yan Yun?

19
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,400
We didn't arrest her.

20
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,000
Fight with me.

21
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,159
You're too young.

22
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,800
First platoon and second platoon protection battalion commander,

23
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,159
the rest of you, follow me.

24
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,439
Hurry up.

25
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:32,919
Keep up!

26
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,319
Leave me alive.

27
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,479
I think it's Wanhushan and Luo Xiu.

28
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,000
We won't lose both sides if we fight.

29
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,000
Luo Xiu is definitely no match for the regular army.

30
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,280
you guys

31
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,560
Why are you looking at me?

32
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,919
I don't care.

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,360
I don't want to see Wan Hushan.

34
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,639
Why don't you care?

35
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:03,360
It's fine if you don't care about Sister Luo Xiu.

36
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,479
No.

37
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:07,400
Boss Jin sent this to save you. You don't care

38
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,520
if you help Luo Xiu out,

39
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,599
You don't have to do it yourself

40
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,879
Go after him!

41
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,720
Yan Yun.

42
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,639
Wait for me here.

43
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,040
Eunuch, where are you going?

44
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
I'll go with you.

45
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,959
Gentlemen of the Army,

46
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,879
we are a circus from the Northern Zhou Dynasty,

47
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,480
I'm the foreman.

48
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:44,480
I wanted to give you a show,

49
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,279
Did it ever occur to me

50
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,759
that this beast wouldn't listen,

51
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,120
You have to eat people,

52
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,279
but you only eat people in military uniforms,

53
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,199
Soldiers,

54
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,079
be careful.

55
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,439
Retreat.

56
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,079
Pan Jun,

57
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,279
can you really lie?

58
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,000
What are you talking about?

59
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,319
Isn't Yan Yun good at playing music?

60
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,920
Let me tell you,

61
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,240
they must be full of wolves, tigers and leopards.

62
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,519
Not to mention Wan Jiajun,

63
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,480
even if the president is here, it won't work.

64
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,240
You have to marry someone else in the future.

65
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,680
If you keep talking nonsense,

66
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,120
I'll let the jackal bite your mouth.

67
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,040
What are you doing? You deserve

68
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,439
to hit me.

69
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,319
Pan Jun,

70
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,800
you deserve it.

71
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,000
They're leaving.

72
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,680
Let's withdraw too.

73
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,759
Where are you going?

74
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,959
My Miss Yan Yun,

75
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,680
Wan Hushan,

76
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,480
Yan Yun

77
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,839
You must be Pan Jun

78
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:15,959
from the Department of Wood.

79
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,560
Sir,

80
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:18,839
Kid,

81
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,680
You look like a man

82
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,240
and come to fight with me.

83
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,120
Come on.

84
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,639
Be careful, bro.

85
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,360
Let's split up later,

86
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,480
don't be wiped out.

87
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,079
Run!

88
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,360
Give it to me.

89
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,439
Miaomiao.

90
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,600
Battalion Commander,

91
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,360
why are you stopping me?

92
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,560
battalion commander

93
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,959
Ziwu is the perfect candidate

94
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,120
to be a herbalist of the local lineage.

95
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,000
He can't get hurt.

96
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,679
You have to keep him alive.

97
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:35,559
Go after him!

98
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,879
Yes

99
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,600
What's the matter, Eunuch?

100
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,159
It's too dangerous here.

101
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,200
You go back first.

102
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,679
I'll come to you later.

103
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,320
Pan Jun,

104
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,639
no.

105
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,600
We can't go on like this.

106
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,080
Why don't I use my piccolo to lure the beast and stall the pursuers?

107
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Yan Yun, it's too dangerous for you to do so.

108
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,080
You go first.

109
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,799
Well

110
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,720
Yan Yun.

111
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,960
Yan Yun.

112
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,960
When I was little,

113
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,240
I would always make a wish on a meteor,

114
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
I hope the Big Dipper

115
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,480
can guide my mother to find her way home.

116
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,200
Mother is finally back.

117
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,399
But I didn't expect it

118
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,960
to be like this.

119
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:09,960
There are meteors,

120
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,480
Yan Ying. Make a wish.

121
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,279
Does your wish

122
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:25,960
have anything to do with me?

123
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,080
Why didn't you tell me?

124
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,679
I asked Meteor to promise me,

125
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,879
the things Yan Ying was worried about

126
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,519
won't happen.

127
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,759
You know what I'm worried about.

128
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,559
Of course,

129
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,879
you're worried about Yan Yun,

130
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,679
Worried about your mother

131
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,679
and your father who didn't come back,

132
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,039
Also,

133
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,279
And grandpa,

134
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,200
Most importantly,

135
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,960
the entanglements between him and your mother,

136
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,679
Twenty-four years ago,

137
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,279
in the battle of Mount Ba Men,

138
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,440
It has cost too many people's lives.

139
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,120
Actually, I'm not really worried about grandpa.

140
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,919
I'm the only male in Ouyang's family.

141
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,519
However,

142
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,000
my grandfather said I was inferior to my sister since I was a child.

143
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,399
He said I can't be a gentleman in the Fire Department.

144
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,399
But I don't care about

145
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,600
being a gentleman at all, do I?

146
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,799
All I want

147
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,080
is a real home.

148
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,039
But because of this,

149
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,960
my grandfather always whipped me,

150
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:57,960
Punish me.

151
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,879
That's what he does.

152
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,000
He only trusts his own judgment.

153
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:08,399
He never listens to anyone's opinions.

154
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,639
He always thinks he's right.

155
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,759
You guys go upstairs first. I'll get some medicine.

156
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:30,320
Okay.

157
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,600
There's no disinfectant left.

158
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,039
Only alcohol and painkillers

159
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,679
can do the basic treatment.

160
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,919
Stop bleeding and relieve pain.

161
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,240
Thank you.

162
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,919
The bullet is still in there. I need to take it out.

163
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,240
You may leave now.

164
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,440
All right. Call us

165
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,519
if you need anything.

166
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,639
Don't worry.

167
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:08,879
You'll be fine.

168
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,759
I'm here.

169
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:27,759
Hang in there.

170
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,039
Thank you so much.

171
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:52,399
But

172
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,840
before I could ask you,

173
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,000
How do you know my name?

174
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,159
Hurry up!

175
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,639
Here it is.

176
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,080
-Hurry up. -No.

177
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
Someone's coming.

178
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,639
It's you again.

179
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,039
Who are you?

180
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:23,519
Sir,

181
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,320
I'm an expert sent by the Northern Zhou government

182
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,639
to inspect Mount Ba Men.

183
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:29,559
This is the approval.

184
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,960
Even Heavenly King

185
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,919
can't control my territory.

186
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,360
Arrest them all.

187
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,759
Gentlemen of the Army.

188
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,399
Think about it before you move.

189
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,320
Let me tell you,

190
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,799
I'm Ba Song.

191
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,000
Ouyang Yanlei,

192
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,919
the son of Ouyang Family,

193
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,639
said that Miss Yan Yun is your daughter?

194
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,840
Aren't you my future father-in-law?

195
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,799
If you keep talking nonsense, I'll rip your mouth off!

196
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,279
Come here.

197
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:19,720
Put your guns down.

198
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,000
Put it down!

199
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,159
You're awake.

200
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,039
You didn't sleep all night?

201
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,879
Don't you think I'm in high spirits?

202
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,919
When I was treating patients in Cordyceps Hall,

203
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,279
I stayed up all night without sleeping,

204
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:06,559
What is this?

205
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:14,879
Don't get me wrong,

206
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,200
yesterday,

207
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,039
It was Yan Yun who helped you take off your clothes.

208
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,240
What were you thinking?

209
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,840
I'm taking your temperature,

210
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,480
so I won't take advantage of you.

211
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,960
Just go to sleep.

212
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,160
You talked in your sleep

213
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,200
last night. What did I say?

214
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,680
In my life,

215
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,400
I'm going to marry Pan Junfei.

216
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,400
I won't marry Pan Jun.

217
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,839
Pan Jun will be my man from now on.

218
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,440
Don't talk nonsense.

219
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,559
All right. Take the medicine.

220
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,240
Let me feed you.

221
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,920
Open your mouth.

222
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:39,960
Well,

223
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,880
about getting married in the future,

224
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,480
Stop talking casually.

225
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,720
After all, you're engaged.

226
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,279
Okay,

227
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:58,960
If I don't say it again,

228
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I won't blame you.

229
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:02,559
Pan Jun,

230
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,240
thank you.

231
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,720
This is the second time you've treated me.

232
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,039
You can't do it without me, right?

233
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,960
I made the soup for you two. Wait

234
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,480
a minute,

235
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,880
Drink it while it's hot.

236
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,160
Thank you.

237
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,000
What do you think?

238
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,759
Are you feeling better?

239
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,599
Much better.

240
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:36,359
Thanks to the uncle I met yesterday.

241
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,440
He said,

242
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,119
his name is Ouyang Yanlei.

243
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:51,039
Is he your father?

244
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,039
Well

245
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,759
Did you mention my father?

246
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,319
Me,

247
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,279
I haven't had time to ask,

248
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,319
but the trouble is,

249
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,160
Wanhu Mountain has taken over the whole stockade.

250
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,839
Wan Jiajun is here,

251
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,880
too. When you were unconscious last night,

252
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,160
They chased after us overnight.

253
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,680
Now there are soldiers stationed outside

254
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,640
and the Wan Family Army won't easily touch Ouyang Family's people,

255
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,599
After all, what they want is treasure.

256
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:22,920
You won't do anything

257
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,240
to the Zerg for a while, will you?

258
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,039
Yes,

259
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,160
Miaomiao has a high fever.

260
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,920
I don't have many herbs left.

261
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,480
I can't stay here for long.

262
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,519
We have to go into the city to find the disinfectant.

263
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,279
Old-timer,

264
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:50,839
please have a seat.

265
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:02,599
My father-in-law

266
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,359
Hushan is a rough man,

267
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,000
Just get straight to the point.

268
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,079
I have a crush on your daughter, Yanyun.

269
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,759
I wonder if you can fulfill it?

270
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,119
Battalion Commander,

271
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,960
marriage matters need to

272
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,079
follow the orders of parents and the words of matchmakers.

273
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,400
I appreciate your kindness.

274
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:24,519
I just got back to Ba Song,

275
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:28,160
I can't be so hasty in such a big matter,

276
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,960
So you don't agree?

277
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:35,039
To be able to marry the battalion commander,

278
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,559
I really want it.

279
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,599
Allow me some time,

280
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,200
to discuss with the family.

281
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:49,480
Battalion Commander,

282
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,039
if there's nothing important,

283
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,279
May I have a word with you.

284
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,920
Say hello to Mr. Ouyang,

285
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,480
Yes.

286
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:06,960
Miaomiao has to

287
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,000
go to Ba Song for treatment.

288
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,680
Yes

289
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,480
Just die.

290
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:14,599
Let's just grab the secret treasure and we'll be done.

291
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,319
The secret treasure is with them.

292
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,000
We can take it away anytime.

293
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,519
But Ba Song is too complicated.

294
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,279
Even if we can get the secret treasure,

295
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,559
we may not be able to get into the Zerg's treasure.

296
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,279
You mean

297
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:29,799
Ouyang Leiyun might get into trouble,

298
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,359
He and Old Thing have been friends for many years,

299
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,799
so that's not necessarily the case.

300
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,079
Ouyang's family's power in Ba Song is intertwined,

301
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:38,720
and Ouyang Leiyun

302
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,160
has close contacts with the military and political circles.

303
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,160
Especially Commander Long, the old coach's enemy for many years,

304
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:47,920
that's why the old coach specifically told me,

305
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,400
Let's not

306
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,160
rush into Ba Song,

307
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,119
What do you think we should do?

308
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:57,680
What the coach means is,

309
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,079
let Pan Jun pretend to be the battalion commander

310
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,039
and you can find out all about Ouyang Leiyun.

311
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,440
That's a good idea.

312
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,599
As long as we detain Ouyang Yanlei

313
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
and Yanyun's father and daughter,

314
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,640
I'm not afraid Pan Jun will change his mind,

315
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,240
and Ouyang's family hasn't seen me.

316
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,839
If anything bad happens,

317
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:18,319
I'll take hostages and go to Ba Song City,

318
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,799
You can win without fighting.

319
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,759
By the way,

320
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,319
Ziwu has to stay.

321
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,559
Didn't you tell me what kind of person he is?

322
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:28,039
Yes.

323
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,839
Then we'll have one more chip in our hands. Okay,

324
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:32,920
hurry up and do it.

325
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,839
If it's done,

326
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,519
don't eat leftovers at the hands of old people,

327
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,480
Follow me.

328
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:42,039
I guarantee that you'll get promoted and become rich with all your hands.

329
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,799
What do you mean?

330
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,559
If I pretend to be the battalion commander,

331
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:57,640
you and Miss Shi only need to act for a few days.

332
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,319
The battalion commander had never shown up in Ba Song before.

333
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,279
Don't worry.

334
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,240
What about Yan Yun and Ziwu?

335
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:05,920
If you two come with me,

336
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:07,440
they'll be fine.

337
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:08,480
I don't understand.

338
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:11,920
Wan Jiajun is threatening us with them as hostages,

339
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:15,640
We can't refuse such a situation at all.

340
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,319
If you want to be safe,

341
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:18,960
just do as I say.

342
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,240
You're threatening us,

343
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,559
but why do you sound like you're helping us?

344
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,319
You'll understand later.

345
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:33,119
Pack up and get ready to go.

346
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,599
You're going to have to bite the bullet again.

347
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,039
At least for now,

348
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,240
they don't dare to hurt Ziwu and Yan Yun,

349
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,799
Don't you think so?

350
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,519
Yes,

351
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,799
my battalion commander's wife.

352
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,319
Send them out of the mountain.

353
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,880
Brother, why are you here?

354
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,960
I'm the hunter to show you the way?

355
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,519
I'm afraid you won't be able to get out of Mount Ba Men.

356
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,000
Okay. Thank you.

357
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
Be careful.

358
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,319
The fever is almost gone.

359
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,759
How do you feel?

360
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,640
Much better.

361
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,240
When we get to the city,

362
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,599
we'll get more shots.

363
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,279
Bro,

364
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,799
where are you from?

365
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,480
I'm from Ba Song.

366
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:19,519
Do you know Hei?

367
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,160
Hei is from our tribe.

368
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:23,279
Do you know him?

369
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,839
Hei's daughter-in-law came to Langshui to complain,

370
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,960
saying that he and the carpenters he worked with were

371
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,720
all missing.

372
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,400
He was going to take us

373
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,880
to the missing place to have a look.

374
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,079
It never occurred to me that

375
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:33,839
she and her family members were also taken away.

376
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:34,960
His whereabouts are still unknown.

377
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,519
They didn't go back to the stockade either.

378
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,559
Tell me,

379
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,359
how is Ouyang Leiyun's reputation in Ba Song?

380
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,119
Every year, the boss will give us a lot of money,

381
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:48,720
as the cost of guarding the mountain,

382
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:50,519
Everyone is grateful to him.

383
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,480
He said he was the patron saint of our tribe.

384
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:54,559
However,

385
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,400
although the leader

386
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,799
is very kind to us,

387
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:03,680
But people in Ba Song said he mixed bran into rice.

388
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,359
Earn dirty money.

389
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,799
Mixed with bran,

390
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,720
Yes.

391
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,960
The toast is even worse.

392
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,880
He quadrupled the price of red wheat.

393
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:13,000
It's so hard to live.

394
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:16,000
The Ouyang family treats you well,

395
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,599
but they just want to rely on you

396
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:18,880
to keep the secret of Mount Ba Men.

397
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:23,279
It seems that Hei's disappearance

398
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,640
has something to do with them.

399
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,839
Wan Hushan, the battalion commander of the garrison in Ba Song,

400
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,160
has arrived in Ba Song.

401
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:16,720
This is the letter of appointment.

402
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,319
Battalion Commander, you've worked hard all the way.

403
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,400
I, Mu Dong, am the toast of Ba Song.

404
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:30,960
I've heard a lot about you.

405
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,960
The battalion commander is indeed young

406
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,079
and handsome.

407
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,000
Old man Ouyang is here.

408
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,799
He is the first industrialist in Ba Song.

409
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,400
Old soldiers of the Northern Expeditionary Army,

410
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,480
the whole city of Ba Song,

411
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,440
Half of the property belongs to their family.

412
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,599
Senior Ouyang,

413
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,079
pick me up in person.

414
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:51,480
My nephew,

415
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,480
you've grown so big in a flash.

416
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,000
I really don't recognize you.

417
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,279
Come on

418
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,799
I still remember that year,

419
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,599
your father and I were drinking tea

420
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,160
and listening to the opera at Qinghe Garden in North Zhou,

421
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,680
Back then,

422
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,799
you were still a doll in open-crotch pants.

423
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,000
I've heard it from my father a lot.

424
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:23,200
What's the name of your favorite scene?

425
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,839
True or false Monkey King?

426
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,799
That's it. This scene is so lively.

427
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,480
How are you feeling?

428
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:31,960
I'm fine.

429
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:33,359
Where's your father?

430
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,240
It's good, too.

431
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,920
He asked me to bring you

432
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:37,559
a nice message.

433
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,559
Battalion Commander, you've worked hard all the way.

434
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,759
I'm going back to the mansion to rest soon.

435
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,519
Is there anything else you want to ask?

436
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:58,839
Okay,

437
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:00,519
I really have something

438
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:02,240
to tell you,

439
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,720
But why do I have to

440
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,160
invite my wife here?

441
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,200
The other side is in danger.

442
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:22,480
I saw it.

443
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,640
The battalion commander is really a man of temperament.

444
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,359
today

445
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:34,640
It's really an eye-opener for me.

446
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:37,079
Battalion Commander,

447
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,000
Your Ladyship is already by your side.

448
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,519
Can we start now?

449
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,440
I'm new here

450
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,920
in Wanhushan,

451
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,039
But when I arrived in Ba Song, I heard that

452
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,440
there was a ghost in Ba Song City,

453
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,920
During the great disaster,

454
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:56,680
someone drove up the price of rice,

455
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:59,480
This is a disaster for the country. Cai Shangfeng

456
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,559
asked me to investigate this matter thoroughly.

457
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,039
Senior Ouyang,

458
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:06,000
you have to help me.

459
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:11,839
Reporters,

460
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:13,799
don't scribble. Don't scribble.

461
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:15,279
This is just a rumor.

462
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:18,759
Battalion Commander,

463
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,079
the rumor has spread to your ears.

464
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,039
The price of rice

465
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,200
was negotiated by the Chamber of Commerce and 18 rice shops.

466
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,680
How can we drive up the price of rice

467
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,359
and make a fortune in the country?

468
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,039
Okay,

469
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,680
That's good since it's a rumor.

470
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,599
I also got the promise

471
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:37,200
from Senior Ouyang and the toast,

472
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:38,680
After that,

473
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,359
let all the grain merchants,

474
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,240
Go to my battalion commander's mansion for a meeting.

475
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,160
Register it.

476
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,319
Since business and citizens are in harmony,

477
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,839
I can give Shangfeng an explanation, right?

478
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:51,839
Okay.

479
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,279
Battalion Commander,

480
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,480
is there anything else you want to say?

481
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,160
One more thing,

482
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,119
I'll investigate the disappearance of the Nichelo Demon lumberjack.

483
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:13,200
Nephew,

484
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,440
I've prepared a banquet at home,

485
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,279
Let's go.

486
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,079
Senior Ouyang,

487
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,880
I should have had a big drink with you.

488
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:23,799
But,

489
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,440
where is my battalion commander's wife?

490
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,680
She's not in good health,

491
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,079
so she needs to go to the hospital.

492
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,440
next time

493
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,559
I'll buy you a drink next time, okay?

494
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,559
As you wish.

495
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:11,160
You're awake.

496
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:15,359
How do you feel?

497
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:16,559
Much better.

498
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:18,839
I told you,

499
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,519
give me two shots and get some sleep,

500
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,640
Then I'll be fine.

501
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:30,000
It's so quiet here.

502
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,960
At the press conference yesterday,

503
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:43,359
some reporters,

504
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,240
It must be the killer's disguise.

505
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,240
It seems that no matter where we are in the future,

506
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,519
we must be very careful.

507
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,640
Wan Hushan

508
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,039
wants us to be fall guys.

509
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,759
That's right.

510
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:57,200
We don't even know

511
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,000
when they're going to do it.

512
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,839
So I came up with a plan.

513
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:03,640
What countermeasures?

514
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:13,960
Come in,

515
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,200
Ma'am,

516
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,759
I'm a reporter for a women's issue.

517
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:20,400
I want to write an exclusive interview with you and the battalion commander.

518
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,680
I'm a reporter from Fashion Weekly.

519
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,480
I'd like to ask you about Ba Song folk songs.

520
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:23,960
Battalion Commander,

521
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,720
I'd like to ask you about the price tag clearly marked by grain merchants,

522
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,599
When will it be executed?

523
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:27,200
Also,

524
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,000
may I ask the battalion commander and madam,

525
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,799
What kind of good deeds can it bring to Ba Song City?

526
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,039
About the missing lumberjack case,

527
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:31,680
do you know,

528
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,519
Dear friends,

529
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,079
Her Ladyship needs to rest.

530
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,559
Would you please leave?

531
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,519
Thank you.

532
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,640
Get out.

533
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:40,920
Hurry up.

534
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,160
Let's go.

535
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,119
Madam,

536
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,119
let's go.

537
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,359
It's fine if you talk nonsense when you enter the city.

538
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,519
Who asked you to do the interview again?

539
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,920
This is the newspaper from that day.

540
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,119
Headlines,

541
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:02,960
Look,

542
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,279
Battalion Commander Wan came to Ba Song for disaster relief

543
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,880
to thoroughly investigate the mastermind behind the price increase of rice

544
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,320
and the disappearance of the lumberjack,

545
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,639
Look, there are photos.

546
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,559
Look at you.

547
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,519
Are you trying to make the whole world,

548
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,360
The whole world.

549
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,639
I just want the whole world to know that

550
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,880
once we die,

551
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,039
Everyone knows it.

552
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,000
What can the Wan Army do to us?

553
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,679
It's fine if you don't believe me.

554
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,199
Why did you provoke the local snake of Ba Song?

555
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,199
Okay,

556
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,239
Now Ouyang Leiyun, Toast Mu Dong,

557
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,239
has been offended by you.

558
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,559
I'm gathering people's hearts for Battalion Commander Wan,

559
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:48,320
making enemies for Battalion Commander Wan

560
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:50,840
Is Battalion Commander Wan here?

561
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,559
Senior Ouyang, you're here.

562
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,239
She just passed by the hospital,

563
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,400
so she came to visit Her Ladyship.

564
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:04,400
Her Ladyship just woke up. Please.

565
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,400
How is Her Ladyship?

566
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,360
Thank you for your trouble. I feel much better now.

567
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,199
I'm glad you're fine.

568
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:19,960
Her Ladyship looks like an old friend of mine.

569
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:26,519
Really?

570
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,320
Isn't all the beauties in the world look the same?

571
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,800
Only those who are ugly are different.

572
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,400
Don't you think so?

573
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,760
What are you waiting for?

574
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:44,760
Make a cup of tea.

575
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,639
Your Ladyship

576
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
What should I call you?

577
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,159
I think I know why you feel familiar with it.

578
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:54,719
My wife's name

579
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:56,119
is Di Lisha.

580
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:59,039
He's a popular singer in Shanghai.

581
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,840
When she gets better,

582
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,519
I'll ask her to sing you

583
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,559
a song. No need to sing.

584
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,000
Judging from Her Ladyship's look,

585
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,360
she's still weak.

586
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:11,159
I won't bother you anymore.

587
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,400
Senior Ouyang, take care.

588
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,719
When I recover,

589
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:17,679
I'll definitely visit you.

590
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,239
Very good.

591
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,880
I'm leaving then.

592
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,039
-Take care. -See you off.

593
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:26,599
Senior Ouyang,

594
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:27,760
take care.

595
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:37,599
Xiao'e, have some tea.

596
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,599
Boss Jin, news from Ba Song City.

597
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,519
Why is Brother Pan wearing a military uniform?

598
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:53,159
Ba Song City is so complicated now,

599
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,760
and they dress like this,

600
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,480
I'm afraid the sheep will go into the tiger's mouth.

601
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:58,239
No way.

602
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,519
I'm going to find them now.

603
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
I'll go with you.

604
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,159
Don't act rashly.

605
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:03,920
I don't even know what's going on right now,

606
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,760
but when I find out what's going on,

607
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,880
Let's go together.

608
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,119
Mother,

609
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,480
Ba Song City is my home,

610
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,840
don't worry.

611
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,159
I won't be in danger.

612
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,719
You still have me.

613
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,880
I can protect him.

614
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,000
Mother,

615
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,079
This time, Brother Pan and Sister Miao,

616
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:26,320
they will probably go to see Grandpa.

617
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,519
What if they run into each other in advance

618
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:30,039
and have an accident?

619
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:31,519
And if I'm here,

620
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,639
I can still help persuade grandpa.

621
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,639
All right.

622
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:43,719
Tell them

623
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:45,400
when you get there,

624
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,679
On your grandpa's birthday,

625
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,840
we'll meet each other.

626
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,719
Okay,

627
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,039
We all listen to your mother,

628
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:58,480
Xiao'e,

629
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:01,039
I'll leave Yan Ying to you.

630
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:02,199
Take care of him for me.

631
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:03,440
Sure,

632
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,119
Mother,

633
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,360
I'm not here.

634
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:08,639
You should take care of yourself.

635
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:10,760
Be careful.

636
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,800
I'm leaving.

637
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,239
Let's go.

638
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,800
Boss Jin,

639
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,840
everything is fine in Ba Song City,

640
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,639
Is the birthday gift ready?

641
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:36,000
Don't worry,

642
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,199
everything is ready.

643
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:53,880
Master,

644
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,599
Master.

645
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,599
Master,

646
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,719
ever since you met Battalion Commander Wan,

647
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,039
Without saying a word,

648
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,639
is there anything

649
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,199
strange here?

650
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,199
He's not Wan Hushan at all.

651
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,480
His posture is weak and wobbly,

652
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,199
Wan Hushan was born in the army,

653
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,639
how could he not even look like a soldier?

654
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:37,360
If it's someone who took a gun,

655
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,559
the calluses should grow on the belly of the index finger.

656
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,960
But he didn't.

657
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:42,679
I still remember that year,

658
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,559
your father and I were drinking tea

659
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:46,199
and listening to the opera at Qinghe Garden in North Zhou,

660
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,360
I've heard it from my father a lot.

661
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,400
What's the name of your favorite scene?

662
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,239
True or false Monkey King,

663
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:55,599
this is it.

664
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,679
I didn't talk to the Wanchao Sect at all.

665
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:03,320
I saw a play

666
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:04,639
in the Northern Zhou Dynasty. So,

667
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:06,119
Wan Hushan

668
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:07,840
sent a substitute

669
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:09,960
to Ba Song.

670
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:12,119
Why did he

671
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,119
do that?

672
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,159
He's a bit like his father,

673
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,199
but he's suspicious.

674
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:24,320
Maybe he knew that I knew Commander Long,

675
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,079
and he did this,

676
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:29,199
To protect myself, of course.

677
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:30,920
Master,

678
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,320
there's still one month left,

679
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,519
The treasure is about to appear.

680
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:38,000
Master, you have to be more careful.

681
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:41,960
How many people will you arrange to go?

682
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,599
Make sure you get

683
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,639
to the bottom of him thoroughly.

684
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:46,440
Yes

685
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,159
Wan Hushan

686
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,159
is a great skater.

687
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,760
Besides,

688
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,760
you have to be careful of Dilisa.

689
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,239
You always keep a straight face,

690
00:40:57,719 --> 00:40:59,679
and you don't even bother to pretend to smile.

691
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,280
What Shanghai song queen?

692
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:04,400
You really think I'm an old man,

693
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,920
You've never seen the world.
