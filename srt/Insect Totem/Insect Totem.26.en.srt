1
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,800
Thank you for your courtesy in Shangjia.

2
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,479
There's no need to be polite.

3
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,599
Okay,

4
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,840
Jiacheng,

5
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,680
long time no see,

6
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,960
You're so powerful.

7
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,280
Don't make fun of me.

8
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,400
I remember the teachings of my benefactor every day,

9
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,039
but I can't put them into action.

10
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,159
I'm so ashamed,

11
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,280
so you must have something to do today, right?

12
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,680
After I came to propose during the day,

13
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,919
I thought about it over and over again,

14
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,520
I'm still worried that you'll set up the Hongmen Banquet,

15
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,879
and kill Wan Hushan.

16
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:51,960
In that case,

17
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,800
why did you come?

18
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,479
because

19
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:02,159
The coach can't tolerate me anymore.

20
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,280
Adjutant Wan,

21
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,240
how did you know Ouyang Leiyun was going to hold the Hongmen Banquet?

22
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:15,159
Senior Lei Yun is the leader of the Zerg,

23
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,560
well-informed,

24
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,639
How can you marry Miss Yan Yun to Wan Hushan

25
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,159
just because of a mere teacher?

26
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,319
Also,

27
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,800
Ouyang's family owns a lot of businesses,

28
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,719
With strong financial resources,

29
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,960
it's impossible to divide the Zerg treasure 50-50

30
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,919
because of a few boxes of treasure.

31
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,960
Isn't this the most ridiculous thing about skating?

32
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,840
You forgot to mention that

33
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,639
we Zerg,

34
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,120
It would be better to break the jade than to destroy it.

35
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,599
The Zerg has such spirit.

36
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,560
Wan Jiajun won't win much.

37
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,719
You just said that the coach doesn't trust you anymore.

38
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,800
What do you mean?

39
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,759
He's a man

40
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,400
who never apologizes to anyone,

41
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:55,680
But he apologized to me

42
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,840
on the phone today.

43
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,000
Besides,

44
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,960
he is a person

45
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,560
who never reveals his itinerary,

46
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,159
But today, he said,

47
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,560
he'll contact me when he arrives in Northern Zhou Dynasty.

48
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,960
Did he tell you?

49
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,840
Why did he go to Northern Zhou?

50
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,680
No.

51
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,000
But according to my guess,

52
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,040
he won't go to the North Zhou Dynasty.

53
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,639
He's lying.

54
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,160
Is it possible that he wants to kill you?

55
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,560
It's very likely that

56
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,040
he has been in a state of mind.

57
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,680
It's impossible to guard against it.

58
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,720
Do we still hold

59
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,399
the Hongmen Banquet?

60
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,040
Swing.

61
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,439
By the way,

62
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,120
pick up your Young Madam from the newspaper.

63
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,680
Young Madam,

64
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,079
you don't know, do you?

65
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,360
Xiao'e and Yan Ying are a couple.

66
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,519
Jun'er,

67
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,439
our previous engagement with Fire Branch,

68
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,120
I'll talk to Yanlei.

69
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,360
Don't worry, Miaomiao and you.

70
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,560
Thank you, Father.

71
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,319
Dad, you have good eyes.

72
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:29,319
I'm just not blind.

73
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,120
Miaomiao,

74
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,000
before I heard about it,

75
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,199
You've been in Japan. You just came back.

76
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,600
Did you go back to your hometown?

77
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,120
Not long after my mother died,

78
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,720
my house was burnt down.

79
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,480
Auntie and I

80
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,519
have been wandering outside for many years.

81
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,439
Later, after Concubine Qiao died,

82
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,720
someone suddenly found me,

83
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,439
He said he would take me to Japan.

84
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,560
At that time, I was so young

85
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,439
that I followed him blankly.

86
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,680
When I was 16 years old,

87
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
Matsui Shangyuan appeared beside me

88
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,959
and Shangfeng gave me orders through him,

89
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,759
Since then,

90
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,839
I've been working for AsiaInfo Club.

91
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,160
Actually, it was Yin and Yang

92
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,800
who gave the order

93
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:19,639
to burn your house. It was Shangfeng Wanchao Sect of the Yaxin Club who gave the order,

94
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,040
Twenty-four years ago,

95
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,600
Lord He from the Qing court,

96
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,160
Escort the Zerg Wanchao Sect

97
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,120
by Lord He's side.

98
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,800
The Wanchao Sect is scheming,

99
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,000
and has always treated you and Xinmei as pawns.

100
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,160
He created your hatred.

101
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,560
At the same time,

102
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,959
he also took advantage of your hatred,

103
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,800
So for so many years, I … I have been used by

104
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,759
others.

105
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,040
So, are they all doing this

106
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,519
for the treasure?

107
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,480
No.

108
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,959
precious mineral deposits

109
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,920
It's just his goal in stages.

110
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,600
The real purpose of the Wanchao Sect

111
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,040
is to get the whole world.

112
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,839
It's been more than 20 years.

113
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,120
It's unfathomable.

114
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,120
When Xinmei was poisoned by a thousand insects,

115
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,360
the Wanchao Sect took her to Japan.

116
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,199
Using the formula of the He family,

117
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,399
he started the cosmeceutical department of AsiaInfo Club,

118
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,639
He knew

119
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,800
Xinmei and Ouyang Leiyun were enemies,

120
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,399
He took advantage of this,

121
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,160
and he also provoked Miaomiao's hatred

122
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,000
for the entire Zerg,

123
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
It's been 24 years

124
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,920
since Wan Chao played the game of opening the treasure.

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,600
Wanchao Sect.

126
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,199
Nice shot, young man.

127
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,360
Ouyang Yanying,

128
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,720
Fire is Ouyang's family,

129
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,039
the younger brother of Yan Yun gentleman,

130
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,480
Who are you?

131
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,480
Me

132
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,519
It's your sister.

133
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,639
Your future father-in-law,

134
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,360
are you from the Wanchao Sect?

135
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,480
You're still stubborn in the face of a catastrophe.

136
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,960
The day after tomorrow,

137
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,679
it's your sister's wedding.

138
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,039
It's also the funeral for you and your mother.

139
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,519
Do you think our Ouyang family

140
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,559
is a piece of meat to be slaughtered by others?

141
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,120
Your Ouyang Family and my Wan Family are married,

142
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
the battalion commander of Wanhu Mountain,

143
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,399
Should I help his father-in-law?

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,279
What about eliminating enemies?

145
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,000
What do you mean?

146
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,159
Make it clear.

147
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,120
I don't want to say anything more.

148
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,279
After all, because of your mother,

149
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,720
Yaxin Club has lost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,919
With Fengchen Jun dead,

151
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,440
Master Cao's plan ended in vain.

152
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,759
Your mother is useless now.

153
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,759
To Ashin,

154
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,559
she was a burden,

155
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,879
As long as I'm in Ba Song,

156
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,000
as long as Ouyang Yanying is here,

157
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,399
I won't allow anyone to touch my mother

158
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,919
and go against the current.

159
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,120
You gave up the fire gentleman of Ouyang's family today,

160
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,720
and you gave up your parents tomorrow,

161
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,559
What about the day after tomorrow?

162
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,720
maybe

163
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,080
will give up your life.

164
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,919
I've been living in troubled times for many years,

165
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,519
and I've seen too many things.

166
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,440
If you sing and I come on stage,

167
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,919
your grandpa is right.

168
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,919
There is a great struggle in the world. If you don't fight,

169
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,799
you will die.

170
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:25,639
What the world wants is someone who can hold a sword,

171
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,159
but the difference between me and your grandfather is,

172
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,720
I know.

173
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,799
You can't just hold a sword.

174
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,320
Because too often,

175
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,159
God-killing ends,

176
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,240
The knife

177
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,120
is behind you. One last question,

178
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,080
The Zerg must be eager to find a herbalist

179
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,679
who can lead the Zerg,

180
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,759
But why did Pan Jun and the others

181
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,480
keep excluding you.

182
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,919
Saving your mother's life is not real.

183
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,600
The ambition to treasure is real.

184
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,519
What is friendship in the face of money and interests?

185
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,559
is the most vulnerable thing.

186
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,799
That's all I have to say.

187
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,039
If you accept it,

188
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,279
you can meet me

189
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,159
at the battalion commander's residence in Ba Song City.

190
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,639
Remember this place.

191
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,039
Come over at night,

192
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,480
and do your work well.

193
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:51,519
Understood.

194
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,080
Report,

195
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,039
what is it?

196
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:04,600
Lieutenant Wan,

197
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,440
the battalion commander wants you to go with him to test the herbalist,

198
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:07,679
Got it.

199
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:26,600
Uncle Pan,

200
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:27,639
this way, please.

201
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:28,480
Okay.

202
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,360
Xinmei,

203
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,679
you need some rest,

204
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,320
Have a good rest later.

205
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,720
Yanlei,

206
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,039
come out.

207
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,200
I'll write you a prescription.

208
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,320
Mother,

209
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:05,720
Mr. Jin.

210
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,720
Are you okay?

211
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,360
It's okay. Don't worry.

212
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,120
Sit down, all of you. It's okay.

213
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
Dr. Pan,

214
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,200
thank you and your father.

215
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,440
Thank you for your hard work.

216
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,919
It's because I'm not good at medicine.

217
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,679
I've made you suffer.

218
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,919
Yan Ying.

219
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,720
From now on,

220
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,399
you have to respect your brother like you do,

221
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,759
Respect Pan Jun,

222
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:56,840
understand?

223
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,759
Why are you saying this?

224
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,039
Mr. Jin,

225
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,000
Pan Jun and his son's medical skills are obvious to all.

226
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,639
You've come over despite all the difficulties.

227
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,440
You can't give in now.

228
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,679
Yan Ying has been waiting for so many years,

229
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:17,879
and now your family is finally reunited.

230
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:20,240
There's still a long way to go in the future.

231
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,799
To me,

232
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,240
let's not say anything discouraging,

233
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,840
As the saying goes,

234
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:28,919
when people die,

235
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,360
His words are also good.

236
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,200
I've never

237
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,240
regretted anything in my life.

238
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,919
I don't want to have regrets even if I die.

239
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,519
It's just that I pity my Yan Yun.

240
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,039
From a girl's family,

241
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:52,919
growing up like this,

242
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,799
For me,

243
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,639
I've never combed her hair once.

244
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:02,000
You drew your eyebrows once?

245
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,360
I think on the day she got married,

246
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,080
she must have been very beautiful.

247
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,879
Pan Jun,

248
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,360
I know Yanyun likes you,

249
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,159
You don't want to marry her?

250
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,639
I don't blame you.

251
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,159
I don't want my daughter to marry someone

252
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,720
who doesn't love her,

253
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:33,279
Yan Ying and Yan Yun have been lonely since childhood,

254
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,200
their parents are not around,

255
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:37,639
From now on,

256
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,159
I'm leaving.

257
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,360
I want you

258
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:44,120
to take good care of them,

259
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,559
Take care of them.

260
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,320
Mr. Jin,

261
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,960
you mustn't give up.

262
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,399
The blood of Herbal Master can save you.

263
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,600
Miaomiao,

264
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,679
what's my body like?

265
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,519
I know it very well.

266
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:05,559
You kids are still so young.

267
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:08,200
There's still a long way to go.

268
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,879
I hope you can all leave here.

269
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:16,159
Forget all the grudges

270
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,080
and treasures.

271
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,320
Mr. Jin,

272
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:25,759
don't worry,

273
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,759
We're all Zerg,

274
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,000
and along the way,

275
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,639
We have deep feelings for each other.

276
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,600
We'll take care of each other.

277
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,399
Okay,

278
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,879
I believe you, Pan Jun.

279
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,720
Take these people

280
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,600
away!

281
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,159
Battalion Commander,

282
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,919
please, Battalion Commander.

283
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:51,399
Please, Lieutenant Wan.

284
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,080
Please, Lieutenant Wan,

285
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,679
I have a three-year-old baby

286
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:57,360
and an old mother at home,

287
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm begging you.

288
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,000
I have to support my family. I beg

289
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,960
to go in.

290
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,480
Hurry up.

291
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,559
Hurry up.

292
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:08,680
Get in.

293
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,839
Hurry up.

294
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,759
Hurry up!

295
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,960
Let's go down.

296
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:13,680
Let's go.

297
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,039
Guys,

298
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,599
let's have a shooting competition later,

299
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,279
Those who come out of that cave are all crazy people.

300
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,960
Beat him to death.

301
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,319
Those who are killed with one shot

302
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,559
will be rewarded,

303
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,920
If you can't hit it with three shots,

304
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,440
slap yourself in the face,

305
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,039
Did you hear that?

306
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,160
Yes, I did.

307
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,759
Yingxuan,

308
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,799
let Pan Jun do the trial.

309
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:42,960
I was the first to disagree.

310
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:44,319
Do you have any other way?

311
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,920
Apart from the antibodies of Herbal Master,

312
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,440
what else can save Xinmei?

313
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,480
Let me do it.

314
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Being able to face life and death together with Mei'er,

315
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,759
is a great thing for me.

316
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,480
Absolutely not.

317
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,119
Listen to me.

318
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,759
Father,

319
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,119
Senior Yanying,

320
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,559
Yanying,

321
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,039
Your mother is asleep.

322
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,559
He's already rested.

323
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,799
Xiao'e is taking care of

324
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,079
Boss Jin. The current situation is not promising.

325
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,400
I'm afraid it won't last long.

326
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,400
Because of Ziwu's previous injury,

327
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,160
plus his injury

328
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,160
as an experimental body,

329
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,440
I'm afraid I can't test Herbal Masters,

330
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,160
so,

331
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:31,039
Maybe I'll search for other native tribes.

332
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:32,960
There will always be a way.

333
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,720
The native tribe tried herbs and visited Mingchuan,

334
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,279
but there were not many of them,

335
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,559
Where are you going to find it?

336
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:41,880
Uncle Pan,

337
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,519
tell me

338
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,279
who is the best person to be a grass master

339
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,039
Can I?

340
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,519
Miaomiao,

341
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,559
the ladies of your water system,

342
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,599
He lives by the lake and the river.

343
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,160
My body is extremely cold.

344
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,240
Besides,

345
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,880
You haven't experienced miasma.

346
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,039
And the trial of the virus,

347
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,559
it's not suitable

348
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,720
Okay Miaomiao,

349
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,519
I've discussed with my father,

350
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,039
my body is the most suitable for herbalists,

351
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,400
So I'm the only one

352
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,759
who's qualified to be there.

353
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,440
I should have done all this for my mother.

354
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:18,000
Kid,

355
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,759
Father.

356
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,559
The first bite of my snack was fed by the nurse.

357
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,599
I had a fever all night.

358
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,119
The person who takes care of me is the housekeeper.

359
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,400
The person who comes to pick me up from school every day

360
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,440
is the coachman's father. You have been suffering from autism

361
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:48,559
and have been ignoring me and Yanyun for so many years.

362
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,039
I've been looking forward to it for too long.

363
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,119
It's okay.

364
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,799
I've wanted a home for 20 years.

365
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,240
Now my parents are finally back.

366
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,440
But what's left in our eyes?

367
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,759
All we see is hatred,

368
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,000
killing,

369
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:08,920
precious mineral deposits

370
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,039
With the justice of the Zerg and the danger of our country,

371
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:14,240
I just want my mother to get better.

372
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,039
I just want to reunite my family.

373
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,079
Even if there is only a glimmer of hope,

374
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,119
even if I have to give my life,

375
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:29,359
In order to save my mother, I'm also worth

376
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:33,400
the child,

377
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,960
I'm sorry.

378
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:40,440
Get up.

379
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:49,599
Yan Ying,

380
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,920
listen to me,

381
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:54,839
The war with the Wan Army is on the verge.

382
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,839
You're all taking risks now.

383
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,480
Didn't you throw yourself into disarray?

384
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,640
The Zerg's treasure is precious.

385
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,720
We can't let them fall into the hands of the Wan Army.

386
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,720
We can't lose this battle.

387
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,200
How about this?

388
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,799
About the herbalist,

389
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,519
I'll figure something out.

390
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,160
I'll continue to recuperate Ziwu,

391
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,799
so don't worry about it.

392
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,000
Yan Ying,

393
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,279
you heard what Uncle Pan said,

394
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,799
The wedding of Yan Yun and Wan Hushan

395
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,160
is a big battle,

396
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:24,799
It must be dangerous.

397
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:25,880
Why don't we

398
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,319
wait until this is all over,

399
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,599
It's not too late to discuss it again.

400
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,160
Up to now, all of you

401
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,119
still talk about Wan Jiajun and treasures

402
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,759
as excuses and excuses.

403
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,880
Who can guarantee that you will defeat the Wan Army?

404
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,640
Who can guarantee my mother's life?

405
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,359
Jiacheng,

406
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:52,960
don't just stand there.

407
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,480
Come here and shoot together.

408
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,480
Go and see if everyone is here?

409
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,000
Yes.

410
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,599
Go and see if there's anyone alive?

411
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,000
Seven,

412
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,519
Eight, nine,

413
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
one less report,

414
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,240
One less.

415
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:31,039
Let's see who didn't dare to go in.

416
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,119
If I catch you, I'll have to unload you.

417
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:04,519
Yan Ying is practicing shooting again, right?

418
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,039
Don't hide it from me.

419
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:11,480
Yes

420
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,920
Give him this gun, too.

421
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,599
Tell him these are all guns of the Wanchao Sect.

422
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,400
Tell him to take it and throw it away.

423
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,880
Pan Jun,

424
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,160
Yan Ying is still young,

425
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,079
It's easy to act on impulse.

426
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:31,799
You must keep an eye on him for me.

427
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,960
I have no choice but to ask you.

428
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:52,960
Thank you,

429
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,480
Miaomiao. Have a seat.

430
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,400
I want to talk to you alone.

431
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,440
I know in my heart,

432
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,680
Pan Jun and Yan Yun

433
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,920
will never get together.

434
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:16,680
Mr. Jin,

435
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,839
I don't mean to blame you.

436
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,599
Miaomiao,

437
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,039
where do you come from?

438
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,279
I know.

439
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,799
Just like me 24 years ago,

440
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:31,720
Back then, just like you do now,

441
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,759
all I could think about was revenge.

442
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,039
So I left my lover

443
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,640
and my children cruelly,

444
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,119
It's been 24 years since we parted,

445
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,920
I thought,

446
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,519
The most important thing in my life is revenge,

447
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,359
until I meet them again recently.

448
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,759
Then it dawned on me.

449
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,839
So revenge is not important at all.

450
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:00,960
My family,

451
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,200
the affection they gave me,

452
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,839
And the time to reunite with them.

453
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,400
That's what I cherish the most.

454
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,920
Your mother asked me to give it to you.

455
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,279
This is the one that hurt Ziwu.

456
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,400
I know you're angry.

457
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,240
Me too.

458
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,680
Yan Ying,

459
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,880
did a lot of people teach you about this?

460
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,240
Whether it's right

461
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:35,759
or wrong.

462
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,480
There are also many people who tell you,

463
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,559
should you do it or shouldn't you do it?

464
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:45,279
You may or may not listen to the rest,

465
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,359
but I have to say,

466
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,839
Ziwu is injured.

467
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,400
We can't get away with each other.

468
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:54,400
Me,

469
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,839
Miaomiao,

470
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,200
your sister, Xiao'e and you,

471
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:02,119
We failed to protect our brothers and sisters.

472
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:05,680
I let that jerk from Wanchao Sect play with me.

473
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,799
Yes.

474
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,720
But this is not the reason why my mother suffers.

475
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,640
That's right.

476
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,720
It's not true.

477
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:16,960
But don't forget,

478
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:19,960
Wan Chaozong was the one who started all of this,

479
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,240
Without him, we won't go from North Zhou

480
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,799
to Ling City and then to Ba Song,

481
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,000
Without him, our friends

482
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,920
won't fall down one by one.

483
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,880
He won't detain your father.

484
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,759
Your mother won't take revenge on your grandpa

485
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:31,359
in a lose-lose way.

486
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,039
Even these two guns,

487
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,920
they belong to the Wanchao Sect.

488
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,559
Think it through,

489
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,039
it was these two guns that hurt Ziwu,

490
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,440
The Wanchao Sect injured Ziwu.

491
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,240
I'll go and test the herbalist.

492
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,559
If Ziwu can't recover,

493
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:08,599
for Mr. Jin's sake,

494
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,319
I also want to give you an explanation.

495
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,319
Even if I die,

496
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,319
I'll go.

497
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,279
We're not fighting for the treasure anymore.

498
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,480
We're doing this for our family.

499
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,799
Friend,

500
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,039
Father,

501
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,480
Those who have been with us

502
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,200
and warmed us.

503
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:05,000
Come in

504
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:12,400
Take your medicine.

505
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,319
You may leave.

506
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:16,920
Yes

507
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,680
Who is it?

508
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:57,960
What are you doing?

509
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,279
Stop!

510
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:03,519
Stop!

511
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,720
A man with a knife

512
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,160
sneaked in front of my door,

513
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,119
Luo Xiu,

514
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:09,599
stop chasing him!

515
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,920
I've been dealing with assassins for so many years,

516
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:12,960
and I'm used to it.

517
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,720
Maybe it was sent by the Wan Family Army

518
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,000
to assassinate Uncle Pan.

519
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,400
Yingxuan,

520
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,839
did you get hurt?

521
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:19,640
I'm fine.

522
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:21,720
He can run faster than a rabbit.

523
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:23,240
Luo Xiu, step up your defense,

524
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:23,960
Yes.

525
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,599
father

526
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:26,599
It's such a big noise. I'm going to see if I'm okay.

527
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,400
Your mother is asleep. Don't disturb her.

528
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,680
Go to bed early.

529
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:30,480
Okay,

530
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,839
Have a good rest.

531
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:33,759
Come with me,

532
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:34,559
Okay.

533
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,240
You're right.

534
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:47,519
There is indeed poison in it,

535
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,279
and the brother who delivered the medicine today is a fresh-faced man,

536
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,319
I haven't seen it before.

537
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:52,720
I just think something's wrong.

538
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,920
Then I took a good sniff of the medicine.

539
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,200
It smells like bee venom.

540
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,200
This is a potent poison that has been blended,

541
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:04,000
and ordinary people can't find it.

542
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,279
But if

543
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:07,319
you take it,

544
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,000
Sudden death within six hours

545
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,839
No doubt I'm a cripple now,

546
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,519
Besides,

547
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,319
why do you have to do that?

548
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,160
It seems that Fengchen Jun and Qiu Yaxin

549
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,519
will have to repay us.

550
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,759
It's the Wanchao Sect's

551
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,720
thunder again.

552
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,240
Will you still listen to me like you did

553
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,319
when you were young?

554
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,599
The Wanchao Sect is too cruel,

555
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,559
and these kids are no match for him.

556
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:20,240
Now,

557
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,640
Yan Ying is terrified all the time

558
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,160
because of me,

559
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,519
I'm afraid he'll be taken advantage of.

560
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,640
The most important thing right now

561
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:32,119
is to unite these kids.

562
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,680
Let them live a good life.

563
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,160
Smoke thunder.

564
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,039
I don't have much time left.

565
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,599
If there is an afterlife,

566
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,599
you can still be a husband and wife.

567
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,400
I'll accompany you

568
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,119
in your next life.

569
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,280
On her deathbed,

570
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,639
she told every Zerg child,

571
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:27,760
We must unite,

572
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,360
unite the entire Fire Branch,

573
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,360
Defeat the Wan Army.

574
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,320
Yan Ying,

575
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,519
stop crying.

576
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,199
Come home with me now,

577
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,800
and we'll kill the Wanchao Sect.

578
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,400
Revenge for Her Highness.

579
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,320
Yan Yun,

580
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,639
don't worry.

581
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,280
Remember,

582
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:03,119
in tomorrow's battle,

583
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:06,719
No matter who wins or loses,

584
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,960
you must leave Ba Song immediately.

585
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,079
Your mother and I don't want anything

586
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,400
to happen to any of you anymore,

587
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
If the Zerg can get away with this,

588
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,639
you can go to the North Zhou Dynasty,

589
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,880
Or go to London with Yingxuan,

590
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:31,960
and never look back.

591
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,880
What about you, Father?

592
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,199
-I'll stay with your mother. -No,

593
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
Father,

594
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:41,480
It's not safe here.

595
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,719
You have to come back to Ba Song with us.

596
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,400
Father,

597
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,440
Now that I'm a gentleman of the Fire Department,

598
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:52,360
I must ensure the safety of

599
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,480
each and every one of you.

600
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,760
Okay, Yan Yun,

601
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:00,559
All right,

602
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,199
don't put all the burdens on yourself.

603
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,800
During our journey,

604
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,239
you are not only a gentleman of Fire Branch,

605
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,199
Aren't you still our brother?

606
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,400
Don't you think so?

607
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,440
Sister is right.

608
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:28,360
I can't even protect my own mother.

609
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,159
I have no right to cry.

610
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:36,920
Yan Ying

611
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,639
Mr. Jin wanted you

612
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,599
to be happy the most when you were alive.

613
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,679
She doesn't want you

614
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,480
to be bound by thousands of obsession,

615
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,559
Otherwise, she wouldn't have said,

616
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,519
"I hope we can stay away from right and wrong when it's done. ".

617
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,079
Don't ever look back?

618
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,000
You understand

619
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:03,480
Mei'er's mind.

620
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,280
Uncle,

621
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,960
I remember what you said.

622
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:18,519
Whether it's for our family,

623
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,800
or for the future of the Zerg?

624
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,760
I'm here.

625
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:29,280
And us.

626
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,559
Kids,

627
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:40,599
let's go.

628
00:37:58,039 --> 00:37:58,880
I'm leaving.

629
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,719
Jiacheng,

630
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,039
let's continue to practice herbalism today.

631
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:29,639
The bullets are ready.

632
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,119
I'm not going today.

633
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,760
We have to prepare for the battalion commander's marriage tomorrow.

634
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,679
So boring.

635
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:45,920
Where's that idiot Mu Dong?

636
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:48,559
He went to prepare a float.

637
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
I have a float here.

638
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,840
He's going to buy a ghost,

639
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,519
He said the battalion commander's mansion is very imposing,

640
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:55,239
so we need to prepare a big float,

641
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,039
He's kind of sensible.

642
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,079
By the way,

643
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:03,400
Jiacheng,

644
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:05,039
Tomorrow,

645
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,440
why don't you be my best man?

646
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,400
You have so many brothers,

647
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,800
why do you want me to be the best man?

648
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,199
The old man called me yesterday,

649
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:13,639
insisting that you be the one.

650
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,000
Why are you still looking so sad?

651
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,360
If you don't like it.

652
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:21,320
I'll get you a daughter-in-law tomorrow.

653
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:24,079
Since it's the commander's idea,

654
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,239
I'll be happy with the battalion commander.

655
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:30,920
By the way,

656
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:32,119
when the time comes to pick up your daughter-in-law,

657
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,519
You have to block the wine for me.

658
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,360
Don't delay my business tonight.

659
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,239
Okay.

660
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,119
Where are Yan Yun and Yan Ying?

661
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:49,000
They're at Lei Yun's place.

662
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,480
Boss Jin passed away,

663
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,159
Everyone

664
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:55,639
feels bad.

665
00:40:58,599 --> 00:40:59,440
Xiao'e,

666
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:02,000
go get the bridesmaid's clothes.

667
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,920
Have a try.

668
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,960
I'll be the maid of honor.

669
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,159
I'll take it then.

670
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,760
Hurry up.

671
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,480
What are you thinking?

672
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,880
Nothing.

673
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:27,719
I'm thinking,

674
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,960
I don't want anyone to leave us anymore.

675
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:48,039
Commander,

676
