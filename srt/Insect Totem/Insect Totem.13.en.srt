1
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,439
I gave you a chance.

2
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,800
And I warn you,

3
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,879
but you're still so cruel.

4
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,560
Chief Priest Xue,

5
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,840
we belong to Zerg so there's no need to kill each other.

6
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,400
Breaking into the altar,

7
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,719
trying to steal the river stone,

8
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,159
You're not the Zerg,

9
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,960
you're the scum of the Zerg.

10
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,479
Today,

11
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm going to clean the door for the Zerg.

12
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,960
Hold on.

13
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,319
Since when did the Zerg Five Clans

14
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,800
collude with the Yin and Yang Clans?

15
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Chief Priest Xue,

16
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,000
I promise.

17
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,439
The Yaxin Club

18
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,360
will never interfere in the internal affairs of the Zerg in the future.

19
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,680
What right do you have to influence the Xue family's affairs?

20
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,599
Breaking into the holy land of the altar,

21
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,400
stealing the river rock,

22
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,960
Die,

23
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,919
Wait a minute.

24
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:24,960
Come out.

25
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,360
Chief Priest Xue,

26
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,199
I hope that this life,

27
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,840
In exchange for your understanding.

28
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,039
Please, Haihan.

29
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,120
You're back.

30
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,039
Are you okay?

31
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:56,479
It's okay,

32
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,599
Yan Ying.

33
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,919
You're finally back.

34
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,560
Yan Ying, well done.

35
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,439
If you hadn't asked Boss Jin for help,

36
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,280
we would still be trapped at the Thousand Worm Altar,

37
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,159
Well done!

38
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,759
Sister.

39
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,199
All right,

40
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,199
didn't you come back safely?

41
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,480
It's safe now.

42
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,680
All right, all right.

43
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,240
Luckily, everyone is fine.

44
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,600
Don't cry.

45
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,439
It's time to laugh at you.

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
As long as you're safe.

47
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,240
Dr Toyotomi,

48
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,480
long time no see,

49
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,959
It's been a long time, Mr. Jin.

50
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,560
It's your foreign style again.

51
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,360
Mr. Jin, after taking the medicine I prepared,

52
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,600
are you feeling better?

53
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,680
Does the Thousand Insects Bone Devouring Poison still attack frequently?

54
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
I feel much better now.

55
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,839
Your medical skills are superb again.

56
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,600
It's my pleasure to serve Mr. Kim.

57
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,120
Mr. Jin,

58
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,399
what do you think?

59
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,639
I didn't expect Dr. Fengchen

60
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,480
to be an artist?

61
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,560
Where is it?

62
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,839
This is all given by nature.

63
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,399
I love nature.

64
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,360
Art comes next,

65
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,040
I use both hands,

66
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,319
I'm roasting the Fire of Life to keep warm,

67
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,879
but the fire is withering.

68
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,759
I should go, too.

69
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,560
You're such an excellent medical scientist,

70
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,800
yet you still read Wattland's poems,

71
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,439
So romantic.

72
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,959
I'm flattered.

73
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,040
Shangfeng has made additional investments this year,

74
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,199
and I firmly believe,

75
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,839
My product

76
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,319
will soon enter the Southeast Asian market.

77
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,800
Shangfeng is very satisfied with

78
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,920
your latest Yersinia pestis

79
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,240
and its power,

80
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,360
We've all seen it.

81
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,839
This place will soon become the most successful

82
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,439
bacterial experimental base in the Far East.

83
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,839
The Zerg treasure is just around the corner.

84
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,480
I came to see you today.

85
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,439
It's for a personal matter,

86
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,759
you know,

87
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,600
Thanks to your mediation with Jin Shun,

88
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,279
I was able to recognize

89
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,560
my son so quickly,

90
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,040
Don't you know Ouyang Family

91
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,480
is also in Lingcheng?

92
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,199
Congratulations to Mr. Jin for reuniting with his son.

93
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,720
You promised her the exact time, didn't you?

94
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,120
Mr. Jin only said he would send a car to pick us up.

95
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,000
The ticket has been bought,

96
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,680
and you are not allowed to leave unless I leave.

97
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,360
Sis, I promised Boss Jin.

98
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,000
As long as we save all of you,

99
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
you and I will leave Ling City.

100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,959
Back to Ba Song's hometown,

101
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,360
what Boss Jin means is,

102
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,519
Why did you listen to her?

103
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,079
She saved us.

104
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,920
Of course we should thank her.

105
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,279
But Boss Jin,

106
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,120
why should she care about our future?

107
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,000
Yan Ying

108
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,399
Ziwu is still suffering inside.

109
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,519
How can we leave?

110
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,679
How about this?

111
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,080
Just tell her

112
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,840
that we're not leaving, okay?

113
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,399
What can she do to us?

114
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,759
Who is Boss Jin to you?

115
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,679
Why should you listen to her?

116
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,879
I'm just scared.

117
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,679
I'm worried that what happened to Second Grandpa will happen again.

118
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,960
Let's go. Let's go.

119
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,320
Xiao'e, go with him, too.

120
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,679
Hand over all the secret treasures.

121
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,759
Give it to me then.

122
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,120
I'll stay here with Miaomiao.

123
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,600
Pan Jun, don't make trouble.

124
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,960
Yan Ying, you are the man of Ouyang Family,

125
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,639
can you be successful?

126
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,000
You sound

127
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,759
more and more like grandpa.

128
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,000
You've learned to talk back.

129
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,240
How did Grandpa teach you?

130
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,600
What kind of person is she, Jin Sumei?

131
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,159
Isn't it just Yaxin Pharmaceutical?

132
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,240
If she dares to block the way,

133
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,919
we'll fight her to the death.

134
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,919
No, don't go, sister.

135
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,559
We are no match for her.

136
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,840
The whole Yaxin Pharmaceuticals

137
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,440
is under her command.

138
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,320
Her cronies are all armed with guns.

139
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,320
Yan Ying, can you grow your brain?

140
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,919
She's so powerful,

141
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,720
yet she still pretends to be nice to us,

142
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,440
Then we can't leave.

143
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:44,840
Yan Ying,

144
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,320
I've been in the AsiaInfo Club for so many years,

145
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,879
I only heard a little about Boss Jin.

146
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,919
Within a few days,

147
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,679
you got to know her so well.

148
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,679
Looks like he wants to save Ziwu.

149
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,639
We have to start from her.

150
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,519
Don't go!

151
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,320
I really don't want any of you to get hurt again.

152
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,720
I'm going to look for Mr. Jin now.

153
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,200
Ask her

154
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,120
what she really wants?

155
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,120
Sister, don't go.

156
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,480
Get out of the way.

157
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,519
Don't go!

158
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,759
Get out of the way.

159
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,320
She is our mother.

160
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,679
Ouyang Yanying, what nonsense are you talking about?

161
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,960
She is our mother.

162
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,840
It was my mother who was killed by a thousand insects.

163
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,919
Yan Yun,

164
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,840
Yan Yun,

165
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,759
Yan Yun.

166
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,000
Yan Yun.

167
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,600
Don't you want to save Ziwu?

168
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:26,960
Yanyun,

169
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,159
here's what I think.

170
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,200
You should take it easy.

171
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:36,240
After all, it's a good thing that you found your mother.

172
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,399
After all, blood is thicker than water.

173
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,519
But if

174
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,399
… If … My second grandfather,

175
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,159
Uncle Pan,

176
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,919
and the death of Senior Jin,

177
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,679
Does it all have anything to do with her?

178
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:58,919
And Ziwu,

179
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,360
I will never let her hurt Ziwu.

180
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,399
We haven't seen each other for so many years,

181
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and our mother and son have just recognized each other,

182
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,720
She was in such a hurry to send you away.

183
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,279
So I think

184
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:14,080
Lingcheng must be very unsafe right now.

185
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,759
The AsiaInfo Club must have made a clear plan.

186
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,039
I don't care who she is.

187
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,480
No one can stop me from avenging Second Grandpa.

188
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,519
As long as she's here,

189
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,559
I don't even want to stay for a second.

190
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,519
Yanyun,

191
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,320
forget it,

192
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,919
Leave her alone for a while.

193
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,679
Miaomiao,

194
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,720
she wants to avenge Second Grandpa.

195
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,600
He won't accept Mr. Jin.

196
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,879
How about this?

197
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,240
Let's take her to Xue's settlement,

198
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,919
and figure out a way to get the Heluo Stone together,

199
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,559
Disperse her energy.

200
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,799
I'd better stay.

201
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,600
The situation in Lingcheng is unknown.

202
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:04,360
I'm worried that Yan Ying and Xiao'e can't handle it,

203
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,960
so take good care of Yan Yun.

204
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,480
Waiter, one more bottle of wine.

205
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,159
Yan Ying, stop drinking.

206
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,080
Leave me alone.

207
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:30,720
Thank you.

208
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,120
Yan Ying, you can't drink any more.

209
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,919
Me

210
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,240
If I don't want to be a Ouyang man,

211
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,320
I just want to be my mother's child.

212
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,279
I just feel bad.

213
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,559
I want to call her mother.

214
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,320
What Ouyang man?

215
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,840
Every Fire Branch

216
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,120
is a false name and an illusion,

217
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,600
They can't give me

218
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,200
a complete home at all.

219
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,440
I just want a complete family.

220
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,399
Here we are.

221
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,679
Sir,

222
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,159
Money

223
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:01,799
Not enough.

224
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,080
Not enough.

225
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,159
Not enough.

226
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,080
Why are you still robbing me?

227
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,039
Are you done?

228
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,879
Thank you.

229
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,840
Let me tell you,

230
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,840
the folk customs here are very tough.

231
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,240
Don't mess with them.

232
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,480
If we make such a scene at the altar,

233
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,240
can they draw all our portraits?

234
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,480
Then we'll kill each other as soon as we meet.

235
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,679
Go back if you're afraid.

236
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,679
Anyway, since I don't have a father, a mother and a family,

237
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,519
I'm not afraid of anything.

238
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,480
If I don't have a place to live,

239
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,759
I'll live here in the snow.

240
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,279
How can I do that?

241
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,799
I just said that if we six are united,

242
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,360
wherever we go, we'll be home, okay?

243
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,000
He Luo Shi didn't touch it,

244
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,120
and Ziwu didn't get it out,

245
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,799
I'll freeze you up then. At least

246
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,600
those three won't kill me.

247
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:55,879
Okay,

248
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,360
I'll listen to you then.

249
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,360
A cosmopolitan family is home anyway.

250
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,879
Kid,

251
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,039
let me ask you something,

252
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,039
Is there a place nearby where I can stay?

253
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,960
And then it's a little cheaper.

254
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,720
I don't have much money with me.

255
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,000
Is that okay?

256
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,720
Little girl,

257
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,879
find us a better one.

258
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,159
I don't want anything cheap.

259
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,240
It's cheaper.

260
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,320
That's the situation.

261
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:36,399
It's going to be the day of the Thousand Worms Sacrifice,

262
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,879
and the Chief Priest ordered that

263
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,200
during this period of time,

264
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,480
You can't take in outsiders in the settlement.

265
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,399
Double the rent.

266
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,080
Okay,

267
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,840
Auntie,

268
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:47,879
we have friends in Lingcheng,

269
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,159
I'll bring it to you in a couple of days.

270
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,360
Three times the rent,

271
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:51,600
Three,

272
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,440
Deal.

273
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,559
Deal.

274
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:56,480
Take it.

275
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,559
There are wolves at night.

276
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,839
This is your food.

277
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,400
Remember,

278
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,359
You can't break into the Xue family's gate in the settlement.

279
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,720
What are you doing?

280
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,839
I've found a place to live.

281
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,319
Next, we need to find a way

282
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,519
to sneak into Xue Family Courtyard.

283
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:25,960
What is it?

284
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:44,880
What's going on?

285
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,119
This girl is not like ours,

286
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,559
Miss, Miss, Miss,

287
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,559
What's wrong with you?

288
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,279
I … I feel weak and have a stomachache.

289
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,200
What about your parents?

290
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,160
Me

291
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,720
Miss! Go find

292
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,480
the witch doctor! -Mother-in-law! Get

293
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,440
out of the way!

294
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,759
Miss,

295
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,240
please make way.

296
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,680
I'm the best witch doctor in the north.

297
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,599
I can talk to the sun, moon, mountains and rivers.

298
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,920
Let me have a look.

299
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,920
Please take a look.

300
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,079
The God of Sun and Moon has told me,

301
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,599
I just need a needle.

302
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,359
She'll wake up in no time.

303
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,240
Open your eyes.

304
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,079
You're awake.

305
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,440
You're really awake.

306
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,000
Get up, little girl.

307
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,440
Thank you, doctor.

308
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,039
Thank you, Doctor.

309
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,519
Thank you.

310
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:04,759
Really?

311
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,359
Young man,

312
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,079
you said you were a witch doctor

313
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,559
who could talk to the sun, moon, mountains and rivers,

314
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,799
Who are you?

315
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:18,039
I have a patient

316
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,759
waiting to save my life.

317
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,279
If she can't wake up before the sting,

318
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,599
God should blame her.

319
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,559
My visit fee is very high.

320
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,240
Let's go.

321
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,039
Be careful all the way to the Xue family.

322
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,640
I got to know about the Xue family.

323
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:42,599
Miss Xue has been ill in bed all the year round,

324
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,200
and all the wizards have no choice.

325
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,359
If you want to gain their trust,

326
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,640
when necessary,

327
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,440
You can reveal your identity as the Divine Physician of the Department of Wood.

328
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,680
Although they might be targeted,

329
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,920
they might be killed.

330
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,720
But it can't help but be an opportunity.

331
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,079
Remember,

332
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:02,319
danger and opportunity always exist at the same time.

333
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:12,920
Jing Zhe.

334
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,039
Uncle Wen,

335
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,440
do you live so far away?

336
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,079
If you can't cure my patient,

337
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,920
there's only one result.

338
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,319
He died in the Xue family settlement,

339
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,839
and you found out about

340
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,640
the girl just now, right?

341
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:41,720
Since you dare to show up in my Xue family,

342
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,279
I'd like to try your medical skills.

343
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,400
Here's the thing.

344
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,079
To cure my patient,

345
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,160
Isn't 100 taels

346
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:59,000
of gold enough?

347
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,319
How much does talking about money hurt your feelings?

348
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,200
Lead the way, lead the way, go, go.

349
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,200
All right.

350
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,920
This is my Young Master.

351
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,880
My Young Master has been in a coma for three years,

352
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,200
and the witch doctors in the settlement are helpless,

353
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:34,160
If you can wake up my Young Master,

354
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,519
let alone 102 gold,

355
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,799
We, the Xue family,

356
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,240
are willing to do everything for you.

357
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:49,119
I dare not say,

358
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,839
but I can make your Young Master wake up.

359
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:53,880
But you're a descendant of the Floragrims.

360
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:56,519
It will cure my Young Master,

361
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,640
how do you know that?

362
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,880
Your silk won't be fake.

363
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,720
It's exactly the same as what Pan Yingxuan used back then.

364
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,480
You know my father?

365
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,039
Back then,

366
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,160
pneumonic plague appeared in the north,

367
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,440
Your father came here to practice medicine and save people,

368
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,480
before he left,

369
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:23,160
He advised the Xue family to hand over the Heluo Stone,

370
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,200
he said he wanted to open the Zerg treasure,

371
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:28,160
Save more people.

372
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,920
I didn't expect my father to be here too.

373
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:34,880
Not only that,

374
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,240
but he also taught the people here

375
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,440
to read and write,

376
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,400
He brought civilization here.

377
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
Later on,

378
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,559
many members of our Xue family

379
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,720
got tired of

380
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,680
the bitter days of drinking blood,

381
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,119
Leaving the barren hills,

382
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,759
leaving the Xue family,

383
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:58,519
As a result,

384
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,599
there were many seniors of Xue clan,

385
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,000
I hate your father so much.

386
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,559
You know,

387
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,000
the thousand-year-old ancestral motto of our Xue family is,

388
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,160
Don't leave the settlement.

389
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,079
Our responsibility

390
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,160
is to protect He Luoshi from generation to generation.

391
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,599
Your Young Master is unconscious,

392
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,480
is it related to He Luoshi?

393
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:26,640
Young Master has been in a coma for three years.

394
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:31,000
It's hard to find out the truth.

395
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,279
I will do my best

396
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,599
to treat your Young Master.

397
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,440
If she wakes up,

398
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,680
I want you to promise me one request,

399
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,359
Go ahead.

400
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,000
I want Heluo Stone, too.

401
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,240
Hello,

402
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,079
everything is ready.

403
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:20,400
Where's Yan Yun?

404
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:25,240
We've decided not to leave.

405
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,400
I'm not leaving.

406
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:27,799
Then.

407
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,160
May I ask if Mr. Jin is not here?

408
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,799
Didn't she say she would see us off in person?

409
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:36,960
Boss Jin went to Yaxin early in the morning to deal with things,

410
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,839
so that he could see you off in person.

411
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,119
However,

412
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,400
as soon as I went out, I met a troublemaker,

413
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,079
She told me over and over again,

414
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,599
I have to explain it to you.

415
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,480
Does she really want to come?

416
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,200
It's not serious. Is it serious?

417
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,319
It's okay. It's just

418
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,960
some unscrupulous workers causing trouble.

419
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,880
Please take me

420
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,359
to the AsiaInfo Club now.

421
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,000
No matter what happens,

422
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,160
we won't leave Ling City today.

423
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,720
Instead of that,

424
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,200
you'd better let me explain it

425
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,480
to Boss Jin and me in person,

426
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,279
But,

427
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,680
whether you agree or not,

428
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,920
We're all going to Yaxin today.

429
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,839
Yan Ying is worried about his mother,

430
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,599
please understand.

431
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:25,640
I'm counting on you.

432
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,000
Come with me.

433
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:59,160
Stay close to me.

434
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,559
Don't be afraid.

435
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:05,920
Mr. Jin,

436
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,279
Mr. Jin,

437
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,359
Boss Jin,

438
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,400
our brothers and sisters,

439
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:11,519
I lost it when I was about to go to work.

440
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,319
His whereabouts are still unknown until now.

441
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:15,160
You must give us an explanation today.

442
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,720
Calm down,

443
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:20,119
everyone. We've sent people to look for it everywhere.

444
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,359
Even the police are looking for it for us.

445
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:24,839
You'd better go back to work as soon as possible.

446
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,599
Mr. Kim Miss Luo,

447
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:29,000
it's not that we don't work,

448
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,119
The women workers in the pharmaceutical factory,

449
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,680
one by one, disappeared.

450
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,480
You have to give us an explanation.

451
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,599
People outside,

452
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:36,480
they all say that there are ghosts in the pharmaceutical factory claiming their lives,

453
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:38,079
We won't be able to enter the factory.

454
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:38,880
Vengeful souls are risking their lives,

455
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,119
not handing over our sisters,

456
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,000
If we don't work,

457
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,160
it's nonsense

458
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,680
to talk about ghosts and gods.

459
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,400
Mr. Jin has already given you

460
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,519
the most generous wages.

461
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,000
If you go on strike like this,

462
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,640
will you be worthy of Boss Jin?

463
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,079
We can't even live our own life well.

464
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,400
We can't take care of you anymore, Mr. Jin.

465
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,599
Mr. Jin.

466
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,000
Yan Ying,

467
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,039
are you all right?

468
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,759
I'm fine.

469
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,160
Mr. Jin.

470
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:24,440
Before Yaxin Pharmaceutical came to Lingcheng,

471
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,400
this place was a piece of loess,

472
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,559
You live a life of isolation,

473
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,200
slash-and-burn,

474
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:32,119
You sold your children

475
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,680
to landlords as child brides and slaves.

476
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,839
Being bullied by others,

477
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,319
Yaxin Pharmaceutical

478
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,680
gave you this opportunity.

479
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,000
So that you can rely on your own hands.

480
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,119
Self-reliance,

481
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,200
clothing and food,

482
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,920
I hope you can cherish this opportunity.

483
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,759
Today, I also promised you

484
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:54,240
that regarding the disappearance,

485
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,079
I'll get to the bottom of this.

486
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,279
Let me explain to all of you.

487
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,799
Now,

488
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,240
if you want,

489
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:02,559
You can go to the factory

490
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,839
to get a month's salary in advance,

491
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
Then go home and think about it carefully.

492
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:08,559
After you figure it out,

493
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,400
you can come back to work.

494
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,000
If you don't want to,

495
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,119
I won't force you.

496
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:18,200
Can I get a month's salary?

497
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,160
Really?

498
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,559
Since Mr. Jin has spoken,

499
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,359
let's go back first.

500
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
Dismiss, everyone.

501
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,039
Please trust her one more time, okay?

502
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,359
Go back, everyone.

503
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,480
Then trust her one more time.

504
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,759
Let's go back first.

505
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,079
It's okay, Xiao'e. Let's go.

506
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,079
Yan Ying.

507
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,200
Yan Ying,

508
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,160
Yan Ying,

509
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,279
Yan Ying.

510
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:12,720
Yan Ying,

511
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,400
are you leaving?

512
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,640
Yan Ying.

513
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,400
Yan Ying.

514
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,599
Yan Ying.

515
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,720
Jerk!

516
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,440
Let us out!

517
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,079
Let us out!

518
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:37,799
Let us out.

519
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,160
Fengchen Jun,

520
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:47,480
why did you catch so many innocent girls?

521
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,640
Aren't you afraid of being punished?

522
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,839
Don't be anxious.

523
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,279
Soon,

524
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,440
you'll be my next partner.

525
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Let me tell you,

526
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:06,920
Pan Jun and the others

527
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,000
will get the treasure sooner or later.

528
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:11,559
You are dead then.

529
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,039
Pan Jun

530
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,119
The young man from North Zhou?

531
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,279
You know what?

532
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,519
He's the weakest member of the Zerg.

533
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,880
People who study medicine cheat money and color.

534
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,079
Don't worry,

535
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,400
After I see him,

536
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,799
I'll teach him a lesson.

537
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,200
Fengchen Jun,

538
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,920
let's make a bet.

539
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,559
You will die at Pan Jun's hands.

540
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,160
Believe it or not?

541
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:56,519
Even if I, Fengchen Jun, die,

542
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,480
I will die in my own hands.

543
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:06,559
My lab is vacant.

544
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,880
We are waiting for a guest.

545
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:09,039
Jerk, you're not a human.

546
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,320
What we have to wait for is

547
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,400
Pan Jun.

548
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,559
Why are they all withered?

549
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,440
What a pity.

550
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:06,760
Doctor Pan said.

551
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,119
This is the most cold-resistant wormwood. It can

552
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,400
relieve asthma and cold when used as medicine.

553
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,599
Uncle Borigu,

554
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,039
do you think Young Master can really be saved this time?

555
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,079
There will be.

556
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,519
Faith matters.

557
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,079
We have to believe it first,

558
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,519
so that we can have a chance to come true.

559
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,400
These are all my father's books.

560
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:55,559
These are Young Master's favorite books.

561
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,159
However,

562
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:00,480
these books are banned here.

563
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,679
Besides medical books,

564
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,079
there are also some stories about western modern times,

565
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:08,079
Why is this a forbidden book?

566
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,360
Our Xue family has clan rules,

567
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,320
and we are not allowed to go out of the mountains for generations.

568
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:14,679
Ancestors said that

569
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,320
we can get the blessing of the Moon Goddess,

570
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,400
But our Young Master loves reading,

571
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,599
she said,

572
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:22,079
Hunting nomads,

573
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,880
she wants to take us out of the mountains,

574
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:26,239
But I was scolded by my ancestors.

575
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,440
I also want to ask,

576
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:34,599
why all these flowers and plants

577
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:35,679
have withered like this.

578
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:36,760
Why don't you throw it out?

579
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,480
Young Master has always liked plants,

580
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,960
and is used to putting more flowers and plants in the house,

581
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,679
We're just continuing

582
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:46,199
her habits and hobbies.

583
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,840
But somehow,

584
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:49,880
all the plants in Young Master's house died.

585
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:51,559
He used to be fine.

586
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,280
Only one is still alive.

587
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,400
Only the one that's alive,

588
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:06,800
your Young Master is not sick,

589
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,119
I'm not sick.

590
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,960
Read the book,

591
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,719
Clearly recorded the characteristics of the two plants,

592
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,159
intuitive feeling.

593
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,400
Come on.

594
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,360
Look at these two leaves,

595
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:27,679
these two leaves,

596
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,239
This leaf stem is smaller

597
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,639
and darker,

598
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,400
And there are velvet thorns on the back,

599
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,679
this kind of

600
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,159
It's called Earth Pomegranate.

601
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,320
It grows near the Ergun River

602
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,000
in Xing'an Ridge of Changbai Mountain,

603
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,280
Because it's cold-resistant,

604
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:46,480
it can grow on extremely cold mountains.

605
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,400
And this kind

606
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,920
is a domestic berry,

607
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,599
The fruit is big

608
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,639
and sour,

609
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,400
There are also thorns

610
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,280
on my back. My father,

611
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:00,559
It was raised in North Zhou City at that time,

612
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,079
but because the climate in North Zhou City was relatively hot,

613
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,119
I don't have any support.

614
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,679
And it's particularly attractive to insects.

615
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,519
It's all messed up by the yellow thorn moth,

616
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,960
yellow thorn moth,

617
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,639
The yellow thorn moth is an insect that feeds on berries,

618
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:15,519
and it's picky about food.

619
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:16,760
I only eat pomegranate,

620
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,239
but my father never lets me touch this kind of flower.

621
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,880
Because the yellow thorn moth

622
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,599
can fly into people's ears.

623
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,679
It will stab people's skin.

624
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,960
After the stab wound, there will be redness and swelling,

625
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,000
accompanied by severe pain,

626
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,320
But there is a kind of person,

627
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,760
because of physical reasons,

628
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,679
He'll develop allergies.

629
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,760
This will lead to long-term shock.

630
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:37,480
Dr. Pan,

631
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,440
what do you mean,

632
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,960
Someone poisoned the yellow thorn moth.

633
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,280
Poisoning my Young Master,

634
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:45,599
think about it,

635
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:48,679
If all the pomegranates are dead,

636
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,559
what does the yellow thorn moth feed on?

637
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,159
This is the only one.

638
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:55,400
This plant is the last food of the yellow thorn moth.

639
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,840
In the past three years,

640
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,000
someone must have been watering

641
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,199
and deworming this pot of flowers and taking good care of it,

642
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,199
It means that this person

643
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:07,760
can freely enter and leave your Young Master's room,

644
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,000
The answer will be clear at a glance.

645
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,599
This person

646
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:13,199
is a member of your Xue family.

647
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,000
In other words,

648
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,079
your Young Master

649
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,400
wants to lead your people out of the mountain,

650
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:19,480
Who is it?

651
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,039
If you want to stop your Young Master,
