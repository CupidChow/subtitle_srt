1
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,040
The gods of the sun and moon

2
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,590
are offering sacrifices to the clan of Shangxue,

3
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,590
I must do my best.

4
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,430
Protect the whole clan.

5
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,840
In the past,

6
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,030
Pan Yingxuan, a gentleman from the wood department,

7
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,120
treated plague for our Xue clan,

8
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,240
To save my entire Xue family in danger,

9
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,150
now time has passed,

10
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,190
The current gentleman Pan Jun is here.

11
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,080
You also gave me a hand.

12
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,430
We fear the gods of the sun and the moon,

13
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,520
we guard the Thousand Worm Altar,

14
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,710
Cheers.

15
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,680
Fengchen Jun,

16
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,680
you killed innocent people indiscriminately,

17
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,840
If you act recklessly,

18
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,400
the ancestors of the Zerg will not let you go.

19
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,030
Really?

20
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,310
The sacrificial ceremony

21
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,400
begins now.

22
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,590
Congratulations to Heluoshi

23
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,680
on the day of spring,

24
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,870
Everything is revived

25
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,430
and everything is restarted.

26
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,520
Fengchen Jun,

27
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,520
here we come.

28
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,480
Welcome to the Thousand Worm Sacrifice hosted by me.

29
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,510
What's this smell?

30
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,870
Your tribute is not some rotten fish and shrimps, is it?

31
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,310
Fengchen Jun,

32
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,630
let me tell you something,

33
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,750
The gods of the sun and moon don't eat your stuff.

34
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,040
Look at our tributes.

35
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,920
How dare you!

36
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,950
How dare you?

37
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,750
This is our territory.

38
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,560
We can do whatever we want.

39
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,390
Uncle Pan,

40
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,000
Senior Ouyang, Senior Jin,

41
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,680
I found your killer.

42
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,950
I will avenge you.

43
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,430
As for our Zerg treasure,

44
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,390
I won't let anyone else in.

45
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll burn the paper money

46
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,720
for you.

47
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,120
If it's not enough, you can dream of me again.

48
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,480
What are you wearing?

49
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,120
Why is there a dead man at home?

50
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,160
The funeral,

51
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,800
today

52
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,750
People will surely die.

53
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,120
But he's not one of us.

54
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,120
Not a single one.

55
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,240
Kill,

56
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,750
Save Young Master.

57
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:11,800
Young Master,

58
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,800
here we come.

59
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,800
Let's go!

60
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,870
Get the Heluo Stone back.

61
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,240
Hurry up!

62
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,070
Auntie.

63
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,720
Let's go!

64
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,160
Auntie,

65
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,040
you go,

66
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,430
Let's go!

67
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,680
Aunt,

68
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,720
Let's go.

69
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,120
The Ice Worm is here.

70
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,000
Come with me,

71
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,240
Let's go.

72
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,240
Do you really think you can run away?

73
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,200
All of them are mine.

74
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,750
You are dead then.

75
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,670
Don't bother.

76
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,080
This stone gate

77
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,870
is used to deal with the thief who stole Luoshi from the river.

78
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,960
It weighs thousands of jin.

79
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,320
What should we do?

80
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,030
Do we have another exit?

81
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,360
The gate has been controlled by people from Yin and Yang.

82
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,870
This is the only exit.

83
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,960
They set a fire outside.

84
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,630
Cover your nose and mouth.

85
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,870
There will only be less and less oxygen here.

86
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,750
Fengchen Jun was dragged to the Thousand Worm Altar by Pan Jun,

87
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,480
Yaxin Pharmaceutical must be on empty guard.

88
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,000
This is a good time to save Ziwu.

89
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,480
Don't be afraid.

90
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,240
It's just glucose to restore your strength.

91
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,480
today

92
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,150
Why are you alone?

93
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,000
Dr. Toyotomi went to a party with your friends.

94
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,440
I think it should be a perfect party.

95
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,080
Our experiment

96
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,840
has reached the final stage.

97
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,480
The Zerg treasure is about to be opened.

98
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,200
Dream on!

99
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,550
If you can do it,

100
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,270
you can kill me now.

101
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,750
Don't wait for your boss to do it,

102
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,750
No.

103
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,000
You can't die.

104
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,670
You will be our herbalist in the future.

105
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,720
Why did you bring so many women here again?

106
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
Fengchen Jun is really insane.

107
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,320
Help me!

108
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,320
Don't be afraid. It's me.

109
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,360
Yanyun,

110
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,320
I'm sorry we're late.

111
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,390
Ziwu,

112
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,030
Xiao'e,

113
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,390
Yanyun,

114
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,600
I knew it.

115
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,030
You will come to save me.

116
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,150
Xiao'e, hurry up.

117
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,360
Let's go!

118
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,910
You guys save her.

119
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,080
I'll go find Master.

120
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,000
Okay.

121
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,630
Master, master, master,

122
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,390
I'll get you out.

123
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,600
Let's go!

124
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,440
This way!

125
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,720
Yan Yun, be careful.

126
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,030
Stop!

127
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,720
Take everyone with you.

128
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,670
Go to Xue's settlement.

129
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,750
Pan Jun is waiting for you there.

130
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,270
Come with me.

131
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,790
We meet again. Xinmei,

132
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,600
I knew you'd come back.

133
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,150
I came back for revenge.

134
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,630
Master,

135
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,240
Let's go.

136
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,440
Ziwu, let's go first.

137
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,600
Yanying,

138
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,000
hang in there. Miaomiao,

139
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,360
hang in there.

140
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,840
I feel like I can't do it anymore.

141
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,000
Don't be silly.

142
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,080
You can do it. Hold on,

143
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,840
Miaomiao. Hold on.

144
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,270
Okay?

145
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,000
Miaomiao.

146
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,480
You.

147
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:53,670
Do you remember the girl I mentioned last time?

148
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,480
That girl,

149
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,120
that's you.

150
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,320
We might not be able to get out.

151
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,000
So,

152
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,910
I want to tell you.

153
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,630
I love you.

154
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,390
Old Priest,

155
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,240
send Young Master back quickly.

156
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,550
What about you?

157
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,960
Without removing the Yin and Yang Dao,

158
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,360
our entire Zerg will never have peace.

159
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,840
Chief Priest,

160
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,120
we've suffered heavy casualties.

161
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,630
Why don't you go back and recharge your energy and fight another day?

162
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,600
Junren Fengchen's Yin and Yang paths in the altar

163
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,080
have also been severely weakened.

164
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,270
This is our last chance.

165
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,550
We can't forget the dead members of Xue's clan.

166
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,750
Guarding the altar is my mission.

167
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,440
I have to finish it,

168
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,440
Chief Priest,

169
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,240
Go back!

170
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,390
Clan Leader can't live without you

171
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,200
Uncle Borigu,

172
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,880
Give this to Clan Leader.

173
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,310
We belong to Zerg.

174
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,440
He asked us to stay.

175
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,070
I'll fight with you.

176
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,110
Thank you.

177
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
And your father.

178
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:58,960
Brothers,

179
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,200
Chief Priest,

180
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,830
We fear the gods of the sun and the moon,

181
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,240
we guard the Thousand Worm Altar,

182
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,550
We fear the gods of the sun and the moon,

183
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,720
we guard the Thousand Worm Altar,

184
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,000
Kill

185
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,440
See you in the next life.

186
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
Chief Priest.

187
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,640
Chief Priest,

188
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,160
Young Master,

189
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,830
I'm sorry,

190
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,880
Chief Priest,

191
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,790
I failed to

192
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,680
help the dead,

193
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,480
Destroy Yin and Yang.

194
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,960
Xue Zimo,

195
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,750
wait for me.

196
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,960
Chief Priest.

197
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,000
This is what you Zerg are capable of, isn't it?

198
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,070
Really?

199
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,680
Pan Jun,

200
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,550
look.

201
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,270
When the wilderness meets the civilization,

202
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,480
it's so vulnerable.

203
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,830
Mr. Fengchen.

204
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,440
Why are you here?

205
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,960
Mr. Jin sent someone to support you.

206
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,160
Why did you call them here?

207
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,440
What about my lab?

208
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,310
What about my subject?

209
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,590
Let them go.

210
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,510
Get out of the way.

211
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:10,960
Fengchen Jun,

212
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,270
if you don't let Pan Jun go first today,

213
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,550
I'll kill your investor.

214
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,240
Mr. Jin,

215
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,000
please talk to your precious son.

216
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,680
Do you hear me?

217
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,510
Fengchen Jun,

218
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,030
I suggest you go back

219
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,680
to your lab.

220
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:48,960
If we can't

221
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
leave here safely today.

222
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,270
I'll blow up your lab.

223
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,720
Where's Ziwu?

224
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,400
Has anyone seen Ziwu?

225
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,440
Has anyone seen Ziwu?

226
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
There's someone alive.

227
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,750
Doctor,

228
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,480
Ziwu ran away,

229
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,240
Yes, the Zerg did it.

230
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,160
Ziwu ran away.

231
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,720
What about my experiment?

232
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,000
My work,

233
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,480
Toyotomi Jun,

234
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,640
Fengchen Jun,

235
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,270
Fengchen Jun,

236
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,350
I have an idea.

237
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,480
I have a new plan.

238
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,400
Bring everyone here!

239
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,750
But Doctor,

240
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,270
I'm afraid we don't have enough people now.

241
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,510
Count him in.

242
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,550
Doctor,

243
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,590
Doctor,

244
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,480
Doctor,

245
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,160
Be good,

246
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,880
I beg you.

247
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,160
Be good,

248
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,550
No.

249
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:23,880
Be good,

250
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,830
Give me another chance.

251
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,750
Be good,

252
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:26,960
Take him away.

253
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,790
Doctor,

254
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,590
Doctor,

255
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,310
Doctor,

256
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,590
Doctor,

257
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,350
Doctor.

258
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,200
The high priest is full of pride,

259
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,680
why are the gods in the sky,

260
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,680
Why don't you bless our Xue family?

261
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,720
If the gods in heaven

262
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,400
can't bless our Xue family for thousands of years.

263
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,350
From now on,

264
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,830
I will be my own God.

265
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,550
Open the granary

266
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,550
to comfort all the warriors of Xue clan.

267
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,310
Yes

268
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,400
You're back.

269
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,400
Yan Ying,

270
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,680
Pan Jun,

271
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,270
Are you okay?

272
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,440
Pan Jun

273
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,400
I've made you suffer,

274
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,720
bro. I'm fine.

275
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,720
No matter how Fengchen Jun tortures me,

276
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,310
I've never been soft.

277
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,070
By the way, this is my master,

278
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,960
Senior Feng,

279
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,400
Are you Pan Jun?

280
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,680
Most of the heroes are the youth ones.

281
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,590
You flatter me.

282
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,790
By the way,

283
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,240
how is it going at the Thousand Worm Altar?

284
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,200
The Thousand Worm Altar

285
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,350
was almost destroyed by Fengchen Jun.

286
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,880
But fortunately, we got the river stone,

287
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,830
but,

288
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,000
Chief Priest Xue passed away

289
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,400
to protect us.

290
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,750
Senior Feng,

291
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,200
as long as Fengchen Jun doesn't die,

292
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,310
He'll start a bloody storm.

293
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,270
You're right.

294
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,550
Pan Jun,

295
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,030
let my master take care of the wounded first,

296
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,030
We have to go back again.

297
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,750
Yaxin Pharmaceutical's lab,

298
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,960
why did you go back to the lab?

299
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,960
This Fengchen Jun is a thief,

300
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,440
and even though these women workers were rescued,

301
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,550
But the germs are still in the lab,

302
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,510
so he will try his best

303
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,200
to find the next one,

304
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,680
Besides, other than that,

305
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,000
he's been studying,

306
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,200
How to use insects

307
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,000
to spread the most incurable diseases.

308
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,590
and infected those innocent women workers

309
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,110
with yellow fever,

310
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,110
We can't leave Pan Jun alone.

311
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,830
There are too many bacteria and insects in this lab,

312
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,680
If we don't kill it,

313
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,200
I'm afraid the plague in the Northern Zhou Dynasty

314
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,440
will repeat itself again.

315
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,350
The glorious God of the Sun and Moon,

316
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,240
Your child, Xue Zifeng,

317
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,200
has fulfilled his mission.

318
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,400
Please allow us

319
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,550
to sing for him for the last time.

320
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,350
For his

321
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,510
Doctor of Dance,

322
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,550
We've got them back.

323
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,590
Lock them in the same room.

324
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,400
The pipes should be smooth.

325
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,830
Sealing conditions should be better.

326
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,480
My work,

327
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,160
My master,

328
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,070
everything I have,

329
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,030
I see.

330
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,240
Let go of me!

331
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:45,790
Let's go!

332
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,640
Let go of me!

333
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,070
Let go of me!

334
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,640
Let go of me!

335
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,350
Let us go.

336
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,880
You, Yanyun Xiao'e,

337
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,070
you three go and save the female worker.

338
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,720
Yan Ying and I will go find Fengchen Jun.

339
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,310
I'll go with you.

340
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,590
I'll be distracted if you're here.

341
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,240
Don't worry. My mother will take care of us.

342
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,000
All right, split up.

343
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,240
Fengchen Junziwu

344
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,030
has run away.

345
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,240
These experiments of yours

346
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,960
can only end in failure.

347
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,590
In Shangfeng's eyes,

348
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,240
you're really worthless.

349
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,310
I feel sorry for you.

350
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,440
Kim So-mi,

351
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,350
you did nothing to save her,

352
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,350
Let the Xue family and I fight at the Thousand Worms Altar.

353
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,030
You connived at your son and daughter

354
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,400
and saved Ziwu.

355
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,160
Aren't you afraid that Shangfeng will blame you?

356
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,480
What's there to be afraid of?

357
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:51,960
My medicine,

358
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,720
to save your life.

359
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,640
But you pulled the tiger away from the mountain.

360
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,720
Kim So-mi,

361
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,270
you're such a terrible woman.

362
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,640
but

363
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,350
Have you forgotten who I am?

364
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,110
I'm Fengchen Jun.

365
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,350
In my dictionary,

366
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,160
there is no such word as failure.

367
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,590
Do you know what this is?

368
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,070
This is a collection of all my biochemical germs,

369
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,680
and it's also my most proud work.

370
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,200
You're out of your mind.

371
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,310
This kind of viral hemorrhagic fever

372
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,920
can make people feel miserable.

373
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,680
In 48 hours,

374
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,550
the infected host will die a horrible death.

375
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,030
The patient first had internal bleeding,

376
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,200
and then died of bleeding from his seven orifices.

377
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,750
And this pathogen is also airborne.

378
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,030
As long as there is one person,

379
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,350
he will destroy the whole town.

380
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,350
However,

381
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,440
as long as one person can get through it,

382
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,680
Then he is the rudiment of Master of Human Resources and Grass.

383
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,830
I'll give him a lot of antibodies,

384
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,270
and I'll give him the best medicine in the world.

385
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:01,110
Let him be the key to the Zerg treasure.

386
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,720
You've already lost the Heluo Stone.

387
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,000
It's no use even if there's a grass master,

388
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,510
you can't get the Zerg treasure.

389
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,070
How did you know that?

390
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,920
Don't you believe me?

391
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,880
I'm Fengchen Jun.

392
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,590
Don't you believe me?

393
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,070
Pan Jun,

394
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:17,790
Pan Jun,

395
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,550
What are you doing?

396
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,270
Open the door!

397
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,510
You're crazy, Pan Jun.

398
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,480
Pan Jun, are you crazy?

399
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,240
Open the door, Pan Junfeng,

400
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,110
Chen Jun,

401
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,790
You don't have to be alarmist here.

402
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,920
Your virus won't spread widely at all.

403
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,000
This virulent virus

404
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,590
is too virulent.

405
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,440
People will die faster.

406
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,070
So he doesn't have the conditions and time for infection.

407
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,880
As expected of Pan Jun,

408
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,350
this concern is the same as mine.

409
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,440
But my virus is filamentous. Under the microscope,

410
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,350
it is like a butterfly

411
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,030
that wants to spread its wings.

412
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:06,920
Even centrifuges

413
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,960
can't separate their molecules.

414
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,510
So,

415
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,280
once the subject is injected,

416
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,590
Their blood,

417
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,000
saliva secretions and even breathing,

418
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,960
You can spread my work.

419
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,280
Have you ever heard of food chain?

420
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,800
Larger fish devour the smaller ones,

421
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,480
wolves devour the sheep,

422
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,110
In my world, those who die

423
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,510
are at the bottom of the food chain.

424
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,000
And I, Fengchen Jun,

425
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,030
am the predator of all of you.

426
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,400
Let me give you a piece of advice.

427
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,150
The higher you climb,

428
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,360
the worse you fall.

429
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,760
Put the gun down if you want to live.

430
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,440
Listen up, all of you.

431
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,190
Once the virus spreads, none of us can escape.

432
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,440
Put the gun down!

433
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,480
Raise your gun.

434
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,150
Jerk!

435
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,190
Release her.

436
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,960
What's the use of talking so much?

437
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,070
Now you see,

438
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,960
Victory is still on my side.

439
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,550
Tell me.

440
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,030
Fengchen Jun.

441
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,550
I actually feel

442
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,630
sorry for you,

443
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,070
I know you.

444
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,000
Your father committed suicide on the battlefield?

445
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,920
And soon your mother abandoned you.

446
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,110
You've been lacking love since you were little.

447
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,920
You've never enjoyed the same happiness as others.

448
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,070
So you are selfish and self-interested.

449
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,230
You're headstrong,

450
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,440
and you even

451
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,710
shut yourself up in a small space.

452
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,190
Because you don't want to be weak

453
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,030
like your father,

454
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,880
But I'm telling you, Fengchen Jun.

455
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,760
No matter how great your work is,

456
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,630
how great a scientist you want to be.

457
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,230
Even a doctor.

458
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,230
You have to forget the past.

459
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,880
I thought.

460
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:17,190
I thought I was just interested in you.

461
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,030
I didn't expect that you know me so well.

462
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,110
You also think I'm a genius, don't you?

463
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,840
You are also afraid that my medical skills will surpass yours.

464
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,710
Am I right?

465
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,110
I'm telling you, Fengchen Jun,

466
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,480
if you want to be a doctor,

467
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,710
You have to be a person first.

468
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,280
You liar!

469
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,440
You're just afraid that your medical skills are not as good as mine.

470
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,320
Am I right?

471
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,710
how

472
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,590
You can't compare with medical skills,

473
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,400
so you're using such dirty tricks?

474
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,280
Okay,

475
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,590
Okay.

476
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,670
What are you doing?

477
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,710
Before you die,

478
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,510
I want you to see my work

479
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,550
with your own eyes.

480
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,000
Miaomiao,

481
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,320
Pan Jun locked himself inside.

482
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,590
Pan Jun. Brother Pan.

483
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,800
Pan Jun,

484
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,440
open the door!

485
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,670
Open the door, Pan Jun.

486
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,670
Pan Jun,

487
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,150
Take a look.

488
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,960
No one can destroy my work.

489
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,920
Pan Jun, open the door!

490
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,590
Come on,

491
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,000
come on,

492
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:20,960
Pan Jun,

493
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,150
come on.

494
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,630
Pan Jun,

495
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,320
you saved people to prove that you are highly skilled in medicine,

496
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,920
I killed people to challenge the limits of medicine.

497
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,400
Why do you always go against me?

498
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,280
Why do you want to be against me?

499
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,840
Why?

500
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,880
Why?

501
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:05,880
Pan Jun,

502
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,590
Brother Pan, come out.

503
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,360
Is that all you got?

504
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,000
Shoot!

505
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,230
Every breath and every drop of blood I take now

506
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,550
is a lethal poison,

507
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,670
Shoot!

508
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,440
Shoot!
