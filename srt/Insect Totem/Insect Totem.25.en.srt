1
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,960
Jiacheng,

2
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,000
Shuai

3
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,280
Tell Hu Shan

4
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,879
Kun Cheng that something happened,

5
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,800
I can't attend

6
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,639
his wedding.

7
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:30,520
Okay,

8
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,400
don't worry, coach.

9
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,759
I'll pass it on to the battalion commander.

10
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,439
Pan Jun,

11
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:45,159
is the side dish to your taste?

12
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,280
Not bad. It tastes good,

13
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,840
but it's a little spicy.

14
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,240
Why are you pinching me?

15
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,840
I haven't eaten all day.

16
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,240
You said you have a clever trick,

17
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,199
can you tell us now?

18
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:09,439
Because of the pressure of Wanhu Mountain's army,

19
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,599
you can't take care of yourself, right?

20
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,039
We can help you destroy Wanhu Mountain.

21
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,919
How are you going

22
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,680
to destroy Wan Hu Mountain?

23
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,599
I've asked Yan Yun

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,319
about the customs here,

25
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,280
When I was picking up my daughter-in-law,

26
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,159
I wanted to have a meal at your mother's house,

27
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,840
Then I can pick up this daughter-in-law.

28
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,360
So you mean,

29
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,960
at this wedding banquet,

30
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,840
let me put it this way, Old Man,

31
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,039
Where is Wan Jiajun?

32
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,280
It depends on the courage of Wanhushan.

33
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,560
Wan Jiacheng's plan,

34
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,000
as long as at the wedding banquet,

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,039
Let's catch the thief and catch the king first.

36
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,319
Then what?

37
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,479
We can find a few people,

38
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,240
cooperate with Mr. Jin's men,

39
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,599
Meet us outside.

40
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,280
As soon as you fire the gun here,

41
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,599
they can go to the battalion commander's mansion.

42
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,959
I was caught off guard.

43
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,360
I don't trust Kim So Mei's people.

44
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,160
The Wan Family Army has a lot of combat experience,

45
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,720
and it won't easily retreat when it's one against ten.

46
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,720
Although you have many troops,

47
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,600
you may not be able to win quickly.

48
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,519
Boss Jin

49
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,120
is also a force.

50
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,199
Tell me,

51
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,680
what are your conditions?

52
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,879
Very happy.

53
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,839
Let me get straight to the point.

54
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,759
One,

55
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,879
You can't trouble Boss Jin

56
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,519
anymore. His family has been reunited.

57
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,639
With Mr. Jin's character,

58
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,120
she won't come to you again.

59
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,920
This one,

60
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,680
I can accept it.

61
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,720
Good two-man

62
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,920
teacher,

63
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,240
I hope when my father comes back,

64
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,160
he'll let us test the herbalist,

65
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,839
Your father,

66
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,079
Gao Huaiyuan,

67
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,759
who scolded Wan Jiajun in the newspaper,

68
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,040
Grandpa,

69
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,839
we have to control the trial of Master of Human Resources and Grassland.

70
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,079
we

71
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,360
We can't let more people die because of this.

72
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,079
Okay,

73
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,279
This condition,

74
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,279
I can barely

75
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,560
accept it.

76
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,399
The last one,

77
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
the last one,

78
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,360
Treasure.

79
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,480
You're finally getting to the point

80
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,720
of sharing the treasure with me.

81
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,120
Let me tell you,

82
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,480
I can still hold this

83
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,800
Hongmen Banquet without you.

84
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,120
But without us,

85
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,600
do you have a secret treasure and Heluo Stone?

86
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,480
Tremella fuciformis,

87
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,120
bacon,

88
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
Ham?

89
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,800
Why are there vermicelli?

90
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,480
Wan Jiacheng,

91
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,519
do you really think Miss Yan Yun

92
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,040
is an ignorant peasant woman?

93
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,360
You asked me to bring these things to propose marriage,

94
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,759
so that no one would call me a bumpkin.

95
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,160
Even Di Lisha,

96
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,519
I bought two diamonds for him.

97
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,160
Battalion Commander,

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,160
the poor victims in Ba Song

99
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,120
are eating bark and grass roots to feed their hunger.

100
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,079
Wan Jiacheng,

101
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,680
stop pretending to be a living Bodhisattva.

102
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,839
How many people did you and the old man hurt?

103
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,360
Do you think I don't know?

104
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,519
Battalion Commander,

105
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,360
you know,

106
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,560
You married the granddaughter of the leader of Ba Song.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,639
The people of Ba Song are watching.

108
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,800
People's hearts are great,

109
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:20,879
if you take these delicacies,

110
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,879
Rinluo went to marry her in silks and satins,

111
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,199
which seemed to be a cliche,

112
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,839
You even let the people blame us.

113
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,279
You know,

114
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,759
your wedding.

115
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:31,079
It's not our family's celebration.

116
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,759
It's a festival in the whole city of Ba Song.

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,839
Yes.

118
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
What you said makes sense.

119
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,680
Battalion Commander.

120
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,279
Battalion Commander.

121
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,519
Battalion Commander,

122
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,879
there's an urgent call from Kuncheng.

123
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,439
Commander Wan sent a telegram. Stop nagging

124
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,720
and tell me about

125
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,759
the demagogic Gao Huaiyuan.

126
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,079
He's coming to Ba Song soon.

127
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,439
Many reporters

128
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,959
asked him to meet in Ba Song.

129
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,319
What they mean is to take him.

130
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,519
Since Mr. Gao is coming,

131
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,480
don't let him go.

132
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,559
Uncle Ouyang,

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,840
get Pan Jun back.

134
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,480
Did something happen?

135
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,000
From London,

136
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,960
Gao Huaiyuan will come to Ba Song tomorrow afternoon.

137
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,799
Uncle Pan Yingxuan,

138
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,759
that's great.

139
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,399
Mr. Jin's illness has finally been saved.

140
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,279
Go now.

141
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,639
You're sure Wan Jiacheng

142
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,120
will follow this path.

143
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,919
Even if you're anxious, I'm anxious.

144
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,799
But we have to find Wan Jiacheng.

145
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,799
Talk to him.

146
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,200
Wan Jiacheng not only holds the military power,

147
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,360
but also is no worse than Fengchen Jun in terms of tactics.

148
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,519
Without him,

149
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,120
our plan would be a bit difficult.

150
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
It's not the way to wait like this.

151
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
We can go to him.

152
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,759
This is the safest place.

153
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,320
What can I get you, sir?

154
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,519
Speak of the devil.

155
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,159
You guys buy it first.

156
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,159
I'll go and have a look.

157
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:50,919
Yes.

158
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,879
Do you think this place is safe?

159
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,000
I can't help you anymore.

160
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,679
Get out of Ba Song.

161
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,039
Go as far away as possible.

162
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,440
Brother Pan and Sister Miao,

163
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,360
Uncle Ouyang asked me to ask you to go back

164
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,279
and park the car.

165
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,399
Jiacheng

166
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,159
How is the wedding banquet going in the mansion?

167
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,600
Where are you going?

168
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,159
The old man called me

169
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,840
and asked me to pick someone up at the station.

170
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,279
I'll go with you.

171
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,240
Don't... He told me

172
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,679
I'm the only one who can go,

173
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,679
When you go to Ouyang Mansion to propose marriage,

174
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,120
you have to be prepared.

175
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,480
Don't embarrass me.

176
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:57,679
Drive.

177
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,799
I told you,

178
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,279
my father won't be late.

179
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,639
Didn't you just tell me you were here?

180
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,679
As long as my father comes back,

181
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,159
I hope

182
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,960
Boss Jin will be saved too.

183
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,080
I dare not say 100%,

184
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,120
high probability,

185
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,559
There's a high probability that you can do it.

186
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,759
Your father

187
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,759
The Wan Family Army is after him.

188
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,759
My father is not a good doctor.

189
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,440
What kind of scholar is he?

190
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,759
It doesn't make money and offend people.

191
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:51,960
No way.

192
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,000
I have to save him.

193
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,000
I haven't seen him yet.

194
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,120
Then he was taken away again.

195
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,120
Don't wander around. Sit down,

196
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,879
Senior Yanlei.

197
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:05,840
I think,

198
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,600
how about Luo Xiu and Yan Ying stay here?

199
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,720
I'll protect you and Boss Jin.

200
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,720
Okay. Let's get ready.

201
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,559
Let's go.

202
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,440
Be careful. It's hot.

203
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,120
Yan Ying

204
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,440
I've been so happy lately.

205
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,399
I can see you and your father every day

206
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,679
as soon as I open my eyes,

207
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,720
Why do I feel like I'm dreaming?

208
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,519
Except for your sister,

209
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,879
I really have nothing to worry about.

210
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,879
If Mother is really good,

211
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,279
let's go to the Northern Zhou Dynasty as a family, okay?

212
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,399
I don't think about swords and swords anymore.

213
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,960
Stop thinking about hating

214
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,120
you and me,

215
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,679
Your sister and your father,

216
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,840
we are a family.

217
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,120
and live a peaceful life.

218
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,120
What are you doing?

219
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,559
Making candied haws.

220
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,320
It's for your father.

221
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,320
That's right.

222
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,039
Of course it's yours too.

223
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,720
There are no tools here.

224
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,840
When there's a chance,

225
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,399
I'll cook it for you every day.

226
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,320
Okay.

227
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,600
Your daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law

228
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,679
are about to meet your father-in-law.

229
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
How do you feel?

230
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,799
I don't know.

231
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,759
My father is very approachable,

232
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,600
didn't Uncle Yanlei also say that?

233
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,559
So,

234
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,759
don't be afraid.

235
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,600
I'm here.

236
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,159
Do you want to have a try?

237
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,320
Let me try.

238
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,799
It's easy.

239
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,279
Come on. I'll hold it for you.

240
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:46,360
Here you are.

241
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:54,639
Yes.

242
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,320
Not bad.

243
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:49,799
One string is done.

244
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,240
Battalion Commander,

245
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,679
everything is ready.

246
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,360
Let them dress up as your men.

247
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,559
I'm at your disposal.

248
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,200
Yes.

249
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,279
Battalion Commander,

250
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,159
this is the door.

251
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,200
Pan Yingxuan can't get through it,

252
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,399
do you know what my father said?

253
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:34,639
Don't shoot!

254
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,000
The commander-in-chief

255
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:39,639
cherishes his people,

256
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,679
What do you mean by cherishing the people?

257
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,799
He was afraid of alarming the reporters,

258
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,080
I heard that reporters at home and abroad

259
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,080
are staring at the documents on Pan Yingxuan,

260
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,639
As soon as it's exposed,

261
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,879
what we've done in Ba Song all these years,

262
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,320
Then the whole world will know.

263
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,360
Battalion Commander,

264
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,240
does that mean Pan Yingxuan is staying at Xian Hengtai Restaurant?

265
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,120
Meet those reporters.

266
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,240
Then detain those reporters

267
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,079
from Hyeong-tae Xian,

268
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,440
It can't be detained or killed.

269
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,359
Those are the reporters of Shenbao and Ta Kung Pao.

270
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,440
If you kill them,

271
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,240
We will lose in public opinion.

272
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:13,640
Listen,

273
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,200
from now on,

274
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,200
All the books, newspapers, magazines

275
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
and broadcasts in Ba Song City

276
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,160
are not allowed to mention this matter.

277
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,000
I don't care about the reporters from Northern Zhou and Kuncheng,

278
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,400
but your land is divided into three parts,

279
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,240
Guard it.

280
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:32,799
Yes.

281
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,480
According to the telegram,

282
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,359
this is Mr. Pan's route back to Ba Song tomorrow,

283
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,799
Mr. Pan is a thorn in Wan Jiajun's side,

284
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,799
a thorn in his side,

285
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,200
Wanhu Mountain

286
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:45,559
will set up ambushes at every location tomorrow.

287
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,680
In the battle tomorrow,

288
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:51,079
I must save my father.

289
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,480
You must know that if you fail,

290
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,680
the Wan Family Army will come out,

291
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,160
When the time comes, it won't be just Ba Song,

292
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:01,799
Ouyang Family,

293
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,200
Even the Zerg

294
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,400
might be wiped out.

295
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,799
Grandpa,

296
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,119
Senior Lei Yun,

297
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,880
So we can only succeed,

298
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,599
not fail.

299
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,599
Sit down first.

300
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,000
They're all here.

301
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,640
They are all young and promising.

302
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,079
Sit down,

303
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,559
Tomorrow,

304
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,519
I'll negotiate with Wan Jiajun here,

305
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,559
I'll use the Zerg treasure as bait,

306
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,480
check and balance their wolf ambitions,

307
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,720
Kids,

308
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,680
Nephew Yingxuan,

309
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,000
For the sake of the Zerg,

310
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,680
we saved Yingxuan,

311
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,599
is to save Ba Song

312
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,440
Jun'er,

313
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,400
Your father will be very happy to see that

314
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,559
you are so young and promising.

315
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,119
Let's toast the Zerg.

316
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,759
To Senior Lei Yun.

317
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,039
To nephew Yingxuan,

318
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,480
a penny and a big bowl of tea.

319
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,000
-Big bowl of tea. -Big bowl of tea. A penny. A

320
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,799
big bowl

321
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,640
of tea.

322
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,039
A bowl for a penny.

323
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:57,839
Mr. Gao,

324
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,839
your son asked me to pick you up.

325
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:03,799
I'm sorry.

326
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,880
You mistook me for someone else.

327
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,079
Mr. Gao,

328
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,000
This one

329
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,759
Your son Pan Jun made it for you.

330
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,279
Senior,

331
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,680
why didn't you see Miss Yan Yun?

332
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,039
Just let me handle this kind of big thing.

333
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,799
Girls

334
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,279
are shy,

335
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,240
It doesn't matter if you don't see him.

336
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:41,680
Okay,

337
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,559
Senior,

338
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,680
what we talked about yesterday,

339
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:46,799
What do you think?

340
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,240
That depends on the sincerity of the man.

341
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,519
Senior, happy.

342
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,960
What our coach means is,

343
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,559
Ba Song will continue to be led by you.

344
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,480
In addition, from Bamen Mountain to Langshui,

345
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,079
you are in charge.

346
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,240
Our coach said,

347
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,200
Young General has wronged you,

348
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,960
But it's up to you to decide the organizational system.

349
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,799
No matter how many men, horses,

350
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,319
guns and ammunition you hire,

351
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,640
It's all settled by Kun City.

352
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,039
Stop right there!

353
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,319
What are you doing?

354
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:28,559
Let's go.

355
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,039
Boss,

356
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,200
please take a look.

357
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,480
Sir,

358
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:44,960
I can't spend the money.

359
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,240
Boss,

360
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,400
how much is the twist?

361
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,119
Copies are available for 100 yuan each.

362
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,599
How much did those two soldiers pay you?

363
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,119
Don't mention it.

364
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,759
15 or a ticket?

365
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:55,599
If it's not our money,

366
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,680
I can't spend it at all.

367
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,680
Then why do you want 100 yuan from me?

368
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,599
I... I'm leaving,

369
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,400
okay?

370
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,279
You can't leave.

371
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,279
I don't believe the soldiers of the Wanjia Army are buying and selling.

372
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,759
Are you being unreasonable?

373
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,279
Wanjia Army is buying and selling,

374
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,519
He even said you were all useless.

375
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:07,720
Exactly

376
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,759
I don't even dare to take care of it.

377
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,319
Who said we forced them to buy and sell?

378
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,119
After Wan Jiajun took over Ba Song City,

379
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,680
we've decided how much it's worth

380
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,960
for more than 30 years.

381
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,160
The Minister of Justice has the final say in Ba Song City,

382
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,680
who is your Wan Family Army?

383
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm tired of living. Push me again.

384
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,720
I pushed you today.

385
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,799
Shoot me if you can.

386
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:24,759
Come on.

387
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,039
Do you think I dare not?

388
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Stop arguing. We still have a mission.

389
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:32,160
If I hadn't been on a mission today,

390
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,880
I would have put you in a lot of trouble.

391
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,720
What are you talking about?

392
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,599
Stop fighting!

393
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:42,680
Stop fighting!

394
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,039
Stop fighting. We still

395
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,720
have a mission.

396
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,759
Stop fighting!

397
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,839
Stop fighting!

398
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,039
Stop fighting!

399
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,279
Senior,

400
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,000
look here,

401
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,359
This is an urgent delivery from Kun City today.

402
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,359
The Third Division should guard Zhu City.

403
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,359
It's the northwest gate of Kun City,

404
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,000
and Zhu Cheng's tax revenue for the whole year is here.

405
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:09,400
But

406
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:11,200
starting next year,

407
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,480
You have to collect it yourself.

408
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,079
Let's talk about the treasure.

409
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,839
What our coach means is,

410
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,200
once the treasure is opened,

411
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,119
You account for 30%.

412
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,359
Recently, Yan Yun is not feeling well,

413
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,880
about this marriage,

414
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,720
Let's talk about it next year.

415
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,200
The marriage can be postponed.

416
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,480
But we can't postpone the opening of the treasure.

417
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,759
In that case,

418
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:47,880
Senior,

419
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,200
Tell me the proportion.

420
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:02,519
How about a 40-60 split?

421
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,720
A 50-50 split,

422
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,319
This is the bottom line of the coach.

423
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,319
According to the new rules,

424
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,319
you have to sign Miss Yan Yun's name.

425
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,960
Our battalion commander

426
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,720
is going to the government to file a case.

427
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,039
Congratulations, Senior Lei Yun.

428
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,920
Sir,

429
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,279
come inside

430
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,279
and have some food.

431
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,519
Sir, are you getting in?

432
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:34,839
Sit down

433
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,079
-Go to Xianhengtai Restaurant. -Okay. You

434
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,920
two can

435
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:26,599
go there.

436
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,440
Come with me.

437
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,200
Let's go.

438
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,640
Xiao'e, run!

439
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,119
Miss,

440
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:18,759
who are you?

441
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,559
Senior Yingxuan,

442
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,599
I'm the daughter of Shi Shiyu, a gentleman of Water System,

443
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,880
Shi Miaomiao

444
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,119
Uncle Yanlei sent us Zerg juniors

445
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,759
to protect your safety.

446
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,559
You are.

447
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,160
Shi Shiyu's daughter.

448
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,559
Now that Ba Song City is under martial law,

449
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,119
let's go back to Ouyang Mansion first,

450
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,599
We'll talk when everything is safe.

451
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,119
Okay,

452
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:50,000
If we want to leave those people behind,

453
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,880
we have to go to Hyeong-tae for a walk.

454
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:06,640
Gentlemen,

455
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,480
are you eating and drinking?

456
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,440
Keep eating. Keep eating.

457
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:29,200
Tell me where you hid the gunpowder?

458
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,759
How did you know that?

459
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,039
Are you trying to

460
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,920
hide it from Ouyang's spy in Ba Song?

461
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,000
Tell me where it is?

462
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,480
Under

463
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,759
the stove.

464
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,960
It's a crude piece of crap.

465
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,240
You don't care about it at all.

466
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,720
Come and add some ingredients to them.

467
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,319
The population here is heavy.

468
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:39,039
Go away! Go away!

469
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,359
Go.

470
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,240
Let's go!

471
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,039
Xiao'e,

472
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,799
you've added too much pepper.

473
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:28,279
You don't know if you don't cook.

474
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,839
In this Sichuan restaurant,

475
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,319
the ingredients are authentic,

476
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,240
I added lantern pepper, sky pepper

477
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,039
and seven-star pepper to the nitrocellulose,

478
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:37,359
And green pepper,

479
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,319
I don't think it's fun,

480
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:40,920
I also added two boxes of hot chili powder,

481
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,720
authentic Yunnan chili,

482
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,880
All right. Let's go.

483
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,720
Watch carefully.

484
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,359
Wan Jiajun will be here soon.

485
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,880
We have to find a way to get out of here.

486
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:02,559
Uncle Yingxuan,

487
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,279
nothing is safer than Ouyang Mansion.

488
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:06,640
But you have to give me your coat.

489
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,720
Yan Yun, what are you doing?

490
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,880
Wan Hushan doesn't dare to touch me,

491
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,200
you take Uncle Yingxuan away first,

492
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:12,200
You're from Ouyang Mansion,

493
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,079
I'm Ouyang Yanlei's daughter,

494
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,799
Yanlei's daughter,

495
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,599
you've grown up.

496
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,119
No way.

497
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,440
I can't let you take risks.

498
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,799
Uncle, we don't have time.

499
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,079
If this goes on, no one can leave.

500
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,400
Sorry for offending you.

501
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:29,839
Catch him!

502
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,599
Hurry up!

503
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:44,640
Trash,

504
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,079
I asked you to chase Pan Yingxuan,

505
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,359
Why are you chasing my fiancée?

506
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,960
Miss Yan Yun was wearing Pan Yingxuan's clothes,

507
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,160
and the fog was too heavy.

508
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,440
We can't see clearly either.

509
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,720
How dare you talk back?

510
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,400
Someone advised me not to pull out the gun all the time,

511
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,279
so I'll spare your life today.

512
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,599
You're such a loser,

513
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:11,160
yet you're wearing such a beautiful thing.

514
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:13,279
If the battalion commander likes it,

515
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,480
tell me,

516
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,759
I'll give it all to you.

517
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:17,880
Okay,

518
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,440
Then I'll leave this ring here today.

519
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:22,599
Guards, drag him down!

520
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:26,319
Battalion Commander! Battalion Commander,

521
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,640
Battalion Commander, please spare my life. I know I was wrong.

522
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,559
Battalion Commander.

523
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,160
Battalion Commander.

524
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,920
Battalion Commander,

525
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,839
although Pan Yingxuan didn't catch him,

526
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,000
But your marriage has been decided,

527
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,759
and it will be a good day in three days.

528
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,039
Calm down for a while. Your anger is hurting your health.

529
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,880
Today,

530
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,359
you said something normal.

531
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,800
Shuai

532
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:24,760
How is Jiacheng? Is everything going well?

533
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,199
Pan Yingxuan,

534
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,360
we didn't catch him.

535
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,159
I already know.

536
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,320
Jiacheng, I want to apologize to you

537
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,039
for not giving you this task.

538
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:39,159
I didn't inform you in time.

539
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,679
Jiacheng didn't do well,

540
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,679
and he hasn't had time to apologize to the coach.

541
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:45,599
Jiacheng

542
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,400
How's Hushan's marriage going?

543
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,039
Ouyang Leiyun has agreed

544
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,360
to our terms.

545
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
What do you think?

546
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,960
He's probably lying.

547
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:02,880
Okay, I trust your judgment.

548
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,400
Tell me what you think in time.

549
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:05,559
I'll call you as soon as

550
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:07,000
we get to the North Zhou Dynasty.

551
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,239
Yes, Mr. Shuai.

552
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,599
Jun'er.

553
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,719
Jun'er.

554
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,679
Jun'er,

555
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:55,920
Jun'er,

556
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,559
I'm sorry.

557
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,079
I'm sorry,

558
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,960
I haven't been by your side

559
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,960
all these years.

560
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,880
I'm really afraid of implicating you.

561
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,000
So I didn't dare to contact you.

562
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,480
You don't blame me.

563
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,440
I don't blame you.

564
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,719
Father,

565
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:33,079
I don't blame you.

566
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:35,840
According to what you taught me,

567
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,440
I'll treat those pneumonic plague patients.

568
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:42,480
I watched those patients ask me for help.

569
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:45,639
I'm thinking of you,

570
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,679
going to Lingcheng,

571
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:53,519
Those Xue people all said that thanks to your favor,

572
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:56,679
I don't want to let you down.

573
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,280
No matter how hard it was,

574
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,800
I made it to Ba Song,

575
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,840
Every time I want to eat candied haws,

576
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:08,039
to get your approval,

577
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:10,559
But I couldn't find you.

578
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:13,960
I can only cook for myself.

579
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,320
I ate

580
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,440
the candied haws you made,

581
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:25,079
It's delicious.

582
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,880
From now on,

583
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,079
you have to cook for me every day.

584
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:30,559
Okay?

585
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,559
Okay,

586
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:35,519
I heard that

587
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,559
today's rescue operation,

588
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,119
You're the commander-in-chief.

589
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:43,519
That's great.

590
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,719
You've grown up.

591
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,199
I'm very pleased.

592
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,639
I'm very pleased.

593
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,199
I won't leave anymore.

594
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:59,239
Stay by your side every day,

595
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,679
okay?

596
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:01,920
Okay.

597
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,440
Well, Pan Jun,

598
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,719
it's not easy to see me,

599
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,760
You should be happy.

600
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,719
Miss Shi,

601
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,920
I'm sorry,

602
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,360
Yingxuan was incompetent,

603
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,440
which made the current-style jade gentleman die in Bamen Mountain.

604
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:31,719
Today, I repay you with good for evil,

605
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:34,360
please accept Yingxuan's bow.

606
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:35,639
Senior Yingxuan,

607
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,880
I already know the truth.

608
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,800
You had no choice back then.

609
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:44,920
Miaomiao doesn't blame Mu Xi,

610
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,480
but only herself for her poor fortune,

611
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:51,079
All right,

612
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,119
my father will be your father from now on.

613
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

614
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,719
That's right.

615
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,159
Senior Ouyang Yanlei and Her Ladyship

616
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,800
are waiting for you outside Ba Song.

617
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
What did you say?

618
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:08,719
Yanlei and Xinmei

619
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:10,280
are both outside Ba Song City,

620
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,119
The Thousand Insects Bone Devouring Poison on Her Ladyship

621
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:12,800
is back.

622
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,960
You have to take a look.

623
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,320
After so many years,

624
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:17,559
the poison on Xinmei hasn't been detoxified yet,

625
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,440
I have to think of a way.

626
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:23,920
I'm the gentleman,

627
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,280
Come in

628
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:32,599
Gentleman, Wan Jiacheng,

629
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,639
an adjutant of the Wan Family Army, wants to see you.

630
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,320
He came in through the side door,

631
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:39,559
not the front door,

632
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,719
Let him in.

633
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,360
Yes.
