1
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,239
Ziwu, don't run!

2
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,319
I saw you.

3
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,840
Ziwu, you are very important now.

4
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,599
The pneumonic plague patients in North Zhou City depend on you.

5
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,400
Follow my advice and come with me.

6
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
To save people.

7
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,919
Say something, Ziwu.

8
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,080
Meridian

9
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,400
You're awake.

10
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,560
What's wrong with me?

11
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,840
What's wrong with me?

12
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,919
Dr. Pan is skilled in medical treatment,

13
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,639
the pollen of lotus leaves is poisonous,

14
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,039
It will make people fall into illusion.

15
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,759
Even bees that collect pollen from lotus leaves

16
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,080
will die quickly.

17
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
This is not only the big lotus,

18
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,919
but also the pollen of veratrum,

19
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,639
So Ziwu is an expert in medication.

20
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,800
Mrs. Matsui doesn't look like a lady

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,080
who even knows such a unique pharmacology knowledge.

22
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,759
Really?

23
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,400
I just read a few medical books when I was a child,

24
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:10,120
Doctor Pan, Doctor Pan,

25
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,240
Doctor Pan,

26
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,159
Brother Pan,

27
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,520
My brother's condition suddenly got worse.

28
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,560
I'm afraid I can't hold on.

29
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,000
Can you come with me to save him?

30
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,360
How could it get worse?

31
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,680
Where is he?

32
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
At Donglai Inn.

33
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,360
I'll ask Lin to take you back to Donglai Inn.

34
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,199
Leave the lunch to me.

35
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,240
Be careful.

36
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,639
Get out of the way.

37
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,000
Where is Zhenlong going?

38
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,879
Zhenlong,

39
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,719
what are you doing?

40
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,360
Passing by,

41
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,360
Stop!

42
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,800
Sure enough, it's yin and yang.

43
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,439
Master,

44
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,959
Master.

45
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,439
Master,

46
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,759
Master,

47
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,600
Master,

48
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,279
these animals,

49
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,000
I can't believe I did this to you.

50
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,319
Master,

51
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,240
Master,

52
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,199
Master,

53
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm sorry,

54
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,800
I'm late for lunch.

55
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,240
Silly boy,

56
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,199
get up.

57
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,120
Master,

58
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,920
according to your instructions,

59
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,480
He hid the secret treasure in Jifang Cove on Mount Fuzhou,

60
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,439
and never fell into the hands of others.

61
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,079
I want you

62
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,279
to go to North Zhou City to find someone,

63
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,600
He's a descendant of Pan Yingxuan, the Divine Physician of the Department of Wood.

64
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,800
His name is Pan Jun.

65
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,000
Pan Jun,

66
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,199
you know him?

67
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,680
I know him.

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,519
Pan Jun saved my life.

69
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,439
Okay.

70
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,399
Master wants you and Pan Jun

71
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,000
to go to Mount Fuzhou together,

72
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,519
Take back the secret treasure,

73
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,079
and you must find

74
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,959
the gold gentleman Jin Wu Yi

75
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,399
to invite him.

76
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,720
I'll testify for both of you.

77
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,759
I officially order you two

78
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,079
to be the new gentlemen of the Department of Earth and Wood.

79
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,720
Inherit their own secret treasures,

80
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,319
Master,

81
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,680
I can't do that.

82
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,199
You are a native gentleman.

83
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,319
Ziwu,

84
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:29,120
you're the only one who keeps the secret treasure of the earth,

85
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,439
Only then can the Zerg's righteousness be preserved.

86
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,560
Hurry up!

87
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,160
It'll be too late if you don't leave.

88
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,079
Let's go, kid.

89
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,720
Master,

90
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,879
there's someone sneaking in. Go and search!

91
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
How long has he had a fever?

92
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:14,800
I don't know.

93
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,360
I came to you as soon as I found out.

94
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,120
It should be a while.

95
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,079
Qi and blood are blocked, the blood is blocked,

96
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,199
and the fever is not going to recede.

97
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,480
But you can rest assured that

98
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,240
the pneumonic plague has completely recovered,

99
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,839
But these signs

100
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,199
are signs of poisoning.

101
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,360
Second grandpa,

102
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,560
second grandpa,

103
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
This is your own Poison

104
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,399
Ghost Beauty,

105
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,199
Poisoned with green silk,

106
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,879
the wound is tiny and nowhere to be seen.

107
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,120
Am I right?

108
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,240
Second grandpa,

109
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,600
there must be some misunderstanding.

110
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,720
Mu Qingsi,

111
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,360
I know it very well.

112
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,439
Duanwuri,

113
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,319
Department of Wood physicians used centipedes and snakes,

114
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,040
The ant cicada ghost beauty quenches the poison for the green silk,

115
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,959
and the person who is poisoned by this poison,

116
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,759
It's easy to attract all kinds of poisonous insects.

117
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,959
What else do you want to say?

118
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,680
It seems that my father was right.

119
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,279
The Fire and Wood Clans are very close,

120
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,559
and they even know how to quench the poison with the green silk of our Wood Clans.

121
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,480
You're Pan Yingxuan's son?

122
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,559
He is my father.

123
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,159
I'm also the only descendant of the Floragrims.

124
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,799
It seems that you and my father

125
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,399
are on good terms.

126
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,879
We're not friends,

127
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,960
it's just fate.

128
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,440
You're as cunning

129
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,679
as your father,

130
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,480
You're eloquent.

131
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,840
My father ran around to save people,

132
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,159
when the Cordyceps Hall was established,

133
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,120
It's also for free treatment for the people.

134
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,519
The whole North Zhou City loves him a lot.

135
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,000
He has devoted his whole life

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,159
to the study of intractable diseases.

137
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,519
How did I get to you?

138
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,000
He became a smooth talker.

139
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,399
Second grandpa,

140
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,360
the most important thing now is to cure Yan Ying quickly,

141
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,639
Can you ask Dr. Pan to treat him first?

142
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,639
Diagnosis and treatment.

143
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,279
I don't think Yan Ying has pneumonic plague at all.

144
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,919
He poisoned all of them.

145
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:26,720
It's impossible.

146
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,639
Second grandpa,

147
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,440
these days,

148
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,039
Pan Jun worked so hard for the pneumonic plague,

149
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,159
and as you know,

150
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,159
Yan Ying got this disease because of Yin and Yang,

151
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:35,919
Dr. Pan,

152
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,159
Could you please think about how to save my brother?

153
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,200
Others don't have a long way to go.

154
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,320
Let's explain it slowly.

155
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,600
Besides,

156
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,559
my Second Grandpa is not unreasonable,

157
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:47,919
The main thing is that Yan Ying

158
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,960
is not suffering from the normal malnutrition poison,

159
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,200
Otherwise, he would have woken up.

160
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,159
But fortunately, it's not pneumonic plague.

161
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,600
It's not contagious.

162
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,120
Keep an eye on him.

163
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,399
Now the whole city is catching people with high fever,

164
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:00,679
Otherwise,

165
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,519
he'll be locked up in quarantine again.

166
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,159
Those shrimp soldiers and crab generals from North Zhou City

167
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,480
still want to catch me?

168
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,039
Then.

169
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,840
How to treat my brother now?

170
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,919
I'll go back to Cordyceps Hall right now and give him a prescription.

171
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,320
I'll go with you,

172
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,320
Second Grandpa,

173
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,320
Don't go.

174
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,080
Stay here and protect Yan Ying.

175
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:28,840
Senior,

176
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,720
I don't care if you believe me or not.

177
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,519
But as a doctor,

178
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,600
it's my duty to treat patients and save them.

179
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,120
I will cure Yan Ying.

180
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,159
This kid is scheming.

181
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,480
In order to win your trust,

182
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,159
the script is quite complete.

183
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,120
Second grandpa,

184
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,720
you are always so opinionated,

185
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,639
Don't forget,

186
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,679
Pan Jun took Yan Ying

187
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,879
back from the King of Hell.

188
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,759
Besides,

189
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,960
when I met Pan Jun,

190
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,480
I didn't hide the identity of my Ouyang family at all.

191
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,960
If she wanted to kill her,

192
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,840
why did she wait until now?

193
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,519
He loves money as much as his life,

194
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,440
so he came to lie to you.

195
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,039
From the moment he saw you,

196
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:12,000
he invited you into the urn.

197
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,080
For what?

198
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,519
Isn't it just for our treasure?

199
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,159
Treasure! Treasure!

200
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,759
Since I was little,

201
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,639
You

202
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:26,279
How many people have been punished because of this rhetoric?

203
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,240
Even my father has suffered a lot.

204
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,320
Police! Stay where you are

205
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,080
when you're handling a case!

206
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,120
We received a report.

207
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,720
Someone here is infected with pneumonic plague.

208
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
We need to check it.

209
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:44,840
Search.

210
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:48,799
Did you see that?

211
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
As soon as Pan Jun left,

212
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,799
the police came.

213
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,559
Do you still believe him?

214
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,480
I received a report that

215
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,200
someone here is infected with pneumonic plague,

216
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,600
We have to take him away.

217
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,480
I'm here.

218
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,799
Try it.

219
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,799
If I dare to obstruct you again,

220
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:28,919
do you believe I'll be with you?

221
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,399
Yan Yun, take your brother with you.

222
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,759
Hurry up!

223
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:56,960
Over there.

224
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,559
Watch the steps.

225
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
Second grandpa.

226
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:03,720
This way.

227
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,799
Doctor Pan,

228
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:31,600
Madam of the board member,

229
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:34,600
You still can't find Ziwu?

230
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,879
I almost brought him back yesterday.

231
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,120
You let the police make a scene and hide again.

232
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,039
I don't know when I can find him.

233
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,279
You're acting recklessly now.

234
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,320
They arrested another group of people today.

235
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,759
It wasn't pneumonic plague

236
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,799
but he was forced to be sent to quarantine.

237
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,399
There's nothing we can do.

238
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,120
Now more and more people are infected,

239
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,759
so I have to make more drugs.

240
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,440
So that I can buy them some time.

241
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,120
In addition to going to Mount Fuzhou,

242
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,080
looking for Ghost Beauty,

243
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,360
I also need your poisonous insect.

244
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
My poisonous insect?

245
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,840
You raised those poisonous insects, didn't you?

246
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:20,720
What do you mean?

247
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,919
This kind of poisonous insect

248
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:25,840
is also called malnutrition.

249
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,720
Candles originated from clouds

250
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,200
must be taken good care of in order to survive.

251
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,879
We can't find it in the north.

252
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,720
But you've been looking for so many things overnight,

253
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,360
and,

254
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,159
When we first met,

255
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,759
you poisoned me with golden silkworm poison

256
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,279
and made me suffer from eye diseases.

257
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,679
Is there anything else I don't know?

258
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,840
The less you know,

259
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,200
the longer you live.

260
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,360
But these poisonous insects are very important

261
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,440
Miaomiao, Miaomiao,

262
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:03,080
Miaomiao, you have to help them.

263
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,320
Miaomiao,

264
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,320
Miaomiao, you have to help them.

265
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,480
You can't give them up.

266
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,519
Let go,

267
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,200
Miaomiao.

268
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,240
Miaomiao,

269
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,360
Miaomiao,

270
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,360
Do you want to see more couples get separated?

271
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,120
Miaomiao,

272
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,159
Miaomiao,

273
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,720
Miaomiao,

274
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:20,679
Your Ladyship,

275
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Is he soft-hearted to the enemy?

276
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,639
Please don't call me Madam.

277
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,799
Don't you like the name of Mrs. Matsui?

278
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,559
I'm just worried that you'll lose your identity.

279
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:41,120
The Zerg will kill you.

280
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,159
Don't worry,

281
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:43,879
the water system won't be

282
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:46,000
slaughtered like it was more than 20 years ago.

283
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,279
We need to find the Five Series Secret Treasure as soon as possible,

284
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,639
and help Shangfeng restart the treasure hunt.

285
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,320
As for the plague,

286
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:58,639
I hope you don't waste your time

287
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,000
on the dispensable people.

288
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,240
Mr. Matsui,

289
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,160
I'm grateful to Shangfeng for giving me the chance to take revenge.

290
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,200
But I, Shi Miaomiao

291
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,200
and Yaxin are not the same people,

292
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
You can do whatever it takes to achieve your goal.

293
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,400
He treats all life like dirt.

294
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,799
But I'm not.

295
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:31,720
Be good,

296
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,279
Thank you, Mrs. Matsui.

297
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,200
Miaomiao, you have to help them.

298
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,279
They can't be separated from each other.

299
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,240
Miaomiao,

300
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,200
please stop the car.

301
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,440
Even my father has to use poisonous insects to cure his illness.

302
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,559
What should we do?

303
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,759
This is

304
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:58,720
the Cloud Candle Poisonous Worm.

305
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:00,960
She feeds on Ghost Beauty.

306
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:02,599
Genuine goods at a fair price.

307
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:14,960
Thank you, Miaomiao.

308
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,160
The last few poisonous insects.

309
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,839
It's all here.

310
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,880
How should I thank you?

311
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,319
Me,

312
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:28,480
Me,

313
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,599
How about I treat you to candied haws?

314
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,200
I've brought you valuable poisonous insects.

315
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,920
Treat me to candied haws.

316
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,920
Don't look down on candied haws, okay?

317
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,799
When my father was here,

318
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:46,960
what I was looking forward to the most,

319
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,039
After he visits the hospital,

320
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,599
he can bring me a bunch of candied haws,

321
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,519
Your Floral Cordyceps Hall is so big,

322
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,880
it's not expensive food.

323
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,359
You don't understand.

324
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,920
My father said,

325
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:01,960
sweetness can't be common in life,

326
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,680
Think of it as a reward and a surprise.

327
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,599
If you get used to it,

328
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,599
you won't be able to suffer anymore.

329
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,119
So,

330
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:12,000
I'll treat you to candied haws.

331
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,480
You have to feel honored.

332
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,200
Go boil the medicine.

333
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,759
Yan Yun,

334
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,000
Yan Yun, what are you doing?

335
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,519
Yan Yun, what are you doing?

336
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,319
-Come with me. -What

337
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,960
do you mean?

338
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,319
This is our Zerg's business.

339
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,119
It has nothing to do with you.

340
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,279
I'm begging you.

341
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,119
Can you stop fighting?

342
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,480
Now that the pneumonic plague is rampant,

343
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,039
shouldn't you share the same enemy?

344
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,920
I'd love to,

345
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,839
but the fact that he poisoned my brother,

346
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:20,920
I haven't found out yet.

347
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,480
Aunt,

348
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:24,920
are you out of your mind?

349
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,960
Why would I poison your brother?

350
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,680
The police came as soon as the front foot left.

351
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,039
Who else could it be if it wasn't you?

352
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,839
I trusted you so much and you lied to me.

353
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,200
I'm begging you.

354
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,559
It hurts so much.

355
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:37,440
Can you let go of me?

356
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:49,319
Yan Yun,

357
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:49,920
Let's go.

358
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,519
Let's go.

359
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:53,720
Let go of me.

360
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,920
Don't think I haven't practiced martial arts,

361
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,920
I'm less energetic than you.

362
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,960
What tricks do you want to play again?

363
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,119
What trick am I playing?

364
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,480
Are you out of your mind?

365
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,440
The whole North Zhou City is waiting for me to save her life.

366
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,599
You only know how to save your brother.

367
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,519
Save your brother. Save your brother.

368
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:04,839
You,

369
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:06,319
What are you talking about? Shut up!

370
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:09,440
Miaomiao,

371
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,440
did you hear that?

372
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,119
I have to go with her to see her brother.

373
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,200
But all the people in North Zhou City are waiting for me.

374
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:18,640
We can't delay for a moment.

375
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,200
I'll give you a prescription,

376
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,680
and then write down the main items.

377
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,640
Take the poison bug

378
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,839
and the prescription to see Dr. Smith.

379
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,319
Get out of the way!

380
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,319
By the way, Miaomiao,

381
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:44,880
remember to take this prescription,

382
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,200
Make more medicines.

383
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,839
And send it to those poor people.

384
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,920
Thank you.

385
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:54,400
Go, go, go.

386
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,839
Thank you for your hard work.

387
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,799
Don't worry. What are you looking at?

388
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,240
I won't save your brother

389
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,240
if I leave.

390
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,599
Your second grandpa won't plead guilty anymore.

391
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:08,440
I'll leave it to you.

392
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,119
Goodbye.

393
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:38,279
Don't worry about me and keep up with them.

394
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,119
Yes.

395
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,480
Young master,

396
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,480
young master,

397
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,079
Young master,

398
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:54,920
young master,

399
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,079
We're back.

400
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:00,359
Young master.

401
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,200
What's going on?

402
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,599
Young master.

403
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,960
Up there.

404
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,200
According to Yan Ying's symptoms,

405
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,559
he is exactly the same as pneumonic plague.

406
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,799
Even the police wanted to isolate him.

407
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:47,640
We found a lot of doctors along the way,

408
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,920
and they all said it was pneumonic plague,

409
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,119
But you.

410
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,799
How did you find out he was poisoned?

411
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,799
I'm a doctor.

412
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:57,599
I'm a Zerg doctor,

413
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,680
and only Zerg doctors have seen the poison,

414
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,720
Have those quacks out there

415
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,200
seen such a strange poison?

416
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,039
Let me ask you,

417
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:05,319
did you get our Fire Department involved

418
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,200
because you wanted to find the Zerg treasure.

419
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,480
I want to find the treasure.

420
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,160
That's because my father told me that

421
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,920
he would come back the day the Zerg treasure was opened.

422
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,480
But I've never harmed anyone because of the treasure.

423
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:21,559
How could this happen?

424
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,440
Now that Yan Ying has poisoned his heart and lungs,

425
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,440
it should be caused by a long journey.

426
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,119
I don't have enough stuff with me.

427
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,519
I need three years of Xuan Cao,

428
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,839
so I have to go back to Cordyceps Hall.

429
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,440
No, you can't leave.

430
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,079
If you want to get it, I'll get it.

431
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:36,720
Do you know what Xuan Cao looks like?

432
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,559
It's a waste of time.

433
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:38,359
Don't move.

434
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:42,920
Are you coveting my Fire Department's secret treasure?

435
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,960
I don't even know

436
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
where the secret treasure of our department is.

437
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,160
Why am I still thinking about your Fire Department's secret treasure?

438
00:25:58,519 --> 00:25:59,440
Pan Jun.

439
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
Pan Jun.

440
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,359
Hurry up.

441
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,839
I really can't walk anymore.

442
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:18,839
Pan Jun,

443
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:19,799
come with me.

444
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:20,680
I have something urgent to do.

445
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,440
Hurry up!

446
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:22,480
I'm telling you,

447
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,079
you have to come back to North Zhou City with me.

448
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,559
I can't go back to Northern Zhou.

449
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,480
As soon as I got back, there were bad guys trying to catch me.

450
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,839
I asked those cops to come to you.

451
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,599
In the process of treating plague,

452
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,160
I found that only you can heal yourself.

453
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,440
Now all the people in North Zhou City,

454
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,880
are waiting for your help.

455
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,279
They are all waiting for me to save them.

456
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,960
If it's not Pan Jun,

457
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,640
my matter is also very important.

458
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,720
My master told me over and over again

459
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,240
that it's about the Zerg treasure.

460
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:46,920
Treasure.

461
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,200
You do have a partner.

462
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:51,079
I'm telling you, it's him. He took me away.

463
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:52,880
Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.

464
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,759
I'll find out about the poisoning.

465
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:58,039
Go back to Cordyceps Hall with me to get the medicine to save my brother,

466
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,200
Miss,

467
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,599
Pan Jun can't go with you,

468
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,960
my master has a Zerg event,

469
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,240
Let me finish it with Pan Jun.

470
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:06,519
Who is your master?

471
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:10,880
My master is a native gentleman Feng Wanchun

472
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:12,079
No,

473
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,880
Why does your master want to see us?

474
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,279
My master asked the two of us

475
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,799
to look for Senior Jin Wu Yi in Mount Fuzhou,

476
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,680
When we find it,

477
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,440
let him witness that we hold the secret treasures of each department,

478
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,759
To be a gentleman of all departments.

479
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,519
Where is Senior Jin?

480
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,240
I haven't found it yet.

481
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,400
Besides, I don't have the earth secret treasure with me.

482
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,839
But I know where it is.

483
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:32,960
You can take it out anytime.

484
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,079
So you didn't do anything, right?

485
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:36,839
How about this?

486
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,480
I'll go with you to find the secret treasure first,

487
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,160
Then we'll go to Old-timer Jin,

488
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:40,880
okay?

489
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,640
No way.

490
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,240
Life is at stake,

491
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,599
just take it as my Ouyang family begging you.

492
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,920
Can you go back to Cordyceps Hall with me first?

493
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,680
How about this, Ziwu,

494
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,079
you go find the secret treasure alone,

495
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,400
I'll go save her brother with her.

496
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,559
Mark it when you come back,

497
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,039
and I'll come back to you.

498
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,720
Of course, human life is a priority.

499
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,160
The terrain here is complicated.

500
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,359
Let me take you out.

501
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,039
Miss,

502
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:10,200
don't you know your name?

503
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,039
I'm Ouyang Yanyun from Fire Department,

504
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,200
Miss Yanyun,

505
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:16,279
Pan Jun,

506
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,519
let's go.

507
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,200
Thank you, Ziwu.

508
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:23,200
This way.

509
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,680
Ziwu,

510
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,079
it's not time to call me Brother Pan.

511
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:27,480
You,

512
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,559
Pan Jun.

513
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,000
We don't have to go back to Cordyceps Hall.

514
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
This is Xuan Cao.

515
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,720
Xuan Cao.

516
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,279
What are you doing here?

517
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,960
You know how to use stems and leaves?

518
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,440
-Go, go. -Don't make trouble.

519
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,319
Go, go, go.

520
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,079
Yanyun,

521
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,680
I heard from Master,

522
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,359
Jifang Cove is Senior Jin's residence,

523
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,759
so we can go there and see

524
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,079
if it's suitable for your brother's treatment.

525
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,759
Really?

526
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,599
Thank you, Ziwu.

527
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:16,079
By the way,

528
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:17,960
where is Senior Feng now?

529
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,680
My master

530
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,200
was captured by Yin-Yang Road.

531
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,160
Locked in jail.

532
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,720
Destroyed in every way.

533
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,640
My native body

534
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,400
is stronger than ordinary people.

535
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,680
Over the years,

536
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:37,000
we native people,

537
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,759
It's common for people who covet treasures

538
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:40,799
to do experiments.

539
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,279
There are only a few people in the Heavenly Palace,

540
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:44,440
and now,

541
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,279
It's almost exterminated.

542
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,279
My grandfather said that the Zerg treasure is full of mechanisms,

543
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,720
and no one can get out alive.

544
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:54,640
It seems that Yin and Yang

545
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,559
are studying these things for the treasure.

546
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,960
That's right. My father also said,

547
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,039
once the mechanism of Zerg treasure is turned on,

548
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,559
It's easy to drive people crazy.

549
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,559
All right, it's more important to save her.

550
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:05,839
We've had enough

551
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,079
Xuan grass. Let's go.

552
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:07,920
Okay,

553
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,599
That way.

554
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,480
Watch out!

555
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:23,680
Be careful.

556
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,039
It's so desolate out there,

557
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:33,079
I didn't expect there's another world inside,

558
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,799
Are you sure it's here?

559
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,880
I'm sure it can't be wrong here.

560
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,119
Miss Yanyun,

561
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,240
look at this place surrounded by mountains on three sides,

562
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,119
Stay away from the crowd,

563
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:41,960
be quiet and comfortable.

564
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,079
See if it's suitable for the patient to recuperate.

565
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,960
If you want to go back,

566
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,119
I can go with you.

567
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,599
It's not easy to walk on this mountain road.

568
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,240
And there are many jackals, tigers and leopards.

569
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,559
It might be dangerous for you to leave alone.

570
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:54,680
If I go with you,

571
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:55,519
brother,

572
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,839
Ziwu,

573
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:58,920
what are you doing?

574
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,920
Is it more important

575
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,519
to find your secret treasure?

576
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,079
You're afraid of Yan Yun, a wild aunt,

577
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,039
a little girl,

578
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,599
The little girl is from Ba Song.

579
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:19,319
The terrain there is more complicated than here.

580
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,319
I'm sure she'll find her way.

581
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:23,240
So don't worry about her, okay?

582
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,720
Then you two wait here.

583
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:27,640
I'm going to pick up my brother and the others.

584
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:37,160
I'll trust you one more time.

585
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:40,839
Trust him if you don't trust me.

586
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,000
Slow down.

587
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:57,039
He's gone

588
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:59,039
and lost his soul,

589
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,720
After we get the secret treasure later,

590
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:05,559
where can we find Senior Jin Wu Yi?

591
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,400
Look at the whole yard. Does it look like

592
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,119
there's no one here?

593
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,839
Take good care of it.

594
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,279
He's obviously avoiding you.

595
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,319
Thankfully,

596
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,160
the earth-series secret treasure is intact,

597
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,519
It's not a waste of Master's trust.

598
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:54,799
Hua Hua,

599
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,799
it's been a whole night.

600
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,160
My young master should be back by now.

601
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:02,839
Master,

602
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:04,000
I'm sorry.

603
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:06,240
I didn't take good care of Young Master,

604
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,359
and I failed to live up to your expectations.

605
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,960
Can you sit down and bless me?

606
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,359
Stop shaking.

607
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,519
I'm willing to hang around.

608
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,000
What if I wandered around?

609
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,960
I feel annoyed,

610
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,720
but the doors of the Cordyceps Hall are closed.

611
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I'm not doing business anymore.

612
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:23,359
I'm not doing business anymore.

613
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,960
The doctor is not here. Who will give you a prescription?

614
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:28,640
But you must read my prescription.

615
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,720
The Young Master of Cordyceps Hall,

616
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,359
Pan Jun's Mansion, Zhou Shan,

617
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,720
entrusted by Madam to accept the matter,

618
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,160
What do you mean?

619
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,720
It's almost done.

620
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,799
These medicines should be enough.

621
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:52,960
Twice a day,

622
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,279
then take it with your meal.

623
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,240
Remember,

624
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,920
he must eat something light.

625
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,240
If you can't eat oily food,

626
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,000
when can we go back to the Northern Zhou Dynasty?

627
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,960
It depends on him and you,

628
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,400
all the poisons in his body have been discharged.

629
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,559
You're not afraid of being young after a long journey,

630
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,880
but you're resistant to hardships.

631
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,719
anyway

632
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,840
Ziwu and I have to go back to Northern Zhou soon.

633
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,840
All the patients in Northern Zhou are waiting for us.

634
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,320
Sister,

635
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,199
Yan Ying,

636
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,920
Why are you up?

637
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,280
I told you I was a doctor,

638
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,440
and a child of Ouyang family.

639
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,239
You're in good health,

640
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:38,480
so I want to get some fresh air.

641
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,719
If you say you're in good health in front of your native land,

642
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,079
but you don't refute it,

643
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:44,760
Pan Jun, sometimes,

644
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,199
you're too stingy.

645
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,559
Your Young Master is fine now.

646
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,840
We'll go back to the Northern Zhou Dynasty first.

647
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:52,960
Stop!

648
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,519
What's wrong again? Senior Ouyang,

649
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,280
I'll send you back.

650
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,559
Yan Yun, take good care of your brother.

651
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,599
Please.

652
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,719
I'm leaving.

653
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:48,920
The Zhoushan Mountain is so big,

654
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,079
which direction should we go?

655
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:53,960
Qi,

656
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:55,920
where is the east side?

657
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,239
Here, here, over there.

658
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:08,280
Mr. Pan,

659
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:10,880
Mr. Yanxi,

660
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,440
Young master,

661
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:15,679
it's been a while.

662
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,159
Let me see if you've lost weight?

663
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,199
As long as you're in good health,

664
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,480
I'm relieved.

665
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:23,599
Then I'll be able to explain it to Master.

666
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,239
What?

667
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,679
You can save Pan Jun

668
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:28,480
with this thing.

669
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,599
No

670
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,800
Misunderstanding, let's go,

671
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,599
let's go,

672
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,360
Let's go!

673
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,159
Isn't this

674
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,039
Brother Pan Pu?

675
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,039
How are you? How are you?

676
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:43,840
Mr. Ouyang Lei

677
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,199
Huo,

678
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,880
You're not threatened by the Fire Branch, are you?

679
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:53,079
There's a misunderstanding here.

680
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,760
I don't think so.

681
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,480
My grandson, Yan Ying, was poisoned by Ghost Beauty by you

682
00:36:58,639 --> 00:36:59,960
using the Green Silk Method.

683
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:02,400
It all points to your Floral Branch.

684
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:04,760
Ouyang Lei's fire

685
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,119
is good.

686
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:11,199
Qingsi is indeed the exclusive hidden weapon of the Department of Wood.

687
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,519
However,

688
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:15,480
when my master left,

689
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,440
He told me over and over again,

690
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:21,079
to make sure Young Master is safe all his life.

691
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,440
Don't threaten the old grudges

692
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:27,280
and don't touch the Zerg's secret art. The wound caused by Qingsi

693
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,400
is very similar to

694
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,719
the Water Cloud Candle Poison Worm.

695
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,239
Of course he can't defend himself.

696
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,760
Is this really a poisonous insect?

697
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,800
As if it were true,

698
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,800
you raised those poisonous insects, right?

699
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:50,440
What do you mean?

700
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,920
As a senior of Fire Department,

701
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,199
Ouyang Leihuo

702
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:59,360
can't think of this, can he?

703
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,719
Young master,

704
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,440
let's go.

705
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,320
Pan Jun, here we are.

706
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:26,880
Young master.

707
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,039
Mr. Yanxi,

708
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,039
how about Uncle Pan?

709
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,440
There's still some time left for them to check the lunch,

710
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,280
so you should go back to Cordyceps Hall first.

711
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,559
Go with Sister Hua to distribute the anti-epidemic medicine.

712
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,719
Okay,

713
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:46,199
Let's go.

714
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:03,880
Relax.

715
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,880
Come on. Raise your arms.

716
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:32,320
Pan Jun,

717
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,679
Pan Jun,

718
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:35,119
Tell them,

719
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,199
I don't want an injection.

720
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,079
Let me go home.

721
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,159
No, just draw some blood.

722
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:40,239
It's okay,

723
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,599
Pan Jun. I don't want blood.

724
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:42,719
I want to go back.

725
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,599
-Let me go back. -Let me go back.

726
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:46,159
Calm down Ziwu!

727
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:47,440
Let go of me!

728
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:47,920
It's okay.

729
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,400
Help!

730
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:48,960
Let go of me!

731
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,159
Let go!

732
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:50,639
Ziwu,

733
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,599
let me go back.

734
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,679
-Let me go back! -Let

735
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:56,199
me go!

736
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:59,320
I don't want it. I don't want it.

737
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,639
Let me out.

738
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:05,119
Let me go! Let me go!

739
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:07,079
I don't want to. Let me go.

740
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,599
I don't want it.

741
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,880
I don't want it.
