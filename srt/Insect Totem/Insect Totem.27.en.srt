1
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,079
I've arranged for someone to look after your father.

2
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,000
Don't worry.

3
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,800
Grandpa,

4
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,000
Tomorrow,

5
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,560
I must kill Wan Hu Shan myself.

6
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,120
Yan Ying, in the past,

7
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,960
there were some misunderstandings between our grandparents and grandchildren,

8
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:31,039
After tomorrow's event,

9
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,280
you can go to Langshui to take charge of it,

10
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,960
I'll give you half of Ouyang's troops.

11
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,159
In the future,

12
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,039
Just assist Yanyun

13
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,000
in managing the Fire Department.

14
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,120
Yan Ying,

15
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,120
thank grandpa.

16
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,240
Yan Ying,

17
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,240
grandpa,

18
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,439
Yan Ying may have worked too hard

19
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,479
to take care of her parents these two days,

20
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,520
Let him have a good rest.

21
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,680
Thank you, Grandpa.

22
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,840
My grandson is incompetent.

23
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,039
I failed to take good care of you.

24
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,240
Don't worry Grandpa,

25
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,879
I will assist you in the future.

26
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,960
Manage the Fire Department well,

27
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,800
and be filial in front of your hall.

28
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Okay.

29
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,680
Okay,

30
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,280
Both of you have grown up.

31
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,879
From now on, I can do my own thing with peace of mind.

32
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,960
Grandpa, please give me a troop,

33
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,960
tomorrow I'll go straight to the battalion commander's mansion,

34
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,520
Revenge for Her Highness.

35
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:42,879
Wan Hushan will come here tomorrow.

36
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,039
Why are you going to the battalion commander's mansion?

37
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,560
Go to Wan Chao Sect.

38
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,520
He's in Ba Song.

39
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,079
Doctor Pan is here. Miss Miaomiao is here.

40
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,720
Where's Senior Lei Yun?

41
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:18,920
I'm getting changed inside.

42
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,160
I guess,

43
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,360
Miss Miaomiao is the maid of honor, right?

44
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,160
You guessed wrong.

45
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,560
Guess what I do.

46
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:31,879
Master of Ceremonial,

47
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,639
you got it right.

48
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,079
I'm here today to confirm

49
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,879
the wedding date tomorrow,

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,759
Not bad.

51
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,279
But I'm telling you,

52
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,279
I can't let you pick up

53
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:44,120
this daughter-in-law so easily tomorrow.

54
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,600
Our float was so big that

55
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,000
it was hard to get into the streets,

56
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,759
I'm thinking,

57
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,319
many guests

58
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,360
can enter through your back door.

59
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:58,839
It's convenient.

60
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,000
Not bad.

61
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,800
Then let me tell you,

62
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,439
the time of our banquet tomorrow,

63
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,879
About three o'clock

64
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:09,000
in the afternoon.

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You can open the table at five o'clock.

66
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:14,040
It's a little late at three o'clock in the afternoon,

67
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,319
our battalion commander's mansion is crowded and busy,

68
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,040
It's better to move earlier.

69
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,959
Adjutant Wan means,

70
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,040
it will be fine after one o'clock in the afternoon.

71
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,959
At that time, everyone was almost drunk,

72
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,279
and they didn't have time to please the groom.

73
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,600
Besides,

74
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,800
our battalion commander has a bad temper,

75
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,759
If it takes too long,

76
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,199
and something unexpected happens again,

77
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,839
That's not necessary.

78
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,079
Good for you.

79
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,959
It's all up to you.

80
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's open the table at 1: 00 p. m. But let me tell

81
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,439
you,

82
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,360
The Ouyang family must have a lot of courtesy

83
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,879
to pick up a daughter.

84
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,439
With you and me here,

85
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,600
everything will be fine.

86
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,360
Goodbye.

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,839
See you.

88
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,639
Everyone is here. By the way,

89
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,839
I'll be the emcee tomorrow to lead the overall situation.

90
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,079
Xiao'e,

91
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,319
you're the maid of honor,

92
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,519
Follow Yanyun all the time to protect her.

93
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,319
Yan Ying,

94
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,439
are you from Ouyang Family?

95
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,399
So you have to be there.

96
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,120
Your mission

97
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,199
is to fill me up with all the company commanders and platoon leaders.

98
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,240
Are you my brother-in-law?

99
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,319
They won't turn you down if you propose a toast.

100
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,439
One can be poured down one by one.

101
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,519
Miaomiao,

102
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,439
you're in charge of the front door,

103
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,680
Be careful then.

104
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,079
Luo Xiu,

105
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,959
you and Ouyang Xi are in charge of the back door.

106
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,839
Understood.

107
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,879
I know everyone is in a bad mood.

108
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
I'm not tall either.

109
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,959
The red carpet is beaming outside.

110
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,199
But as we all know,

111
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,399
what we should have done

112
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
is a waste of time,

113
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,319
But do you want to know

114
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,240
why we're sitting here?

115
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,480
It's because we can carve up the treasure

116
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,279
and have no worries about food and clothing.

117
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,639
Or because of my so-called shares,

118
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:34,920
none of them.

119
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,959
We can sit here.

120
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,720
It's because of Mr. Jin,

121
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,360
because Ziwu

122
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,639
can't get hurt for nothing.

123
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,399
Boss Jin can't just die like this.

124
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,720
Tomorrow, I'll kill my enemy

125
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,279
and avenge you.

126
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,079
So,

127
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,800
in tomorrow's battle,

128
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,079
It's a crucial battle for the Zerg juniors.

129
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,279
Who dares to offend the Zerg?

130
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,800
We won't spare them.

131
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,000
Although you can move around now,

132
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,959
you're still very weak.

133
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,120
After that, the battle

134
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,920
is very important.

135
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,120
You must not go out.

136
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,399
Hide here.

137
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,559
Do you know?

138
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,879
If you are found by Wan Family Army,

139
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,000
all the previous efforts will be wasted.

140
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,360
I understand.

141
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,799
Don't worry.

142
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,399
I'll listen to you.

143
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,960
Okay,

144
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm leaving.

145
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,759
Pan Jun.

146
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,200
Be careful.

147
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,120
Why are you so worried

148
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,559
about me? Come on.

149
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,519
What's with the float?

150
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,960
The battalion commander said,

151
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,639
your float is for the bride,

152
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,799
Our float is to pick up Ouyang's elders.

153
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,240
Are you okay with it?

154
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,759
I'll go around from the back.

155
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:27,960
Let's go.

156
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:29,759
Come on, let's go.

157
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,480
Eat and drink well.

158
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,480
Come on,

159
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:39,720
Come on.

160
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,720
Drink whatever you want.

161
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:42,840
Cheers,

162
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,399
Come on.

163
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,600
Excuse me. Excuse me.

164
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,519
Battalion Commander Wan is here.

165
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,840
I'll drink it.

166
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,320
Okay,

167
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,440
Drink well.

168
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,720
Drink well.

169
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:10,679
Congratulations, battalion commander.

170
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,279
Be careful. Be careful.

171
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,799
Be gentle.

172
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,600
-Yes. -Be careful.

173
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,840
-Congratulations. -Congratulations, Minister

174
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
Tuji.

175
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,519
Why did you come to the back door

176
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,480
instead of drinking in front of us?

177
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
The battalion commander ordered me

178
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:41,879
to use this float,

179
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,279
It's to pick up Master Lei Yun,

180
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,080
and the parents of the Fire Clan.

181
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,639
Let's go to the battalion commander's mansion for a drink later.

182
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,000
Look at how big your float is,

183
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,399
and how narrow the road is,

184
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,759
The guys at the back door

185
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
are moving things.

186
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
The pots and pans are inconvenient.

187
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,759
Well,

188
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,360
I'll leave two guys to help.

189
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,000
Lean this

190
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,200
float

191
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,440
to the side. Thank you. Thank you.

192
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,600
I'll pick you up later.

193
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:08,919
Okay,

194
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:10,879
Do it whenever you get the chance.

195
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,240
Check it out.

196
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,279
Please have a seat.

197
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,080
I'm sure you all know him.

198
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,399
Our Ba Song's food and clothing parents,

199
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,360
Ouyang Leiyun,

200
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,480
Okay,

201
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,879
Then this

202
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,000
is our groom,

203
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,399
Wan Hushan Wan Ying Chang

204
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,159
Okay.

205
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,519
We infatuated men,

206
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,000
persevere and seek the phoenix,

207
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,320
As a sentimental girl,

208
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,919
Xu Lifelong has been tested in every way.

209
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,320
Now let's welcome our bride,

210
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,600
the gentleman of Ouyang's family,

211
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,240
Miss Yan Yun,

212
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,279
Okay.

213
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,759
Now that the bride and groom are here,

214
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,200
I have a little suggestion,

215
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:03,840
We're in the new era now,

216
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,120
so don't accept that nonsense.

217
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,000
Why don't you just lift the hijab?

218
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,799
Let everyone see what they look like, okay?

219
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,159
Okay

220
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,480
You want to see it. Do you want to see it?

221
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:23,919
It's gone.

222
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,159
Okay.

223
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,919
Come on, let's drink. Let's drink

224
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,840
Drink

225
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,000
Is it beautiful?

226
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,759
I didn't see Mr. Jin and Mr. Yanlei,

227
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,679
so I can't change my mind.

228
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,679
Battalion Commander,

229
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,960
they're not feeling well and they're still recovering.

230
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,480
I'll bring you to visit him in person another day

231
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,120
Pan Jun

232
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,559
Let's continue.

233
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,240
Let's continue.

234
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,119
It's boring.

235
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,039
Senior Lei Yun,

236
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,319
you must follow me to the battalion commander's mansion.

237
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,559
Our Ba Song doesn't

238
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,559
recognize grandpa,

239
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,519
Am I right?

240
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,079
Right?

241
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,799
Stop laughing.

242
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,759
Come on, battalion commander.

243
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,640
Battalion Commander, don't be angry.

244
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,920
Sit down.

245
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,880
Sit down.

246
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,279
Today, this is my first bowl of wine,

247
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,359
to the battalion commander's wife,

248
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,359
Wish you a harmonious union lasting a hundred years.

249
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,640
Live together to a ripe old age,

250
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,960
Okay.

251
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,599
Good things come in pairs.

252
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:48,799
This second bowl of wine,

253
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,559
Let's propose a toast to the two newcomers, okay?

254
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,920
Okay,

255
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:52,920
Come on,

256
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:55,839
Come on,

257
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:59,319
Cheers.

258
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:31,319
In the notice,

259
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,920
I think it's about to happen.

260
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,039
Get out of the way!

261
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:49,279
Get out of my way!

262
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,759
Stand up.

263
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,200
Get out of the way!

264
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:00,519
Attention!

265
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,000
Guys,

266
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,400
the float will pass by here later.

267
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,400
Clear the place!

268
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,240
Yes.

269
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,160
Let's go.

270
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,039
Battalion Commander Wan,

271
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,160
can you still get into the bridal chamber today?

272
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,279
Senior Lei Yun,

273
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:48,200
you can't wait to hear me call you grandpa,

274
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,640
Battalion Commander Wan,

275
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,359
how dare I take advantage of you?

276
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,519
Drink,

277
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,839
Drink.

278
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,039
You're the maid of honor, right?

279
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:10,759
Come and have a drink with me.

280
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:23,519
Come on,

281
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
I'll drink with you.

282
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,759
Okay.

283
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:33,920
That's right.

284
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,359
What's wrong?

285
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,640
Ouyang's Mansion is surrounded.

286
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,799
Come on, everyone,

287
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,599
Everyone,

288
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:56,519
today is a happy day for our battalion commander.

289
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,759
If you don't get drunk, it won't be good.

290
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,720
Okay,

291
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,559
Cheers,

292
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,039
Senior Lei Yun.

293
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:13,880
Battalion Commander,

294
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:16,799
don't get mad.

295
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,200
It's getting late.

296
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,279
Finish this bowl and let's go.

297
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,319
Senior Lei Yun,

298
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,960
our battalion commander is tired,

299
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,519
If there's any offense,

300
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,559
as long as he admits his mistake,

301
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,000
Please don't punish him for drinking.

302
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,720
Wan Jiacheng,

303
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,400
you're really your coach's confidant.

304
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,599
Get out of the way!

305
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,559
My mother's death,

306
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,440
has something to do with each and every one of you.

307
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,319
Yan Ying, what nonsense are you talking about?

308
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,119
Sister,

309
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,200
there are some things,

310
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,720
I have to do it.

311
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,519
Ouyang Leiyun,

312
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,519
it was you who caused my mother to be tortured by thousands of insects.

313
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,839
You deserve to die the most today.

314
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:34,880
Yan Ying.

315
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:36,160
Yan Ying.

316
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:41,960
Grandpa.

317
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,680
Stand up.

318
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:46,480
Get out of the way!

319
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,519
How dare you point a gun at me?

320
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,039
Let's go!

321
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,920
Grandpa,

322
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,359
Grandpa.

323
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,039
Grandpa,

324
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,119
Yan Yun,

325
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:11,279
Yan Yun,

326
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:13,160
Yan Yun,

327
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,160
Pan Jun,

328
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,519
come with us!

329
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,279
Grandpa,

330
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,000
come here.

331
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,400
Take her outside and wait for me.

332
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,640
I'll go find Ziwu.

333
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,480
Gentleman, go.

334
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:32,400
Pan Jun,

335
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,880
I think it's smoking.

336
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,440
Well,

337
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,240
I'll find a place to park in front of you.

338
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
It's a black pillow oriole.

339
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,440
It seems that my father has arranged it.

340
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,119
Get out of the car.

341
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,519
Go!

342
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:23,480
Within five days,

343
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,759
you can hand over the five-series secret treasure,

344
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,400
And River Rock.

345
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,160
Otherwise,

346
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,559
Chief toast,

347
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,799
go back and tell the Wanchao Sect,

348
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,920
Tell them Pan Yingxuan, a gentleman from the Department of Wood,

349
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,000
will visit Ba Song City these two days,

350
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,839
If you can't wait

351
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,680
to burn everything now,

352
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,119
I'll accompany you.

353
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,240
We still have 400 guns.

354
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:46,000
His Wanchaozong is coming.

355
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,720
We're always welcome

356
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,359
Commander Wan said,

357
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,319
For the trial of Herbal Master,

358
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:57,240
it depends on you, Doctor Pan.

359
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,599
See you in five days.

360
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:01,880
Retreat.

361
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,640
Come on.

362
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:16,680
-What's wrong with you? -Ziwu. Ziwu. Brother

363
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,400
Ziwu.

364
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,559
What's wrong with you?

365
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,559
Why are you being a hero?

366
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:29,440
Pan Jun

367
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,279
Ziwu,

368
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:32,799
Pan Jun,

369
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,400
listen to me. It's too late.

370
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,160
You must become

371
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,400
a herbalist for me.

372
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,839
For the rest of the way,

373
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,400
you'll have to go alone.

374
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,880
Secret treasure

375
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,279
You have to do it yourself.

376
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,160
I'm a doctor. I can cure you.

377
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,240
I won't let you die.

378
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,440
Pan Jun,

379
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,039
Pan Jun,

380
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,559
I can do it.

381
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:06,519
Listen to me,

382
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,799
my own body,

383
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:10,440
I know.

384
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:14,079
I just want to talk to Yanyun right now,

385
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,799
bro,

386
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,920
I'm counting on you,

387
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,400
Yanyun.

388
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:38,680
I really,

389
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,599
I really like you.

390
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,759
Yan Yun.

391
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,559
I lied to you before.

392
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:56,880
I don't want to be your clan.

393
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,400
I don't want to be your comrade-in-arms.

394
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:04,599
I really like you.

395
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:09,000
I … I just want to be with you.

396
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,079
I want to be with you forever,

397
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,680
Ziwu,

398
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,799
Ziwu,

399
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,759
I'm sorry,

400
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:17,680
Ziwu.

401
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,279
I'm sorry.

402
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,079
Ziwu.

403
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:02,680
Pan Jun.

404
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,960
Pan Jun.

405
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
I'm sorry.

406
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,759
Within 10 days from now,

407
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:39,920
Ba Song City will be closed and curfew will be imposed,

408
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:42,720
People are not allowed to enter or leave the city gate,

409
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:45,559
each family will have a young and middle-aged man,

410
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,960
Replenish the military resources,

411
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,920
and punish those who disobey.

412
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,880
Please come in.

413
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,960
Congratulations, Battalion Commander. Congratulations, Battalion Commander.

414
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,279
The letter of appointment hereby

415
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,119
appoints the successor of the Ouyang family of the Ba Song Huo family,

416
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,039
Ouyang Yanying

417
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,319
is the battalion commander of the Basong Garrison Major,

418
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,920
Assist the new Deputy Commander of Southwest

419
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,319
Guard Wan Hushan

420
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,799
to lead Ba Song's military affairs and appease the people,

421
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,160
Battalion Commander Ouyang,

422
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:38,960
the brothers are here to salute you.

423
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,880
Please take good care of me in the future.

424
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,599
Yes, the battalion commander should take care of us.

425
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:46,759
Congratulations, Battalion Commander. Congratulations, Battalion Commander.

426
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,079
She's in a rush,

427
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:18,839
and she'll be fine after taking the medicine.

428
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:23,680
Miaomiao,

429
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:25,079
where's Jun'er?

430
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,880
He said he wanted to take a walk by himself.

431
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,720
Xiao'e,

432
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,559
Xiao'e,

433
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,559
Please

434
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,119
go and see Jun'er.

435
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,279
Okay.

436
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,799
Miaomiao

437
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,079
Do you have something to say?

438
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,319
Pan Jun couldn't accept Ziwu's death for a while.

439
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:01,960
But I know him.

440
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:04,920
He will definitely go to test the herbalist

441
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,000
Uncle Pan I want to hear the truth,

442
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:11,000
What's Pan Jun's chance of success

443
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,199
in the human herbalist trial?

444
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,440
Zixu, the trial site of Huai'an Cave

445
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,880
is also a place

446
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,760
where people enter,

447
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,239
poisonous insects and miasma can't tell the direction,

448
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,400
Only one in ten thousand can survive.

449
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:28,239
This is a master of human nature.

450
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,880
Twenty-four years ago, in the battle of Bamen Mountain,

451
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:36,000
the herbalist has been extinct

452
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,639
for so many years,

453
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,559
I've been studying it,

454
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,079
but until now,

455
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,400
I'm still not sure.

456
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:44,760
It can open the treasure.

457
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,679
I'm not quite sure that

458
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,519
I can try to be a successful herbalist,

459
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:52,320
Now, even if you add your Mo Yu Bracelet,

460
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:54,599
it will increase the possibility

461
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,880
by 12% at most.

462
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,719
Brother Pan,

463
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:06,559
you've been out alone

464
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,800
for hours,

465
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,760
It's so cold outside,

466
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,800
you should go back and rest early.

467
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:20,079
Uncle Pan and Sister Miao

468
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,519
are worried.

469
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,239
It doesn't matter if I freeze for a few hours.

470
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:31,400
Ziwu is getting cold.

471
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:34,000
Brother Pan,

472
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:36,320
you can't think like that.

473
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:39,119
If Ziwu finds out,

474
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,800
he won't feel at ease when he leaves.

475
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:44,719
He knows.

476
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,519
How did he know?

477
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:02,840
He's so funny.

478
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,760
I always find some reasons

479
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,920
to comfort myself.

480
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,760
I don't want to hear anything right now.

481
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,000
Ziwu's death,

482
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,480
we're as sad as you are.

483
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,280
But as you know,

484
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:50,920
Wan Jiajun won't give up the trial

485
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,480
and open the Zerg treasure,

486
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,440
At such a critical moment,

487
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,559
how can we just fall down like this?

488
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:58,599
Can you stop mentioning human beings

489
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,239
and treasures?

490
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:03,039
I've had enough.

491
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:29,679
I'm really scared.

492
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,840
I'm afraid,

493
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:39,119
I'm afraid that everyone around me will leave,

494
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:43,480
Pan Jun, get up first.

495
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,119
Pan Jun, remember,

496
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:53,639
Hope

497
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,000
It's the most important belief

498
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,519
that we have in this world.

499
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:00,920
No matter how far apart

500
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,760
or how long?

501
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,400
The things we wanted to say,

502
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:09,920
but didn't have time to say.

503
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,679
We'll have a chance to have a good talk.

504
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,800
That's what life is all about.

505
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,440
Welcome and send

506
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:28,599
is normal.

507
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:34,280
Will you leave me too?

508
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,480
I will protect myself well.

509
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,840
I will never leave you.
