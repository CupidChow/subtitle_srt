1
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,280
Can the three of us

2
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,080
stop the outbreak of pneumonic plague?

3
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,039
If we can't stop them or cure them,

4
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,000
we'll continue to look for the source of their infection.

5
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,360
Looking for clues from the source

6
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,319
is the best way.

7
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,159
In the information I found,

8
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,439
there are no similar cases.

9
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,080
Cholera in the Middle Ages

10
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,719
is very different from this disease.

11
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:43,120
The medical records of Mr. Zhang and Mr. Lin

12
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,039
are all medical records of insect drugs.

13
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:48,039
Now that Miss Chunlan is holding her breath,

14
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,400
I really don't know if she can make it through.

15
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,199
Look,

16
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
the boss says,

17
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,479
In case of plague, poisonous insects can be used as medicine,

18
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,520
poisonous insects can be used as medicine to delay the outbreak of complications,

19
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,400
Buy time for the patient.

20
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,159
It's native to Cloud Candle,

21
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,639
and feeds on Ghost Beauty.

22
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,319
Do you have it in your garden?

23
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
I don't have it here.

24
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,680
But I know where it is.

25
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,479
Where?

26
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,080
Ashin Pharmaceuticals,

27
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,879
he's a great doctor.

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Saving lives,

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
sacrificing one's life for justice,

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,960
He cares about the world.

31
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,639
His name is Pan Jun.

32
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,120
What's going on?

33
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,039
He's from the Department of Health.

34
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,159
Why did he come here to give out anti-epidemic drugs?

35
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,280
Epidemic prevention drugs.

36
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,520
You're here early in the morning.

37
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,000
He's a great doctor.

38
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,280
Saving lives,

39
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,479
sacrificing one's life for justice,

40
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,919
He's a doctor from Cordyceps Hall.

41
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,599
You're finally here Mrs. Matsui,

42
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,120
I'm a health clerk,

43
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,599
As for the pneumonic plague,

44
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,919
the Health Department paid special attention to it.

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,919
It has nothing to do with me.

46
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,919
But I heard that Mrs. Matsui has always been kind-hearted.

47
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,639
Then you heard it wrong.

48
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,080
Mrs. Matsui,

49
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,520
the poor people of Northern Zhou,

50
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,560
He was tortured by pneumonic plague and died.

51
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,240
Now Pan Jun is the only one standing up.

52
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,000
But it's really hard to find a cure for pneumonic plague.

53
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Miraculous Physician Pan said,

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,519
only you, Yaxin Pharmaceutical, will do it,

55
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,040
Only then can we save the entire North Zhou City.

56
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,759
On behalf of the Department of Health, I'm also asking for your help.

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,959
How can I help you?

58
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,959
Miraculous Physician Pan has found a precious prescription.

59
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,519
But what are

60
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,000
the rare herbs?

61
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,639
Poisonous insects.

62
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,959
Poisonous insects are the most deadly poison to kill people,

63
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,480
and Yaxin will never take the risk of harming others.

64
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,120
I don't want to see you around.

65
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,279
Mrs. Matsui,

66
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,480
I made the decision on my own.

67
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,959
He didn't dare to bother you

68
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,240
when he helped Pan Jun fulfill his wish.

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But I hope you can meet him.

70
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,279
Otherwise,

71
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,240
he will die in peace.

72
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:04,920
For the sake of the people of Li,

73
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,680
he decided to fight against death.

74
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,319
Live and die with the plague.

75
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,680
He's the only hope for the patients of Northern Zhou.

76
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,519
Mrs. Matsui.

77
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,519
Do you understand?

78
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,199
Put on airs.

79
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,319
You said,

80
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,600
fever,

81
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,600
Red rash,

82
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,560
cough,

83
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,879
Several illnesses occurred simultaneously.

84
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,439
The plague seems to have come prepared.

85
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,519
I know people's weaknesses,

86
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,079
but I don't know medical skills,

87
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,639
I trust your judgment. Brother Pan,

88
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,240
well,

89
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,920
You should call me Dr. Pan.

90
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:24,959
Or Doctor Pan can do it.

91
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,279
Who?

92
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,759
It's me.

93
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,319
Mrs. Matsui,

94
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,639
I was going to ask you for medicine.

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,079
Why are you here?

96
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,680
Really?

97
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,199
Didn't you ask someone to take a message?

98
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:54,160
Are you Mrs. Matsui from AsiaInfo Pharmaceuticals?

99
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,000
Hello, my name is Ouyang Yanyun.

100
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,680
Nice to meet you.

101
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,839
It's a nice name.

102
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:04,600
From now on,

103
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:07,160
we'll see each other a lot.

104
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,680
I heard that someone is going to die generously.

105
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,199
So let's take a look.

106
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,439
The plague hasn't been removed,

107
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,439
the beauty hasn't been married,

108
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,399
You can't just die.

109
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,240
You're eloquent.

110
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,199
It's not a life-or-death moment yet.

111
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,600
Just let Mr. Zhang go around saying,

112
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,079
"You're going to die for the people. ",

113
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,639
Mr. Zhang is right.

114
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,000
I did give my life to the police.

115
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,480
If I can't treat the plague well,

116
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,319
you may never see me again.

117
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,160
This is your prescription.

118
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,040
Yes,

119
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,879
only my prescription

120
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,720
saved Yan Ying and Mr. Zhang,

121
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,040
What does the life and death of those people have to do with you?

122
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,240
Do you need to forget to eat and sleep?

123
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,319
Righteous people sacrifice their lives to death.

124
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,000
He sacrificed himself in exchange for a complete life.

125
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,600
This is a great righteousness.

126
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,879
What do I think is the most important thing?

127
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:11,240
If I succeed in treating pneumonic plague this time,

128
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,439
then my tiny Cordyceps Hall,

129
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,040
But someone has broken through the threshold.

130
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,000
By then, your investment in me will double.

131
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,519
So,

132
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,920
I want to ask my wife Matsui

133
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,800
to look for it for me.

134
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,920
You want me, Yaxin, to provide you with poisonous insects?

135
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,120
Clever,

136
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
I went through all the books,

137
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,079
There are a lot of cases treated with poisonous insects,

138
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:33,000
the book says that as long as the poisonous insects are ground to powder,

139
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,679
Plus the herbs along the Wulu River,

140
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:37,600
the two have opposite medicinal properties and are opposite to each other.

141
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,360
It can quickly improve vitality,

142
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,759
strengthen the foundation and cultivate the yuan.

143
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,000
It's good for your health.

144
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,639
Why did you let yourself get involved in this mess?

145
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,240
The doctor is kind,

146
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,240
saving lives and helping others.

147
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,919
If I can't find this poisonous insect,

148
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,799
it's not just my life.

149
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,559
Maybe the whole North Zhou City

150
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,840
is doomed.

151
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,679
Cloud candles are thousands of miles away,

152
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,440
and poisonous insects are so hard to find,

153
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,559
If we can't find it,

154
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,679
we'll lose everything.

155
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,600
Don't worry.

156
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,679
I'll figure it out.

157
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,919
It's the last meal.

158
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,240
Eat up.

159
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,720
Your Ladyship,

160
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,240
the car is ready.

161
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,840
You can leave anytime.

162
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,919
Lin,

163
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:32,360
let me ask you something,

164
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,519
In your heart,

165
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,799
I'm a hateful

166
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,919
and vicious woman, right?

167
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,039
In fact, over the years,

168
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,080
you have had countless chances

169
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,919
to wipe out other Zerg families.

170
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,519
But you didn't do that.

171
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,600
I think,

172
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,360
you must be hesitating.

173
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:03,200
It's not so much that you want revenge,

174
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,360
but,

175
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,799
Not as good as what?

176
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,399
It's better to say that

177
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,480
you're more willing to believe that there's something else going on back then,

178
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,480
Miss Miaomiao has always been

179
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,799
a kind person in my heart.

180
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,120
Miaomiao,

181
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:29,600
Miaomiao,

182
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,320
Is this jade bracelet beautiful?

183
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,399
Nice

184
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,480
I'll put it on for you,

185
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:37,679
Be good,

186
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,399
Miaomiao, listen up,

187
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
what I told you today,

188
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,679
You have to remember for the rest of your life,

189
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:49,159
your mother's name is Shi Shiyu,

190
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,759
It's a gentleman from the previous generation

191
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,000
in the forest of Bamen Mountain,

192
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,480
Miaomiao's mother was killed by

193
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,480
the other four gentry of Zerg,

194
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,519
He has been gentle and kind all his life,

195
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,399
and abides by the ancestral training of the Zerg,

196
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,759
He never harmed anyone.

197
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,320
He cares about the conspiracy and evil deeds of the people

198
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,639
and the four branches of the world,

199
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,360
When I'm going to get what I deserve,

200
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,440
Miaomiao,

201
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,519
Do you think Mrs. Matsui

202
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,759
can really help us?

203
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,440
What do you mean?

204
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,000
There's a killer organization under Yaxin.

205
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,440
Have you heard of it?

206
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,279
Yin and Yang.

207
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,519
They might be

208
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,000
the source of the infection this time.

209
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

210
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,080
I'm just speculating.

211
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,440
I dare not jump to conclusions.

212
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,600
Before Yan Ying got sick,

213
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,440
the two men she chased might be the killers of Yin and Yang.

214
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,759
I calculated the time and speculated that

215
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,399
these two people are the most suspicious.

216
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,159
But both of them are dead.

217
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,919
Where is the body?

218
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:09,559
I don't know.

219
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,279
You said the plague seems to have come prepared.

220
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,480
If it really has something to do with Yaxin,

221
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,360
then Mrs. Matsui.

222
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:43,519
Mother,

223
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,919
The Zerg Four Clans deserve to die,

224
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,279
but the people are innocent,

225
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,519
If you were still here,

226
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,279
you would have gone to save these innocent patients.

227
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:09,600
100-year-old wood Ganoderma lucidum,

228
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,159
this is a good thing to strengthen the foundation and cultivate the yuan.

229
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,720
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,240
Saffron, Xuan grass,

231
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,360
Sumu peach kernel,

232
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,879
Radix Paeoniae rubra, rhubarb and Angelica sinensis.

233
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,840
I didn't expect that one day I, Pan Jun,

234
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,240
would also go into a business at a loss.

235
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,519
How could you risk your life

236
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,519
with the poisonous insect you want?

237
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,000
Is this really a poisonous insect?

238
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,039
It's real.

239
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,159
How did you get it?

240
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:02,919
Didn't you say that?

241
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:05,000
Mrs. Matsui has been in the business world for many years,

242
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,639
which can't be compared with our small family.

243
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,080
Look at how open my mouth is.

244
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,559
Thank you, Mrs. Matsui.

245
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,279
These patients can be saved.

246
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,000
Thank you so much. Thank you.

247
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:20,559
Thank you.

248
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:21,919
Miaomiao.

249
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:34,200
Mrs. Matsui's name is Miaomiao,

250
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:36,440
Okay,

251
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,000
Is this really poisonous?

252
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,679
Hold it

253
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,519
Open the jar.

254
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,279
Are you sure this will work?

255
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,519
How do you know if you don't try?

256
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,000
Now we can only give it a shot,

257
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,759
and we can only do our best to obey the fate of heaven.

258
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:31,519
All right,

259
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,120
we don't have time to talk.

260
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,320
If it's too late,

261
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,840
those people in the hospital

262
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:38,039
won't be able to take such expensive medicine.

263
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,000
Let's go.

264
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,840
Let's go.

265
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,440
Let's go.

266
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:50,960
Now the pneumonic plague

267
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,840
has turned into severe septicemia.

268
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,080
Don't follow me in later.

269
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,799
I wouldn't have come here with you if I was afraid of death.

270
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:58,080
I said there's no need to take the risk together.

271
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,799
But,

272
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,240
if something really happens to me.

273
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,079
Remember to find me a good place,

274
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,160
burn some more money,

275
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,240
You'll be fine.

276
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,039
What do you think?

277
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,720
Don't worry.

278
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,960
Fang Rude has been overcharged

279
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,480
by the staff of our department.

280
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,799
She's flirting with you right now.

281
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,559
I can't remember it for a while.

282
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:43,200
Yes.

283
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,720
How long has Dr. Pan been in there?

284
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
It's been almost an hour.

285
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,000
Brother Pan said before,

286
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,480
you can't stay in there for too long.

287
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,559
I have to go in and find him.

288
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:51,839
Hold on.

289
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,359
Don't disturb him yet.

290
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,200
Mrs. Matsui,

291
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:08,920
I used to think that ladies and nobles like you,

292
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,759
He doesn't care about the lives of the people.

293
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,279
But since you are so loyal this time,

294
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,720
there are still many good people in this world.

295
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,400
Without you,

296
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,319
we wouldn't be able to win at all.

297
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:22,759
Lift it up.

298
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,279
I'm not as kind as you say.

299
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,319
You're finally awake.

300
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,119
You know what?

301
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:41,000
You're the savior of the whole city now.

302
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,799
Doctor,

303
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,200
Yes.

304
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,839
Help me.

305
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,319
You're safe now.

306
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,039
I have a few questions for you.

307
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,880
Do you know what happened

308
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,400
in Chunxiang Restaurant before the outbreak?

309
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,079
That night,

310
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:57,000
where did the drunkard come from?

311
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,519
It's a mess.

312
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:02,400
Over there,

313
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,319
there's a dead man.

314
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,440
Mom was right there

315
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,559
and asked Wang Damao to drag him away,

316
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,119
Okay.

317
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,279
Don't tell anyone about it.

318
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,519
I'll scare the guests,

319
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,119
or I'll skin you.

320
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,440
Do you hear me?

321
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,319
Yes, I did.

322
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:35,400
Chunlan,

323
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,039
what about them?

324
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,279
Go

325
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,440
Dongdonglai Donglai

326
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,880
inn

327
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:48,640
Find

328
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,680
Ouyang Yanyun,

329
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,400
where is Chunlan?

330
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,640
Where is Chunlan? The guest is looking for you?

331
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm coming.

332
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,240
Xiaoqian,

333
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,440
at least there are two lives.

334
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:04,559
Otherwise,

335
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,359
send them to my room first.

336
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,400
I'll go to Donglai Inn when I'm free.

337
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,319
Okay.

338
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:17,640
All of you have made a lot of achievements.

339
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,519
I can't believe you're raising a gigolo secretly.

340
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,759
It was Chunlan's idea.

341
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:24,119
Taozi has gone to find his family.

342
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,720
I can't just watch

343
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,400
my life die in front of our door.

344
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:29,720
What a bad luck.

345
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,799
How can we do business in the future?

346
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,759
I'd like to see,

347
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,440
what kind of boy is he?

348
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,200
I've got you all confused.

349
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:45,759
Pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague

350
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,839
that kills people,

351
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,279
Do you want to die?

352
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,279
Do you know

353
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,079
where the Pneumonic Plague corpse was pulled?

354
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,680
Who's the driver?

355
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,039
Wang Damao,

356
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,160
where is he now?

357
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,079
He's dead.

358
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,720
Yes.

359
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,039
Do you have any other clues about him?

360
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,240
Do you know where he lives?

361
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,200
Mr. Zhang,

362
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,880
you've really used all your tricks.

363
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,640
You really got me drunk.

364
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,000
As long as you're happy.

365
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:29,000
I'll get even with you next time.

366
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:37,400
Doctor Pan, are you really destined to be a woman?

367
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,440
You even invited Mrs. Matsui here.

368
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,839
It's enviable.

369
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,079
Yaxin will invest in Cordyceps Hall.

370
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,400
As for the decision made by superiors,

371
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,119
there's no need to inform you.

372
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,039
Those you don't know are innocent.

373
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:54,400
Do you know why

374
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,200
I value this matter so much now?

375
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:59,119
We're all family members.

376
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,319
Detective Fang?

377
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:02,000
I have good news for you.

378
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,319
We found the source of the infection.

379
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,400
Really?

380
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,720
Of course it's true.

381
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,359
Let me tell you the details.

382
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,799
Here's the thing,

383
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,119
after I've seen all the patients'symptoms,

384
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,119
I can confirm that

385
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:19,000
my father's prescription works.

386
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:20,359
But

387
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,720
it only aims at the early stage of plague prevention.

388
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:24,720
Now the epidemic is getting worse.

389
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,920
My father's prescription is.

390
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,160
But don't worry,

391
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,720
there's already a solution.

392
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:39,160
As long as we find those bodies,

393
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,480
we won't expose them

394
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,559
to the wilderness and pollute the water,

395
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,039
The whole North Zhou City will be saved.

396
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,200
Well,

397
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:47,839
why is there a corpse?

398
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:49,240
You don't know,

399
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:51,039
Ouyang Yanying was her brother

400
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,240
that day. No,

401
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,720
no, no. I won't listen to you talking nonsense to me.

402
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,079
I don't want to go through the process,

403
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:58,119
I just want the result and find it for me.

404
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,480
Then who?

405
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,960
Full cooperation.

406
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,640
Yes

407
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,720
No. 38, Wangjiawan Hutong.

408
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,519
Dr. Pan,

409
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,599
is this the place?

410
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,200
Yes, this is it.

411
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:31,039
Okay.

412
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,720
Is this Wang Damao's house?

413
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:37,920
Yes.

414
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,960
Your father is Wang Da Mao?

415
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,240
Yes

416
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,839
Where's your father's body?

417
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,359
My father was burnt to ashes by the police.

418
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,039
Be good,

419
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,640
Stop crying.

420
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,519
Stop crying.

421
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,200
Don't cry,

422
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,279
kid. Why are you so fierce?

423
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,839
Did your husband, Wang Damao,

424
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,160
deliver a corpse to Chunxiang Restaurant?

425
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,799
Yes.

426
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:29,640
Do you know where he sent it?

427
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,920
He came back late that day.

428
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,400
I was so scared.

429
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,880
He only said that he had transported the body to the cemetery.

430
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
You didn't even bury it.

431
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,279
But I didn't say where it is.

432
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,720
When did he come back?

433
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,519
approximate

434
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:47,599
Around 12 o'clock at night.

435
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,519
Thank you.

436
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,359
Dr. Pan, let's go.

437
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,440
I'm sorry.

438
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,839
What happened? You just left.

439
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,279
Well,

440
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:06,279
do you know where the cemetery is

441
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:07,799
after a few questions?

442
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,599
Wang Damao should have returned here

443
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,920
at 10 p. m.,

444
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,599
starting from Yanhua Lane around 12 p. m.

445
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,079
That is to say,

446
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:16,759
go to the place where the body was dumped,

447
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,799
It'll take an hour at most.

448
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,519
If a carriage pulls three bodies,

449
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,160
it can run up to 18 miles,

450
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,759
Within this range,

451
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,680
wherever there's a graveyard in the middle of nowhere,

452
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,960
it's a graveyard

453
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,960
in the middle of nowhere.

454
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:35,759
To the east, Shilipu Liangjia Village

455
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,359
is crowded with people. To the north, there is a moat,

456
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:40,519
which is difficult for cars and horses to travel

457
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,319
To the west

458
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,799
Don't blame me

459
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,640
for disturbing the burial ground of Mount Fuzhou.

460
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,880
Luckily, it was a sunny day.

461
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,640
If it's like the cloudy day just now,

462
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,960
it'll be scary.

463
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,279
Let's go.

464
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,359
Let's go and have a look.

465
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,759
Look,

466
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,640
come here.

467
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,519
Come on,

468
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,400
stay away from me.

469
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,160
Call the corpse-lifting team here.

470
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:52,480
Bring lime and burn the body.

471
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,559
Burning corpses,

472
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,000
if their wives and daughters make trouble,

473
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:55,960
If you want the whole body from us,

474
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,000
then you should make a scene.

475
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,759
Do you know how long plague

476
00:27:58,759 --> 00:27:59,880
can stay in a corpse?

477
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,359
This is a plague bank,

478
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:02,799
if their bodies

479
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,359
are eaten by rats and other things.

480
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,440
If you infect people in the city,

481
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,160
you'll need your whole body,

482
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,240
You two stay. The rest of you come with me.

483
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,000
Yes.

484
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,680
Brother Pan, come and take a look!

485
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,160
It's the button of Yin and Yang. It seems that

486
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,039
these two people are Yin and Yang.

487
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,759
How did you recognize him as a man of Yin and Yang?

488
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:39,079
My grandfather's name is Ouyang Leiyun,

489
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,880
he is a gentleman of the Zerg Fire Department,

490
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:43,559
Do you know who I am?

491
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,720
I knew it.

492
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,839
We Zerg have dealt with Yin and Yang,

493
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,240
so we can be sure that these two people are Yin and Yang.

494
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:54,559
This time, they should be here

495
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,359
for our Zerg treasure.

496
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,000
My grandfather once said,

497
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,480
a man of Yin and Yang,

498
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:01,880
I've been thinking about our Zerg treasure for years,

499
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,119
but what worries me the most right now is,

500
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:07,279
It may not be an accident.

501
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,440
It's because they want to kill people with plague.

502
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,559
Hold on.

503
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:17,720
Aren't there three bodies?

504
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,079
Why is one missing?

505
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,200
Hurry up!

506
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,680
Hurry up and look for another body.

507
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,480
Hurry up!

508
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:32,920
Come and take a look!

509
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,799
After training animals in the Fire Department for generations,

510
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,880
we can be sure that this is the footprint of wolves.

511
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,480
It seems that one of them is still alive.

512
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,839
He might have been attacked by wolves.

513
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,759
The wolf attack,

514
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:46,759
I only remember when I woke up,

515
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,559
It's in the graveyard.

516
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:49,880
then

517
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,680
After being besieged by wolves,

518
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:53,640
I know who it is.

519
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,759
Almost, almost, almost.

520
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,359
He's a little taller than me.

521
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:01,640
He's quite strong.

522
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,359
Your hair is quite stupid.

523
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,240
It's Qi Liu Hai,

524
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
wearing my clothes.

525
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,440
He even took a bag of silver coins from me.

526
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,599
Dr. Pan

527
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,519
is about appearance, appearance,

528
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:12,839
Appearance,

529
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,000
eyebrow

530
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,119
Hang down a little.

531
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:16,759
Yes.

532
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:18,279
Just... Just draw normally.

533
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,200
Your drawing is just like Qi Laoliu's.

534
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,559
Do you know how to draw?

535
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,680
Bro,

536
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,680
did you enter the police station through the back door?

537
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,480
Fine, fine. I'll draw.

538
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,519
Brother-in-law,

539
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,079
are you okay?

540
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,599
How many times have I told you?

541
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,599
What should I call you

542
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,960
at the police station? Sir, are you okay?

543
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,000
Let me ask you,

544
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,640
this Wangjiawan Hutong,

545
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,359
Where ghosts don't even live,

546
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,039
you're not allowed to pay for the epidemic prevention.

547
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,279
Let me tell you,

548
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,599
the management fee is not enough this month,

549
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:02,119
Wait for it to be deducted from your monthly rules.

550
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,640
Detective,

551
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,839
please calm down.

552
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:07,160
The director's wife said,

553
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,519
the epidemic prevention fee,

554
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,799
Yaxin Pharmaceuticals paid a penny

555
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,759
without our help.

556
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,559
They gave it to me. Be polite

557
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,079
when you see the director's wife.

558
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,400
With a little insight,

559
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,440
we need these big consortia

560
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,720
to contribute to our investment

561
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,359
in Northern Zhou,

562
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,359
Okay, okay.

563
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,000
They're close.

564
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,200
Detective Fang?

565
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,640
Ziwu ordered us

566
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,279
to search the whole city like this,

567
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,440
Don't worry. Cousin

568
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,559
won't be able to escape.

569
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,799
By the way,

570
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:48,920
the fare for last month's carriage and horse.

571
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,480
Don't forget to give it to the brothers,

572
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,640
and finish it first.

573
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:51,880
Yes.

574
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,359
That's right.

575
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:55,519
Don't hurt him.

576
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,240
His physique is different from that of ordinary people,

577
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:59,200
and he might be the last hope of North Zhou City.

578
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,920
Dr. Pan, don't worry,

579
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:04,680
my men are the best in a hundred.

580
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,200
I really didn't see it.

581
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,039
I'm leaving too.

582
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:17,119
If he can't find anyone,

583
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:19,079
clean up the quarantine area of Beizhou Hospital immediately

584
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:21,279
and leave no one behind.

585
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:22,839
Including Mr. Zhang,

586
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,200
and Ouyang, who was just discharged from hospital,

587
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,079
Yes.

588
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,160
Second grandpa,

589
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,680
you little girl film,

590
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,720
I was looking for you.

591
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,319
The pneumonic plague is so severe outside,

592
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:56,799
you are not allowed to run around in the future,

593
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,960
Second grandpa, don't worry.

594
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,480
We found the source.

595
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,079
Maybe everyone will be saved.

596
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,480
Where's Yan Ying?

597
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,319
He hasn't been out of the house before.

598
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,119
He must be fast asleep.

599
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:06,880
I'll go find him.

600
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,160
Yan Ying, Yan Ying,

601
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,319
wake up.

602
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,359
Yan Ying.

603
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,759
Yan Ying,

604
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:17,640
Yan Ying,

605
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,920
Don't move! Get out of the way!

606
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:20,480
Second grandpa,

607
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,000
go get some incense wormwood.

608
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,640
Okay.

609
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,240
Zhenlong.

610
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,599
Jeong Yong,

611
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,559
Master,

612
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,039
Zhenlong.

613
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,519
Zhenlong, wait for me.

614
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:20,800
Zhenlong.

615
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,920
Second grandpa,

616
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,440
we were plotted against by someone,

617
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,880
We're new here. We didn't mess with anyone.

618
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:32,760
Look,

619
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,800
His skin is blue,

620
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
his whole body is soft,

621
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,239
It also attracted a lot of bugs.

622
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,679
I got it.

623
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,480
I know someone who can save him.

624
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,280
I'll go find him.

625
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:07,480
Why hasn't Yan Yun come back yet?

626
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,519
Is it so hard to find a swallow eagle?

627
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:11,360
You should have come back if you walk backwards.

628
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,199
It seems that you care a lot about Miss Yan Yun.

629
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,480
What are you talking about?

630
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,079
Let me tell you,

631
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,480
All the money I've spent

632
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,400
since I started treating pneumonic plague,

633
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,239
She has to reimburse me.

634
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,360
In that case, you're my employer.

635
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:28,639
A loyal minister doesn't wait on the Second Master,

636
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,440
Mr. Pan,

637
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:32,360
It seems that you are collecting money from both sides,

638
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:33,679
without losing money inside or outside.

639
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:40,320
She can only be regarded as the loyalty of the Jianghu.

640
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,920
It's a serious business with you.

641
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,119
But what remains the same,

642
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:50,159
is my life of working hard day and night.

643
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,800
In the cold wind,

644
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:55,519
I didn't drink anything warm.

645
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,440
Just one sip.

646
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,639
And some

647
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,000
Li Zhenlong Where are you going?

648
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,159
Ziwu,

649
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:01,519
he's about five feet four inches tall.

650
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,199
It concerns the lives of the citizens of Northern Zhou.

651
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,960
Find him

652
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,679
and send him to the North Zhou Police Station.

653
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,639
Or assist the captors,

654
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,440
and reward them with 500 oceans.

655
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:13,199
500 oceans,

656
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,440
500 oceans.

657
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,480
Stop!

658
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,760
Stop!

659
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:24,960
Stop running!

660
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,639
Stop!

661
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:27,760
Get out of the way!

662
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,679
Stop!

663
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,280
Stop running!

664
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,440
Do you think that's meridian?

665
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,199
Go, go, go, go, go.

666
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:48,920
Get out of the way!

667
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:49,880
Stop him!

668
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,079
Get out of my way!

669
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:51,760
Stop!

670
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:54,800
Hurry up. Drive faster.

671
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:57,239
Stop!

672
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:08,239
Stop!

673
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,079
This way.

674
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:15,880
Get out of the way!

675
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,079
You.

676
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:19,920
Stop, stop,

677
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,679
stop. Surround this place.

678
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:25,760
Get out of the way!

679
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:38,239
I told you not to hurt him.

680
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:39,480
He even chased him around with a gun.

681
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,599
What if you get hurt?

682
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:41,440
He's not a criminal.

683
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,960
The whole city is waiting for him to save us.

684
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,880
Then you are not allowed to go in.

685
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,800
I treated him,

686
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,320
but he won't run away when he sees me.

687
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,119
Is that okay?

688
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,760
You can't go up there.

689
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:02,360
Pan Jun,

690
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:03,880
why are you running away?

691
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,119
I'm going to save my master.

692
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,000
You saved my master.

693
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,960
Pan Jun, I'm sorry.

694
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,599
Ziwu, don't run!

695
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:18,679
I saw you.

696
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,199
Ziwu, you are very important now.

697
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:23,960
The pneumonic plague patients in North Zhou City depend on you.

698
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,760
Follow my advice and come with me.

699
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,760
To save people.

700
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,280
Say something. Ziwu,

701
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,440
Ziwu,
