1
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,120
Forget it.

2
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,359
The visitors are all guests.

3
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,400
You missed the feast,

4
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,359
I'll make it up for you.

5
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,240
Ouyang Xi, serve the wine.

6
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,919
It's Old Master.

7
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,159
Please

8
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,199
I'll do it first as a toast.

9
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,000
Xin Mei,

10
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,919
Please.

11
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,800
In front of everyone,

12
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,159
you'd better leave some retreat for yourself.

13
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,000
As early as 24 years ago,

14
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,639
when I climbed out of the dead,

15
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,240
I didn't give myself a way out.

16
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,560
In those two stones,

17
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,879
it was so easy for you to distinguish between true and false.

18
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,439
But you were so indiscriminate

19
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,439
that you insisted that the piece my father took was fake,

20
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,879
Have you really never doubted the Xue family

21
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,039
in charge of Luoshi?

22
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,280
The Xue family and our Zerg Five Clans are in the same breath,

23
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,800
Your father, Lord He,

24
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,719
escorted our Zerg family and humiliated the entire tribe in Bamen Mountain.

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,719
When your father gave Luo Shi,

26
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,439
it was a plot

27
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,840
to uproot the Zerg.

28
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,599
Heaven has no eyes and evil people get what they want,

29
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,960
Bamen Mountain is bleeding profusely.

30
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,719
today

31
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,719
The death of the Zerg is all thanks to you.

32
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,840
Nonsense.

33
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,719
Grandpa, that's not what happened.

34
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,599
Senior Ouyang,

35
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,360
look at the letter in your hand.

36
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,680
That's a letter written by Clan Leader Xue himself,

37
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,720
which contains everything that happened.

38
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,160
You wronged her.

39
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,600
As a gentleman of the Department of Wood,

40
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
I guarantee, Senior Ouyang,

41
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,399
Back then,

42
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,839
the Luo Shi provided by the He family was indeed

43
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,000
the river stone handed over by the real Xue family was fake.

44
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,920
Did you hear that?

45
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,360
You saw it, didn't you?

46
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,720
You were wrong back then.

47
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,319
You're the one who deserves to die.

48
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,879
The one who deserves to be tortured by thousands of insects

49
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,519
is also your grandfather,

50
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,040
Mother,

51
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:55,879
Yan Ying.

52
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,079
Yan Ying.

53
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,079
Grandpa,

54
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,600
are you really going to be so cruel?

55
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,519
Are you going to kill my mother?

56
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,079
Yan Ying,

57
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,319
it's been 20 years,

58
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,480
I hate that iron can't be made into steel,

59
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,279
until today you have the blood.

60
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:23,160
It's a pity that you're confused.

61
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,959
The gun in your hand is pointing at the wrong person.

62
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,000
Get out of my way!

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,879
Grandpa.

64
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,199
If you want to kill my mother,

65
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,800
kill me first.

66
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,000
Do you think

67
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,399
I dare not?

68
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,040
Yan Yun, be careful.

69
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,600
Ziwu,

70
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,800
Ziwu,

71
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:14,959
Ziwu.

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,759
Ziwu.

73
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,279
Ziwu,

74
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,079
Stop!

75
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,120
You go first.

76
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,800
Stop!

77
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,120
Stop fighting!

78
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,439
Ziwu,

79
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,319
Yan Yun,

80
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,199
Yanyun, listen to me. Go with grandpa.

81
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,199
I'm not leaving.

82
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,560
Come on, come on,

83
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,120
Master,

84
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,160
-Hurry up. -Master, let's

85
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,839
go. It's too dangerous here.

86
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,120
Yan Yun, go!

87
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,639
Hurry up and save her.

88
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,199
Ziwu,

89
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,480
Get up.

90
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,160
If I don't let you come,

91
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,879
do I have to come to make you happy like this?

92
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,279
Ziwu,

93
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,480
Ziwu, I'm sorry,

94
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,399
I really didn't expect this to happen.

95
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:43,920
Ziwu,

96
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:44,800
Ziwu.

97
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,439
Ziwu,

98
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,000
Ziwu,

99
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,399
They went in the direction of the arsenal,

100
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,279
Kim So-mee,

101
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,600
Let's go.

102
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,439
Grandpa,

103
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,319
Grandpa.

104
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,439
Sister,

105
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,839
Grandpa and Mom went to the arsenal,

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,120
I really don't want to see anyone get hurt again.

107
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,000
Sister,

108
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,399
how is Ziwu?

109
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,439
Can you save him?

110
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,639
It's all because of you

111
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,439
that you're giving me lunch.

112
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,360
Pan Jun,

113
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,600
come on,

114
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,160
It's already like this.

115
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,839
Do you want to waste more time?

116
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,480
Do your Ouyang family

117
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,320
still want to bear another blood debt?

118
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,279
Ziwu, hang in there.

119
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,120
Pan Jun,

120
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,600
I volunteered.

121
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,720
Don't blame Yanyun.

122
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,279
Will you shut your mouth?

123
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Ouyang Leiyun,

124
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,960
decades of grudges,

125
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,120
Let's put an end to it today.

126
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,720
No one is allowed to follow us.

127
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,919
If I remember correctly,

128
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,080
in your Fire Department's arsenal,

129
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,679
With more than 700 jin of explosives,

130
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,320
I'm going to die today.

131
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,799
You have to go on the road with me.

132
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:36,960
Gentleman, Young Master Yanying,

133
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
you can't go in there.

134
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,919
Get out of the way!

135
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,360
No one is allowed to go in today.

136
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,919
Can you solve the problem inside?

137
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,320
Can you?

138
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,080
Gentleman,

139
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,279
Inside,

140
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,759
It's too dangerous inside.

141
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,200
Now, only if Yan Ying and I go in,

142
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,679
can we convince them.

143
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,879
Do you want to see everyone die here?

144
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,320
Trust me,

145
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,840
I'll bring them out safely.

146
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,480
Mother,

147
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,440
Mother, grandpa,

148
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,440
Mother,

149
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,600
If you insist on killing Grandpa today,

150
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,879
we'll die together in the arsenal.

151
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,759
-Who told you to come in? -Get out.

152
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,200
Mother,

153
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,360
Mother,

154
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,200
Don't be afraid. I've been waiting

155
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,519
for the reunion of my mother and son for 20 years.

156
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,919
If I can't live with you today,

157
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
I'll die with you.

158
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,879
Yan Ying,

159
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,159
get out!

160
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,399
Sister, as I said,

161
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,759
if you want to kill my mother, kill me first.

162
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,919
Senior Lei Yun Boss Jin,

163
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,519
you two don't care about blood and water,

164
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,639
Do we have to go all the way to the dark?

165
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,799
Grandpa,

166
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,480
what you did is hurting both sides.

167
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,200
Wan Jiajun will be the only one who will benefit.

168
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,440
You have to look at your flesh and blood.

169
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,360
Blocking the muzzle of the Wan Army with flesh and blood?

170
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,720
Mother,

171
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,120
I've been waiting for you for half my life.

172
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:06,759
He has traveled more than half of the mountains and rivers for you.

173
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,159
At the top of the mountain and the edge of the world,

174
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,399
he went there for you.

175
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,879
He's waiting for you outside Ba Song City right now.

176
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,360
Mother,

177
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,759
Everyone in Ba Song said,

178
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,120
I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth.

179
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,679
I want the wind to win. I want the rain to rain.

180
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,480
What else can I not be satisfied with?

181
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,200
However,

182
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,840
no one has ever asked me

183
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,840
what I really want?

184
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,679
I just want you and father to come back.

185
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,759
I just want a complete family.

186
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,360
I just want a complete family.

187
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,600
You worthless thing.

188
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,039
I've raised you for 20 years.

189
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,960
It's a waste of time.

190
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,879
Don't point a gun at my son.

191
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,360
Okay,

192
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,840
Okay,

193
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,639
Then.

194
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,159
I'll give my life for my life,

195
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:27,919
and kill you.

196
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,519
Grandpa,

197
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,360
ever since Yan Yun was born,

198
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,279
You've been teaching me how to order soldiers on the battlefield,

199
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,559
I don't care how hard it is.

200
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,879
I never dare to shout tired.

201
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,600
Because I'm afraid I'll let you down.

202
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,240
Now that I'm a fire gentleman,

203
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,840
I'll do my best

204
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,759
to ensure Ba Song's safety.

205
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,519
But if,

206
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,279
if you insist on

207
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,919
killing my mother today.

208
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,240
For all the things you've given me,

209
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,879
I'd rather have nothing.

210
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,799
Ouyang Leiyun,

211
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,080
I, He Xinmei,

212
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,320
The enmity between you and me in this life

213
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,159
has been written off.

214
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,639
Mother,

215
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,480
Mother,

216
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,080
Mother,

217
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,440
Your Highness,

218
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,399
Mr. Jin,

219
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,559
Mother.

220
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Do you want

221
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:40,759
something to eat?

222
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:43,080
No need.

223
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,320
Pan Jun,

224
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,360
get out.

225
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,919
You know what?

226
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,120
Ever since the soil system was gone

227
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,720
and the family was destroyed,

228
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,240
No one has been so nice to me.

229
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,720
I'm sorry

230
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,039
for what you did.

231
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:28,919
Let me propose a toast to you.

232
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,399
If 10 thousand goes in alone,

233
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,039
only one can come out.

234
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,320
No way.

235
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:49,960
Ziwu, you can't go.

236
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,039
Pan Jun,

237
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,879
my master asked me to go,

238
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,840
I have to

239
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:57,320
release Ziwu and Yan Yun,

240
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:58,519
Pan Jun,

241
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:01,399
the contract says Ziwu who lives

242
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,920
and dies together,

243
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,799
Did we sign a contract?

244
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,160
Live and die together!

245
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,759
Wake up now!

246
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,279
Yan Ying.

247
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
Calm down.

248
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,000
Boss Jin's condition

249
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,680
is not very serious.

250
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,440
Will she pass out if it's not serious?

251
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,279
My grandpa is right.

252
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,759
I'm a loser.

253
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,240
I'm just a worthless person.

254
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,680
I can't protect anyone.

255
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,359
Yan Ying,

256
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,680
don't worry.

257
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,799
Mr. Jin will get better.

258
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,519
Wait for me here.

259
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,640
I'll go find Brother Pan

260
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,319
and find a way.

261
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,559
At Shin time today,

262
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,799
Ba Song Garrison took over Ba Song

263
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,839
and told the public that

264
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:47,079
another Zerg democracy

265
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,599
had moved to report to the camp.

266
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:51,079
Reward me.

267
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,880
Reward me.

268
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,000
This move should be called

269
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,000
"two tigers fight against each other" and there must be one injury.

270
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,119
Am I right?

271
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:07,079
Now you, a tiger outside the city,

272
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:09,599
can sit in Ba Song City.

273
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,200
Wan Jiacheng,

274
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,960
you did a good job this time.

275
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:17,200
It's a pity that

276
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,720
Kim So-mi didn't kill Ouyang Leiyun,

277
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:20,680
It's okay.

278
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,759
There's still a chance.

279
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:42,200
Master,

280
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,880
nearly 100 of our people

281
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,960
died.

282
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,720
70 or 80 guns were damaged.

283
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:51,799
Put the rest of you together.

284
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,119
I'll leave the rest to Yanyun.

285
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:58,519
Yes.

286
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,799
Master,

287
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,640
that girl named Duan Xiao'e is here to see Pan Jun.

288
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,640
I'm afraid Xinmei is seriously ill.

289
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,440
She's the only one who came back.

290
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,039
Yes.

291
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:15,880
Let her in.

292
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:26,720
Go back and get some sleep.

293
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
Let's take your place.

294
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,200
No, thanks.

295
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,440
I have to keep an eye on Ziwu.

296
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,000
Don't wait for my son to wake up at noon.

297
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:35,759
You look so pale

298
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:36,920
that you fell ill again.

299
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,000
Alright,

300
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,720
I said I won't go.

301
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,119
Pan Jun,

302
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,440
you're too noisy.

303
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,000
Ziwu, you're awake.

304
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,359
Let me tell you,

305
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,319
can you stop doing this next time?

306
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,559
Your life,

307
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:00,680
keep your voice down.

308
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:02,039
I just woke up at noon.

309
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,559
Pan Jun,

310
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,319
stop scolding me.

311
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,480
What will you say in the future?

312
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,119
I'll listen to them all,

313
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:12,680
everybody

314
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,359
You're not hurt, are you?

315
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,720
You're such a fool.

316
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:17,920
Which one of us can get hurt?

317
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:19,880
As long as no one gets hurt.

318
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,519
Yanyun,

319
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,359
where's your grandpa?

320
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,200
My grandpa.

321
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,119
My grandpa is fine,

322
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,400
thanks to you,

323
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm glad you're fine.

324
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,119
I'm glad you're fine.

325
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,039
Touch your hands?

326
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,079
Yanyun,

327
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:52,319
I won't leave you again.

328
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,759
God bless me.

329
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,119
I knew Ziwu would be fine.

330
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,319
I was so close.

331
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:19,400
I'm telling you, he won't be so lucky next time.

332
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,720
By the way, how is Boss Jin?

333
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,599
After we left the arsenal,

334
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,559
Boss Jin's health went downhill,

335
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:34,440
He has been unconscious until now.

336
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,559
She has been unconscious.

337
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,599
She has persisted for more than 20 years.

338
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,240
It can't be today.

339
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,359
Pan Jun, let's go now.

340
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,559
Let's do it together

341
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,720
Let's go.

342
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,839
Miss Yan Yun,

343
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,559
the Wan Army's motorcade has arrived at the gate of our mansion,

344
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:57,759
The servants all say that

345
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,640
the sky of Ba Song is about to change.

346
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:03,519
With my Ouyang family in Ba Song,

347
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:05,440
who dares to change Ba Song's life?

348
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:06,640
Yanyun,

349
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,319
how about this?

350
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,920
You stay and help your grandpa,

351
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,240
I'll take care of Boss Jin,

352
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,279
Yan Yun,

353
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,000
guard Ouyang Mansion,

354
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:16,880
To protect the people of Ba Song,

355
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,960
you are now a gentleman of Fire Branch,

356
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:20,319
You can't leave.

357
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,279
Yanyun,

358
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,960
listen to me,

359
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:28,640
Now Ouyang Family and Boss Jin

360
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,680
are hurting each other.

361
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,359
Be careful.

362
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,440
The Wanjia Army

363
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,000
will take advantage of it.

364
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:40,880
All right,

365
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,039
don't move now.

366
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:52,839
Okay,

367
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,839
Then I'll stay at Ouyang's Mansion.

368
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:56,160
Keep an eye on Wan Jiajun.

369
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,160
I'm counting on you for everything about my mother.

370
00:23:59,079 --> 00:23:59,920
Don't worry.

371
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,680
I'll do my best.

372
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,200
Let's go.

373
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,480
You two wait for me here.

374
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:17,440
Yes

375
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,079
Greetings, Senior Lei Yun.

376
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,319
Greetings, Miss Yanyun.

377
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,880
Congratulations, Miss Yanyun,

378
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,799
for officially becoming a gentleman of Fire Branch.

379
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,279
Wan Jiacheng,

380
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:48,880
they all say that you are a general of the Wanchao Sect.

381
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:52,200
A young man is old and resourceful,

382
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:55,960
and what he said today is true.

383
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,319
I admire you.

384
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,119
Compared to you,

385
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:01,960
Jiacheng is far worse.

386
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:06,200
Please.

387
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,160
After you

388
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
Serve the tea.

389
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:22,799
This time, Jiacheng came here specially,

390
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,160
because Mr. Ouyang

391
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:25,839
agreed to our battalion commander's marriage.

392
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,119
Jiacheng is here to talk to you.

393
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,119
In a few days,

394
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:32,640
our battalion commander will come to propose marriage in person,

395
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,039
There is such a thing.

396
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,559
Mr. Ouyang is officially in charge of the Fire Department,

397
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,720
which is a happy event.

398
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,640
Senior Lei Yun defeated Kim So-Mei.

399
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,160
This is Second Joy.

400
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,160
If you can succeed in this matter,

401
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,960
it will be a triple blessing.

402
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,759
I'm here to congratulate Jiacheng in advance.

403
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,599
As for this matter,

404
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,119
we have to discuss it with Yanyun's father.

405
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,359
My father is still in your hands.

406
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:00,359
Here's the thing,

407
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,960
Mr. Yanlei has been sent to Boss Jin's camp

408
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,039
by our battalion commander.

409
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:07,480
First,

410
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:09,480
Mr. Yanlei insisted,

411
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,680
Second,

412
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,359
it's our battalion commander,

413
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:15,000
I don't want to offend my future father-in-law.

414
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,680
Are you going to be Commander Wan's lobbyist?

415
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,319
Our coach gave you a lot of praise.

416
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,920
If you can cooperate with him sincerely,

417
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,799
it will be a blessing for the people.

418
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:32,200
It can keep the Southwest peaceful,

419
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,119
isn't it beautiful?

420
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,359
So,

421
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,319
Yan Yun's marriage,

422
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,400
It has to be done.

423
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,559
Senior said so.

424
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,480
That means even more happiness,

425
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,319
Jiacheng will report it to the coach right away.

426
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,240
No rush.

427
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,440
No rush.

428
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:59,839
I, Ouyang Leiyun, care about

429
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,880
reciprocity the most.

430
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,839
Don't worry,

431
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:07,799
our coach

432
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:10,680
will make a deal

433
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,319
that will satisfy the people of Ba Song,

434
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:13,839
Goodbye,

435
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,519
see off the guests.

436
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,440
Stop!

437
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,200
I'm looking for Boss Jin,

438
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,960
Father,

439
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:40,880
Father,

440
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,240
You're here.

441
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,319
Where is your mother?

442
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,480
It's inside.

443
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,039
Mei'er was tortured by the Zerg

444
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,480
to eat bones with thousands of insects.

445
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,640
She was poisoned,

446
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,480
but no one found her body.

447
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,240
That's why I believe she's still alive.

448
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,480
The redness on her left thumb,

449
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,000
near the metacarpophalangeal joint,

450
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,720
has spread to the entire back of her hand.

451
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,319
The poison developed.

452
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,680
It's even better than I thought.

453
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,960
So we have to get rid of the poison now.

454
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:57,799
Well, Xiao'e,

455
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,119
heat a pot of hot wine,

456
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,119
-Heat the wine. -Yes. Hurry

457
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,240
up.

458
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,400
Okay.

459
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:15,400
What?

460
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,559
You're in a bad mood.

461
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,799
I saw Boss Jin

462
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:31,480
lying there just now,

463
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,400
The first person that comes to mind,

464
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,200
is my mother.

465
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:37,559
You know what?

466
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,839
The thing I regret the most in my life,

467
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,519
is that I didn't learn to pick up a gun early

468
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:44,119
to protect my mother

469
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:48,279
and sister Shi Shi,

470
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,720
Am I selfish?

471
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,440
I hated fighting and killing since I was a child.

472
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,799
I just want to protect my family.

473
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,519
I've been looking forward to it for 20 years.

474
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,799
In the end,

475
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,839
I could only watch my loved ones

476
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,240
lose both sides.

477
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,480
I finally found my own mother.

478
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,039
But she can only lie there.

479
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,079
Tell me,

480
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:17,559
is it because I didn't point the gun

481
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:19,519
at the Zerg's real enemy,

482
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,200
If it weren't for everyone,

483
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,759
then our little family,

484
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:27,440
It's just a small boat in the torrent,

485
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,200
which can be overturned by huge waves at any time.

486
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,279
I can't keep my dream,

487
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:34,799
and my family.

488
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,359
Yan Ying,

489
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,839
it's time to pull yourself together.

490
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:51,000
Department of Wood has superb medical skills. Thank you.

491
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,119
If my father were here,

492
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,279
it would be better.

493
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,319
The hot wine is here.

494
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,319
Mei'er.

495
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,200
Mei'er,

496
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,319
you're awake.

497
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,759
Mei'er.

498
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:59,079
Mei'er,

499
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:01,559
is that you?

500
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:02,680
Yes.

501
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,319
I'm Smoke Thunder.

502
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,559
I thought I would never

503
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,279
see you again in my life.

504
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,039
I knew you weren't dead.

505
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:41,000
Can you hug me?

506
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,480
You're a grown man and you still need a hug.

507
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:59,279
I'm sorry for Ziwu.

508
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,400
Have you ever thought about giving up the treasure?

509
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,480
Far away from the world.

510
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:18,440
How could I not have thought about it?

511
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,360
It's just,

512
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
Not now.

513
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,760
I know.

514
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,639
You don't want to give up the treasure,

515
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,840
you can't give up the Zerg?

516
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,400
The one who knows me,

517
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,360
Miaomiao, is also.

518
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:42,920
Pan Jun,

519
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:46,320
your choice,

520
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,079
It's also my choice.

521
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:00,760
Brother Pan,

522
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,280
go and check on Mr. Jin.

523
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,519
New Student Weekly,

524
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,880
Journal of Geological Studies,

525
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,440
The article published by Lianhe,

526
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,880
called Lu You Frozen to Death Bone,

527
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,800
He is suspected of insulting officials at all levels.

528
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,519
Exaggerate the disaster,

529
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,360
confuse people,

530
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,880
All the newspapers have been ordered

531
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,679
to remove the false articles.

532
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:28,360
If it's published again,

533
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:30,400
stop publishing immediately.

534
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,800
Who has so many things to do?

535
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,880
Catch him and kill

536
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:34,880
the battalion commander,

537
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:38,119
You shut up the literati,

538
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,320
and don't let them vent their anger in the newspaper.

539
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,360
They'll make a scene in the streets.

540
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,199
Go to the school,

541
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,880
or even come to our door.

542
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,000
Sit down and say that

543
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,119
there are a few literate people in this wild land

544
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,599
who can't even eat.

545
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,199
How many people can afford newspapers?

546
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,159
Who can be bewitched by this?

547
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,719
Let's just

548
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,239
let it go.

549
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:01,480
Battalion Commander,

550
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,599
this man's name is Gao Huaiyuan,

551
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,800
It's a Chinese doctor living in Great Britain.

552
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,280
Gao Huaiyuan,

553
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,960
if he doesn't cure the disease and save people,

554
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:13,039
After reading foreign ink for a few years,

555
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,800
he slandered us in foreign newspapers.

556
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,800
As for the disaster in Ba Song,

557
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,559
he put the photos

558
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,840
of the victims in foreign newspapers,

559
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:27,159
The whole city is full of wind and rain.

560
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:28,599
Ba Song,

561
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,079
if there's no one to pick him up,

562
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,320
I don't believe he made

563
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,639
such a big noise alone.

564
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,920
Who took care of him?

565
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,280
Did you find out?

566
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,239
I found out that

567
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,519
Gao Huaiyuan had a close friend when he was abroad,

568
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:48,519
The son of Ouyang Family Ouyang Yanlei.

569
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:49,960
Ouyang Yanlei.

570
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,599
My father-in-law

571
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,960
is interesting.

572
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:00,800
What's more interesting is that

573
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,559
Gao Huaiyuan is a false name,

574
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,079
Can you finish it all at once?

575
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:12,159
He's most likely a member of the Zerg Clan,

576
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,719
Pan Yingxuan.

577
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,320
It's too much trouble for you to send telegrams

578
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,039
to an old man. I don't want to take care of it anymore.

579
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,960
You should hurry up with that herbalist's trial.

580
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:33,519
Get out of the way!

581
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:47,800
Looks like

582
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,920
I underestimated the Bone Devouring Poison of Thousand Insects.

583
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,239
Now I can only try my best to help Boss Jin,

584
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,440
buy more time,

585
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,320
If my father were here,

586
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,559
there would be a better way.

587
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,119
I have another idea.

588
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,480
It just needs to be verified.

589
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:00,480
What?

590
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,199
The blood of the herbalist,

591
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,679
Yes.

592
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,920
It was mentioned in the Tiangong Collection,

593
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,760
saying that the blood of Master of Human Resources and Grassland can cure all poisons.

594
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,199
However,

595
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:12,559
there are no records of successful cases.

596
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,639
It's no use talking about it now.

597
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,719
Ziwu is still lying in bed and can't get down.

598
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,239
Who's going to test the herbalist?

599
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,000
Jiacheng,

600
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,280
Shuai,

601
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,079
Pan Jun can be destroyed by just one wood department.

602
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,639
Jin Sumei is competing with Ouyang Family's two tigers,

603
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,360
so he doesn't have to stay anymore.

604
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,159
Do you have something on your mind?

605
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:55,599
Yanyun,

606
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,199
where did your marriage with that smoker Wanhushan

607
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,559
come from?

608
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:04,559
I promised to marry Wan Hushan from the beginning,

609
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:05,719
which was a delaying tactic.

610
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:07,519
I want to keep it safe.

611
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,199
Only Ouyang Mansion

612
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,000
is a life-long event.

613
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,199
How can it be used as a game?

614
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,599
My granddaughter won the bet this time,

615
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,119
but on your birthday banquet,

616
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:20,039
The Wan Army has been standing still,

617
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,239
Grandpa,

618
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,719
These things

619
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,800
are not important to me anymore.

620
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,639
You've grown up.

621
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,719
You've learned to keep me in suspense. Grandpa

622
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,000
and granddaughter are no longer children.

623
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,719
Grandpa,

624
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,639
how should we deal with the Wan Army now?

625
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,119
is the most important thing.

626
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:49,480
Yes,

627
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,519
I'd like to recommend someone to you,

628
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,039
It can balance the ten thousand armies.

629
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,360
If you have this kind of talent,

630
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,679
tell me about it.

631
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,519
How about Mr. Ouyang buying me a drink?
