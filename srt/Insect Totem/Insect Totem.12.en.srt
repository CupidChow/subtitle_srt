1
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,640
I'm an expert.

2
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,599
Medical experts,

3
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,480
experts who study bacteria.

4
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,840
I, Jin Shun, don't have much skill,

5
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,840
so I can only ask about news and old news.

6
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,479
Tell me.

7
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,479
What do you want from me?

8
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,360
Two things,

9
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,560
One

10
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,479
Gold Secret Treasure,

11
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,039
Two,

12
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,400
He Luo Shi.

13
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,639
One,

14
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:42,400
I was expelled from the school long ago by Master.

15
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,560
Not to mention the secret treasure.

16
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,879
Two,

17
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,599
The Heluo Stone is in your lair in Lingcheng,

18
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,759
but you can't even find such a good Yaxin Club.

19
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,039
You're counting on me?

20
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,759
Everyone is smart.

21
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,280
Since I invited you here,

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,080
I've found out

23
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,520
everything about you.

24
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,680
Can we cut to the chase?

25
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,879
Don't waste each other's time.

26
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,159
Heluo Stone

27
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,000
was built by the ancestors of your Jin family.

28
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,159
In this world, very,

29
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,520
very few people have seen it.

30
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,360
However,

31
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,960
the descendants of the Jin family,

32
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,840
We can tell whether it's true or not no matter what.

33
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,479
I don't want to repeat the mistakes I made 24 years ago.

34
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,080
I need to find the real Heluoshi,

35
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,520
and,

36
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,879
Mrs. Matsui,

37
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,680
didn't I plant the Golden Silkworm for you?

38
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,520
With this,

39
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,520
you have to find it.

40
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,240
You really know everything?

41
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,639
Ling City is such a big place,

42
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,599
my eyes and ears are everywhere,

43
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,800
What about Yaxin?

44
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,199
For me, a mere golden silkworm

45
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,159
can be easily removed.

46
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,319
But have you ever thought,

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,919
if

48
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,199
I'm poisoning you.

49
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,039
I'll give you a shot

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,040
of our newly invented bacterial test,

51
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,079
At that time,

52
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:19,639
in this world,

53
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,759
No one can save you.

54
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,920
You'll be so sad at that time.

55
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,279
At that time,

56
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,680
You.

57
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,120
You'll die without a corpse.

58
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,000
If you want the real Heluo Stone,

59
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,720
you have to go to the Thousand Worm Altar,

60
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,959
Otherwise, there is no other way.

61
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,439
Isn't that right?

62
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,600
The Zerg kids have arrived in Ling City.

63
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,600
I still need you.

64
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,600
Bring me

65
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,079
all their secret treasures!

66
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,399
Even if Kim So-mi is very capable,

67
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,040
but if he opens the door to the Zerg treasure,

68
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,319
It can only be me, Fengchen Jun.

69
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,279
You're amazing.

70
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,759
You're not that good. You can do it yourself.

71
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,199
You all stare at me one by one.

72
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,879
Okay,

73
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,920
Sooner or later, I'll die anyway.

74
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,240
Let me tell you,

75
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,160
those kids from the five departments are not fools.

76
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,720
It's not hard for us to think that

77
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,920
they can lure fish into the bait.

78
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,639
Don't throw yourself into the net in the end.

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,959
Me

80
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,800
I tried my best to help you.

81
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:54,839
The whole Yaxin

82
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
will also help you.

83
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,160
Then tell me the addresses and movements

84
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,639
of these kids first,

85
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,079
I won't greet you.

86
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,399
Stay out of it.

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,879
Deal

88
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,279
Jeong

89
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:53,759
Zhenlong.

90
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,879
Anyone here?

91
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,040
Is there anyone?

92
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,279
I'm an experimenter.

93
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,079
I'm not feeling well.

94
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,199
-Is there anyone here? -Come here.

95
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,519
You're in a good state of mind.

96
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,199
Look at this. I have a rash here.

97
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,959
Where is it?

98
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,839
Here.

99
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,800
Jeong Yong,

100
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,480
Jeong Yong,

101
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,480
Zhenlong.

102
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,639
Master.

103
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,240
Master, it's Ziwu.

104
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,120
Ziwu,

105
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,240
Why are you here?

106
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,000
Just wait.

107
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,600
I'll get you out now.

108
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,279
Ziwu,

109
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,919
don't waste your energy.

110
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,200
My life is not that important.

111
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,440
The target of the Yin and Yang Dao

112
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,679
is the Zerg treasure.

113
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,000
But even if he gathers the Five Series Secret Treasures,

114
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,080
and gets Xue Jiahe Luoshi,

115
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,679
He will never

116
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,799
get the Zerg's treasure.

117
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,600
That's because,

118
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,000
in this world,

119
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,279
I can't find the second herbalist.

120
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,120
Master of Human Resources and Grass,

121
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:21,200
Five Series Secret Treasures into the jungle,

122
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,000
The fog filled the barrier bridge,

123
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,240
carrying river rocks across the tunnel,

124
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,879
If you want to pass

125
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,840
the barrier bridge on the second pass,

126
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,879
We must be led by Master Ren Cao,

127
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,360
the barrier bridge is chaotic,

128
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,159
It's a tiny bug called Carefree Bee.

129
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,120
Crowds?

130
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
Covering the sky and the sun,

131
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,000
it will eat up all living things.

132
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,039
Only a person with a different constitution

133
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,399
can be dispelled by a herbalist.

134
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,759
But the last herbalist in the world,

135
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,919
those years

136
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,960
He died at Shi Shi Yu's hands.

137
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,399
So,

138
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,240
they really wasted their efforts.

139
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,320
Master,

140
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,120
that is to say,

141
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,120
Without a master,

142
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,120
we can't get the Zerg treasure.

143
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,279
Master,

144
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,000
Master,

145
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,240
We'll talk about this later.

146
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,399
I'll get you out first.

147
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,799
Ziwu,

148
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,039
listen to me,

149
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:56,480
You have to get out of here alive.

150
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,919
To protect the treasure,

151
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,360
to protect the Zerg,

152
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,399
Master wants you to be

153
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,120
a new person. Master Cao,

154
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,320
Ziwu, be careful.

155
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,360
I think she's actually quite kind,

156
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,279
and we agreed to visit Yaxin.

157
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,559
He doesn't mean to refuse at all.

158
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,000
Did you see this

159
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,639
at the AsiaInfo Club?

160
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,480
What's your name?

161
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,720
I forgot to ask his name. He only knows

162
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
his last name is Kim.

163
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,240
But there's always a chance to ask if it's okay.

164
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:55,279
If we ask too many questions as soon as we come up here,

165
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm afraid we'll get suspicious.

166
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
AsiaInfo

167
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,519
will be in the three-point world for a long time,

168
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,720
One is the director you know,

169
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,240
Matsui Shangyuan,

170
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,399
One is Young Master Fengchen Jun,

171
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,519
who is a medical maniac.

172
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,799
All the technical support of Yaxin Pharmaceutical

173
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,919
depends on him.

174
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,519
The other one is

175
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,360
Boss Jin, who is in charge of cosmeceuticals,

176
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,720
If I remember correctly,

177
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:23,919
her name should be

178
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,720
Kim So-mi,

179
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,840
All three of them covet the position of president.

180
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,759
Everyone knows,

181
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,720
who owns the Zerg treasure?

182
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,399
The future Yaxin

183
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,279
will be in the hands of someone.

184
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,840
Tell me about you,

185
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,360
you've been chatting with him for so long,

186
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,120
I'm going to visit her place.

187
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,879
I don't know his name.

188
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,840
You have to do this again next time.

189
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,600
No matter what the situation is,

190
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,759
life safety comes first.

191
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,799
Be careful. Do you hear me?

192
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,600
Thank you for your concern,

193
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,200
Brother Pan. It's fine.

194
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,320
That's it.

195
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,080
Next,

196
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,039
Miaomiao and I will continue to go to Xue Clan,

197
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,960
to find the whereabouts of He Luoshi and Jin Shun,

198
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,840
After that,

199
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,279
you can continue to go to Yaxin Club to inquire about the news,

200
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:26,240
Can't we be together?

201
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,960
cannot

202
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,080
Room service.

203
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,000
I'll bring you some fruits,

204
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,759
Jinshun.

205
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,639
Before my second grandfather went to Mount Fuzhou,

206
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,120
he had been thinking about you.

207
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,320
I specially asked Yan Ying to send you a letter in Rouge Lane.

208
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,279
But what about you?

209
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,759
He disappeared without a trace.

210
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,720
Our five departments agreed to go together,

211
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,039
why should you go first?

212
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,200
Me,

213
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm here to talk to you.

214
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,399
Calm down. Eat the fruit. It's a waste.

215
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:08,759
Come here.

216
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,600
Eat the fruit. Eat the fruit.

217
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,919
Since you showed up on your own initiative,

218
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,120
you must have found He Luo Shi.

219
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,559
I'm here for your help.

220
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,919
I can't do this on my own.

221
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,000
How did you know we were here?

222
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,360
I'll be honest with you then.

223
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,960
Fengchen Jun wants to kill you.

224
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,519
You all know who he is.

225
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,840
He is determined to

226
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,679
open this Zerg treasure,

227
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,759
Who can I help if I don't exist?

228
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,320
Today, Shi Miaomiao solved the golden silkworm for me,

229
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,519
and tomorrow he'll give me a shot.

230
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,080
I can't run even if I want to.

231
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,000
What about me?

232
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,399
He's just a jerk.

233
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,240
But then again,

234
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,679
we're all Zerg anyway,

235
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,840
So I'm here to remind you,

236
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,960
Xue Clan's Thousand Worm Altar,

237
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,799
He Luo Er Shi must be there.

238
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,440
If you don't want the Zerg treasure

239
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,519
to fall into the hands of others.

240
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,639
See you at the altar.

241
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,679
You lured the snake out of the hole.

242
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,000
Isn't it too blatant?

243
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,600
No, I just praised you for your cleverness. You … You … Take her

244
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,759
with you.

245
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:20,919
Go and see a doctor.

246
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,759
I'll prick you.

247
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,600
Who are you?

248
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:28,039
Brother Jin Shun,

249
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,080
Master.

250
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,440
Jin Wu Yi's disciple.

251
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,919
There is such a beautiful girl

252
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,639
in our department of gold,

253
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,759
Look at you.

254
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,240
My name is Duan Xiao'e.

255
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,679
He's the disciple of Master Jin Wuyi who closed the door.

256
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,960
Duan

257
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,000
Master didn't ask you to change your name to Jin.

258
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,639
Master is so nice to you.

259
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,919
To me

260
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,720
Room service is over.

261
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:15,399
The map of the Thousand Worm Altar. You need

262
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,600
the AsiaInfo Club.

263
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,600
I can't stay here for long. I'm leaving now.

264
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,279
By the way,

265
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,200
take good care of my junior sister.

266
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,919
I'm leaving.

267
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,399
Aren't they still going to Yaxin with Mr. Jin?

268
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,840
What matters now is the Thousand Worm Altar,

269
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:43,480
instead of going to the Yaxin Club,

270
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,279
Inquire about those uncertain news.

271
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,840
We might as well do it together.

272
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,639
What should we do now?

273
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,840
Can't you come up with your own ideas?

274
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,399
You have to ask Shi Miaomiao everything.

275
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,200
We were going to the Xue family's settlement,

276
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:10,920
so we should ask around.

277
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,880
All the way to the Thousand Worm Altar,

278
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,599
everyone together,

279
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,920
So as not to get separated.

280
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,319
What do you think?

281
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,839
I think so.

282
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,160
Yes,

283
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,640
but like Jin Shun said,

284
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,960
There must be an ambush in Fengchen Jun,

285
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,359
too many people are eyeing the Zerg treasure,

286
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,799
Think it through.

287
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,519
There must be

288
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,480
a lot of trouble for us along the way.

289
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,680
There's no going back.

290
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:39,240
Can you stop acting like you know the situation

291
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,759
and are brave and resourceful?

292
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,519
Now that we've decided to live and die together,

293
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,119
we know these things clearly.

294
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:52,559
Water,

295
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:53,839
Dry food,

296
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,960
all kinds of weapons, fire,

297
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,400
A traumatic injury drug,

298
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,359
a smoke agent, a hallucinogen,

299
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,279
Have you prepared

300
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,759
everything I said casually?

301
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,799
What weapons are Xue clan good at?

302
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,200
Do you know what insect technique

303
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,440
you're good at?

304
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,599
Who are their current chief priests?

305
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,559
What's your last name?

306
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,519
Why do you hate my Fifth Branch so much?

307
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,279
Don't tell me that

308
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:20,759
you know you're sneaking into danger

309
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:22,920
just casually.

310
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,079
I didn't prepare anything.

311
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,799
That is to die.

312
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,559
Do you hear me?

313
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
Get ready.

314
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,079
also

315
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,480
Every department's secret treasure,

316
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,319
be sure to carry it with you.

317
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,440
When they arrived at the Xue Family's settlement,

318
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:41,720
they were not only keeping an eye on He Luoshi,

319
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,400
And the secret treasures of various departments,

320
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,119
and

321
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,839
The lives of all of us.

322
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,960
Go that way.

323
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:15,640
Come in

324
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,119
How is it going?

325
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,599
It's that Jin Shun,

326
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,200
under Dr. Fengchen's order,

327
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:27,200
He led the Zerg descendants to the Thousand Worm Altar.

328
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,200
You may leave.

329
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,839
Fengchen Jun,

330
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,519
knowing clearly that the Xue family is at odds with the Five Clans,

331
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:43,599
You clearly know why Yan Ying and Yan Yun

332
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,000
led them to the Thousand Worm Altar?

333
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:48,839
Boss,

334
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:50,240
who on earth

335
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:51,960
is the Xue family?

336
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:54,599
Xue Jia

337
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,279
Pursue the ancestral training of Zerg,

338
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,519
and protect He Luoshi from generation to generation,

339
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,279
But they have strange personalities,

340
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,279
and they have little contact with the Five Clans.

341
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,960
About 12 years ago.

342
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:11,559
Ouyang Yanlei and Pan Yingxuan broke into Bamen Mountain again,

343
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,279
so,

344
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,960
The Xue family believed that

345
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,480
the Floral and Fiery Clans were traitors to the Zerg who coveted the treasure,

346
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,279
I hate them so much.

347
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:22,640
Now,

348
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,200
when these kids go to the altar again,

349
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:28,079
It can only be bad luck.

350
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:31,119
But I think Mr. Fengchen did the right thing.

351
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,599
Why don't we use the Xue family

352
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,519
to wipe out all the descendants of the Zerg.

353
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,359
No way.

354
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,240
Isn't our ultimate goal

355
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:38,519
the Zerg treasure?

356
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,440
No way.

357
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,359
Boss,

358
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,559
sit down and have a rest.

359
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,400
Yes, this is the hole.

360
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,160
Let's go inside.

361
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:35,400
This way.

362
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,400
Yes, this is it.

363
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,359
Yan Ying,

364
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,200
Yan Ying

365
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,000
Sister,

366
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,119
Yan Ying,

367
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,240
Yan Ying,

368
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,960
Yan Ying, can you hear me?

369
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,279
Xiao'e,

370
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:11,839
Sister,

371
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,640
Yan Ying, can you hear me? What about Yan Ying?

372
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,480
Brother Pan

373
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:22,400
can't get out of here.

374
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,319
Yan Ying will go to Boss Jin for help.

375
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,119
That's right.

376
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,480
No matter who we are looking for,

377
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,200
Yan Ying will definitely come to save us.

378
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,240
Let's move on.

379
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,079
Have some hot water.

380
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:35,000
I haven't seen you so angry for a long time.

381
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,200
Take care of yourself.

382
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,119
You know what?

383
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:43,920
I have a pair of children.

384
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,920
My daughter

385
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,920
is one year older than my son.

386
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,559
I was born in an official family,

387
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,400
and I was married to Ouyang's family of Fire Branch in Ba Song.

388
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:07,319
This is supposed to be

389
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,799
a great honor for the Zerg.

390
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:13,519
I didn't expect that 24 years ago.

391
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:17,880
Ouyang Leiyun

392
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:22,960
has poisoned me with a thousand insects.

393
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:25,359
The Thousand Insects Devouring Bone Poison,

394
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:27,759
so your medicine,

395
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,599
It's not a medicine for palpitations.

396
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,200
Yaxin wouldn't have

397
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,319
used drugs to keep me alive.

398
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:43,160
I've been dead thousands of times.

399
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:04,599
Yan Ying

400
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,279
and Yan Yun,

401
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Could they

402
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,400
be,

403
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,960
It's my own flesh and blood.

404
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:19,680
No wonder.

405
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,000
That day at Mount Fuzhou,

406
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,279
you had to let them live.

407
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:33,519
Ever since I heard about the formation-breaking song at Panasonic,

408
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,759
I've guessed it.

409
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,319
But I didn't expect them

410
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,240
to stay away from Ba Song

411
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:45,480
and come to Ling City that day,

412
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,200
I heard with my own ears

413
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,359
that they are here to see their parents.

414
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,680
I was thinking,

415
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,559
is this fate?

416
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,799
But now, the two of them

417
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,119
are involved in this trap.

418
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,799
I'm a little worried.

419
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:09,039
If they find out,

420
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:11,640
Yaxin will rob the Zerg of all their treasures,

421
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,839
It's all about you.

422
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,079
I don't care

423
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,039
if they won't.

424
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:20,519
I want my mother and son to be reunited,

425
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,960
and I want to avenge this blood feud.

426
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,000
What Ouyang family owes me,

427
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:26,960
I want to take it back.

428
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,359
But if that's the case.

429
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,559
What have you done?

430
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,319
Yan Ying

431
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,359
You're the one who chased us in Fuzhou Mountain.

432
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,839
My second grandfather,

433
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:02,240
Uncle Pan,

434
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,160
Uncle Jin died in Mount Fuzhou,

435
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,200
do you know that?

436
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:09,240
During your absence for more than 20 years,

437
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,480
between me and my sister,

438
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,079
For more than 20 years without my mother,

439
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,880
it was Second Grandpa who led us to play,

440
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,000
Practicing martial arts with us and giving us delicious food,

441
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:20,039
now you suddenly tell me that you are my mother.

442
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,000
He was also the one who killed my second grandfather.

443
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,599
Let me explain, okay?

444
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:30,240
My sister and I almost died in Mount Fuzhou,

445
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,079
you know?

446
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,480
When my friends and I were in Fuzhou Mountain,

447
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,599
we all lost our relatives and seniors.

448
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,519
All of this has something to do with you.

449
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,359
Yan Ying,

450
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:42,319
your mother,

451
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,480
She has her reasons.

452
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,559
My mother.

453
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,000
You don't deserve it.

454
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,720
Can you say that again?

455
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:17,759
You don't deserve it.

456
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,160
Get out.

457
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,599
This is a gift from your father.

458
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,400
I'm from a noble family,

459
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,119
and I'm the daughter my father loves the most.

460
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,799
But I fell in love with the Zerg.

461
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,279
I endured the taunts of countless people,

462
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,519
and the reprimands of my father,

463
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,720
I gave up the honor of my family.

464
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:01,240
He married to Ba Song far away.

465
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:07,839
Your father and I love each other and respect each other as guests,

466
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,279
On the day of Gu Yu,

467
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,720
We gave birth to your sister,

468
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,519
and you.

469
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,720
From the moment I saw you,

470
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:26,680
I recognized you.

471
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,160
Now Ouyang's family has so much wealth,

472
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,400
do you know what they rely on

473
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,279
for so many industries?

474
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:41,720
It depends on my dead father.

475
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,000
Did your grandpa tell you this?

476
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,119
Does your grandpa still remember this?

477
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,039
Twenty-four years ago,

478
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,880
my father met by chance,

479
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,279
After he got a rock,

480
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,200
he was ordered

481
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,880
to escort the Zerg to Mount Ba Men.

482
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:02,960
As for what happened later,

483
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,880
you must have heard about it many times.

484
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,039
Everyone only knows

485
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:11,039
Shi Shiyu died on that day.

486
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,839
Has it ever occurred to anyone,

487
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,200
my father also died in Mount Ba Men

488
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,839
on that day.

489
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,559
After my father died,

490
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,279
your grandfather

491
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,480
blamed all the mistakes on me.

492
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,079
At the Thousand Worm Altar,

493
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,319
he poisoned me with

494
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,400
the Thousand Worm Bone Devouring Poison.

495
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,799
When I was tortured,

496
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:46,079
I called out your names crazily.

497
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,720
Call your father's name.

498
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,720
Where's your grandpa?

499
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,599
Your grandfather is so cruel.

500
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:01,799
They broke up our flesh and blood.

501
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,359
If Yaxin didn't hang me with the medicine,

502
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:13,599
I would have died long ago.

503
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,720
At the seaside in Japan,

504
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:20,839
I would head towards Ba Song

505
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:23,680
every night.

506
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,400
I think about you all the time.

507
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,400
I've been thinking about

508
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,920
the reunion day with you all the time.

509
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,680
But it never occurred to me.

510
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:47,000
When we recognize each other,

511
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,240
it will be like this.

512
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,400
There seems to be an altar ahead.

513
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:57,760
Yes,

514
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:00,719
this is the altar of the Xue family,

515
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,840
Why did our ancestors

516
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,599
put the altar in a place like this?

517
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,840
Pan Jun,

518
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,920
Pan Jun, what are you doing?

519
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,440
What's wrong with you?

520
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,559
Where is she?

521
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,920
What kind of person?

522
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,199
There were two people here just now.

523
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,280
No one is here.

524
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,519
What's that sound?

525
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:57,679
It's the bell.

526
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:59,000
It can make people hallucinate.

527
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,039
Cover your ears.

528
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,760
My grandfather said,

529
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,519
sounds can kill people too.

530
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:15,719
The Zerg sound array

531
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,960
can make people afraid.

532
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:18,760
Illusion and madness,

533
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,840
just like our Fire Department used flutes to train animals,

534
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,920
You were controlled by the wind bell just now.

535
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,199
If he can use the Zerg Sound Formation,

536
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:27,519
he is definitely not an ordinary person.

537
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:29,920
All right,

538
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:32,039
let's go to the front and have a look.

539
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,119
Chief Priest,

540
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:44,119
do you want us to take someone with us?

541
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,639
Wait a little longer.

542
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,119
Look.

543
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:17,079
Tianshu, Tianxuan, Tianji,

544
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:19,280
Tianquan and Yuheng shake the light and open the sun,

545
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,519
This is the Big Dipper.

546
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,440
This is not only the Big Dipper,

547
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,039
but also the Seven Murder of Heaven and Earth.

548
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,239
The six stars of the Southern Dou Empire,

549
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,760
Well

550
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,920
Aren't these bugs?

551
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,760
Why did you see the Star Map?

552
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,840
Have you ever seen the world?

553
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:36,760
Our ancestors recorded the star map,

554
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,760
It's all bugs.

555
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:40,440
Look over there.

556
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:42,840
Is that River Rock?

557
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,000
Is it really He Luo Shi?

558
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:55,840
Don't move.

559
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,639
What kind of bug is that?

560
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,039
This is the Polar Ice Worm,

561
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,000
which the Zerg uses to execute

562
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,280
the bone-devouring punishment of thousands of insects.

563
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,480
All of them are here.

564
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,719
Run! Run! Run!

565
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:37,960
Are you all right?

566
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,159
-It's okay. -Are...

567
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,880
Are you okay?

568
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,000
We're fine, too.

569
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,880
Since everyone is safe,

570
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,440
we'd better find a way to get out.

571
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,199
If Yan Ying is here,

572
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,639
we'll be in a hurry if we can't find him.

573
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,320
But we can't go back.

574
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,559
There are bugs all over the altar.

575
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,719
How about this?

576
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,119
Let's take a look over there.

577
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,599
Did you find the mechanism?

578
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,920
Let's look for it here.

579
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,679
Okay.

580
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,719
Chief Priest, please welcome him.
