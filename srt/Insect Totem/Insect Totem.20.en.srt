1
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,280
I haven't eaten anything for days.

2
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,680
Give me something to eat.

3
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,240
Please give me something to eat.

4
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,590
Miss, please enjoy your meal.

5
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,750
Give me some.

6
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,560
Yanyun,

7
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,280
have you ever thought about

8
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,870
why Langshui Town has become like this?

9
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,960
I also want to know why.

10
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,240
I heard that the grain harvest here

11
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,590
is very low this summer.

12
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,560
The whole Langshui granary is in an emergency.

13
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,080
To put it bluntly,

14
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,360
it's a natural disaster,

15
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,750
Natural disasters can be seen,

16
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,560
but man-made disasters can't be seen.

17
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,030
Don't act weird,

18
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Grandpa won't sit idly by while the people suffer.

19
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,840
I'm not talking about you.

20
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,400
Why are you sitting here?

21
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,240
Pan Jun,

22
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,430
can you stop making Yan Yun angry?

23
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,870
Leave me alone.

24
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,680
Stop it.

25
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,310
Let's find a place to settle down first.

26
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,280
When you come to my place, you'll come to my house.

27
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,360
Let's go.

28
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,080
Yanyun, your family lives in a temple,

29
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,590
but this is the ancestral temple of Old Madam Wu Luo.

30
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,800
Only Fire Branch is qualified to live there.

31
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,910
It's a big show. There are so many soldiers

32
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,000
taking care of them. They're not our people.

33
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,240
It looks like a regular army.

34
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,150
The battalion commander is inside.

35
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,520
No one else is allowed in.

36
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,310
When did Langshui Town have a battalion commander?

37
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,360
Stop!

38
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,190
What took you so long?

39
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,630
Who are they?

40
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,030
They are all doctors I hired from outside.

41
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,750
It's for Wu Ling.

42
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,630
Let's go in.

43
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,030
Sha Yi,

44
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,280
why are there so many soldiers guarding outside?

45
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,240
They sent a battalion commander named Wan Hu Shan,

46
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,150
to Ba Song for disaster relief,

47
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,270
He has been living here since he came.

48
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,800
I've been staying here for three days.

49
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,270
Why are you staying here for disaster relief in Ba Song?

50
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,190
There must be a lot of pretty girls here, right?

51
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,240
Wu Ling is a young girl,

52
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,630
he forced them to dance as soon as he came,

53
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,830
Those who disobey will be severely beaten.

54
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,070
He was even dragged out to feed the wolves.

55
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,160
We have no choice but to compromise,

56
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,390
how can the Zerg Holy Land allow him to fool around?

57
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,310
I'll teach him a lesson.

58
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,950
Yan Yun,

59
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,510
wait.

60
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,430
I have an idea.

61
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,750
I want you to play music!

62
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,800
I didn't ask you to play sad music.

63
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,680
Change something festive for me.

64
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,430
My battalion commander

65
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,600
took great pains to come to Ba Song for disaster relief,

66
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,070
I want you to play a piano and a song,

67
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,190
is it that hard?

68
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,830
What's wrong, battalion commander?

69
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,040
-Battalion Commander. -Battalion Commander, are

70
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,510
you all right?

71
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,600
Honey,

72
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,070
are you okay?

73
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,510
What's wrong?

74
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,360
Who?

75
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,830
Who is plotting against me?

76
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,600
You're the one who brought the evil spirits of Nichimolo.

77
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,920
You,

78
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,600
Come in.

79
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,630
Are you possessed by evil spirits?

80
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,430
I'm a local witch doctor.

81
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,510
These two are my assistants.

82
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,430
Evil ghosts.

83
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,160
How could our battalion commander be possessed?

84
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,750
Wu Ling is the messenger who respects the Heavenly God,

85
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,120
but your battalion commander disrespects the Heavenly God,

86
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,680
That's why he was cursed by Nitziluo Demon.

87
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,360
Are you crazy? How dare you

88
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,270
talk to the battalion commander like that?

89
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,750
Then hurry up

90
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,950
and exorcise the evil spirits for me.

91
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,240
It can exorcise evil spirits,

92
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,720
but Ba Song belongs to Yin,

93
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,800
The Nitziluo Demon here

94
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,310
only chooses greedy and lustful people.

95
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,800
So you have to stop coloring.

96
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,750
Battalion Commander,

97
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,630
you can let them go now.

98
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,270
Let's go.

99
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,310
Get lost, too.

100
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,000
Hurry up.

101
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,240
We can start now.

102
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,750
The curse of Nitziluo Demon is about to wake up.

103
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:20,160
The ghosts in the forest are about to rush out of the forest.

104
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,510
What's the next word?

105
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,830
The sun,

106
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,360
the sun of Nichelo rises again.

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,120
The long-lost sunshine shines on the earth,

108
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,480
and everything is revived.

109
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,120
How do you feel?

110
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,070
All right,

111
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,390
all right,

112
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,070
We'll get going then.

113
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,600
Wait.

114
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,190
The three of you,

115
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,720
since you saved me,

116
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,240
Why don't you show your true colors?

117
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,160
We've given our whole lives

118
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,160
to the witch doctor profession.

119
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,750
As witch doctors,

120
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,120
we never show our true colors.

121
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,360
This is a profession that is condemned by heaven.

122
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,270
Miss,

123
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,480
you look familiar.

124
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,030
Battalion Commander Wan,

125
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,510
I've already told you,

126
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,670
You can't get close to women.

127
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,150
Once we get possessed by evil spirits again,

128
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,080
there may be

129
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,550
nothing we can do.

130
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,200
Wan Hushan,

131
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,390
I'm telling you, he's a jerk.

132
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,910
His eyes are narrowed,

133
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,200
his face is blue and his face is erratic,

134
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,630
He must be addicted to cigarettes.

135
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,360
I must have seen him somewhere.

136
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,840
You've seen it again?

137
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,440
How come you've seen everyone?

138
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,840
You did well today.

139
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,320
He saved Wu Ling from the Fire Department.

140
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,030
I will praise you well

141
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,630
in front of my grandpa,

142
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,030
If you don't want to thank me,

143
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,790
just thank Miaomiao for the Mo Yu Bracelet,

144
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
It helped a lot.

145
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,600
No, Miaomiao,

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,840
Miaomiao,

147
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,910
Can you be more careful? Don't you know

148
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,030
if a man and a woman will kiss or not?

149
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,790
Get lost!

150
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,510
Stingy,

151
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:49,840
Me,

152
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,360
When did Doctor Pan

153
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,440
become a witch doctor?

154
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,240
Who are you?

155
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,630
Wan Jiajun,

156
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,790
Wan Jiacheng,

157
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,150
By the way,

158
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,360
say hello to Mrs. Matsui for me.

159
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,600
Now that you've already said hello,

160
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,120
go ahead,

161
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,270
What are you doing?

162
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,390
I happened to run into the scene just now,

163
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,000
just to warn Dr. Pan,

164
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,270
Be careful.

165
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,150
Don't think you're smart.

166
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,480
You Zerg

167
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,790
have been under observation for a long time.

168
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,510
About what happened just now,

169
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,960
I'll pretend I don't know.

170
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,630
How do you know who I am?

171
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,360
Fate has come a long way to meet each other.

172
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,750
Dr. Pan, you don't have to ask.

173
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,270
When something happens,

174
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,320
I will help you.

175
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,600
Is it free?

176
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,630
What? Are you doing charity work?

177
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,910
Shangfeng,

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,720
so you are Shangfeng.

179
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,550
Shangfeng will be here soon.

180
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Dr. Pan,

181
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,440
be careful!

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,960
Is it because I killed Fengchen Jun?

183
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,790
Let me warn you,

184
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,030
this is Ouyang Family's territory,

185
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,320
Be careful, too.

186
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,960
Miaomiao, what's wrong with you?

187
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,080
Not acclimatized?

188
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,750
According to the book,

189
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,240
there will be locust plague

190
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,750
after drought.

191
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,240
When these two things run into each other,

192
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,120
it never rains but it pours.

193
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,200
Fortunately, the most difficult autumn has passed.

194
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,630
Now this place is in ruins,

195
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,670
unless the leader organizes disaster relief,

196
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,960
Otherwise, no matter how much we worry about it, it won't work.

197
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,270
I wonder what Yan Yun's grandfather

198
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,550
is doing?

199
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
It's such a big matter.

200
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,270
He doesn't care about

201
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,030
reporting it. I want to report it.

202
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,550
Sir, please,

203
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,030
let's meet the battalion commander.

204
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,360
I'm here to report the case.

205
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,870
How can you think of it?

206
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,790
Go, go,

207
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,150
go. Report the case. Go to Ba Song. Go to Ba Song.

208
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,630
Sir Jun,

209
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,320
please,

210
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,550
Sir, please

211
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,600
make trouble, right?

212
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,750
I'll arrest all of you.

213
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,550
Take care.

214
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,600
We don't want to cause trouble, sir.

215
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,720
We want to see the battalion commander.

216
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
Arrest them all.

217
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,000
Sir, don't arrest her!

218
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,200
Please, please.

219
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,270
What's going on?

220
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,630
They want to see the battalion commander.

221
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,910
Sir,

222
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,960
Sir,

223
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,240
We are the family members of the carpenters here in Ba Song.

224
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,320
Our husband made a float for Head Ouyang,

225
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,150
but he disappeared in the mountains.

226
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,320
This is paper.

227
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,000
Okay,

228
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,080
I'll give it to the battalion commander for you.

229
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,030
You can all go back first.

230
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,390
Sir,

231
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,670
they were taken away by the Fire Department priest.

232
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,910
Please save them.

233
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,270
Please.

234
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,670
Please.

235
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,120
Where do you live?

236
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,080
It's at the Wuluo Temple in the west of the city,

237
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,550
the battalion commander will look for you after reading it.

238
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,790
You can go back first.

239
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,240
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.

240
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,750
In troubled times,

241
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,000
the people

242
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,630
will suffer the most.

243
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,080
Who says it's not?

244
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,910
I'm going out for some fresh air.

245
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,200
Yan Ying,

246
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,030
you and Xiao'e should go inside and rest.

247
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,480
Okay.

248
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,150
Go and find out where Yan Yun and Pan Jun are.

249
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,150
Remember,

250
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,510
Ba Song is Ouyang's territory.

251
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Be careful.

252
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,480
Understood.

253
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,120
Sister-in-law Zhang, do you think they'll be fine?

254
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,910
Mother-in-law Wu Luo, bless us.

255
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,960
We'll be fine. We'll be safe.

256
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,000
The battalion commander won't leave us alone, will he?

257
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,150
I think he knows how to handle it.

258
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,840
Don't worry.

259
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,080
No, we'll go to see the battalion commander tomorrow.

260
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,150
That's right.

261
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,360
Who are you?

262
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,080
After seeing your evidence,

263
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,630
the battalion commander asked me to investigate this matter.

264
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,960
The battalion commander asked you to avenge us.

265
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,720
Great. They can be saved.

266
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,240
Why did the battalion commander send a girl to investigate the case?

267
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,480
I'm the battalion commander's wife,

268
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,360
the battalion commander's wife,

269
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,750
Madam battalion commander,

270
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,510
this money,

271
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,440
You can keep it to supplement your family.

272
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,000
Your Ladyship,

273
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,360
they're offering Hei as a sacrifice.

274
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,630
The curse of Nitziluo Demon woke up.

275
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,670
Get up and talk slowly.

276
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,320
What curse?

277
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,720
A month ago,

278
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,440
the priest who prayed for rain came to see my husband, Hei.

279
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,910
Take him away

280
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,790
with the 19 carpenters in the stockade.

281
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,080
He said he wanted to build a float

282
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,320
for Ouyang Touren's birthday,

283
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:58,960
But after that,

284
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,270
my husband never came back.

285
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,840
We ended up on the edge

286
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,070
of a path in the woods,

287
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,720
I found the axe he and the other workers left behind.

288
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,110
Your Ladyship,

289
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,160
that mountain road

290
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,160
is the way to the gate of hell.

291
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,270
Yeah,

292
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,550
making floats for the leader,

293
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,480
Why did he disappear in the forest?

294
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
We suspect that

295
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,200
it has something to do with Nicheluo Demon's curse.

296
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,720
It's said that during the war,

297
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,110
the demons of Nicheluo Demon,

298
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,920
Then they will come out.

299
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,960
Only the flesh and blood of living people.

300
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,510
To satisfy it.

301
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,350
Hei and the others

302
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,070
must have been taken to

303
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,350
the Demon Sealing Grottoes.

304
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,960
This is the punishment given to Ba Song by heaven.

305
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,790
It's the curse of Nicheluo Demon.

306
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,830
The curse of Nitziluo Demon.

307
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,160
It can't be my grandfather.

308
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,920
Why did he catch those carpentry?

309
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,240
Calm down.

310
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,510
Maybe there's something else going on.

311
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,110
But Yanyun,

312
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,550
your grandfather is Ba Song's savior.

313
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,200
Well

314
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,160
Don't make trouble, okay?

315
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,790
How about this?

316
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,880
Let's go ask Sister-in-law Hei tomorrow,

317
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,830
Ask her to take Hei to the place where he went missing

318
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,350
and investigate,

319
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,790
Maybe it has nothing to do with your grandpa.

320
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,030
Our Ouyang family won't do such a thing anyway.

321
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,920
Did I say something wrong again?

322
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,480
Mother, we've settled down.

323
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,070
What are you looking at?

324
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,830
The person in this painting

325
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
is so beautiful.

326
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,160
This is,

327
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,030
this is when I was young,

328
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,720
Your father drew it for me himself.

329
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
At that time,

330
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,200
I thought we would be together for the rest of our lives.

331
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,550
I didn't expect it to be half of my life after parting.

332
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,550
Ever since my mother left,

333
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,070
my father has been away from home for more than ten years,

334
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,160
He was regarded as a rebellion of Fire Branch by Grandpa,

335
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,440
but he never forgot me for a moment.

336
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,440
Why would he do that?

337
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,240
It's not worth it.

338
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,240
It wasn't worth it from the start.

339
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,680
Mother,

340
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,750
If father comes back now,

341
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,680
our family will be reunited.

342
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,920
That's all extravagant hopes.

343
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,920
Since the day your grandfather hurt me,

344
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,160
my life has changed long ago.

345
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,510
Sister-in-law,

346
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,680
Sister-in-law, Sister-in-law,

347
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,830
Where is she?

348
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,110
Judging from the situation,

349
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,680
he must have been taken away.

350
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,160
Who will take them away?

351
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,790
They went to Ba Song to report the case,

352
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,110
and made it known to everyone.

353
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,640
Who hates them the most?

354
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,030
Who is the most likely suspect?

355
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,960
Why are you looking at me?

356
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,640
They said before,

357
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,640
those who took the carpentry,

358
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,200
It's a fire sacrifice.

359
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,790
If that's the case,

360
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,960
fine,

361
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,400
Now you all suspect that my grandfather did it?

362
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,680
Don't fight with me.

363
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,440
You'll fight with Mud.

364
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,070
What did I do?

365
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,240
I told you to fight with Mud.

366
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,830
Yan Yun, listen to me.

367
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,030
I didn't do it on purpose.

368
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,510
Yan Yun,

369
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,790
Miaomiao,

370
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,270
Are you unhappy

371
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,790
because of Yan Yun recently?

372
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,110
Did you?

373
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,030
Are you jealous?

374
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,750
Don't smile at me.

375
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,070
I have something to tell you.

376
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,880
I told you the battalion commander looked familiar,

377
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,920
if I remember correctly,

378
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,830
He's Wan Hushan, the son of Wan Chaozong,

379
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,830
the leader of the AsiaInfo Association,

380
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,790
Have you met him in Yaxin?

381
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,440
The AsiaInfo Club's system is very strict,

382
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,030
I only met him in Tokyo.

383
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,790
Wan Hushan wasn't addicted to drugs at that time,

384
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,720
and his impression was completely different from now on.

385
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,110
I just remembered,

386
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,000
but I'm glad I saw him wearing a mask yesterday,

387
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,590
By the way,

388
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,960
what did Wan Jiacheng

389
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,160
tell us about the Yaxin Club?

390
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,110
Shangfeng,

391
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,960
come to Ba Song

392
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,590
Shangfeng.

393
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,440
I've been following his orders in Japan for so many years,

394
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,590
now

395
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,550
I can't believe we're going to see each other in Ba Song.

396
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,960
You haven't seen him?

397
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,030
I contacted him through Matsui.

398
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,160
Shangfeng doesn't like to see outsiders,

399
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,160
Yaxin will go up and down,

400
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,550
What everyone is most curious about,

401
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,240
should be his true face.

402
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,070
The background of the AsiaInfo Club is too complicated,

403
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,350
and there are too many entanglements

404
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,510
between the political and business circles in Japan and abroad,

405
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,720
Those of us down there,

406
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,750
the less we know,

407
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,680
That's why I'll live longer.

408
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,790
Miaomiao,

409
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,270
I won't let you go through this anymore.

410
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,070
It's okay now.

411
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,070
Let's go.

412
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,750
Were you jealous just now?

413
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,550
No.

414
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,240
I really didn't.

415
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,830
No.

416
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,720
Battalion Commander,

417
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,830
the Zerg has arrived in Langshui.

418
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,880
We are keeping an eye on their whereabouts.

419
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,270
We're also discussing a perfect solution.

420
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,590
What the coach means is,

421
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,920
put them in Ba Song first,

422
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,310
And then there,

423
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,310
Wan Jiacheng,

424
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,000
Do you really think I don't know anything?

425
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,880
Do you think I can't see

426
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,350
what they did a few days ago?

427
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,830
Do you have a battalion commander like me

428
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,200
in your eyes?

429
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,640
Battalion Commander,

430
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,790
you're smart but Jiacheng is stupid.

431
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,510
I really didn't see it.

432
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,480
Well,

433
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,030
since your eyes are so bad,

434
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,160
Then I'll take care of it myself.

435
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,000
When I come back,

436
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,680
I want to see new products.

437
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,590
I asked you to come here to say,

438
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,350
we're already in Ba Song.

439
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,350
About the engagement,

440
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,880
it was decided by the previous generation.

441
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,720
We didn't agree

442
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,830
to this either,

443
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,310
right? The society now focuses on free love,

444
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,400
Love is free. If you don't like me,

445
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,680
just tell me.

446
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,640
Let me tell you,

447
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,110
if it weren't for our parents'engagement,

448
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,240
My love for you is just

449
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,030
a sister to a brother.

450
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,590
Besides,

451
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,880
I, Ouyang Yanyun, will be the future gentleman of the Fire Department,

452
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,550
I'm good-looking and well-behaved,

453
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,480
why should I force you to be a liar,

454
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,750
Yes.

455
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,830
You're right.

456
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,440
Have some tea.

457
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,680
Search for me!

458
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,240
Yes

459
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,680
Row 1, row 2,

460
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,830
search over there. Row 3, follow me.

461
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,960
Yes

462
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,160
Wan Hushan is here with his troops,

463
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,400
does he know who we are?

464
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,920
Yan Yun,

465
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,110
let's pack up and go.

466
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,590
Let's go!

467
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,030
Get in the car.

468
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,920
Will this work?

469
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,240
It's too late. We'll catch up soon.

470
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,160
Get in the car.

471
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,830
Ziwu, hurry up and give me

472
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,640
your stuff. Come on.

473
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,160
Why is the town full of soldiers?

474
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,200
He seems to be catching someone.

475
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,400
Eunuch, the gate will be closed soon,

476
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,590
so let's go to the forest farm first.

477
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,310
Okay.

478
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,790
I wonder

479
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,240
where the car is going?

480
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,790
I think he said he was going out of town.

481
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,030
Miaomiao,

482
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,400
you don't have to worry about her.

483
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,350
I know Yan Yun,

484
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,550
a woman from the Fire Department,

485
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,590
You're straight-tongued,

486
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,240
and you don't beat around the bush.

487
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,640
I'm looking for trouble.

488
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,240
You've liked Yan Yun for a long time, haven't you?

489
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,310
But Yanyun

490
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,400
only regards me as a good friend.

491
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,440
Not necessarily.

492
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
Some people

493
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,790
are just hindsight.

494
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,720
Yan Yun

495
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,160
She's a future fire gentleman,

496
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,880
and she has a lot of responsibilities

497
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,200
on her shoulders.

498
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,750
But in the trial of our Master of Human Resources and Grass,

499
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,880
the result is unpredictable.

500
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,310
How long

501
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,960
can I stay with her?

502
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,920
As it is now,

503
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,750
I'm satisfied.

504
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,550
Fellow villagers,

505
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:18,960
thank you for your hard work.

506
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,110
The ghosts of Nitziluo Demon are sleeping.

507
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,680
You can't disturb me.

508
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,720
Wake up! Wake up!

509
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:28,920
Someone is coming.

510
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,720
Sir,

511
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,550
we're here to inspect Mount Bamen,

512
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,350
It was approved by the Northern Zhou government.

513
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,310
Commander Tang of Kun City also signed it.

514
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,440
This is the approval.

515
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,680
It has the official seal of the British Foreign Office,

516
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,110
the provincial council chamber, Birmingham University.

517
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,510
What should I do?

518
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,440
What should we do? Pan Jun,

519
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,240
hold on. Don't talk.

520
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,160
He's coming.

521
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,960
Hide. Hide.

522
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
Take the box down.

523
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,270
What's in this box?

524
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,440
It's some insect specimens and soil data. Open it

525
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,750
and have a look.

526
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,550
Don't be nervous.

527
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,590
This is the Amazon giant bird-eating spider,

528
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,920
Although it's big,

529
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,960
it only eats bats and birds.

530
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,110
It never hurts humans.

531
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,680
You can touch it,

532
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,880
Take it away!

533
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,510
This is a gift from the Great Britain government

534
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,030
to China,

535
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,160
I wish the friendship between the two countries will last forever.

536
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,110
We also brought giant scarabs,

537
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,550
Queen Alexander swallowtail butterflies

538
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,160
and five-inch giant tease worms,

539
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,160
It's all here.

540
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,160
All right. Let's go.

541
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,880
Let's go! Lift the box up!

542
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,830
we

543
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,510
Is this the way to Mount Ba Men?

544
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,920
Mount Ba Men.

545
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,200
Wait.

546
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,030
When we go up the mountain,

547
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,510
life and death are decided by fate.

548
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,880
I've warned you.

549
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,000
Don't worry.

550
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,110
The Wan Army has made a move,

551
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,030
so we have to guard against it.

552
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,310
Otherwise,

553
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,270
let's avoid its edge first,

554
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,720
I'm not going anywhere.

555
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,590
We must go to Ba Song City.

556
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:18,480
Ouyang Leiyun's 70th birthday will be in a few days,

557
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,550
and I'll wait for it.

558
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,680
I've been waiting too long.

559
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,720
You go first.

560
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,030
Protect Yanyun,

561
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,440
Wanhu Mountain is too close to her.

562
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,510
Yes.

563
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,030
Are you still worried about your grandpa?

564
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:53,830
Mother,

565
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,590
If you really start a fight with Grandpa,

566
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,550
Ba Song City will be leaderless,

567
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,200
The bad guys will take advantage of it.

568
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,110
Yan Ying,

569
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,960
if

570
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,000
If I can make you a gentleman in the Fire Department,

571
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,680
will you still care about your grandfather's life and death?

572
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,310
The gentleman's position belongs to my sister,

573
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,680
and I don't care about

574
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,270
the gentleman's position at all, do I?

575
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,750
I just want to be with you,

576
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,960
father and sister,

577
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,750
Our family can live a good life together.

578
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,440
You've really grown up.

579
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,200
Mother,

580
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,960
If I were here right now,

581
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,830
would you still take revenge?

582
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,200
Remember,

583
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,840
when people do something wrong,

584
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,110
You have to pay the price.

585
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,960
No ifs.

586
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,960
It's really the way to Bamen Mountain.

587
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,440
Along the way, there are fog and dark ditches everywhere,

588
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,510
and even locals won't come here easily.

589
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,030
Pan Jun,

590
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,710
look how docile this spider is.

591
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,800
Isn't it strange?

592
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,320
Why do English people bring so many

593
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,360
strange bugs to Ba Song?

594
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,110
Look,

595
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,280
A Hundred Years of Insect History Volume II.

596
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,000
Isn't this the mural of the secret chamber of the Jin family?

597
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,840
Even the timing is the same.

598
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,070
This is the Bamen Mountain Forest,

599
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,190
and it's the periphery of the forest.

600
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,400
I went there when I was a kid.

601
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,320
You've been looking at the photos for years,

602
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,400
but it's been 20 years, right?

603
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,480
The location of this photo is exactly the same,

604
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,230
but one is new and the other is the old

605
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,110
Gao Huaiyuan George Young,

606
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,030
It's these two people again.

607
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,960
In the second volume of the Hundred Years of Insect History,

608
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,480
my father hid the first volume of the Hundred Years of Insect History in my home

609
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,960
and the second volume of the Hundred Years of Insect History is here.

610
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,880
They're from England again.

611
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,150
My father was also shipwrecked

612
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,360
on his way to Liverpool.

613
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,590
Then they must know where my father is.

614
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,360
Pan Jun,

615
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,480
don't act rashly.

616
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,760
They came at a bad place.

617
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,280
What if it's the enemy?

618
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,550
Let's take a good look at the situation first.

619
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,920
Calm down.

620
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,960
This used to be a forest farm,

621
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,150
where loggers lived.

622
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,190
Please.

623
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,030
This one tastes better.

624
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,110
Here, have a bite.

625
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,280
You can have lunch too,

626
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,670
Yan Yun, would you like some fish?

627
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,800
As soon as the car stops,

628
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,710
it's getting more stuffy inside.

629
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,920
Why isn't the transmitter fixed yet?

630
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,590
Let me go to Ba Song or not.

631
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,070
Sorry, battalion commander.

632
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,440
It will take some time to fix it.

633
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,590
You bunch of losers,

634
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,400
hurry up and fix it,

635
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,150
Yes

636
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,880
Have you found the way ahead?

637
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,880
Where are you going?

638
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,880
Not yet.

639
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,550
Then why are you standing there? Go find him.

640
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,360
Yes

641
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,110
This way.

642
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,280
Battalion Commander,

643
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,710
where are you going?

644
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,070
You don't have to ask me everything.
