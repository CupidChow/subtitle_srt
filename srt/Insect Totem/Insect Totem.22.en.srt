1
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,520
Report,

2
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,080
congratulations to the battalion commander for taking over Ba Song.

3
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,360
The whole Ba Song City is watching us.

4
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,520
Since you want to do it,

5
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,280
let's do it to the end.

6
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,560
Thank you for your hard work.

7
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,719
This sofa is softer

8
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,319
than Ashin Club. Be serious.

9
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,479
I wonder how Ziwu and the others are doing.

10
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,159
I've sent someone back.

11
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,919
I was stopped by Ouyang's family.

12
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,639
They sealed the forest.

13
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,919
Why did you seal the forest so easily?

14
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,439
What are you doing?

15
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,120
I'm looking for your battalion commander.

16
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,120
What can I do for you?

17
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,199
I'm here with your battalion commander,

18
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,039
Fire cloth

19
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,639
Put him in Fire Cloth

20
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,759
Where have you been?

21
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,680
Madam battalion commander,

22
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
I have something to say.

23
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,479
When we entered the city,

24
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,439
I thought I saw the man who took Hei away.

25
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,159
The brother in the stockade

26
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,840
disappeared after he went into the forest.

27
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,639
Where is he?

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,919
I'm going to look for him.

29
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,039
I didn't find it.

30
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,759
Do you remember what he looks like?

31
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,680
Describe it,

32
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,039
and I can try to draw it.

33
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,360
If we can find the person who took Hei,

34
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,639
we can determine the reason

35
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,120
why Ouyang's family sealed the forest.

36
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,439
Father,

37
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,680
You're awake.

38
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,680
My name.

39
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,240
I can only hold you

40
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,560
in my hand in this way.

41
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,680
I'm sorry that

42
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,360
I didn't grow up with you.

43
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,040
Back then, in order to find out

44
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,240
the truth of the Battle of Mount Ba Men,

45
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,759
I'm like a lunatic.

46
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,399
I know that.

47
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,279
I wanted to break into Bamen Mountain,

48
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,759
and eventually,

49
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,720
Your grandfather drove me out of the Zerg.

50
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,360
I've been studying in Great Britain

51
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,399
all these years,

52
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,199
I wrote a hundred-year history of insects,

53
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,560
in order to find out

54
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,959
the truth of the Battle of Mount Ba Men,

55
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,000
To clear your mother's name.

56
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,439
Me

57
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,879
I met you.

58
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,360
Your mother,

59
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,199
you met your mother.

60
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,240
She's not dead.

61
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,000
She's still alive, isn't she?

62
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,399
Where is she?

63
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,319
Father,

64
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,839
It's a long story. I'll tell you about it slowly,

65
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,279
but the trouble is,

66
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,480
She wants to kill grandpa.

67
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,759
Follow me.

68
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,439
The magnetic field in the mountain

69
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,399
can affect the transmitter.

70
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,959
But it's impossible to kill him directly.

71
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,160
Go and have a look.

72
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,519
Your Lin is very evil.

73
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,000
Several of my brothers went hunting.

74
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,000
His head was broken.

75
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,480
The wild monkey in the mountain is strong

76
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,519
and gets irritated,

77
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,079
You can kill people too.

78
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,439
All right,

79
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,000
let's go and have a look.

80
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,160
Okay.

81
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:07,959
Yan Yun,

82
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,240
Wan Hu Shan didn't bully you, did he?

83
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,040
He wouldn't dare.

84
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,920
Now that his men have been killed one after another,

85
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,279
he doesn't have time to take care of me.

86
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,439
But Brother Pan

87
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,519
doesn't know if he's safe in Ba Song.

88
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,160
Don't worry,

89
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,480
they are so smart,

90
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,800
I'm sure he'll be fine.

91
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,920
When they pretend to be husband and wife this time,

92
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,920
I don't know how to explain

93
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,199
to my grandpa in the future?

94
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,279
Yan Yun,

95
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,560
Sometimes,

96
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,040
There are some things that can't be forced.

97
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,759
I know

98
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,079
you're gone.

99
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,240
What are you waiting for?

100
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:44,920
Well,

101
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,959
I'm sorry,

102
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,120
I didn't mean to be harsh on you.

103
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,040
It's okay,

104
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,839
Yanyun.

105
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,120
Your father can come back?

106
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,480
I'm so happy for you.

107
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,560
When I was young, my biggest wish

108
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,560
was to reunite my parents and my family.

109
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,759
But now,

110
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
My mother

111
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,160
But you want to kill my grandpa.

112
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,800
Yan Yun, don't worry.

113
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,720
I think Senior Yanlei

114
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,360
might be able to persuade Boss Jin?

115
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,800
It's a long road ahead.

116
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Who knows?

117
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,720
Yanyun,

118
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,160
no matter what happens,

119
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,680
I'll always be there for you.

120
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,079
I mean,

121
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,920
I can be your clan.

122
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,040
Your brother,

123
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,879
your comrade-in-arms or,

124
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,879
Who do you want me to be?

125
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,360
I am who I am.

126
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,360
Ziwu,

127
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,320
Me,

128
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,879
I hope

129
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,000
you can be yourself.

130
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,000
Do what you like to do.

131
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,919
The man's eyelids drooped,

132
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,879
and there was a circle on his face.

133
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,039
Take a look and you can adjust it.

134
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,519
Like,

135
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,200
They look so alike.

136
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,639
Besides,

137
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,480
you two look like a couple,

138
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,240
What do you mean by "like"?

139
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,039
We're just a couple.

140
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,039
Catch this person.

141
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,559
Leave the rest to me.

142
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:35,799
a platoon leader

143
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,639
Yes,

144
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,840
Press this to find it quickly.

145
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:40,679
Yes.

146
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,960
Be careful.

147
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,240
Yanyun,

148
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,720
the terrain here is complicated,

149
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,120
Be careful.

150
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,320
What are you afraid of?

151
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,480
This must be

152
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,360
the local people of Ba Song,

153
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,759
The local people of Ba Song.

154
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,200
This is our kettle.

155
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,960
This should be

156
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,000
the place to test the herbalist,

157
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,399
Zixu Huai'an Cave.

158
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,279
Yan Yun,

159
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,759
be careful! Go! Back off!

160
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,159
Let's go.

161
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,120
What are you eating?

162
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,519
You two send them back.

163
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,000
Yes

164
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,080
The rest of you search with me.

165
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,440
How nice it would be if it were really our family.

166
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,399
It's worth risking our lives for such a long time.

167
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,960
If you marry Yan Yun,

168
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,440
the house will be more luxurious than it is now.

169
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,080
Miaomiao,

170
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,320
it's so hot and cold every day,

171
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
Are you happy?

172
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,600
I'm used to it.

173
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:41,840
Then what's on my mind?

174
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,200
It's not like you don't know.

175
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,360
Change the dressing.

176
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,039
I've been working for Yaxin Club for so many years,

177
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,039
and I've been shot many times.

178
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,159
But none of them hurt this time.

179
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,240
Pan Jun,

180
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,519
it's because of you,

181
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,039
You made me feel weak.

182
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,480
But I suddenly feel like

183
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,360
I want to rely on someone

184
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,200
I've never felt before.

185
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,080
It scares me, too.

186
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,519
Miaomiao,

187
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,759
don't worry,

188
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,639
I can make you forget the past.

189
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,200
Forget it.

190
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,000
Listen to me first.

191
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:17,840
My past,

192
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,879
and the Zerg's entanglements for so many years,

193
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:23,919
It will always be a burden to you and me.

194
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,519
We can't forget it or let it go.

195
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,919
Yan Yun is innocent,

196
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,080
but she is also engaged to you?

197
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,440
She's more suitable for me

198
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,919
than I am.

199
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,759
I'll take care of it.

200
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,519
It can only be you if I choose you.

201
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,559
Recently,

202
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,519
there are too many strange faces in Ba Song,

203
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:17,120
All kinds of outsiders keep breaking into my heart

204
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,240
and suddenly I feel anxious,

205
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,279
Master,

206
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:26,159
the battalion commander's mansion is investigating the case of the forest farm,

207
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:29,639
These people can't stay idle when they come to Ba Song,

208
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:32,320
so they're really prepared.

209
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Keep an eye on him.

210
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:35,519
Yes.

211
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,440
Hello, sir.

212
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,559
This is our battalion commander.

213
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,559
Please show us

214
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,880
the files of the Bamen Mountain incident,

215
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,480
Well,

216
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,119
To transfer the case,

217
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,839
we need the approval of the police department and the government,

218
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,759
Do I need to call the government?

219
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,119
Go.

220
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,720
All right, sir. Please

221
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,519
come in.

222
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,519
Ladies and gentlemen,

223
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,119
the ones on this shelf,

224
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,519
It's a historical case in the dense forest of Bamen Mountain.

225
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:45,920
19151,

226
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,440
19131912,

227
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,079
A year or two ago,

228
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,039
after the Revolution of 1911,

229
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,440
That's why the city government set up a data archive,

230
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:56,480
and what happened before that,

231
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,279
It was recorded by historical officials of Qing Dynasty.

232
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,200
We don't hold back here.

233
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,400
On the seventh day of July 1915,

234
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:09,359
four foreign merchants, including Zhao Peixin.

235
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,880
Selling cloth to Ba Song,

236
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,519
on Mount Ba Men,

237
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,640
Missing near the jungle,

238
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,759
the police department searched for four bones after more than a month,

239
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,680
There's no flesh left,

240
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,400
but there's no flesh left in a month.

241
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,160
On October 8, 1913,

242
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,400
the commander of the Northwest Army sent a geological team to explore the dense forest,

243
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,160
Thirty-five people went in.

244
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,599
Two months later,

245
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,680
29 bodies were found,

246
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,920
Three, ten, five, twenty,

247
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,720
what about the other six?

248
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,440
One is missing,

249
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,640
the other five,

250
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,079
Are you crazy?

251
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,839
Could it be caused by the treasure mechanism?

252
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,920
Or is it really like a legend.

253
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,759
If you open the treasure,

254
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,039
there will be a cursed compass deviation.

255
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,799
Electronic failure.

256
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,759
What else?

257
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,880
Look,

258
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,680
these pages have been torn off.

259
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,799
September 7, September 8,

260
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,160
September 9, 1913,

261
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,119
September 9th,

262
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640
that was the day when my father and Senior Yanlei left.

263
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,519
Who tore these two pages?

264
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,960
I … I don't know.

265
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,640
I don't know.

266
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,480
Okay,

267
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,920
Call your curator here.

268
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,200
I want to sue you.

269
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,480
If the file is damaged,

270
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,119
go to the police station and explain it.

271
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,400
Sir,

272
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,960
I didn't do this.

273
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,240
Who did it if it wasn't you?

274
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,200
Say it out,

275
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,960
and you'll be fine.

276
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,119
Well

277
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,319
Is it Ouyang Leiyun,

278
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,359
Well,

279
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:58,880
Sir,

280
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,480
yes, yes.

281
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,640
The housekeeper of Ouyang Mansion,

282
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,359
sent a group of people

283
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:06,000
to pick up some documents.

284
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:08,400
He said he wanted to make up his family history,

285
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:11,440
but only part of it was returned later.

286
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,720
This is back.

287
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,200
It was torn off.

288
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:26,839
Mother, can we really kill demons?

289
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:27,839
Yes,

290
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,839
the leader of Ouyang Mansion

291
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,279
will lead us to kill the demons,

292
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,400
Go to peace and happiness,

293
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,480
and walk home.

294
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,119
What's wrong?

295
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,000
Tell me,

296
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,559
if they find out

297
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:47,279
what their leader did,

298
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:48,640
What will they think?

299
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,160
There's no evidence, isn't there?

300
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:57,359
More than 20 loggers are still missing.

301
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,440
The life and death of his wife and children are uncertain.

302
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,599
The information of Mount Ba Men

303
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,240
was also taken away by Ouyang's family.

304
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,839
And the death of my mother back then.

305
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,480
I have to go to Ouyang's Mansion.

306
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:13,039
Get to know all of this.

307
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,160
Take care.

308
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,759
Master, the battalion commander's wife is here,

309
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,400
just in time.

310
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,799
Come and take a look at my new koi fish.

311
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,519
The water is so good.

312
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,480
Water is good water,

313
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,839
fish,

314
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,000
It was just fished from Jinjiang River.

315
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:58,559
Ba Song is in the year of catastrophe,

316
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:01,240
and Ouyang Touren is really in a good mood.

317
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,039
Why is Her Ladyship alone?

318
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,680
The battalion commander didn't come with you.

319
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,359
The battalion commander is looking for information in the archives,

320
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,880
but he really doesn't have time.

321
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,160
Your Ladyship,

322
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,400
what brings you here?

323
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,440
I want to know that

324
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,000
so many refugees are homeless.

325
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,119
They also hope that the leader will kill the demon,

326
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,160
are they entrusting

327
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,359
an inhuman person?

328
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:35,599
Your Ladyship, you must be kidding.

329
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,880
I'm in charge of Ba Song City,

330
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,279
and I'm duty-bound.

331
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,480
Let me ask you two questions. Please go ahead,

332
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:43,880
Madam.

333
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,119
First,

334
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,960
the Ouyang family changed the rice into bran,

335
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:50,079
Why are you offering sacrifices to exorcise ghosts?

336
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,039
Ba Song,

337
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,960
is there really a ghost?

338
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,079
Your Ladyship,

339
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,799
have you ever eaten bran?

340
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,000
Of course,

341
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,920
after my mother was killed,

342
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:05,240
So I wandered around with Concubine Qiao.

343
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:07,400
The one who eats the most

344
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,400
is bran.

345
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:15,599
I didn't expect Her Ladyship to have such a background.

346
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:19,359
But you survived.

347
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,839
Three people can live with a handful of chaff,

348
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,000
but rice is robbed by poor people,

349
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,079
None of them can survive.

350
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,480
Do you understand?

351
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:32,880
What do you mean?

352
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,640
If we don't feed the Chamber of Commerce with rice first,

353
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,160
the people won't even have bran. Catastrophe,

354
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:46,799
famine, war,

355
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,839
Things that can't be reversed by manpower

356
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,720
can't be changed.

357
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,200
I can only pray to God and Buddha.

358
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,559
People

359
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,960
always place their hopes

360
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,640
on illusory things,

361
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,240
For example,

362
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,359
treasure.

363
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,440
In the year of chaos,

364
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,319
stabilizing Ba Song is more important than anything else.

365
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:14,160
Are you satisfied

366
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,960
with your answer?

367
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:18,640
The second question is

368
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:21,839
to take away 20 loggers and their families,

369
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,640
Is it you?

370
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,200
We've been talking about it and finally got to the forest farm.

371
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,640
Your Ladyship,

372
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,319
you may as well move.

373
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,200
Where are you going?

374
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,160
Just go and have a look.

375
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,400
Ouyang Leiyun mixed bran into the rice,

376
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,960
Mu Dong raised the price of the rice,

377
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,720
These two old guys are so dark.

378
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,319
Not only the price of rice,

379
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,359
you can look at the prices

380
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:01,839
of all the goods on the market,

381
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,680
Raising the price of rice

382
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,880
is just a move.

383
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:08,880
Now you know how complicated Ba Song is, right?

384
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,920
What a mess.

385
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:15,480
All right,

386
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:17,599
let's talk about us,

387
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,640
Your coach and Ouyang Leiyun are sworn enemies.

388
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:25,400
You brought me here to be the battalion commander

389
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,880
because you want me to be the scapegoat, right?

390
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,440
I won't let you die.

391
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,160
In my opinion,

392
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,000
we are closer than family.

393
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,279
Back then,

394
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,920
Old Commander Wan Chaozong and I fought from south to north,

395
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,680
Unfortunately, he suffered from plague.

396
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:50,559
It was your father, Pan Yingxuan, who saved me,

397
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,400
and your Pan family

398
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,680
saved me.

399
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,559
It seems that my father has been practicing medicine for so many years,

400
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,039
and he has made a lot of good fortune for me.

401
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,680
It's like saving lives.

402
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:11,440
Why don't you join me?

403
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,400
An affair is an affair,

404
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,480
a business is a business,

405
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,839
Understood.

406
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:19,200
Understood.

407
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,160
It seems that Wan Jiajun,

408
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,119
Ouyang Family,

409
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,440
And Toast Mu Dong,

410
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,799
no matter how he makes money in a different way,

411
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,599
It's all about raising money to open the Zerg treasure.

412
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,759
Do you know what's the most precious?

413
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,960
People, grass, teachers

414
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,039
and things are precious, not to mention people.

415
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,920
Drink it first and leave.

416
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:06,880
Your Ladyship,

417
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,480
Sister-in-law Hei,

418
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,480
Your Ladyship,

419
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:13,960
the battalion commander and I have been looking for you.

420
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:17,720
Did Ouyang's family bring you here?

421
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,279
Your Ladyship, you misunderstood.

422
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,599
Mu Dong was the one who caught us,

423
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,480
and the leader rescued us.

424
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:24,759
Mu Dong,

425
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,960
he and Old Master

426
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,599
have been secretly fighting in Ba Song,

427
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:33,000
Mu Dong is nominally the chief executive of Ba Song,

428
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,359
but in fact,

429
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,160
His prestige is far less than

430
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:39,079
Old Master's. I've long heard that,

431
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,480
Someone did bad things under the name of Ouyang Family,

432
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,039
trying to pour dirty water on my head.

433
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,839
It's not that easy.

434
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,599
Since you saved them,

435
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,799
why didn't you send them back to the forest farm?

436
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,079
But locked up in the mansion,

437
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:54,920
and it's all our fault.

438
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,319
The leader who has always suspected us,

439
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,799
the leader who made it known to the public

440
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,680
is also trying to protect us.

441
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,319
Your Ladyship,

442
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:04,640
this is my second question for Her Ladyship.

443
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,720
Are you satisfied?

444
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,920
Then why did Mu Dong take Hei away?

445
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:10,720
Is it for the treasure?

446
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,720
You could say that,

447
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,839
if it were more accurate,

448
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:20,240
It's for people. Master of Grass.

449
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:28,480
Someone must have tried it

450
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,559
with

451
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:32,200
the local people. Who on earth is Master of Grass? So wicked?

452
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,480
Ignoring human life.

453
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,839
Could it be the AsiaInfo Club?

454
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,279
I remember Fengchen Jun

455
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:38,720
was studying this before.

456
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,400
Or else,

457
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,279
it could be

458
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,319
Yan Yun I'm not talking about your grandpa,

459
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,440
Me,

460
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,920
When I left Ba Song,

461
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,119
I made a bet with your grandpa.

462
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,359
He said that the Human Grass Master is the last to be seen,

463
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:56,559
and the Zerg treasure can no longer be opened.

464
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,960
But your grandfather insisted that

465
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:00,519
it would never happen,

466
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,039
Father,

467
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,720
Even you suspect Grandpa,

468
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,880
you two

469
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,160
Yan Yun

470
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,920
Why don't you run around?

471
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,599
Kill me if you dare.

472
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:15,240
Ask Battalion Commander Wan to collect the body for me!

473
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,599
Yan Yun, I didn't mean that.

474
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,640
Uncle,

475
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,000
leave her alone.

476
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,960
Are you a villager here?

477
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,240
Are you okay?

478
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:45,200
Are... Are you lost?

479
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,920
I … I see you are hurt.

480
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:50,400
Don't be afraid.

481
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,519
There's a stockade nearby.

482
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,160
I'll take you back for treatment.

483
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,119
Uncle,

484
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:04,200
Yan Yun.

485
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,559
Stop!

486
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,240
What are you doing? Save her.

487
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,160
Get out of the way.

488
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,279
If Yanyun is in danger,

489
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:13,400
will the battalion commander let you go?

490
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,359
Get out of the way!

491
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:25,519
Go, Zhenlong.

492
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,000
Yan Yun,

493
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,079
Yan Yun,

494
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:36,880
Are you okay?

495
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,519
Ziwu.

496
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,440
Report,

497
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,000
we found the man

498
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,359
who took the woodworker from the forest farm.

499
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,119
Bring him in.

500
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,759
Bring him in.

501
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,240
You may leave.

502
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:57,960
Wait.

503
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:04,839
Let's go.

504
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,000
About the lumberjack.

505
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,400
If I tell anyone,

506
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:41,079
I won't be able to save you anymore.

507
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,719
Does it hurt?

508
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:58,400
It doesn't hurt.

509
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,239
I'm really fine.

510
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,280
It's just a scratch.

511
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,639
What kind of skin injury?

512
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,039
It's bruised.

513
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:12,840
It'll be better if you apply some medicine.

514
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,960
It's okay.

515
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:19,280
I was just scared back then.

516
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,840
Uncle,

517
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,599
according to what you said,

518
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,599
The so-called curse of Mount Bamen,

519
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:38,719
is actually just a natural phenomenon,

520
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,000
Bamen Mountain

521
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,320
is at 30 degrees north latitude,

522
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:46,199
In the eyes of explorers,

523
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,079
it is on the same latitude line

524
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,880
as the pyramid Bermuda.

525
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,840
Also known as the Death Latitude Line.

526
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:53,599
Usually in a place like this,

527
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,039
weird things happen.

528
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,280
The magnetic field in Zixu Huai'an Cave is very strong,

529
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,599
and there is the most poisonous miasma in the world.

530
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,199
It's as dangerous as a treasure forest.

531
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
That tribesman

532
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,760
is probably

533
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:11,559
the victim of the trial of Herbal Master.

534
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,559
If I had become a herbalist earlier,

535
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,719
so many people

536
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,039
wouldn't have fallen victim to it.

537
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:24,320
What does this have to do with you?

538
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,360
If you want to blame it,

539
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,599
you should blame those who refined herbalists.

540
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,280
Uncle,

541
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,880
after you've been in England for so many years,

542
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:37,960
Is there any way

543
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,239
to help me become a herbalist?

544
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:40,239
You,

545
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:44,079
I don't have the ability.

546
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,079
But maybe.

547
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,360
There is one person who can.

548
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,599
You go first.

549
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,239
Those loggers

550
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:41,519
really have nothing to do with Ouyang Leiyun.

551
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,159
It's Mu Dong, the local local snake,

552
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,440
who covets the Zerg treasure.

553
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:46,400
So he took him to test the herbalist

554
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,599
and then framed Ouyang Mansion.

555
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:51,440
I found out that prices in the city are soaring,

556
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:52,599
government and business collude,

557
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:54,159
This is the Wanjia Army's way of collecting money.

558
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:57,000
And they're also looking for a herbalist,

559
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,440
talking about it,

560
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:01,960
Ouyang Mansion, Wan Family, Mu Dong,

561
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,320
these three parties are all looking for Master Ren Cao,

562
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,760
Okay. Open the Zerg treasure.

563
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:19,360
Jiacheng,

564
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,719
Shuai,

565
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,639
How is Ba Song?

566
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,719
Everything is as you expected.

567
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:28,280
Ouyang Leiyun's 70th

568
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:29,920
birthday gift is ready.

569
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,719
According to the commander-in-chief's order,

570
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:32,880
the birthday gift is ready,

571
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,039
Kim So-mi,

572
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:35,519
We haven't touched her yet.

573
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:38,400
Kim So-mi is eager for revenge,

574
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,559
Ouyang Leiyun has deep roots,

575
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,480
Kim So-mi is a good move we use

576
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,159
to check and balance the Zerg.

577
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,679
According to your plan,

578
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,280
we'll stay still first,

579
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:49,360
No.

580
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,119
If two tigers fight against each other,

581
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,119
we have to help Jin Sumei

582
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,599
completely expose her minions.

583
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:57,719
It's good that she can swallow Ouyang Leiyun in one gulp,

584
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,960
if she can't

585
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,960
hurt Ouyang Mansion's flesh and blood.

586
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,800
It's also beneficial without harm.

587
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,840
Jiacheng understands,

588
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,119
and,

589
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,840
Don't let Hushan make the same mistake.

590
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,079
If he committed a crime because of a woman,

591
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:12,119
he would be shot on the spot,

592
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,280
Shuai

593
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,960
Jiacheng, remember,

594
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:19,159
there is no joke in the army.

595
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,599
It's the end of coach

596
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,079
Ouyang Leiyun's birthday banquet,

597
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,920
So I went to Ba Song to clean up the mess.

598
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:28,159
Hold on to those little guys,

599
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:30,119
especially Ziwu,

600
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,199
Yes

601
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:49,559
Brother Pan, Miaomiao

602
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,880
saw that you were safe,

603
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:52,039
We can rest assured.

604
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:55,039
Well,

605
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,320
why are you here?

606
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,000
All kinds of news about you in the newspaper,

607
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,840
it's hard for us to find them.

608
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,199
What's wrong with you?

609
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,079
How did you

610
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,199
become a warlord?

611
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,280
We were forced to go to Liangshan,

612
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:10,639
but the real battalion commander Wan Hushan was afraid of death.

613
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,960
He threatened Pan Jun and I

614
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,400
to come to Ba Song to serve for them,

615
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,880
The situation here is complicated and people's grievances are boiling.

616
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,400
Even if there is an assassin,

617
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:18,800
we will die first.

618
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,400
What can't we die?

619
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,880
Where's Boss Jin?

620
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,880
My mother said,

621
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,239
on my grandfather's birthday,

622
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:27,239
If she comes to Ba Song again,

623
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,000
why didn't she see Yan Yun and Ziwu?

624
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:38,840
This is

625
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:41,000
Mr. Yan Ying from Ouyang Family, right?

626
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,119
Lieutenant Wan,

627
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:46,760
what's wrong?

628
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,280
Battalion Commander Wan is looking for us again?

629
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,239
You're finally the battalion commander today.

630
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,920
We're going to get the real battalion commander back.

631
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,079
You can retire after you've completed your work.

632
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,199
It's only been a few days.

633
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:00,400
I haven't had enough.

634
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,599
Okay,

635
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,960
I'll obey your arrangement.

636
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,360
When are you leaving?

637
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,880
It's all assembled.

638
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,039
Let's go.

639
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,639
Attention, everyone!

640
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:21,559
dress right.

641
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,719
Look forward

642
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,239
and turn right.

643
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,920
Run. Let's go.
