1
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,350
Yan Ying

2
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,150
Mother, where are you going?

3
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,920
Yan Ying,

4
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,200
Yan Ying,

5
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,280
Wake up!

6
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,400
Yan Ying,

7
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,000
wake up!

8
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,080
-Do something. -Boss Jin, it's

9
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,280
okay. Yan Ying is fine.

10
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,630
Wake up Yan Ying,

11
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,310
Yan Ying,

12
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:18,520
Yan Ying,

13
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,310
Boss Jin,

14
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,800
Pan Jun and the others are here.

15
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,190
Tell them to wait for me at Hengfeng Hotel.

16
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,960
Don't come to my office.

17
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,590
Yan Ying,

18
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,630
and,

19
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,430
Keep a close eye on Fengchen Jun,

20
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,750
see what he's up to,

21
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,840
Yes.

22
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,000
Boss Jin,

23
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,400
otherwise,

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,840
Let's inject him with painkillers.

25
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,960
You can't use it.

26
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,080
Yan Ying has to get through this.

27
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,840
I'm going to get him off Fengchen Jun's medication,

28
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,910
otherwise,

29
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,000
He'll be like me

30
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,960
for 20 years,

31
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,080
They all rely on other people's drugs to maintain their lives.

32
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,030
Take your gun

33
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,750
and stand at the door.

34
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,430
No matter what Yan Ying calls you,

35
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,630
no one is allowed to come in and help him.

36
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,000
Including yourself.

37
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,120
Help me!

38
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,750
Sister, help me,

39
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,190
Yes.

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
Remember,

41
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,750
those who disobey the order,

42
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,400
Kill them on sight.

43
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,400
Mr. Jin.

44
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,120
What can I do for you?

45
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,470
The chief of the Xue family wants to ask you

46
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,840
to help save the young master of the Xue family,

47
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,910
You really want something from me.

48
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,560
That's why you brought Yan Yun

49
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,910
to threaten me, right?

50
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,000
Stop right there!

51
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,040
They are my friends.

52
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,120
There's no need to do that.

53
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,070
Besides,

54
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,560
a mother who abandoned her own child

55
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,920
for more than 20 years,

56
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,560
Are you worried about my safety?

57
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,600
When the Zerg was forced by Lord He,

58
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,360
the Zerg treasure was what your father and daughter

59
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,920
always wanted.

60
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,000
The bloody battle in Bamen Mountain was also caused by you.

61
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,360
You're the one who abandoned my father

62
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,240
and caused his illness for more than ten years,

63
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,390
Yan Ying and I,

64
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,680
you were the one who had no parents since we were little,

65
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,510
The one who killed Second Grandpa

66
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,630
and Senior Pan Shujin,

67
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,190
It's still you.

68
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,120
Did Ouyang Leiyun tell you all this?

69
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,480
You don't have the right to call me grandpa's name.

70
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,720
My grandfather is right,

71
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,160
you are the traitor of Ouyang Family.

72
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,240
You don't deserve to be our mother.

73
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,190
Clan Leader Xue promised,

74
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,360
he is willing to reveal the truth 24 years ago.

75
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,830
I'll clear your name.

76
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,600
Mr. Jin,

77
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,270
Yan Ying can't hold on any longer.

78
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,680
Yan Ying,

79
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,240
Yan Ying,

80
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,720
Don't move! Don't move!

81
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,870
Yan Ying, Yan Ying,

82
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,560
take me home.

83
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,190
I have a home,

84
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,070
Yan Ying,

85
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,560
Put the gun down!

86
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,600
Put the gun down!

87
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,870
Why did you leave me alone?

88
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,480
Yan Ying,

89
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,270
why did you leave me alone?

90
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,040
Yan Ying,

91
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,040
why did you leave me alone?

92
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:00,800
Yan Ying,

93
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,600
stay away.

94
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,120
Don't touch me! Get up!

95
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,190
Get up.

96
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,240
Yan Ying, put the gun down. Yan Ying

97
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,190
Sis,

98
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,000
When Grandpa hit me,

99
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,120
why did you...?

100
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,920
Why did you leave me alone?

101
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,560
I didn't. Put the gun down.

102
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,510
It hurts.

103
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,270
I know.

104
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,160
I've only had my sister since I was a child.

105
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,720
No father,

106
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,040
no mother,

107
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,600
Why did you leave me alone?

108
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,190
Why did you leave me alone?

109
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,040
Yan Ying

110
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,270
Put the gun down Yan Ying

111
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,190
doesn't have a father,

112
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,480
Yan Ying,

113
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,070
can you give me the gun?

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,680
Give me the gun.

115
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,430
Mother.

116
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,190
Why don't you want me?

117
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,510
Why don't you want me?

118
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,750
Yan Ying,

119
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,920
why?

120
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,070
Stand up.

121
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Get up and you don't care about me.

122
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,120
Yan Ying,

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,630
you don't care about me.

124
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,040
Yan Ying,

125
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,920
Boss Jin,

126
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,430
Yan Ying,

127
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,160
Yan Ying,

128
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,950
Maybe I can save him.

129
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,310
It's not getting any better.

130
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,270
Do you have any other way?

131
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,560
I did everything I could.

132
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,510
Now it's about his willpower,

133
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,270
so I can't help you with that.

134
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,310
Xiao'e, don't go.

135
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,800
You're a Zerg, too.

136
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,040
No secrets.

137
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,800
Don't you like to drink?

138
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,560
Let's just have a drink today.

139
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,870
First of all,

140
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,480
the deaths of Jin Wu Yi, Pan Pu

141
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,120
and Ouyang Lei Huo have nothing to do with me.

142
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,240
The Yaxin Club is complicated,

143
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,240
so I don't need to explain it to you.

144
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,680
Secondly,

145
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,830
I did go to Mount Fuzhou.

146
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,480
But I did it for you, for Yan Ying,

147
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,240
and for the rest,

148
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,030
It was all done by Yin and Yang,

149
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,150
and it has nothing to do with me.

150
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,840
I'll clear myself up.

151
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,720
Have a clear conscience.

152
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,270
Then what exactly does Clan Leader Xue

153
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,790
mean by what he asked me to do?

154
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,670
24 years ago,

155
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,320
my father,

156
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,440
It's a Zerg.

157
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,440
Lord He of the Qing court, who hates you so much.

158
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,510
Accidentally got a Luo Shi lost by Xue clan

159
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,510
at the end of Ming Dynasty,

160
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,200
He was ordered to be escorted by soldiers.

161
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,790
Gather the Zerg in Mount Ba Men.

162
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,270
Trying to open the treasure.

163
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,240
But who ever thought,

164
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,910
Xue Gui, the chief priest of Xue clan,

165
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,720
But the river stone he took out is fake.

166
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
It caused Shi Shiyu, a gentleman in the water system,

167
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,790
to come out crazily and kill innocent people indiscriminately.

168
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,670
As for the rest,

169
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,240
you must have heard about it many times.

170
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,390
But my grandpa said,

171
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,630
Luo Shi is the fake one.

172
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,510
Your grandpa,

173
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,510
your grandpa has always been arrogant,

174
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,440
How could he dare to face the truth?

175
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,120
Fortunately, Xue Gui is willing to testify for me.

176
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,790
Go on.

177
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,030
Back then, Xue Gui insisted that

178
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,790
my father's rock was fake.

179
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,960
The Zerg

180
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,720
are united with Xiang Laixu,

181
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,670
There has never been a traitor.

182
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,120
So,

183
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,790
they threw all their hatred

184
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,150
towards my father on me.

185
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,790
He put a thousand insects on me and killed me.

186
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,120
Your grandpa,

187
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,510
with his face of putting righteousness above family loyalty,

188
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,600
I still remember,

189
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,550
the Thousand Insects Devouring Bone Poison,

190
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,550
In the past 24 years,

191
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,080
he has been torturing me every night.

192
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,670
Fortunately, Xue Gui has a conscience,

193
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,720
and after what happened,

194
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,270
He blamed himself.

195
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,550
ashamed and uneasy

196
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,000
Save me in time.

197
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,630
You asked a doctor to treat me again.

198
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,320
That's how I saved my life.

199
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,200
Otherwise, I would have died.

200
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,390
So,

201
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,630
you have to seek revenge on Grandpa.

202
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,360
If this is you,

203
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,000
can you not take revenge?

204
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,550
I hope you can call me mom.

205
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,550
I hope you and Yan Ying

206
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,790
can follow me out of here and back to Japan,

207
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,200
But I won't force you.

208
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,600
You can't force me.

209
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,000
When did you two find out?

210
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,320
Just like you.

211
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,390
Xue Gui told us

212
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,150
in the Xue family.

213
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,870
It's no different from

214
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,720
what your mother and Jin Sumei said.

215
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,030
Well

216
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,120
Love and hate in this world,

217
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,240
it's hard to part with each other.

218
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,270
I can't tell right from wrong.

219
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,440
So,

220
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,720
don't take it too seriously.

221
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,550
As for the pursuit of Mount Fuzhou,

222
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,550
it must be Fengchen Jun's Yin-Yang Road

223
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,000
and Matsui Shangyuan,

224
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,750
The death of your second grandfather,

225
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,480
is not directly related to Boss Jin,

226
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,630
I just hope,

227
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,550
you won't be too upset and sad.

228
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,440
Be nice to your mother.

229
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,960
It's easy to say.

230
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,440
Didn't you threaten

231
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,750
to take revenge,

232
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,670
Aren't you going to let anyone of the Zerg go?

233
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,120
You're right.

234
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,120
Over the past 20 years,

235
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,750
in my life, apart from revenge,

236
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,120
I can't see anything else.

237
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,150
But you're the only one who has experienced it.

238
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,120
Then you will know

239
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,630
how to cherish it,

240
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,030
How important it is.

241
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,960
Listen to me or not.

242
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,360
I don't mean to force you.

243
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,630
No, I'm not lying.

244
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,120
Mei'er is innocent,

245
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,600
Luo Shi is the real Luo Shi,

246
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,200
Let me prove it to you.

247
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,270
Don't go.

248
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,480
Grandpa told me,

249
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,240
there's a lunatic in there.

250
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,630
He's a sinner of Ouyang's family.

251
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,000
Yan Ying,

252
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,840
why are you here? Yan Ying

253
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,080
Father,

254
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,270
What does Her Highness look like?

255
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,150
When can I see her?

256
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,120
Grow up quickly.

257
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,720
I'll take you to see my mother when you grow up.

258
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,550
Tell me,

259
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,670
Did you go to find that lunatic?

260
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,630
Am I right?

261
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,120
Come here.

262
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,200
Grandpa,

263
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,270
grandpa, stop hitting me.

264
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,840
Did you go to find that lunatic?

265
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,600
Grandpa, stop beating him.

266
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,200
Get out of the way!

267
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,790
Mother

268
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,360
It can't be quiet.

269
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,840
Yan Ying,

270
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,550
Yan Ying, Yan Ying,

271
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,000
What a loser. You have no memory.

272
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,320
Yan Ying,

273
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,080
Yan Ying,

274
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,360
Are you going or not?

275
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,870
Tell me,

276
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,120
are you going or not?

277
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,600
Yan Ying.

278
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,630
I was wrong.

279
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,510
I was wrong. I was wrong.

280
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,120
I was wrong.

281
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,840
I was wrong.

282
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,120
Yan Ying,

283
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,440
you're right.

284
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,030
Don't punish yourself

285
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,480
for other people's mistakes, okay?

286
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,390
Yan Ying.

287
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
He really doesn't treat me as an outsider.

288
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,750
Mother,

289
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,590
Dr. Pan has checked your pulse,

290
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,590
and he said you're fine.

291
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,200
What do you think?

292
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,350
I feel much better.

293
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,680
Don't worry.

294
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,590
I'm sorry

295
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,790
I didn't take good care of you.

296
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,510
I'm fine.

297
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,270
He did sleep well.

298
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,350
Welcome back.

299
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,880
My dear friend,

300
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,200
I'm not here to fight.

301
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,070
if

302
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,830
You don't want Ziwu and Young Master Xue to die?

303
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,030
So on the day of beginning of spring,

304
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,920
all of you,

305
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,590
Come to me at the Thousand Worm Altar.

306
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,590
Okay.

307
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,550
See you in beginning of spring.

308
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,160
When the time comes for Uncle Pan's hatred of Qiu Ziwu,

309
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,790
I'll settle it with you.

310
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,480
Pan Jun,

311
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,070
I've always been very interested in you.

312
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,750
Pneumonic Plague,

313
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,720
is one of my most satisfying works

314
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,680
in recent years.

315
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,160
I didn't expect you to be so good.

316
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,030
Do you know that

317
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,000
you're making me unhappy.

318
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,590
But the new work

319
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,590
is more interesting than Pneumonic Plague.

320
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,750
Do you know where this inspiration comes from?

321
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,550
The inspiration comes from

322
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,400
your five families,

323
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,440
In the war 24 years ago,

324
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
Mount Ba Men,

325
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,270
What a nice place.

326
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,240
Then let's go to the Thousand Worm Altar.

327
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,550
See you there.

328
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,270
I won't

329
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,000
see you.

330
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,510
Let's go.

331
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,720
Go to Xue Family's settlement and unite Xue Zifeng

332
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,640
to eliminate Yin and Yang Dao.

333
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,790
This way, please.

334
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,270
The Thousand Worm Sacrifice,

335
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,110
is the biggest festival of Xue's Group.

336
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,510
Everyone began to prepare

337
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,400
tributes and talismans months in advance.

338
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,880
By the beginning of spring,

339
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,590
every family will send tributes

340
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,790
to the altar of thousands of insects,

341
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,920
To commemorate the deceased relatives, friends and ancestors,

342
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,480
in order to bless us

343
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,200
with a bumper harvest and good weather in the coming year.

344
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,510
Well.

345
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,270
Didn't you tell the hunters that

346
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,830
we're going to fight with the Yin and Yang Daos?

347
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,640
This decisive battle is extraordinary.

348
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,160
Chief Priest doesn't want to implicate innocent people.

349
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,830
So the news hasn't been announced yet.

350
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,000
However,

351
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,000
we Xue clan have always been brave and fearless,

352
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,590
And we are fully prepared.

353
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,680
To prevent miasma,

354
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,790
we went up the mountain a month ago to collect herbs,

355
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,550
We will definitely win this battle.

356
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,480
What's with the miasma?

357
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,070
After the severe cold,

358
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,350
the Thousand Worm Altar will breed miasma.

359
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,550
The whole altar will be filled

360
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,160
until beginning of spring.

361
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,350
Except for our people,

362
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,110
most outsiders will be choked out.

363
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,720
How about

364
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,680
this? Take Miaomiao to the witch doctor's mother-in-law first.

365
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,790
I'm going to find some big pots.

366
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,160
Why are you looking for big pots?

367
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,200
You'll find out in a while.

368
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,400
Let's go this way.

369
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,750
Granny

370
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,070
All the herbs are here.

371
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,830
It's all prepared according to the amount in previous years.

372
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,270
Nothing will go wrong.

373
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,720
Madam,

374
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,310
this year's Thousand Worm Sacrifice

375
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,400
Old Clan Leader will invite some distinguished guests to join us,

376
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,550
Plus,

377
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,200
there are more people and soldiers in our whole settlement

378
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,680
than in previous years.

379
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,640
I'm afraid that's not enough.

380
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,720
Since it's a distinguished guest invited by Clan Leader,

381
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,920
I'll prepare something for you.

382
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,590
This is more tiring than buying new year's goods.

383
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,070
Just one basin.

384
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,160
They were sent to the compound.

385
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,590
Do you still draw the spell of Xue clan?

386
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,440
Draw,

387
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,720
We have to get everything ready.

388
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,960
I'm sure it's safe,

389
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,270
so I can use

390
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,960
these thousand insects during the sacrifice.

391
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,070
If Yin and Yang insist on hosting the Thousand Worm Sacrifice,

392
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,720
we can't afford to lose our share, right?

393
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,240
What's going on?

394
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,480
How did the Thousand Worm Sacrifice become the host of Yin and Yang?

395
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,270
Isn't this nonsense?

396
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,510
We're family members.

397
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,240
Where's Chief Priest?

398
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,160
Why do you want an outsider to preside over it?

399
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,110
Everyone, tell me,

400
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,880
who will offer our sacrifice?

401
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,590
The Thousand Worm Sacrifice is our ancestor worship ceremony,

402
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,000
how can we let the Yin and Yang Daos occupy the altar?

403
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,720
We can't let them go.

404
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,270
That's our place.

405
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,550
Don't worry. Listen to me first.

406
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,510
Our sacrifice.

407
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,310
If we ask Clan Leader Xue to deliver it in person,

408
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,510
we can't let outsiders

409
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,110
defile our altar offerings.

410
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,680
If that's the case,

411
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,240
we can't do

412
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,200
it ourselves.

413
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,590
Beginning of spring is too dangerous.

414
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,830
None of you can go.

415
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,240
Yin-Yang Road kidnapped Young Master,

416
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,160
we did this

417
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,590
to counter Yin-Yang Road.

418
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,110
What did you say?

419
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,720
Young Master, Young Master is in their hands.

420
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,720
Yin and Yang do have a stubborn heart.

421
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,750
We need to save Young Master.

422
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,550
Listen to me.

423
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,880
On the day of beginning of spring,

424
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,110
At the Thousand Worm Altar,

425
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,880
we'll face the Yin and Yang Daos head-on,

426
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,880
So I hope everyone won't leave the house.

427
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,510
Don't go to the sacrifice, okay?

428
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,640
Who will deliver this year's tribute?

429
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,070
Yes.

430
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,550
What about the tribute we prepared?

431
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,510
Our gods,

432
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,550
our relatives and ancestors must not be neglected.

433
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,480
Yes, don't neglect it.

434
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I'll deliver it for everyone, okay?

435
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,070
I'll send all the offerings you've prepared

436
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,270
to the altar.

437
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,200
I will also pray to the gods of the sun and moon.

438
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,750
Bless our Xue clan,

439
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,720
and bless us

440
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,790
to save Young Master Xue back.

441
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,790
Who is it?

442
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,640
Who is this?

443
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,350
I know.

444
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,510
The annual Thousand Worms Sacrifice,

445
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,400
is very important to everyone.

446
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,400
Me

447
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,640
As a descendant of the Floral Department,

448
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,070
my father,

449
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,720
My father, Pan Yingxuan, once treated you.

450
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:48,000
So I will bring all my feelings

451
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,680
to the God of Sun and Moon.

452
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,590
I also hope you can trust me.

453
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,790
Trust me, a descendant of the Floral Clan.

454
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,590
Mr. Pan,

455
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,000
our tribute for this year,

456
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,350
I'll leave it all to you.

457
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,480
Please give it to you.

458
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,000
Time to eat.

459
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,830
You.

460
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,720
As long as you help us save Ziwu and his master,

461
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,590
I'll call you mother.

462
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,880
If you don't help me,

463
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,750
I don't seem

464
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,310
to want to hear you call me mother.

465
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,480
Just leave it here after dinner.

466
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,240
Someone will clean it up.

467
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,400
I need to go out.

468
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,200
I'll come back to see you later.

469
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,440
The longest piece of green silk is missing from your bag,

470
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,270
I saw your father use it once,

471
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,310
That's the secret treasure of our wood system,

472
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,680
Spirit Piercing Needle. Are you sure

473
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,440
you've seen that

474
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,270
I was also infected during the late plague.

475
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,350
Young Master and Old Clan Leader

476
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,750
forced me to take the medicine your father gave me,

477
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,440
But at that time, both sides of my shoulders were red and swollen,

478
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,640
and I couldn't lift my bow or shoot an arrow.

479
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,720
Your father told me it's plague

480
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,030
sequelae arthralgia syndrome,

481
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,720
If you don't treat him,

482
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,270
your arms will be ruined.

483
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,310
He retired everyone.

484
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,310
We were the only ones left in the woodshed.

485
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,720
No matter how much I refused,

486
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,830
he still took out the longest Spiritual Pivot Needle,

487
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,720
Your father told me,

488
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,350
all the Qingsi in the Department of Wood have saved people.

489
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,920
He killed someone too.

490
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,400
Only this Green Silk of Spiritual Pivot,

491
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,000
can only be saved,

492
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,920
Don't kill him!

493
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,000
The funny thing is,

494
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,350
Lingshu Qingsi, the secret treasure of your wood system,

495
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,790
saved these two arms.

496
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,590
He killed countless people,

497
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,480
and your father said,

498
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,510
It's hard to tell right from wrong, good from evil,

499
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,240
and he never cares,

500
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,030
He only cares about his perseverance

501
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,240
and justice.

502
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,440
Young Master Xue,

503
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,440
I've always been tired of killing,

504
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,480
But this time,

505
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,960
in order to solve the mystery of the Zerg treasure,

506
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,200
Let me climb to the peak of medical research.

507
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,550
I'm afraid the Xue family

508
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,880
will suffer.

509
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,750
The shotguns and crossbows of the Xue family,

510
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,880
not only protect the Xue family,

511
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,270
And protect the Zerg.

512
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,440
Young Master Xue, you're wrong again.

513
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,070
The era of cold weapons has passed.

514
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,720
In the future,

515
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,480
he'll be competing with a steel gun,

516
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,440
The Zerg treasure can get it.

517
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,110
It's better than

518
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,750
putting it

519
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,920
in an unknown world.

520
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,030
The Xue family guards He Luoshi,

521
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,680
relying on the trust of the Zerg.

522
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,000
You only want to seize the treasure,

523
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,920
and the name of injustice has been confirmed.

524
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,920
No matter how the world changes,

525
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,920
the crossbow of our Xue family,

526
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,790
Always point to the unjust.

527
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,200
Before the treasure came out,

528
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,350
the Far East fell into a warlord battle,

529
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,350
The people are not living well.

530
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,960
There is a lot of sorrow everywhere,

531
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,510
Yes

532
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,160
Pan Jun and his party,

533
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,030
they call themselves the teachers of justice,

534
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,720
It's a pity that they … They showed their

535
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,160
courage,

536
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,110
They didn't look at the pattern in the past century,

537
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,310
look at me, Fengchen Jun,

538
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,350
In order to study the Zerg treasure,

539
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,350
I did my best,

540
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,960
I just want to lift its veil.

541
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,110
I'll let these muddy and short-sighted people have a look.

542
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,880
What do you mean

543
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,200
by "material charm"?

544
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,200
medicine

545
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,160
So many.

546
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,550
You're no match for Pan Jun.

547
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,880
He can let go of his personal grudges

548
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,350
and be righteous.

549
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,790
He knows that,

550
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,480
but you'll never understand.

551
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,680
Look at

552
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,960
this world.

553
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,960
Poor and weak,

554
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,000
the people here,

555
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,070
Ignorance.

556
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,110
You kept saying that

557
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,880
you were going to save everyone.

558
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,160
To save everyone,

559
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,720
I think what you should really save

560
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,440
is your people who are easy to eat.

561
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,240
You let some hunters who can't read characters

562
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,400
know what righteousness is,

563
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,750
To understand the rise and fall,

564
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,110
it's better to give them a piece of bread.

565
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,960
This is called drinking poison to quench thirst.

566
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,550
You use idioms well.

567
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,510
Fengchen,

568
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,510
the Teacher of Justice,

569
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,070
I'm invincible.

570
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,070
You have to be careful tomorrow.

571
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,160
Don't lose your life.

572
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,750
Okay.

573
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,400
Tomorrow,

574
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,480
I'll take you to the Thousand Worms Sacrifice,

575
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,790
I want you to see it with your own eyes.

576
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,110
When the barbarians meet the civilization,

577
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,480
they are so vulnerable.

578
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,790
I made this specially for you.

579
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,270
It's miasma-proof medicine.

580
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,480
Tomorrow morning,

581
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,110
it will be a big battle.

582
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,270
What are you doing?

583
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,680
It's your Young Master who will be saved tomorrow.

584
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,350
You're the main force. Why don't you drink?

585
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,400
You aren't manly at all. Why?

586
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,960
I'll go down the mountain and have a look.

587
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,640
Come back and drink.

588
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,920
Come back.

589
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,440
Drink it before you go.

590
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,590
Look at him.

591
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,680
Drink it.

592
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,960
That's right,

593
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,110
Let's go.

594
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,640
How are things going

595
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,720
with Yan Yun and Yan Ying?

596
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,720
Mr. Jin, can you help us?

597
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,480
It depends on whether the two of them are smart or not,

598
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,350
as long as they don't fight each other again.

599
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,200
At this point,

600
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,480
I can count on Xiao'e the most.

601
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,400
Without emotional entanglements,

602
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,630
it's the most rational.

603
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,920
Once a person has a tie,

604
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,760
it's hard to be smart.

605
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,150
Well, I think

606
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,070
I'm stupid.

607
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,760
Aren't you stupid too?

608
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,440
What are you up to?

609
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,550
Does it still hurt?

610
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,760
It doesn't hurt anymore.

611
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,880
When you recover,

612
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,550
you guys

613
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,670
Do you want to go back to Ba Song,

614
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,670
or go back to Tokyo with me?

615
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,070
I want to see my father.

616
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,760
Mother,

617
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,070
I've been dreaming about my father every night lately.

618
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
Could you show me that pocket watch?

619
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,710
I'd like to see a picture of you and father.

620
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,440
You and father

621
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,960
were so young back then.

622
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,150
I remember when we took this photo,

623
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,070
there was a big flood between us,

624
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,800
You know, before this,

625
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,590
I've been living in seclusion,

626
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,590
Every day when I look up,

627
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,070
it's a square piece of sky

628
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,230
in my home,

629
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,000
Until I met your father.

630
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,400
He took me around

631
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,190
to see the outside world.

632
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,960
When he found out,

633
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,960
I was so eager to hold a show,

634
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,320
During the Western wedding,

635
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,880
he took me to Hankou Concession.

636
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,440
So I took the photo just now.

637
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,760
I didn't know we'd run into a flood

638
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,190
just after we finished filming,

639
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,280
As a result, people all over the street were running for their lives.

640
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,230
It's just the two of us

641
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,590
who have no idea and are still walking on the street.

642
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,960
Aren't you afraid at that time?

643
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,670
Yes.

644
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,760
But as if your father is by my side,

645
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,960
I'm not that scared.

646
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,510
Then what happened to you?

647
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,440
Later,

648
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,190
later he took me back to Ba Song.

649
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,280
We read books together during the day,

650
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,760
and at night,

651
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,150
Just under the night sky,

652
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,550
talking to each other,

653
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,510
Sometimes he took me to the forest,

654
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,670
and summoned those rabbits for me.

655
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,280
Squirrel came to play with me,

656
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:32,150
it was really a time like a fairy.

657
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,710
The Banmen Mountain Tribulation,

658
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,360
all the dreams are beautiful,

659
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,480
In an instant,

660
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,760
they all disappeared.

661
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,630
Mother,

662
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,440
I believe father will come back one day.

663
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,590
As long as we wait until then,

664
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,280
our family will still be here.

665
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,840
What Zerg treasure

666
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,150
or hatred secret doesn't matter anymore, right?

667
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,280
As long as father comes back,

668
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,590
as long as we're still here,

669
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,920
We can't go back to Yanying,

670
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,880
even if he's still here,

671
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,880
We can't go back.

672
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,960
At least I can't go back.

673
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,190
Mother.

674
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Yan Ying,

675
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,280
please help save Ziwu

676
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,920
and Feng Wanchun.

677
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,230
Because only in that way,

678
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,440
we Zerg can work together

679
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,030
to find the treasure.

680
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,510
Father said,

681
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,480
as long as the Zerg treasure is reopened,

682
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,800
He'll be back soon.

683
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,800
You.

684
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,760
Can you help us?

685
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,510
Anyway, no matter what,

686
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,710
we can't let Fengchen Jun and the others

687
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,920
commit evil deeds anymore, right?

688
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,190
Mother,

689
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,760
I believe that if father is here,

690
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,550
he will agree with us.

691
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,150
Don't you think so?
