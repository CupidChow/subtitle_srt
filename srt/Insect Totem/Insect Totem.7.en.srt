1
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,840
Why isn't the light on?

2
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,640
Let's go inside and have a look.

3
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,120
Let's go.

4
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,199
Fang Rude,

5
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,080
Fang Rude,

6
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,039
Fang Rude,

7
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,360
Pan Jun,

8
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,439
Stop yelling.

9
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,039
There's no one inside.

10
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,919
I don't know when Fang Rude will arrive.

11
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,599
Fang Rude is wasting too much time.

12
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,639
You can run away from the monk but not the temple.

13
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,479
What's the rush?

14
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,759
Just wait.

15
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:01,840
Ziwu.

16
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,280
Get down.

17
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,919
What's wrong?

18
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,840
What do you want to do after you find the treasure?

19
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,280
Of course, I'm working with Master

20
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,360
to revive the earth system.

21
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,719
Aspiring,

22
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,120
what do you want to do after you find the treasure?

23
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,080
Me

24
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,800
Of course it's to

25
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,719
promote medical skills with my father

26
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,400
and save the world with ambition.

27
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,080
What else?

28
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,159
Also,

29
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,120
it's gone.

30
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,759
It's gone.

31
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,360
Think about it.

32
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,680
Think about it.

33
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:42,919
Ziwu,

34
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,319
after finding the treasure,

35
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,599
Do you have a lot of money?

36
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,800
Don't worry,

37
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,439
we won't move

38
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,120
this time.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,759
Stand up,

40
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,360
bro. What do you mean?

41
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,840
What do you want to do?

42
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,159
Come with me.

43
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,680
Let's go.

44
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,560
Didn't you say no one was there?

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,479
I didn't turn on the light just now. I didn't see it clearly.

46
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,439
Did you make a mistake?

47
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:18,279
We are the guests invited by Detective Fang.

48
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,160
We're looking for

49
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,000
Detective Fang's guest.

50
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,199
Mrs. Matsui

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,639
called me Shi Miaomiao,

52
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,639
Shi Miaomiao,

53
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,000
you are indeed a descendant of the river system,

54
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,279
Aren't you here

55
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,720
because you want it?

56
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,519
Twenty-four years ago,

57
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,319
the Zerg fell apart,

58
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,600
The four gentlemen killed my mother's jade,

59
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,839
but unexpectedly,

60
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,240
She has a daughter alive, right?

61
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,839
I, Shi Miaomiao,

62
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,800
the only descendant of Yun Zhu Water System,

63
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,560
I'm here to seek revenge on you.

64
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,399
Heaven won't let me

65
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,000
down. It's time.

66
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,319
I want to avenge my mother!

67
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,279
To avenge the destruction of our water system.

68
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,519
We've agreed that none of the Zerg will be missing.

69
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,839
Jin Shun is used to breaking his promise.

70
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,800
What time is it? Why aren't you here yet?

71
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,759
At the Zerg gathering,

72
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,079
how can he lose the face of the gold department?

73
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,360
Calm down.

74
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,680
The wonton is ready.

75
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,519
Thank you.

76
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,279
Shi Miaomiao.

77
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,800
You two, go!

78
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,319
Pan Jun.

79
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,679
Are you okay?

80
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,879
Okay.

81
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,200
You played so well.

82
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:45,960
Inspector,

83
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,879
detective

84
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,039
If we don't save Fang Rude, he will die soon.

85
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,639
Go to the hospital and send a car to save her.

86
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,200
Detective.

87
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,840
Contract,

88
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,799
you are all coveting the treasure.

89
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,799
Don't tear it.

90
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,000
Don't tear it!

91
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,960
Shi Miaomiao.

92
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,320
Don't tear up my contract.

93
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,279
Don't come near me.

94
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,320
You poisoned the tidbits?

95
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,879
Do I need to poison him?

96
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,600
Fang Rude had asthma,

97
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,799
and after inhaling dandelions,

98
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,799
He will suffer from spleen deficiency, phlegm and airway obstruction,

99
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,200
and now only I can save him.

100
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,759
Shi Miaomiao,

101
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,799
will you save her or not?

102
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,799
You think I care about his life?

103
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,039
Okay.

104
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,879
He has shortness of breath, pleura rupture,

105
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:36,919
and now he has pneumothorax,

106
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:37,679
Detective,

107
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,399
I won't be able to save him after a while.

108
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
Pan,

109
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,240
if you're sensible, save my third uncle.

110
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,320
I can save him.

111
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,919
If you ask Shi Miaomiao to let Yan Yun and Ziwu go,

112
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,759
I won't leave if you don't leave.

113
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,320
The contract says we'll live and die together.

114
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,559
It's not the right time.

115
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,799
Can you not be so childish?

116
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,320
The one who can walk is one by one,

117
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,080
You.

118
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,159
Detective, detective,

119
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,679
detective,

120
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,559
Shi Miaomiao,

121
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:06,080
if you dare to burn bridges,

122
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,000
Our police station won't spare you.

123
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,360
Let them go!

124
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,200
Let's go.

125
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,080
Get lost!

126
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:19,840
Get lost!

127
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,559
Get lost!

128
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,120
Pan Jun,

129
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:21,759
Pan Jun,

130
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:22,360
Get lost!

131
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,440
I'll save you.

132
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,279
Pan Jun.

133
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:30,720
Pan Jun,

134
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,039
you can start saving people.

135
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,679
Uncle Pan.

136
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,759
Uncle Pan,

137
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,919
let's go!

138
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,440
What's going on?

139
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,399
-Get in the car. -Get in the car. There's an ambush. What's

140
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:55,879
going on?

141
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,240
It's too late. Hurry up.

142
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,399
Stop!

143
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:05,879
Stop!

144
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:28,759
Second grandpa,

145
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,200
Yan Ying,

146
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,600
Second grandpa,

147
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,519
second grandpa,

148
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:35,360
Yan Yun,

149
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,320
don't shout yet,

150
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,679
There are signs of a fight,

151
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,679
and he was trapped by Yin and Yang.

152
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,480
No way.

153
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,320
Let's meet them at the city gate.

154
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,480
This way.

155
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,960
Second grandpa,

156
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,519
Yan Ying,

157
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,200
Second grandpa,

158
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,120
Gale,

159
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,320
Yan Yun

160
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,240
Watch out for an ambush. I'll check it out

161
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:09,320
Nobody

162
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,279
What should I do?

163
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,039
Where did Second Grandpa and the others go?

164
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,000
Yan Yun,

165
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,919
don't worry.

166
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,120
Senior Ouyang's martial arts skills are so good,

167
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,720
he will be fine.

168
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,559
Let's go save Pan Jun first.

169
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,799
He had a lot of ideas,

170
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,240
so the three of us

171
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,399
went to see Senior Ouyang and your brother together.

172
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,480
Okay. Let's go.

173
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,320
Let's go.

174
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
I told you to give me this.

175
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,480
It's the last meal.

176
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,000
Help yourself.

177
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,879
Well,

178
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,960
after all, we've been treated together.

179
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,519
Unfortunately,

180
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,679
all I want is your Zerg's life.

181
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,440
I know.

182
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,200
Senior Shi Shiyu has left,

183
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,840
it's useless to say anything.

184
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,759
After all these years,

185
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,360
our department owes you an apology,

186
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,360
Today, I'll say

187
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,919
sorry first.

188
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,240
Besides,

189
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,600
after all the hardships you've suffered over the years,

190
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:33,919
All the difficulties,

191
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:38,600
even all the tears and thoughts

192
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,320
in the midnight dream.

193
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,519
I want to say that you've suffered a lot.

194
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,519
This is what I, Pan Jun, told you.

195
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,559
Will it work?

196
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,080
My mother can't come back.

197
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,960
People from the water system can't come back.

198
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:07,679
All these are thanks to the gentlemen of the Four Clans.

199
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,600
And the one who killed my mother,

200
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,600
was your father, Pan Yingxuan.

201
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,919
It's been over 20 years.

202
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,720
Live like this.

203
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,840
It's all thanks to you.

204
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,720
Miaomiao,

205
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,720
they all have their reasons.

206
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,600
There are reasons,

207
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,120
the four great gentlemen are insatiable,

208
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,080
To get the Zerg treasure alone,

209
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:46,480
my mother wanted to stop them so she wanted to kill them.

210
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,559
You don't have any difficulties.

211
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:18,759
Congratulations to Miaomiao

212
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,360
for taking down his enemy.

213
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:24,159
Don't waste all these years of hard work.

214
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,799
I didn't live up to Shangfeng's expectations for you.

215
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,320
Yes,

216
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,639
after more than 20 years of sleepless nights,

217
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,440
Finally, the winner shifts.

218
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,000
But why can't you

219
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,919
see happiness on your face at all?

220
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:45,399
I only have one goal in my life,

221
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,039
and now I'm about to achieve it.

222
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,399
What should I do next?

223
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,120
What kind of faith can we live on?

224
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,799
Could it be that from the beginning,

225
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:00,840
I was wrong,

226
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,240
Miaomiao,

227
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,880
no matter what,

228
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,000
I just want you to be happy.

229
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,839
I don't care

230
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,960
if you can be with me.

231
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,200
It's just a waste of time.

232
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,920
We haven't even got the secret treasure yet.

233
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,000
There's no way to end

234
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,960
what Shangfeng wants,

235
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:23,039
But the Zerg treasure,

236
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:24,519
that's right,

237
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,240
There's not much time left

238
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,839
before the sting.

239
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:33,200
We didn't catch them all this time.

240
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:36,240
It's all Fang Rude's fault.

241
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,799
Just some dandelions.

242
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,440
He almost got himself killed.

243
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:44,839
Pan Jun's medical skills are really good,

244
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,279
I heard that his pulse has stopped.

245
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:49,039
He still has the ability

246
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:50,960
to pull Detective Fang back

247
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,279
from the gate of hell,

248
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,920
He's not dead yet.

249
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,440
I saved my life,

250
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,400
but after tonight,

251
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,240
I can't move most of my body.

252
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,039
Become a useless abandoned child.

253
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,319
After all, he is also an old man

254
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,039
who has worked for Shangfeng for more than ten years,

255
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,240
It's useless if you say it's useless.

256
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:16,640
Maybe in Shangfeng's eyes,

257
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,160
each of us is just a chess piece.

258
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,839
Mr. Matsui,

259
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,240
Mrs. Matsui Ouyang

260
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,240
Lei Huo fled towards the Zhou Mountain of the mansion.

261
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,559
It's hard for the car to pass over there.

262
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:35,640
The terrain is complicated.

263
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:37,160
We lost our men.

264
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:39,960
Send Matsushita Ryusei to chase them.

265
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,680
We must find them.

266
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,640
Yes.

267
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:58,559
Yan Yun,

268
00:18:59,039 --> 00:18:59,920
calm down.

269
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,200
We're here to explore the terrain,

270
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,720
but we can't alert the enemy.

271
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,920
How can I not be anxious?

272
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,000
It's no use worrying.

273
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,559
We have to find the right time,

274
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:08,960
Use our soil pollen

275
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,279
to break through,

276
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,400
Find another way to save him.

277
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,319
How long will the pollen last?

278
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,039
I won't be able to hold on for long.

279
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,480
With so many people,

280
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,200
it's actually quite dangerous.

281
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,039
How sure,

282
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,200
only 50%,

283
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,319
It's worth a try.

284
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,640
Don't you remember what the contract says about living and dying together?

285
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:33,920
Yan Yun,

286
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,079
please wait a moment.

287
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,279
What are you doing?

288
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,279
Our director's wife

289
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,680
wants to make a deal with you.

290
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,599
It depends on whether you dare to enter the mansion or not.

291
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,440
Yanyun,

292
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:54,400
this might be a trap.

293
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,400
The only way to catch tiger cubs is to go into tiger's den.

294
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,440
What's there to be afraid of?

295
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,920
Shi Miaomiao,

296
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,480
where did you hide Brother Pan?

297
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,920
If anything happens to him,

298
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,440
the Fire Department will not let you go.

299
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,240
Brother Pan,

300
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,160
your name is affectionate.

301
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,920
He's so heartless

302
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,240
that he can eat, drink and sleep,

303
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,319
It's none of your business.

304
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,279
You talk about revenge,

305
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,519
but you still think about

306
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:51,799
the treasure water system. Women are insatiable indeed.

307
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:52,839
By the way,

308
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,839
Brother Pan has promised me,

309
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,160
Once we find the Zerg treasure,

310
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,440
the biggest Zerg wedding will be held.

311
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,880
-Remember to come and join

312
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,839
us. -Okay.

313
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:09,319
I'll send you down now.

314
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:11,759
I'll hold the biggest nether marriage for you.

315
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:12,440
Shi Miaomiao,

316
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,200
Yan Yun,

317
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,319
Don't act rashly.

318
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,480
If you want to make a deal,

319
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,200
how do you want to make a deal?

320
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:22,920
You don't have to protect her.

321
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,119
Let her keep her mouth shut for two days.

322
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,400
Anyway, I can't say it in the future.

323
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,599
I'm warning you,

324
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:32,640
you're going to kill me!

325
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,240
Don't move, Yanyun.

326
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What's the rush?

327
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,880
Neither of you can escape

328
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,599
Shi Miaomiao, who are you scaring?

329
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,319
If you dare to kill me,

330
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,440
I, Ba Song Ouyang Family, will respond to every response,

331
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,640
When the time comes, let alone the secret treasure,

332
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,119
you won't even know how you died.

333
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:05,839
Your Ladyship,

334
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,079
what is it?

335
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:10,480
Pan Jun has been clamoring to see you.

336
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,680
He said he wanted to have a good talk with you.

337
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,359
Look

338
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,799
Your fiancée bridegroom took the initiative to deliver it to you.

339
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,880
Aren't you clamoring to see me?

340
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,480
I didn't see you in a hurry.

341
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:47,359
I just want to see

342
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,160
if you're on call?

343
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,480
I didn't expect it

344
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,599
to be true.

345
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,400
I think you're a little tired of living, aren't you?

346
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,400
Back then,

347
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,319
when we first met at Cordyceps Hall,

348
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,160
I'm very impressed with you.

349
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Just say what you want to say.

350
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,720
I'm not here to talk nonsense.

351
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,759
Okay,

352
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,359
Let me get straight to the point.

353
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,759
Do you think you've been used?

354
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:19,119
Those who told you the cause of Senior Shi Shiyu's death,

355
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,279
as long as they have your trust,

356
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:23,480
Even if you get the secret treasure of the river system,

357
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,440
you can take advantage of your desire for revenge.

358
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,599
And the identity of your water system.

359
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:28,480
Gather our four departments together again.

360
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,960
He easily got the Zerg treasure.

361
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,680
So you have to think about it carefully,

362
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,240
who is using you?

363
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,759
It depends on who you want to point the finger at.

364
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,119
Who took you away from your hometown?

365
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,519
I went to Japan,

366
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,559
gave you the identity of the director's wife,

367
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,720
On the surface, I'm helping you,

368
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,039
revenge for you.

369
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,759
In fact, it's a secret matter,

370
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:56,559
there's nothing secret.

371
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,359
We've always been open and aboveboard,

372
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,160
hiding things,

373
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,079
It's the habit of your four departments

374
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,480
to still argue when you die.

375
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,680
Stop defending your predecessors.

376
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,200
I don't believe it.

377
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,759
Miaomiao,

378
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,119
you're different from them.

379
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,039
Ever since the day you sent the poisonous insect here,

380
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:21,079
I knew it.

381
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,799
You'll be sad when you see a child homeless

382
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,160
because of the plague.

383
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,039
You'll still be sad when you see the coachman's widow,

384
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,359
even if you don't give up,

385
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,599
You still use poisonous insects to cure diseases and save people.

386
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:38,960
So Miaomiao,

387
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,440
you're not as ruthless as you pretend to be.

388
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,039
If you kill me,

389
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,880
you can get back on track.

390
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,440
Then you do it now.

391
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:51,279
If you die,

392
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:53,319
Who will give it to Ouyang Yanyun?

393
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,680
The biggest wedding of the Zerg.

394
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,400
Who told you that?

395
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,559
Who else could it be?

396
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,160
What did you do to Yanyun?

397
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,519
What did you do to Yanyun?

398
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,000
You're really thinking of your fiancee.

399
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,519
No, Miaomiao,

400
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,000
Miaomiao, you misunderstood me.

401
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,079
I'm not who you think I am.

402
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:14,960
But I can beg you.

403
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,039
Don't hurt them?

404
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,720
Pan Jun, I'm telling you,

405
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:24,519
human feelings are as thin as paper,

406
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:26,799
Everything is just a lie.

407
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,240
Let's make a bet, okay?

408
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:32,799
Have a look,

409
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,119
is the love of the Zerg indestructible?

410
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,759
Miaomiao. Miaomiao.

411
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,599
Shi Miaomiao,

412
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,480
what did you do to Pan Jun?

413
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,920
I poisoned him.

414
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,960
His life is worse than death.

415
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,680
I can't hold on any longer.

416
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,920
Shi Miaomiao,

417
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,039
Yan Yun,

418
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,400
Don't panic.

419
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,559
She's lying.

420
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,200
I can't get the secret treasure.

421
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:11,839
She won't do that.

422
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,000
I gave him a golden snake worm,

423
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:16,920
refined from 100 kinds of snake venom,

424
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,279
Within three days,

425
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,440
he will bleed to death.

426
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,279
Shi Miaomiao,

427
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,480
how can you let Pan Jun go?

428
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,559
I told you,

429
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,680
I want to make a deal with you.

430
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,960
Within three days,

431
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:32,400
exchange your secret treasure for Pan Jun's life.

432
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,000
Otherwise,

433
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,720
you can only get his body.

434
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,759
You can let them go now.

435
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:40,559
Yes.

436
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,200
Let's go

437
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,039
Let's go.

438
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,559
Yaxin wants the secret treasure,

439
00:26:58,759 --> 00:26:59,720
not Pan Jun's life.

440
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,039
Yan Yun,

441
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,480
we need to calm down now.

442
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,599
How am I supposed to calm down?

443
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,759
Shi Miaomiao planned it step by step,

444
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,200
just to get back at us.

445
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,079
Because I trusted her so much before,

446
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,079
I'm scared even thinking about it now.

447
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,559
But when she was treating the plague,

448
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,759
she also put a lot of effort into it.

449
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:16,480
But this secret treasure is very important,

450
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:19,240
so we can't make our own decisions.

451
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,680
But now that Second Grandpa and Yan Ying are nowhere to be seen,

452
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,839
Pan Jun is trapped in Yaxin Mansion,

453
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,160
You and I only have three days,

454
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,200
do you understand?

455
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,279
I know that very well.

456
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:29,200
But my master is still alive,

457
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,200
so I can't decide whether to keep the secret treasure without permission.

458
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,440
But the secret treasure is dead and people are alive,

459
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,200
so long as people are alive, there will be hope.

460
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,759
If you were in there today,

461
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,079
I would have saved you.

462
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:44,079
Now we need to save not only Pan Jun,

463
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,319
but also Senior Feng.

464
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,759
Why is there no one inside?

465
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,079
Could it be that your master has been transferred?

466
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,759
Oh no.

467
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,240
Master.

468
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:23,359
Master,

469
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:24,519
Master,

470
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,440
Senior Feng,

471
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:27,960
Master,

472
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Senior Feng,

473
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:30,519
Master,

474
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,599
I'm late.

475
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,960
I'm late.

476
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,039
This is Master's clothes.

477
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:47,119
Master,

478
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,160
I'm late.

479
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,200
The blood isn't dry yet.

480
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,279
Your master may not have been taken away for long.

481
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,319
What is this?

482
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,680
Let me see.

483
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:25,119
This should be the seed of Stellar Chrysanthemum.

484
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,559
If you write with it,

485
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,039
you can see it in the dark.

486
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,640
This is unique to our soil system.

487
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,240
My master must have left it

488
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:39,200
to me. Remember,

489
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,240
I, the Zerg, have never betrayed anyone.

490
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,559
But the treasure is precious and attractive.

491
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,640
There are so many people eyeing it,

492
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,799
and they've been working hard for decades,

493
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:51,599
Don't listen to any rumors.

494
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:53,200
In case you fall into a trap.

495
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,400
Water system gentleman Shi Shiyu,

496
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,920
taking the lead and facing death unflinchingly,

497
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,440
If the water system can be dissolved later,

498
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,160
the five clans of Gan Ge will work together,

499
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,480
Don't let the treasure fall into the hands of others.

500
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,599
Master,

501
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,839
I understand.

502
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,039
What did your master say?

503
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:14,920
What do you mean?

504
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,279
My master said,

505
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,440
the five great clans of Golden Wood, Water, Fire and Earth,

506
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,559
There has never been a traitor.

507
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,640
No one has ever coveted the treasure.

508
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:27,200
Who influenced Miaomiao's hatred

509
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,480
at that time?

510
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:31,480
What Shi Miaomiao did,

511
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,880
do you think she did it for the treasure?

512
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,079
Or for revenge?

513
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:35,920
Well

514
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,079
Yanyun,

515
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,759
let's not talk about it anymore,

516
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,119
Save Pan Jun first.

517
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:48,079
Let's go.

518
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,359
You don't even have the deed and you dare to take it.

519
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,119
He even sent soldiers to guard it.

520
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,920
Is there any law?

521
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:04,799
In this world,

522
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,279
if you have a gun, you're the master,

523
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,920
If we guard like this,

524
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,279
we can't get in at all.

525
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,559
Sister Hua,

526
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,759
I saw you two from afar.

527
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:15,400
Where is my young master?

528
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,920
Pan Jun has other things to do.

529
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,039
So I didn't come.

530
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:22,000
He asked us to get some herbs,

531
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,720
Yes.

532
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,640
Sister Hua,

533
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,440
are there always so many soldiers guarding this place?

534
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,359
There are soldiers guarding this place during the day,

535
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,839
except in the middle of the night,

536
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,400
No one is watching at the back door.

537
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,680
Miss Yan Yun,

538
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:35,680
please send a message to my young master,

539
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,240
Tell him,

540
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,839
I got a job next door to the Cordyceps Hall.

541
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:42,240
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

542
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,680
Tell him to take good care of himself.

543
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:45,839
Remember to eat every day,

544
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,559
and take good care of yourself when you go out.

545
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:51,759
I'll stay here and keep watch.

546
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,319
Waiting for Young Master to come back.

547
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:54,880
Don't worry.

548
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,039
Then I won't stay here any longer.

549
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,559
I have work to do when I get back.

550
00:31:58,839 --> 00:31:59,599
I'll get going.

551
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,880
Okay. Take care.

552
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:14,599
Hold on.

553
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,400
They're catching up.

554
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,480
We can't take the main road anymore.

555
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,279
Go that way.

556
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,319
Okay.

557
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,240
-Hurry up. -Second grandpa, Second

558
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,200
grandpa,

559
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,119
The terrain of Mount Fuzhou is so complicated,

560
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,440
we can't find the direction

561
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:32,440
even if we go around. What should we do?

562
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:54,920
Over there.

563
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:15,839
Who?

564
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,720
You're from the Fire Department.

565
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:18,960
You're from the gold department,

566
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:19,920
Yes.

567
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,680
Come here.

568
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:25,240
The gold department is really loyal.

569
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,400
You didn't forget us.

570
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:27,799
Let's go.

571
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:28,880
Come with me.

572
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,440
Okay.

573
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,160
Come with me.

574
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,079
Watch out for Second Grandpa.

575
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,039
Take a break.

576
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:00,640
Okay,

577
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,279
Please rest assured.

578
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,240
This is Lang'ao in Fuzhou Mountain, and

579
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,039
they won't be able to find it for a while,

580
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,400
If there's an enemy approaching,

581
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,559
I'll protect you.

582
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:12,840
By the way,

583
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,519
in Jifang Cove,

584
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,599
There are all kinds of hidden weapons checkpoints,

585
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:18,960
even if they come here, they can't do anything to you.

586
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,920
Are there any wolves in Wolf'ao?

587
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:22,960
Don't be afraid.

588
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,800
I'm used to wolves.

589
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,480
Miss, aren't you afraid of wolves?

590
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:27,679
Of course.

591
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:30,920
By the way,

592
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,320
I forgot to report to myself,

593
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,920
My name is Duan Xiao'e,

594
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,719
a descendant of the Zerg Gold Branch.

595
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:38,880
Miss,

596
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,639
if I'm not wrong,

597
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,320
Jin Wu Yi is your master, right?

598
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,079
You are both my master and Xiao'e's family.

599
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:50,039
I've been lonely since I was a child,

600
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,639
and I've been living with my master.

601
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,639
Think of him as your grandfather.

602
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,559
I've known him for 20 to 30 years,

603
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:58,679
but I haven't seen him for a long time.

604
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,760
Tell me where he is now?

605
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:08,119
Master said

606
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:11,079
it's my duty to save you.

607
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:13,119
But the Zerg are troubled,

608
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,159
so he doesn't want to be involved in anything.

609
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,760
Senior Ouyang, please forgive me.

610
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,199
I'm afraid Master doesn't want to show up.

611
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:31,880
Are you hungry?

612
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,360
I'm going to make some food.

613
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,599
Thank you.

614
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,000
Sir,

615
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,599
what is this place?

616
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,639
This is Fuzhoushan Village

617
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,599
called Ailao Village,

618
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,119
Have you seen

619
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,760
a young man

620
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,079
and two old men?

621
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:23,239
Are you looking for them?

622
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:24,960
Yes.

623
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,639
No one knows this place better than I do.

624
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:29,960
Come with me.

625
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,559
As one of the five Zerg clans, the Gold Clan

626
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:02,119
is the only clan that doesn't deal with living creatures.

627
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:05,320
They inherited the magic of the Mo family's mechanism,

628
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,960
and their disciples

629
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:10,159
are meticulous in thinking and not chaotic in times of danger,

630
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,920
Jin Wu Yi, a gentleman of the gold department,

631
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,960
even got the true biography of the previous generation.

632
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:16,639
During the battle at Bamen Mountain,

633
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,039
all the Zerg clans withered.

634
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,320
Only him.

635
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,599
For so many years,

636
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,159
I've been living in seclusion here.

637
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:26,679
It makes me a little envious

638
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,320
that self-cultivation doesn't come out of the world.

639
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,719
Second grandpa,

640
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,440
can I ask you a question?

641
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:33,320
Tell me

642
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,280
What exactly happened in the Battle of Mount Ba Men?

643
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,920
Why are you always evasive

644
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,360
every time you mention it,

645
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,159
What's the reason?

646
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,519
Left is just because of my mother.

647
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,000
Now that Yanyun and I have grown up,

648
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,960
what else can't we explain clearly?

649
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:57,920
And my father,

650
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:00,400
why did he insist on going to Mount Ba Men 12 years ago?

651
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,000
That led to being expelled from the Zerg?

652
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:03,880
What kind of changes have happened?

653
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,400
Let my Zerg be worse than before.

654
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,840
Water system exterminates the Door and the Gold Department retreats,

655
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:09,639
what on earth is all this for?

656
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,880
During the battle at Bamen Mountain,

657
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,000
Jin Wuyi was injured by Shi Shiyu.

658
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:22,320
It causes leg disability.

659
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:25,039
Even Yingxuan can't do anything about it.

660
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,480
Leaving behind a lifelong regret.

661
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,800
Wu Yi has an unruly temperament,

662
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:30,559
and doesn't want to meet his old friend

663
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,079
as a cripple.

664
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,920
That makes sense.

665
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,800
Miaomiao,

666
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:51,920
you're getting more and more presumptuous.

667
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:54,440
If you let Ouyang and Ziwu go in private,

668
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,320
how can you explain to Shangfeng?

669
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,079
The Yaxin Club has been talking a lot.

670
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,559
They all say that you're acting arbitrarily here,

671
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,880
and for the AsiaInfo Association,

672
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,400
Isn't it enough to gather all the Zerg's secret treasures?

673
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:07,599
I don't care what I do.

674
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,559
Besides,

675
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,920
I'm doing this for the secret treasure,

676
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,360
they won't come back.

677
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:17,920
It's even more impossible to hand over the secret treasure.

678
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,000
Three days. I bet

679
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,119
they'll be back in three days.

680
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:25,079
Otherwise, I'm willing to accept any punishment.

681
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:27,360
If you want to kill or cut, do as you like.

682
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,159
Is that okay?

683
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,320
Miaomiao,

684
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,840
why do you have to push yourself

685
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,960
to a dead end every time.

686
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:38,199
I pushed myself to a dead end.

687
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,239
Matsui Shangyuan,

688
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,519
I've come this far,

689
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:47,639
Didn't you teach Shangfeng?

690
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:52,920
Get out of the way!

691
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,119
Miaomiao,
