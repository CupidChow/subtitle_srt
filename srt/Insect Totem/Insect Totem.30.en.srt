1
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,319
Let's go!

2
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,479
This is the Zerg treasure.

3
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,479
For thousands of years,

4
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,120
countless people have tried to find the Zerg treasure

5
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,400
but never came back.

6
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,280
No one would have thought that

7
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,639
on the other side of the tunnel of death,

8
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,520
It's like a fairyland.

9
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,840
Pan Jun,

10
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,439
don't think we have to rely on you on the way out.

11
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,919
We dare not do anything to you.

12
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,680
If you dare to play tricks.

13
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,959
No one wants to steal the treasure from you.

14
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,439
You two keep an eye on them.

15
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,720
You're indispensable to the treasure.

16
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,720
We have to stop him as soon as possible.

17
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,480
Otherwise, what kind of powerful things have been alerted?

18
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,560
None of us can escape.

19
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
Guys,

20
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,040
you just keep watching,

21
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,240
Aren't you greedy?

22
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,959
You don't really think,

23
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:27,560
your boss

24
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,639
will give you the gold and silver treasures, do you?

25
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,079
What kind of person is your boss?

26
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,560
It's not that you don't know.

27
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,680
I have these treasures.

28
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,879
The world belongs to me.

29
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,480
The world belongs to me.

30
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,680
He's changing bullets

31
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,639
right now. Right now.

32
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,279
Sun Tzu.

33
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,519
Miaomiao.

34
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,080
Hit me.

35
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Hit me again.

36
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,240
The six-legged and four-winged chaos has no face,

37
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,080
and it is the primordial insect of chaos.

38
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,799
The child worm is dangerous,

39
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,840
and the middle one will die instantly.

40
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,440
At the same time,

41
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,039
the female worm will be restless

42
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,120
and attack the host. The host will weaken and die in a short time.

43
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:04,919
Wanhu Mountain,

44
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,600
for the treasure,

45
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,200
How many people have you killed?

46
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,759
He ended up like this.

47
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,879
He's the one to blame.

48
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,480
The ancestors who were able to build such a mechanism,

49
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,840
must be people who look down on life and death.

50
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,279
Only by looking down on life and death,

51
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,600
and peeping through the glitz,

52
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,320
So as not to be fooled by greed in the world.

53
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,399
How many times have I looked forward to our Zerg treasure,

54
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,600
what exactly is it like?

55
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
But now,

56
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,600
I think it's a blessed place,

57
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:53,240
In fact, it's the Shura battlefield.

58
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:15,960
What's going on?

59
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,440
Why is the weather changing?

60
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,359
Kill him.

61
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:22,240
Well.

62
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,359
When I put my hand on it just now,

63
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,480
I seemed to see a lot of familiar people.

64
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:34,839
Well,

65
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:38,599
It's like standing in front of me.

66
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:42,079
But,

67
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,559
But it's like,

68
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,759
they're leaving me one by one.

69
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,559
This is an ominous thing.

70
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:01,720
Pan Jun,

71
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,000
after you go out,

72
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,400
You must take good care of yourself.

73
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,799
Remember to eat on time,

74
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,440
eat more vegetables,

75
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,279
Remember,

76
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,200
look at the sun more,

77
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,759
Smell the flowers,

78
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,319
Miaomiao,

79
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,440
What's wrong with you?

80
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,240
Miaomiao,

81
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,519
what's wrong with you?

82
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,240
Let's go. I'll take you out.

83
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:36,480
No.

84
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,079
Pan Jun.

85
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:40,720
Pan Jun.

86
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,799
It's too late.

87
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:00,720
It is said that

88
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,480
the ancestor, Madam Wu Luo,

89
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,400
It's on the banks of the Oro River.

90
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,240
He passed away on a small boat.

91
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,720
Before he died,

92
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,640
She said.

93
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,359
The withered trees spring up,

94
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,119
the begonia bloom again,

95
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,680
She can,

96
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,240
she can

97
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:41,720
return from another world.

98
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,039
Pan Jun,

99
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,319
I don't know.

100
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,519
Could there really be a different world?

101
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,680
All I know is,

102
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,640
every day I'm with you,

103
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,319
It's me.

104
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:14,880
The happiest day.

105
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Pan Jun.

106
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,640
If it weren't for you.

107
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,680
I don't think

108
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:37,839
I'm going to be like this,

109
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,200
So reluctant?

110
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,880
I can't bear to leave.

111
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,359
Miaomiao,

112
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:51,799
don't leave me, okay?

113
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,200
On the banks of the Oro River.

114
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,319
It's where people from the Water Department come from,

115
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,680
and also where they go.

116
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,799
Pan Jun

117
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:19,079
Take me home.

118
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:28,400
Me,

119
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:30,920
I really,

120
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,440
really want to

121
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,960
be with you,

122
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,839
spend together

123
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,160
A lifetime.

124
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:04,960
Miaomiao,

125
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:08,319
Miaomiao,

126
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,799
Miaomiao.

127
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,240
You've come all the way to this day.

128
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,720
I'm pretty sure.

129
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,200
You are the most important person to me in this world.

130
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,759
Miaomiao,

131
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,519
when it's all over,

132
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,640
Can you give me a home?

133
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:16,840
Director,

134
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,039
there's a patient outside.

135
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:21,119
He said he wanted to see you.

136
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,760
By the way, Director,

137
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:28,239
I've always wanted to ask you a question,

138
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,480
Why have you been here for decades?

139
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,440
You always water a dead branch.

140
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,360
because

141
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,400
Don't give up.

142
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,280
Don't give up.

143
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,320
Doctor, I need the medicine.

144
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,320
Okay, wait a minute.

145
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:12,920
Director,

146
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,199
go ahead.

147
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:16,679
Excuse me,

148
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
are you Doctor Pan Jun from Cordyceps Hall?

149
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,320
Yes,

150
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:23,599
I am,

151
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,800
What's wrong?

152
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,079
My great grandfather said,

153
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:28,039
as long as there is this thing,

154
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,440
That is, Doctor Pan,

155
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:32,800
a treasure hunting partner,

156
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,039
will treat us for free for generations.

157
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,119
Is that true?

158
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,119
Yes, it's true.

159
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:51,599
Thank you, Grandpa.

160
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,280
A pretty lady outside

161
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,440
asked me to give it to you.

162
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,639
Come and have a look.

163
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:19,880
Look!

164
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,400
The withered branch actually blossomed.

165
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,760
It's blooming. It's amazing.

166
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:26,519
Yeah, it's amazing.

167
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:27,599
It's really blooming.

168
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:29,239
It's the first time

169
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,800
to see it blossom.

170
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,039
This is incredible.

171
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:32,559
It's so beautiful.

172
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,599
It has never bloomed before.

173
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,960
Unbelievable,
