1
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:56,879
Come here.

2
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,400
How can I deal with him?

3
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,000
Thank you, coach,

4
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,560
for raising me for so many years.

5
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:39,000
Jiacheng has also worked hard

6
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,439
for Wan Jiajun for decades.

7
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,439
Um,

8
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,360
De

9
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,080
It has been paid off.

10
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,039
There's only one wish.

11
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,199
Please remove Jiacheng

12
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,319
from the Wanjia Army.

13
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,879
I was an orphan.

14
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,199
Since no one cares about you,

15
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,800
you shouldn't have any traces.

16
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,120
Jiacheng has been used by thousands of families all his life,

17
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,759
killing people,

18
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,639
He has hurt countless people

19
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,599
and committed grave sins.

20
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,120
You deserve to die.

21
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,319
And you,

22
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,560
too,

23
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,439
deserve to die.

24
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,280
This tea

25
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,199
is better in spring.

26
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,800
Everything is prosperous,

27
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,000
tea leaves are implicit,

28
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,319
It looks like a leaf,

29
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,560
when it comes to the right temperature,

30
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,240
It will give off

31
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,599
the vitality of spring,

32
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,520
Have some tea,

33
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
still

34
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,400
The vitality in drinking tea.

35
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,879
Let's see who deserves to die.

36
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:06,959
Hurry up.

37
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,040
Let's go!

38
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,600
Hurry up.

39
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,040
Hurry up.

40
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:17,959
Deputy Commander,

41
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,199
I've been searching Ba Song City for days,

42
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,519
The mob leader has been confirmed.

43
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,160
They are the only ones

44
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,160
who colluded with the bandit leader Pan Yingxuan

45
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,680
to confuse people and commit heinous crimes.

46
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,480
He deserves to be punished.

47
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,680
Take them all to prison.

48
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,160
They were put into the Human Grass Master Trial,

49
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,199
Yes.

50
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,360
Take him away.

51
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,079
Take him away.

52
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,120
Hurry up

53
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,360
Let's go.

54
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,560
Let's go.

55
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,040
Hurry up.

56
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,399
Jun'er.

57
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,720
I've been away from you for 12 years,

58
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,160
just to study the trial of Master of Human Resources and Grass.

59
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,360
Even if it's a one

60
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,439
in ten thousand chance, it's good.

61
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,160
But it never

62
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,759
occurred to me,

63
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,879
This bowl of medicine

64
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,399
is for my son.

65
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,959
Jun,

66
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,639
let me remind you,

67
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,519
Zixu Huai'an Cave

68
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,439
is specially designed to test herbalists.

69
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,279
It's no less dangerous

70
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,160
than the forests of Mount Bamen,

71
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,839
The poisonous insect miasma inside,

72
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,120
and the strange magnetic field,

73
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,600
It'll make you miserable.

74
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,360
Have you really made up your mind?

75
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,399
Pan Jun,

76
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,639
if you waver,

77
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,800
Actually, you can.

78
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:22,680
Pan Jun.

79
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,839
This is my secret treasure of wood, the Spirit Pivot Needle.

80
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,879
Gentleman

81
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,800
Please take the needle.

82
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,639
So, in this case,

83
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,279
the Human Grass Master Trial,

84
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,160
It's indeed one in a million.

85
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,480
The trial site is outside Bamen Mountain Forest,

86
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,959
and the name of the cave is Zixu Huai'an Cave.

87
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,639
Like a treasure,

88
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,240
there's probably no going back.

89
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,000
Or you may become insane.

90
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,439
The cave is covered by the magnetic field of Mount Bamen.

91
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,560
The same

92
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,040
poisonous miasma, right?

93
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,399
Yes,

94
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,040
the periphery is relatively weak,

95
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,559
Once you get close to the entrance,

96
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,120
it will be hard for ordinary people to get in.

97
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,320
Commander Ouyang,

98
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,919
once the treasure is opened,

99
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,240
You'll be in charge of the Ba Song area.

100
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,240
Your battalion will be expanded into a whole division,

101
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:50,799
and I hope you can become a nail buried in the Southwest

102
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,919
by the Wan Family Army.

103
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,360
It's a big responsibility.

104
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,159
There can be no woman's benevolence.

105
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,679
But those refugees are really not suitable for the trial.

106
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,240
Even if you bring another 5-thousand here,

107
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,679
you will die in vain.

108
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,000
Apart from a large-scale trial,

109
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,679
is there no other way?

110
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,919
You came to me with the Fire Tiger Tally?

111
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,639
I gave you the position of battalion commander,

112
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,600
and entrusted you with the important task of training as a herbalist.

113
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,159
But what about now?

114
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,039
The Tiger Tally is still with you

115
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,159
and the trial didn't work.

116
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,960
And you're making irresponsible remarks.

117
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,000
What do you mean?

118
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,720
Commander,

119
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,960
if the human-grass division trial continues,

120
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,720
I'm afraid the entire Ouyang Family's soldiers

121
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,000
will be involved.

122
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,440
When the time comes, even if I give you the Tiger Tally,

123
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,279
you will be powerless.

124
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,480
What I want you to know is,

125
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
without your help,

126
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,759
I can also become a herbalist,

127
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,159
Yes

128
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,279
One in a million.

129
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,279
Isn't it enough to find more people?

130
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,399
10thousand can't.

131
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,440
100 thousand then.

132
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,720
If 100thousand doesn't work,

133
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,080
then 1 million.

134
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,720
If that's the case,

135
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,879
why did Commander come to me as soon as he arrived in Ba Song?

136
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,679
Isn't it because of

137
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:25,200
the human resources and financial resources of the Zerg Fire Department?

138
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:26,360
Aren't you interested in

139
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,960
my power as an orthodox Zerg?

140
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,399
Young man,

141
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,000
I've been playing this game for over 20 years,

142
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,360
No one is more patient than me.

143
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,159
I don't want to do it anymore.

144
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,320
Deputy Commander,

145
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,360
why don't you want to do

146
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,080
such a heavy task?

147
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,200
I can't do it

148
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
without you,

149
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,960
What else do you want to try?

150
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,320
If you ask me, just blow up the mountain.

151
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,960
After three or five years,

152
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,840
I don't believe Mount Bamen can't be blown up,

153
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,000
The treasure won't come out.

154
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,519
Even if you blow up Mount Ba Men,

155
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,480
we can't do anything about the magnetic field.

156
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,600
Don't always be like Wan Jiacheng,

157
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
nagging me about

158
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,919
how he died. Don't you know?

159
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,960
Yes.

160
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:57,960
Please inform us.

161
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,320
Tell them that Pan Yingxuan from the Zerg Floral Branch

162
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,080
wants to see the commander-in-chief of the Wanchao Sect,

163
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:02,840
Hold on a second.

164
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,559
Let him in.

165
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:04,960
Yes.

166
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:08,440
Uncle Pan.

167
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:16,759
So he's the battalion commander of Ba Song Garrison.

168
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,799
Thank you, Pan Yingxuan.

169
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:20,879
Uncle Pan, don't be like this.

170
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,840
Are Duan Xiao'e

171
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,120
and the others okay?

172
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,919
Well,

173
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,000
you can ask them yourself.

174
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,360
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Gao Huaiyuan,

175
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,200
so you're Pan Yingxuan, a senior from the Department of Wood.

176
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,000
You,

177
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,519
The article is sharp,

178
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,279
the writing is brilliant,

179
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,799
Sorry to see you, commander-in-chief.

180
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,600
Yingxuan came this time,

181
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,399
on the command of the commander-in-chief,

182
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,840
No, no, no.

183
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,679
I invited you here to ask me a question.

184
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,919
What do you mean?

185
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,519
After you.

186
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,240
You may leave.

187
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,200
Stop bumping into me, sir.

188
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,600
Okay,

189
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:18,759
Get off.

190
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:19,519
Yes.

191
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,320
Back then, I followed Lord He

192
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,039
to explore treasures in Bamen Mountain,

193
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:04,759
He's just a small potato around him.

194
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:06,759
Yingxuan,

195
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,279
you're already a wood gentleman,

196
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,639
Young talent,

197
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,519
time flies now,

198
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,879
We met old friends,

199
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,200
just like what you said,

200
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:19,879
Nephew Pan Jun,

201
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,559
if you can really become

202
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,720
a herbalist of the Zerg,

203
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,440
That's a big deal

204
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,080
for the Zerg.

205
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,399
Commander,

206
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,399
the trial of Herbal Master is a matter of life.

207
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:36,200
Can you pause for a moment?

208
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,240
It depends on your sincerity.

209
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,639
As long as the Human Grass Master's trial is successful,

210
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,320
the Zerg's wood system,

211
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,679
I'm willing to lead the commander into Bamen Mountain.

212
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
Explore the treasure again.

213
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,120
Very happy.

214
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,360
Very happy.

215
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,600
Come on,

216
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,720
I'll drink tea

217
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,639
instead of wine. Here's to you.

218
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,799
Why are you here?

219
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,480
Uncle Pan told you

220
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,200
to have a good rest tonight.

221
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,080
Keep your spirits up.

222
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,679
Are you here to put me to sleep?

223
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,159
He gave me

224
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,759
the Mo Yu Bracelet

225
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,799
to defend against some poisonous insects in the cave.

226
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,879
Young Master Xue and Uncle Pan have mentioned that

227
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:20,360
when you wear it,

228
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
It can improve your chances of success.

229
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,639
Are you scared?

230
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,559
I'm afraid.

231
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,960
Of course I am.

232
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
However,

233
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,759
I have to go.

234
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,360
Besides,

235
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:48,080
I'm waiting for you to give me a home in the future.

236
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,279
All right,

237
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,960
don't act like you're saying goodbye.

238
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,639
Okay?

239
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,240
This is just a peaceful day

240
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,920
for the rest of our lives.

241
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,519
It's the same today,

242
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,000
and it will be the same in the future.

243
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,279
He'll be fine.

244
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,680
Let's call it a day.

245
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,440
I'll wait for you here.

246
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,920
Xiao'e and Xi,

247
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,000
they'll guard the outer area with their soldiers.

248
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,440
I'll wait for you to come out.

249
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,559
Let's get out of the forest together.

250
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,759
If I don't come out in a day,

251
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,000
you should leave now.

252
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,200
Promise me.

253
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,640
Also.

254
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:45,920
If I come out,

255
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,359
you'll find that I'm crazy.

256
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,039
You know what to do.

257
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,720
Don't be soft-hearted.

258
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,000
All right.

259
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,480
Watch out!

260
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,519
Inform Mu Dong

261
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:27,079
that we can move now.

262
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,960
Yes.

263
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,480
Dad,

264
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,160
I don't understand. Why didn't you detain Pan Yingxuan?

265
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,400
If we detain him, his son will risk his life with us.

266
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,200
People, grass and teachers are precious,

267
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,480
they are holding the door of our lives.

268
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,519
Yes,

269
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:45,279
That's right.

270
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:52,680
Father,

271
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,640
Send more men

272
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,880
to take care of

273
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,359
Master Mu Dong. I want to live.

274
00:20:58,759 --> 00:20:59,920
If anyone obstructs you,

275
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,440
kill him.

276
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,279
Pan Jun,

277
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:27,480
Pan Jun, wake up,

278
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,519
Pan Jun.

279
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,119
Isn't this Erleng

280
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,480
who likes to be a hero?

281
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,240
Isn't he a greedy, lustful

282
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,759
and sworn swindler?

283
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,480
That's a very accurate description.

284
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,519
Brother,

285
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,920
how many oaths

286
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,400
have you taken in your life,

287
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,599
I took a lot of vows.

288
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,960
But few of them have been cashed.

289
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,519
Not many of them have been cashed.

290
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,000
But I've never cashed it.

291
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,319
Let me think about it.

292
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:20,279
Don't think about it.

293
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,759
Today,

294
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:23,480
you have to cash it once.

295
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,720
Just once.

296
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,400
What?

297
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,200
Get out alive.

298
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:37,640
Pan Jun,

299
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,519
I want you to get out of here alive.

300
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,680
Brother,

301
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,720
don't die!

302
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,559
I won't die.

303
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,839
Take care.

304
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,640
I won't die.

305
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,079
Come on.

306
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,920
I'm here.

307
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:02,000
Brother Pan,

308
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,920
are you okay?

309
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,279
Do I look like I have something to do?

310
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:08,759
But I've brought you here.

311
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,640
It's too foggy here.

312
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:20,680
There's an ambush.

313
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,279
Let's go.

314
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,079
Don't move.

315
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:33,960
Nobody move!

316
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,000
The herbalist Pan Jun

317
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,880
stays. The others leave.

318
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,160
Yan Ying,

319
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,519
you've grown up, haven't you?

320
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:58,680
Hurry up and shoot!

321
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,200
Ouyang Yanying,

322
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,680
shoot me.

323
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,599
Don't be like this.

324
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,000
Shoot me to death!

325
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,079
Get out of the way.

326
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,440
Let's go.

327
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,319
Let's go!

328
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,119
Let's go!

329
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:57,680
Let's go.

330
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,440
Ouyang Yanying is chasing after us.

331
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:19,160
You just wait and see!

332
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:30,559
over there

333
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,200
Oh, no. We seem to have lost our way.

334
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,839
Are you lost?

335
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:24,880
Sir,

336
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:28,000
please spare my life.

337
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,039
Take him away.

338
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:43,440
Pan Jun

339
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,320
You're really an adult herbalist.

340
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:46,239
Yes.

341
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,440
Otherwise, he wouldn't have come out so easily.

342
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,960
Why did you come back empty-handed?

343
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,480
I failed to stop

344
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:59,679
Pan Jun and the others.

345
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,840
I think

346
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,599
you let them go on purpose, right?

347
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,880
Mu Dong went after him.

348
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,920
Why didn't you go after him?

349
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,159
Commander,

350
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,719
the forest is full of fog,

351
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:14,000
I don't dare to shoot.

352
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,599
I'm afraid I'll hurt you, Master Cao.

353
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:21,519
I'll write a letter and send someone

354
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,159
to Pan Yingxuan tomorrow,

355
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,360
Hushan,

356
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,599
you go down first.

357
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,679
Father,

358
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,880
What about him?

359
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,360
Get off.

360
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,119
You're lying.

361
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,320
You're really like your mother.

362
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,039
You can't let go of your child's affair.

363
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,760
Your mother,

364
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,519
Trapped by love,

365
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,880
I hurt myself

366
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,480
and the whole Fire Family,

367
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,800
What about you?

368
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,960
I can't let go of my lover,

369
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,639
so I dare not shoot him.

370
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:52,760
I've delayed my business.

371
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,719
This is not the way to do big things.

372
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,800
I didn't want to do anything big,

373
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,840
man,

374
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,360
If you want to pursue something,

375
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,920
you'll ruin yourself sooner or later.

376
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,480
Don't make it so serious.

377
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,320
I won't kill myself.

378
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,000
I don't want to ruin myself.

379
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,480
You can destroy me now.

380
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:18,519
It's good that

381
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,960
you're the only one who knows.

382
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,960
I can use you.

383
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,239
Of course I can ruin you.

384
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,559
If you're willing to be used by me,

385
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,039
we'll take what we need.

386
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,599
Everyone is happy.

387
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,239
Pan Jun, Shi Miaomiao,

388
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:40,960
Duan Xiao'e,

389
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:43,840
Love keeps talking about how to control Ba Song,

390
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,320
and how to talk about a fire gentleman?

391
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
Chief Zerg,

392
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,920
there's no need

393
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,679
to dominate the Southwest.

394
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,679
In Bashu area,

395
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:05,800
I admire your grandfather

396
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,639
Ouyang Leiyun the most,

397
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:09,880
He acts with a heavy attitude

398
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,800
and is decisive in killing,

399
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,199
At the critical moment,

400
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,599
I'd rather sacrifice my family.

401
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,360
You have to achieve your goal.

402
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:59,400
Eat more or less.

403
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,840
At least put some before you drink the medicine.

404
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:04,800
Uncle Pan made these medicines for you.

405
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,280
Everything about Ziwu is here now,

406
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,239
but he's not here.

407
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:34,559
Xiao'e.

408
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,719
Sis Yan Yun,

409
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:39,960
you're awake.

410
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,239
Uncle Yingxuan,

411
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,199
since Brother Pan Jun

412
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,920
has successfully tried the Master of Human Resources and Grass.

413
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,559
Commander reminded me,

414
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:02,039
I hope you can keep the promise

415
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,800
on the opening day of the treasure,

416
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,599
Going to Bamen Mountain together,

417
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:08,599
is considered a grand move to assist the Zerg.

418
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,119
As for the details,

419
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,679
you can tell by reading this letter.

420
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:27,079
Don't you care about Xiao'e?

421
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,280
Pan Jun,

422
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,840
is it your sister

423
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:33,079
or the dead Ziwu?

424
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,239
After my mother passed away,

425
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,760
the past,

426
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,519
It has nothing to do with me.

427
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:41,559
You still have a father?

428
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:43,840
Does it have nothing to do with you?

429
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,760
He never cared about me.

430
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:48,039
Why should I care about him?

431
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,760
This one

432
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:57,719
It was left by your father.

433
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:02,960
If Commander Ouyang wants to,

434
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,320
can he

435
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,360
take him away?

436
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:10,559
Do you care?

437
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:27,079
Uncle Yingxuan,

438
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,440
after leaving today,

439
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,480
If we see each other again, we'll be at the foot of Ba Men Mountain.

440
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,760
There's still a long way to go.

441
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:38,760
See you.
