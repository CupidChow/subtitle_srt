1
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,039
You're on a hunger strike.

2
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,000
You're at your wit's end,

3
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,879
how

4
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,800
You want to send me on the road.

5
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,560
Kind of.

6
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,919
I issued a military order,

7
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,400
and within three days,

8
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,879
If your Yanyun can't get the secret treasure,

9
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,120
I'll die,

10
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,159
What did you say?

11
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,599
Of course, you can't live either.

12
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,800
On the contrary,

13
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,120
if Yan Yunziwu still dares to throw himself into the net,

14
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,919
When I got the secret treasure,

15
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,120
I sacrificed your heads to my mother.

16
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,199
It's not Miaomiao,

17
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,840
it's a matter of the previous generation,

18
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,520
Can our generation let it go?

19
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
Shangfeng said,

20
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,719
if it doesn't work this time,

21
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,759
The first one to be killed is Pan Jun.

22
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,199
Second,

23
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,000
it's us.

24
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,199
Weird,

25
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,479
It's all because we were born in the Zerg.

26
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,319
It hurts.

27
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,240
It hurts.

28
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,520
What are you doing?

29
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,639
You poisoned me again?

30
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,319
This is a mother-child worm.

31
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,159
I have the mother worm,

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,560
but if you get too close to me,

33
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,639
When the child senses the mother,

34
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,280
it will get excited.

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,400
You'll feel itchy all over your body.

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,360
If you're too far away from me,

37
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,479
the child can't sense the mother,

38
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,560
You will be agitated and die.

39
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,319
Well

40
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,199
What about me?

41
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,599
I … I will burp my ass.

42
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,639
That's right.

43
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,159
So now,

44
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,120
You're free again.

45
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,680
Miaomiao, are you really...

46
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,080
You even play hard to get by poisoning me?

47
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,759
The power to refuse and be

48
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,639
at arm's length,

49
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,439
Then I'll take it as a compliment.

50
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,400
Miaomiao, can you do

51
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,360
whatever you want? Just do what you want.

52
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,199
You don't have to lock him up anymore.

53
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,240
He didn't dare to run,

54
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,360
Yes.

55
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,519
No, Miaomiao, I'm begging you.

56
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,720
I'm begging you, okay?

57
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,000
Miaomiao.

58
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,839
What kind of immortal did I offend again?

59
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,240
Come with me.

60
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,600
Your water system is amazing.

61
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,959
It's easy

62
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,079
to make our four families turn around.

63
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,759
You've been a gambler in the Gold Department for so many years.

64
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,480
You disobeyed the rules and broke your promise,

65
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,800
and you asked me to send someone to invite you here.

66
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,319
You're so respectable.

67
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,879
If you have anything to say, just say it.

68
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,879
Don't beat around the bush.

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,720
The sacred object of Zerg, He Luoshi.

70
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,680
As an apprentice that my master doesn't recognize,

71
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,519
I can know where

72
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,680
the secret treasure is going,

73
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,879
Feng'er and Xiao Fusheng from Chunxiang Restaurant,

74
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,720
I'll take good care of them for you.

75
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,720
How dare you lay a finger on them!

76
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,800
I'll kill you.

77
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,079
You can give it a try.

78
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,839
Open the Zerg treasure,

79
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,079
in addition to the five series of secret treasures,

80
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,959
He Luoshi is also a necessary condition,

81
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,079
for thousands of years,

82
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,800
How many people died in the Bamen Mountain forest,

83
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,600
more or less,

84
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,040
They were unable to find all the gentlemen of Luoshi Five Clans

85
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,120
and were taken to Mount Ba Men by Lord He,

86
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,439
That led to Senior Shi Shiyu's

87
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,120
mad and tragic death.

88
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,000
Because of He Shi and Luo Shi.

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,160
At least one of them is fake.

90
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,120
Go on.

91
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,240
In addition to our five series secret treasures,

92
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,519
the Zerg ancestors gave River Stone and Luo Shi

93
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,480
to the Xue family for safekeeping.

94
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,279
That is to prevent the Zerg treasure

95
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,680
from being easily opened.

96
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,920
Xue's Group,

97
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,519
that's right.

98
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,480
What about Xue clan?

99
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,959
At the end of the Ming Dynasty,

100
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,000
Luo Shi was lost.

101
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,839
After years of searching, I couldn't find it,

102
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:29,639
and then Lord He found Luo Shi among the people,

103
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,720
So on the day of the sting 24 years ago,

104
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,000
he took our five departments to Bamen Mountain.

105
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,279
As for the rest,

106
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,800
you should know.

107
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:40,120
Since Luo Shi is nowhere to be seen,

108
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,560
how can we tell if it's true or not?

109
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,480
You really don't know anything?

110
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,680
Stop talking nonsense.

111
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,439
If you want to enter the Bamen Mountain Forest,

112
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,120
you have to go through three levels to seize the Zerg treasure,

113
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,199
The Five Clans'Secret Treasures entered the jungle, and

114
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,560
the fog filled the barrier bridge.

115
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,639
Take River Rock across the tunnel,

116
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,800
the forest of Bamen Mountain,

117
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,680
It's very strange.

118
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,279
Everyone will be lost when they go in.

119
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,560
It needs a compass made up of the treasures of the five clans,

120
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,959
so that it can point the way.

121
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,800
Then the Master of Human Resources and Grass crossed the barrier bridge,

122
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,040
and arrived at the tunnel.

123
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,120
This tunnel is the key.

124
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,639
You need to carry river stones and Luo Shi

125
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,040
to enter smoothly.

126
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,720
Back then,

127
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,160
Lord He went in first

128
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,279
with Qing soldiers and He Luoshi,

129
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,720
Where is Shi Shiyu?

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,160
I'm afraid that the Zerg treasure will fall into the hands of others.

131
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,360
So I followed him in.

132
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
Who would have thought of that?

133
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,639
When he came out,

134
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,720
Senior Shi Shiyu was covered in blood,

135
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,720
Crazy into a demon and killing innocent people,

136
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,240
so,

137
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,440
There's something wrong with the Heluo Stone,

138
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,480
that's for sure.

139
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,799
In those days,

140
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,840
which gentlemen of the Four Clans tried hard to persuade each other,

141
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,080
I can't bear to

142
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,840
hurt Senior Shi Shiyu,

143
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,480
At the end of the day, there was nothing I could do.

144
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,960
That's why he killed Senior Shi Shiyu.

145
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,960
Why did my mother become crazy?

146
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,480
Why is the Heluo Stone out of order?

147
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,200
Did someone set you up on purpose?

148
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,399
Lord He?

149
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,279
Xue Shi

150
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,399
Or is it the Zerg Four Clans at all?

151
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,240
Lord He is dead,

152
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,639
so there is no way to verify it.

153
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,919
The Xue clan has been keeping Heluo Stone for many years,

154
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,360
so there's no need to doubt it.

155
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,320
So the Fire Branch

156
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,440
with the highest status among the five departments,

157
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,639
So he passed on his anger to Lord He's daughter.

158
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
She's Ouyang Yanyun and Yan Ying's mother.

159
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,639
That's right,

160
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,000
my own daughter-in-law,

161
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,720
Even my own daughter-in-law,

162
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,000
she didn't escape the punishment of a thousand insects eating away bones.

163
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,720
What happened after that?

164
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,679
What happened to Mrs. Ouyang?

165
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,440
I don't know.

166
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,440
He must be dead.

167
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
What about He Luo Shi?

168
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,399
Where is the real He Luo Shi now?

169
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,759
Lingcheng.

170
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,720
I just want to know,

171
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,159
can you help us get the real river stone?

172
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,440
It's just Luo Shi.

173
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,440
It's impossible.

174
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,080
You were out there all the time,

175
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:28,639
but I just happened to hear the key information.

176
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,720
In a month,

177
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,840
I found He Luoshi,

178
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,600
One thousand oceans.

179
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,080
One thousand oceans.

180
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,679
You must have a way.

181
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,440
He had to finish it in a month.

182
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:55,679
Right?

183
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,759
Don't let me and Shangfeng down on you again.

184
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,120
There are limits to my tolerance and love.

185
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,919
Cool,

186
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,639
Golden silkworm,

187
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
a one-month period,

188
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:50,960
Got it?

189
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,679
Perfect.

190
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,399
Lin,

191
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,919
Yaxin Club is supporting you.

192
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,559
It's also Mrs. Matsui.

193
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:54,960
It's the Yaxin Club.

194
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,200
That's good.

195
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,360
How can you still be rational?

196
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:00,879
Mr. Matsui,

197
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,159
what exactly is this?

198
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:06,799
I, Yaxin, am a member of the pharmaceutical industry.

199
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,000
Fengchen Jun, who serves us,

200
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,720
is a medical weirdo who can do anything,

201
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,399
You know what?

202
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,159
There's nothing I can't do.

203
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:20,279
Just want to or not,

204
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:21,919
as for

205
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,759
This is good stuff.

206
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,399
I can make Shi Miaomiao submit to me obediently.

207
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,279
To be my real Mrs. Matsui.

208
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:39,039
She can only belong to me.

209
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:40,600
It belongs to me.

210
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,399
No one can take it away.

211
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,200
The wolves came out late at night.

212
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:23,200
If we don't withdraw from Mount Fuzhou,

213
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,840
I'm afraid we won't catch him.

214
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,720
We lost our lives here.

215
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Darn it.

216
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,120
The sound of the flute

217
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,200
is familiar

218
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,200
when we withdraw.

219
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,559
You're so good at playing.

220
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,159
Can I have a look

221
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,679
at this piccolo?

222
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:44,440
I've long heard that your Fire Department is far in the southwest,

223
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,559
and you're violent,

224
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,759
Piccolo can drive away birds and animals,

225
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,519
not to mention lions and tigers.

226
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,000
Unexpectedly,

227
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,200
the melody is so beautiful.

228
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,279
I'm flattered,

229
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:56,919
but unfortunately,

230
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,320
I'm not a descendant of Fire Branch,

231
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm afraid I won't be able to learn in this life.

232
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,159
Then you can learn it after marrying into the Fire Department.

233
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,160
I forgot how itchy it is.

234
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,319
How can I forget that?

235
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,079
It's just that it's so boring

236
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,039
to be alone at night.

237
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,240
I was just teasing you.

238
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,960
You were

239
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,680
enjoying flowers just now,

240
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,160
Begonia flower,

241
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:10,559
this flower means a lot to you.

242
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,240
After my mother died,

243
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,400
the already withered river system fled everywhere.

244
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,240
I was brought up by Concubine Qiao,

245
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,319
and then someone took revenge on me.

246
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,359
That night,

247
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,880
they burned down the stockade.

248
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,680
The fire in the Wu Luo River is really strong.

249
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,519
It burned for three whole days and nights.

250
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,319
All the crabapple flowers in the house

251
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
are gone.

252
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,799
Well,

253
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,640
then who is chasing after the river system?

254
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,799
They claim to be the Four Clans of Gold, Wood, Fire and Earth,

255
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,759
and they want to wipe out our water system.

256
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,799
I'm telling you, this is absolutely true.

257
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,519
It's absolutely impossible.

258
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,480
The noodles here are willing.

259
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,400
There must be something fishy.

260
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,240
Think about it. It's definitely not us.

261
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:20,680
Really?

262
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:24,079
Tell me,

263
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,640
what should I do?

264
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,599
I can't go back,

265
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,599
Miaomiao.

266
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,559
I can't go back.

267
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,079
I can't go back.

268
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,599
What's wrong, Miaomiao?

269
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:46,759
What's wrong with you, Miaomiao.

270
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:51,440
What's wrong with you?

271
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:52,960
Is Miaomiao okay?

272
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:54,240
Get out of the way!

273
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,480
My wife is tired,

274
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,680
and she needs me to help her back to her room.

275
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,079
You once said,

276
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,000
you would accompany me back to my hometown.

277
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,880
You can't break your promise.

278
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,319
Pan Jun.

279
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,440
Shouldn't you be down?

280
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,480
Pan Jun.

281
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,480
You jerk!

282
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:26,759
Hurry up!

283
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,880
Your lady was drugged.

284
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,960
Hurry up and get some water!

285
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:32,759
What about you?

286
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,960
Brother, I'm a doctor.

287
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,400
-I'm saving people. -I …

288
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,960
What do you think will happen to me?

289
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,000
What can I do?

290
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,400
What do I want to do to her?

291
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,279
There's another person lying here.

292
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,720
I'm not an animal.

293
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,119
Where's my Qingsi?

294
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,400
My Qingsi was taken away by your lady Hurry

295
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,880
Do you know where Qingsi is?

296
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,640
Calm down,

297
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,359
Qingshui Qingsi. Go.

298
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,880
Go, go, go!

299
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:17,079
Miaomiao

300
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,119
Hunian, don't release the deduction yet.

301
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,079
Pan Jun,

302
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:25,519
Hunian,

303
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,960
Hunian, don't do this.

304
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:27,960
Pan Jun,

305
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:30,680
Miaomiao, stop peeling it.

306
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,319
Pan Jun.

307
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,799
Pan Jun.

308
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,079
God, Amitabha,

309
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:45,240
I'm begging you. I'm begging you.

310
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,480
Don't do this. Really, don't do this.

311
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,799
Color is empty, space is color,

312
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,400
and there is a knife on the prefix of color.

313
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,000
I can't hold it anymore.

314
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,240
Don't move! Don't move!

315
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,200
Here comes the water.

316
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,039
Hurry up.

317
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,119
Isn't it for you?

318
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,640
Now I need this

319
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:12,960
even more,

320
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,319
I'll give you a prescription later,

321
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:15,359
you go buy some herbs,

322
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,799
The most important thing now,

323
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,799
is to take him away.

324
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:19,759
Hurry up!

325
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,799
Don't worry,

326
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,279
I won't tell you that you helped me.

327
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,400
Thank you.

328
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,000
Qingsi, go.

329
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,480
Pan Jun,

330
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,880
I'm begging you.

331
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,759
Hurry up.

332
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,240
Yanyun,

333
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,680
this is Ye Lanxiang,

334
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,480
After burning, it can produce smoke,

335
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,200
which can make people unconscious.

336
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,079
-Put this on! -Who is

337
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,079
it? -Stop!

338
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:01,519
Run,

339
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,880
Catch them!

340
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,599
Let's go.

341
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:09,680
Stop!

342
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,680
No need to chase him.

343
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,799
Just a few thieves.

344
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:30,119
Feng'er,

345
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,039
turn off the light.

346
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,079
Where's Fusheng?

347
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:50,559
He's asleep.

348
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,000
He's asleep.

349
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,720
They didn't do anything to you, did they?

350
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
To make a long story short.

351
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:58,039
I'm going to Lingcheng for a month.

352
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,200
You must come back.

353
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,839
Don't worry. I'll redeem both of you

354
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,839
when I come back.

355
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,559
You're still helping those people

356
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:06,400
to do evil.

357
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:08,640
Stop asking.

358
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:09,839
I told you,

359
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:11,079
I don't want anything from you.

360
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:13,359
So don't ask me anything.

361
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,519
Trust me,

362
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,200
if you keep doing those lousy things,

363
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,599
I don't need you to redeem it.

364
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,400
You.

365
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,480
What about Fusheng?

366
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,079
I grew up in a kiln.

367
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,640
Live like me in a pile of mud.

368
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,000
Take your time,

369
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,839
Mom. Don't pick up customers,

370
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,319
By the way,

371
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:42,559
this,

372
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,319
Give it to Fusheng.

373
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,160
I...

374
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:53,440
I'm leaving.

375
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
I'll wait for you to come back.

376
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,680
Good morning, Miss Xiao'e.

377
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:48,559
Good morning.

378
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,079
Did you sleep well last night?

379
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:53,359
It's good.

380
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,039
This one

381
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,440
I made breakfast for you.

382
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:57,559
Eat it while it's hot.

383
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,799
Miss Xiao'e, how can you cook?

384
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:01,960
Of course.

385
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,559
Unlike you, Mr. Yanxi,

386
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:07,119
I can feed horses, chop firewood and build houses

387
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,279
without any problem.

388
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:11,119
Thank you.

389
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,000
I'm going to take care of the garden.

390
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,039
See you later.

391
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:35,480
It's a good thing you came.

392
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:36,920
Otherwise, I wouldn't even wake up.

393
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,920
Miss, take something to cushion yourself first,

394
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,160
and then drink the medicine.

395
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,680
This is the medicine Dr. Pan

396
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,759
prescribed last night. Take it.

397
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,160
I was drunk

398
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:48,640
last night.

399
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,880
Are you rude?

400
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,960
No.

401
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,599
Why are you up?

402
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,279
Are you still upset?

403
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,000
Are you okay now?

404
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,880
I'm telling you,

405
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,039
you have to drink this medicine for another day.

406
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,160
So that you can get rid of all the dirty stuff.

407
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,279
Dirty stuff.

408
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,440
What on earth happened?

409
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,119
Tell me the truth.

410
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,079
Dr. Pan,

411
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,680
Mr. Matsui is awake.

412
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,720
He asked you to come and take a look.

413
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,799
Please.

414
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:00,640
Remember to take the medicine.

415
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Tell me the truth.

416
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,359
I want to know everything.

417
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,720
Now you're the only one left in the soil department.

418
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,680
Now that you've made your decision, you can't go back on your word.

419
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:33,400
If anything happens to you,

420
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,279
Second Grandpa will scold me to death.

421
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,680
Yan Yun, don't worry,

422
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:39,720
we have the secret treasure in hand,

423
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,200
Miaomiao won't act rashly

424
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,039
at this moment.

425
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,680
But this woman is vicious

426
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,359
and has a weird mind.

427
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:54,400
So,

428
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,039
we have to ask her out.

429
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,519
It can't be in her place.

430
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
You can do whatever you want.

431
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,720
What do you Chinese people call that?

432
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,640
An eye for an eye.

433
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:18,920
You attacked me last night?

434
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,559
I want to give it back to you

435
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,079
today. You're disgusting.

436
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,960
To treat a girl in such a dirty way,

437
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,839
I'm telling you,

438
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,319
What's wrong if I hit you?

439
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,039
I just don't know Kung Fu.

440
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,319
If I know Kung Fu,

441
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:49,119
I'll stop!

442
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:52,680
Miaomiao,

443
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:54,440
you're here.

444
00:32:58,839 --> 00:32:59,680
Why?

445
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:08,799
Did my wife

446
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,400
come here specially to save another man?

447
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:22,400
You haven't let go of the drunkenness and fatigue

448
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,880
last night, have you?

449
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:25,200
Look at you,

450
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,839
you look so pale.

451
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,400
Matsui,

452
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,000
you're making me feel terrible now.

453
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,400
Terrible. Who has been protecting you

454
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,119
in Japan

455
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:42,240
all these years?

456
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:45,519
I'm tolerant and accommodating to you everywhere.

457
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:48,079
And you?

458
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,519
How will you repay me?

459
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:54,759
now

460
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,359
You even argued with me for a charlatan.

461
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:01,039
I've changed

462
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,400
or Shi Miaomiao, you've changed.

463
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:10,039
You and I

464
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,679
have served Shangfeng all these years,

465
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,960
There's nothing else but work.

466
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:18,320
Mrs. Matsui

467
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:21,199
is just a reputation for convenient activities.

468
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,920
You and I know it very well.

469
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,320
There's no need to dwell on it.

470
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,280
Love is the easiest

471
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,880
to use and the most confusing.

472
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:33,480
Don't you think so?

473
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,559
Mr. Matsui has been living in the mortal world

474
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:38,599
for so many years,

475
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,239
As a director of Yaxin who has been in love in the mall for a long time,

476
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:46,000
are you in love with me?

477
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,639
Gosh.

478
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,039
A vicious woman,

479
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,639
work is more important. Shangfeng is more important.

480
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:10,320
The Zerg treasure is more important.

481
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,800
Mr. Matsui.

482
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:20,079
Who is it?

483
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:21,599
A letter from Miss Shi.

484
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,159
That's great.

485
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,280
Now you can explain to Shangfeng.

486
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:46,639
Yanyun and Ziwu are very loyal.

487
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,239
They are willing to trade the secret treasure for your life.

488
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,519
No, Miaomiao,

489
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:52,440
Miaomiao

490
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,239
The secret treasures and treasures belong to the Zerg.

491
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,400
You can't give it to anyone else

492
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:59,039
Miaomiao's secret treasure,

493
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,480
Mr. Matsui,

494
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:03,199
I'm taking him with me now.

495
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:05,519
Do you have a problem with that?

496
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,199
Tonight in Warehouse 3,

497
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:29,159
Fire and Earth will exchange the secret treasure for your life.

498
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,639
You can't get away with this

499
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,239
and I can't avoid what Matsui and Shangfeng want,

500
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,599
I have to

501
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:38,840
take your lives. I don't have to take them for now.

502
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:40,800
I'll find out the truth.

503
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,320
When the deal is over,

504
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,639
let's not see each other again.

505
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,119
Miaomiao,

506
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,480
if you believe me,

507
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,559
Don't ask any more questions.

508
00:36:58,679 --> 00:36:59,639
Come with me.

509
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,679
When we leave this place,

510
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,039
I'll protect you.

511
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,880
Trust me, okay?

512
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,079
Don't you notice that

513
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,480
you don't itch anymore?

514
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:19,960
I've detoxified you.

515
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,880
Will you really protect me?

516
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,239
I'll care about what Shangfeng will do.

517
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,480
I'll see tonight.

518
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:31,039
In fact, even if you run away,

519
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,960
I have nothing to say.

520
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,280
I still choose to trust you.

521
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,920
Get some rest.

522
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,559
I have something else to do.

523
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,760
I'll take you to the warehouse tonight.

524
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:49,400
If you don't run away.

525
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,000
Mr. Matsui,

526
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,239
a telegram from Shangfeng

527
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,760
Read it

528
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,880
Mr. Jin will arrive at North Zhou Shangfeng on the 15th of this month

529
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,639
and ask you to do a good job of reception.

530
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,960
He said that after finding the subject,

531
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,840
he would like to have a talk with Lingcheng.

532
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:19,039
At that time, according to the agreement,

533
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:20,800
Mr. Jin will transfer the shares of the pharmaceutical factory

534
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,639
to you.

535
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,639
Also,

536
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,880
What else?

537
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,639
The telegram says that He Luoshi is indeed in Ling City.

538
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,559
It seems that as Jin Shun said,

539
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,639
it's good.

540
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:44,000
I can prepare to

541
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,360
take over Yaxin Pharmaceutical Factory now.

542
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:49,079
No matter how powerful Boss Jin is, he is still a female,

543
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,079
although Fengchen has a yin and yang path around him,

544
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,559
After all, the foundation of youth is unstable,

545
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,079
who should run the AsiaInfo Club in the future?

546
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:00,039
I think Shangfeng knows it better than I do.

547
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:14,760
The 15th.

548
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,719
What's the date today?

549
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,119
On the 18th,

550
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,719
that means Ms. Jin has arrived in the North Zhou Dynasty.

551
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,679
Yes

552
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,960
Shangfeng said that the outbreak of pneumonic plague

553
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,000
was a small mistake made by the R & D of Yaxin

554
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,320
Pharmaceutical Factory,

555
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,360
Although it caused casualties in the Northern Zhou Dynasty,

556
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:33,880
Yersinia pestis has achieved satisfactory results.

557
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,440
He told us to speed up the collection of the secret treasure,

558
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,480
only when the treasure is opened can we make the best use of it.

559
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,320
to produce a variety of bacteria

560
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,280
that is 100 times more powerful than Yersinia pestis.

561
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,480
For this pneumonic plague,

562
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:04,599
Yaxin will be the culprit.

563
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:06,000
Am I right?

564
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,599
The loss of Yersinia pestis

565
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,519
was just an accident.

566
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,199
Yaxin Pharmaceuticals

567
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:14,199
is not a pharmaceutical factory that saves lives and saves lives.

568
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:16,199
It's a biochemical experiment base. Is Shangfeng

569
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,960
using the Zerg treasure?

570
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,719
Spread the plague, eliminate dissidents and realize your ambition.

571
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,320
But you never care about the lives of the people.

572
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,719
Regardless of the safety and danger of the people in the world

573
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,639
and the chaos in the world, if we don't fight, we will die.

574
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:35,440
The Zerg treasure,

575
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,760
fell into the hands of mediocre and incompetent people.

576
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,639
It doesn't work at all.

577
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,760
But in the hands of the AsiaInfo Association,

578
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,239
it can help us make great achievements.

579
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:51,960
How long are you going to hide all this from me?

580
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,360
Do I have an obligation to tell you?

581
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,639
Shi Miaomiao,

582
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,559
if we don't get the secret treasure tonight,

583
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,760
You know the consequences.

584
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:20,440
Lin,

585
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,480
keep an eye on her.

586
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,880
Once Miaomiao gets the secret treasure,

587
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,719
kill them immediately.

588
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:28,880
Yes.
