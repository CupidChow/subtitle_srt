1
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,519
Rumor has it that

2
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,280
the Zerg treasure began in the pre-Qin Dynasty

3
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,199
with gold and silver treasures

4
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,479
accumulated by the Zerg for thousands of years,

5
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,879
Countless.

6
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,759
They are extremely rich.

7
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,479
If you get it,

8
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:19,840
you can recruit people to change the dynasty.

9
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,479
People are killing each other for this.

10
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,439
A river of blood.

11
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,840
So at the end of Qin Dynasty,

12
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,759
the ancestors of the Zerg did so to avoid harming the living beings,

13
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:01,919
Divide the Zerg into six families,

14
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,280
Golden Wood, Water, Fire and Earth,

15
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,680
and the Sacrificial Family, the Xue Family,

16
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,919
The six clans are hiding in the city,

17
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,639
protecting the secrets of the Zerg treasure together.

18
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,800
Today,

19
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,960
the warlords have been divided and the people are living a poor life,

20
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,680
As a descendant of the Zerg Floral Branch,

21
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,879
I feel that I have a great responsibility.

22
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,639
Can I drown the Zerg treasure

23
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,719
in the darkness?

24
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,759
I can't.

25
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,400
Can I keep the Zerg alive?

26
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,199
No, I can't.

27
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,840
Can I put our citizens

28
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,240
in dire straits?

29
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,439
No, I can't.

30
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,319
No, I can't.

31
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,879
No, I can't.

32
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,439
So,

33
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,639
I, Pan Jun,

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,840
swear here today,

35
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,080
I will definitely find the treasure.

36
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,439
No matter how dangerous the road ahead is,

37
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,360
I will keep going.

38
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,800
you guys

39
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,599
Would you like to be my partner?

40
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,519
Do you know what this is?

41
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,399
This is called the Water Family Emblem.

42
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,279
What if you have it?

43
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,319
You will be my partners from now on.

44
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,439
After I find the treasure,

45
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,519
we'll split the shares equally.

46
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,399
One ocean and one ocean.

47
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,480
Limit 10 items.

48
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,319
Two,

49
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,399
I want three

50
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,519
wise ladies,

51
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,279
You'll be rich soon.

52
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,519
Cixi has to set porcelain with you

53
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,360
even if she's alive. Give me three.

54
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,000
Three, right?

55
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:47,720
Come on,

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,360
I want two

57
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,759
Uncle Pan to pay the bill.

58
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,680
I want three, too.

59
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:52,600
Young master,

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,759
what account do you want to keep?

61
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,279
Keep it.

62
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,279
You're selling the family emblem of the river

63
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,040
system again. You brat, just do it.

64
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,079
In my opinion,

65
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,439
the reputation of Cordyceps Hall.

66
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,439
I let you ruin it.

67
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,560
Take it.

68
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,560
Buy it and leave!

69
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,480
I have to beat you

70
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,680
today. Come on. Press you.

71
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,639
Who's afraid of you?

72
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,240
Open

73
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,959
Boss Jin wins

74
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,079
Boss Jin is so lucky today.

75
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,040
It's all mine.

76
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,639
Come on.

77
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,519
Yes.

78
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,879
Buy it and leave!

79
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,399
Here we go.

80
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,879
Boss Jin wins again.

81
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,439
Look carefully, everyone.

82
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,079
-Got it. -Come on, let's

83
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,759
go on, bro.

84
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,439
Yusheng,

85
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,879
how about I play with you?

86
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,160
Sorry,

87
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,839
I'm not interested.

88
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,959
You think if you wear a suit and a top hat,

89
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,959
you'll be a man.

90
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,560
Why did a woman's family

91
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,199
come to such a romantic place?

92
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,839
I didn't mean anything else.

93
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,879
I'm just afraid that you'll lose money,

94
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,199
so you can give me the money.

95
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,920
How about I let you win?

96
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,800
I never say it again.

97
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,240
Keep an eye on the bet.

98
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,480
Buy it and leave!

99
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:27,839
Open,

100
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,480
Mr. Huang won.

101
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
Qi Laoliu,

102
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,079
do you still have money?

103
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,399
Go away if you don't have money.

104
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,600
Don't worry.

105
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,639
Did you see that?

106
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,199
Water Family Emblem,

107
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,759
isn't it just a lead plate?

108
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,199
Not even a coin is worth it.

109
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,680
What do you know?

110
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:55,439
Don't underestimate this small lead plate,

111
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,879
it's the stock certificate of my treasure hunt.

112
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,040
When I find the Zerg's treasure,

113
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:02,560
I, Qi Laoliu, will be able to buy half of the Northern Zhou City,

114
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,000
There's no good news

115
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,199
in half of North Zhou City, Miss.

116
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,759
Why are you calling me?

117
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,800
Where did you get the lead plate?

118
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,639
Why are you

119
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,920
asking this?

120
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,759
Let me ask you where you got the lead plate

121
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,360
Woman Please spare me Woman Please spare me.

122
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,240
Doctor Pan from Cordyceps Hall.

123
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,519
Your Ladyship,

124
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,399
are you sure you don't want me to go in with you?

125
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,519
After all, he's a quack doctor.

126
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,920
He's just a villain in the market.

127
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,600
Today is the official visit,

128
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,519
see how bold you are?

129
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,360
Let him dare to fake the emblem of our Water System,

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,439
and ruin my reputation.

131
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,759
Sorry,

132
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,199
we're not going to see a doctor today.

133
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,879
I came all the way from the embassy district,

134
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,160
so you mean I failed to return?

135
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,440
This pretty lady

136
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,879
is so gorgeous.

137
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,600
You talk a lot.

138
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,399
What's wrong?

139
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,759
What are the symptoms?

140
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,360
Let me take a look at your tongue coating first.

141
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,440
It hurts.

142
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,279
To make a long story short.

143
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,200
I'm here to buy shares.

144
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,000
You should have told me earlier, right?

145
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,200
But,

146
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,639
can you change your posture?

147
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,720
Don't play tricks.

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,639
How dare I?

149
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,840
This is the water family emblem.

150
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,279
I heard that you still limited the purchase price.

151
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,320
That's for outsiders.

152
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,399
To you

153
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,919
Enough.

154
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,039
You're really a descendant of the Zerg.

155
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,639
If it's real,

156
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,240
let me ask you,

157
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,840
It's said that Zerg is extremely vulgar.

158
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,080
Unfathomable,

159
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,039
Well,

160
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,919
Do you know the secret art of Zerg?

161
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,480
My father said,

162
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
wait for me.

163
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,039
My father said,

164
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,279
if I improve my medical skills, he will teach me some secret skills.

165
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,320
It's just that I haven't improved my medical skills.

166
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,559
So he went overseas.

167
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,559
Goodbye.

168
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,159
Young master,

169
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,600
what are you looking at?

170
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,240
Do you have a crush on her?

171
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,480
In my opinion,

172
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,039
Sichun has gone too far,

173
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,120
What do I like?

174
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,480
Why do I think of spring? I

175
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:40,039
… You just think of spring too much,

176
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:41,480
Me,

177
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,399
If you think too much about spring,

178
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,559
you can't come to me.

179
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,000
Me,

180
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,399
Even if I look at Sister Hua, I won't.

181
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,879
I'm not looking for you either.

182
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,080
Young master,

183
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,639
what are your eyes?

184
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
I know. Isn't that a problem?

185
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,519
Retribution. Retribution.

186
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:35,960
Does it work if you put these needles on your face?

187
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,919
Anyway, if this set of needles goes down,

188
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:38,759
no matter what,

189
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,120
I don't think he blinks anymore.

190
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,440
Logically speaking, the symptoms around my eyes,

191
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,679
should all be caused by wind and heat,

192
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:46,679
But I don't have the chance

193
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,639
to get infected with this disease recently.

194
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,399
Maybe

195
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,720
it has something to do with that lady.

196
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,080
She is the wife of Director Matsui

197
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,600
of the AsiaInfo Club,

198
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,879
That Toyo Medicine King.

199
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,639
She's here to inquire about her peers.

200
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,960
Mother.

201
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,080
Mother,

202
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,840
For thousands of years, the Five Clans have been linked with each other,

203
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,279
why did you kill Yu'er?

204
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,960
Mother.

205
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,320
Mrs. Matsui,

206
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,360
sorry to have kept you waiting.

207
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,039
Any news from the Zerg now?

208
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,120
Other Zerg families,

209
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,159
after receiving the secret letter from our water system,

210
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,240
Feng Wanchun, who has been drawn

211
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,879
to the Northern Zhou Dynasty,

212
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,320
is already in our hands.

213
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,919
His disciple's name is Ziwu,

214
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,000
and he disappeared on the way to the Northern Zhou Dynasty.

215
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,279
We are looking for him everywhere.

216
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,519
In addition, regarding the wood system,

217
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,639
we haven't found any clues yet,

218
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,240
Is it possible that the quack doctor?

219
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,759
He's really a descendant of the Floragrims.

220
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,120
How is that possible?

221
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,039
Kiki has been practicing medicine for generations,

222
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,519
but he doesn't even look like a doctor.

223
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,519
Last night at the casino, I heard that

224
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,360
I saw two suspicious-looking people,

225
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,080
Seeing that the costume is from Ba Song,

226
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,440
it can't be ruled out that it has something to do with fire.

227
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,080
Who is it?

228
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:56,840
What's going on?

229
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,080
Young man, are you okay?

230
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,759
Young master. Young master.

231
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,759
Young master has traces of being caught by animals.

232
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,600
Which beast?

233
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,320
Howling Heavenly Dog or you?

234
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,240
Is it funny?

235
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,120
If it's not funny, just fetch water.

236
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,679
What are you looking at? You know how to look?

237
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,240
The wound

238
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,639
must have been scratched by a wolf or a dog.

239
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,679
I'm afraid he's not a thief.

240
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,039
Young Master Jiangyang Thief

241
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,559
Even if he is a Jiangyang thief,

242
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:57,039
First of all, he's a human being.

243
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,320
If he's a thief in Jiangyang,

244
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,480
He must have a lot of money, right?

245
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,039
If he is really a thief,

246
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,279
we should

247
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:08,480
go to the police station to report the case first.

248
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,480
Hold on.

249
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,159
Prepare

250
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,519
Shengji Powder Ointment,

251
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,879
Shengji Powder

252
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:16,120
Ointment. -Yes, yes. -Go.

253
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,720
Here comes the money.

254
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,600
Why are there so many pinholes here?

255
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:32,240
What's wrong with you?

256
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,039
Western medicine wouldn't have put so much

257
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,799
Shengji Powder ointment on it,

258
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,159
Young master, come here.

259
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,480
Ointment.

260
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:52,120
Young master's heart is kindness,

261
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,799
which should be known by Old Master,

262
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,960
He will be very pleased.

263
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Of course I'm kind-hearted.

264
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,720
You're done.

265
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,200
Within three days,

266
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,559
he'll wake up

267
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,039
and bring me his baggage.

268
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,880
I don't have any baggage.

269
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,079
He was like this when he came.

270
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,079
Nothing.

271
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,240
Just like this,

272
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,799
just come in naked,

273
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:20,400
That's right.

274
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:27,279
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

275
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,480
I gave him

276
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,960
the precious Shengji Powder ointment,

277
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,680
I'm still putting it on.

278
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,200
Young master,

279
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,559
the ancients said it well,

280
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,720
Saving a life is better than building a seven-floor pagoda.

281
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,079
What is a pagoda?

282
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,759
Can Futu be used as money?

283
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:48,079
Can Futu let me find the treasure?

284
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,039
Scum!

285
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,680
Young master, young master,

286
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,960
young master,

287
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,200
Hurry up.

288
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,160
-Emergency treatment. -Hurry up and make a visit. Who

289
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,400
is it?

290
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,079
It's Xiaoqian from Chunxiang Restaurant,

291
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,799
who's holding the family emblem you sold?

292
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,119
It's your partner. What sin

293
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,839
did I commit to deserve this?

294
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,440
Hurry up.

295
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,599
Xiaoqian said it might be

296
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,079
an infectious disease.

297
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,599
Dr. Pan, you're finally here.

298
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:34,640
Someone is sick.

299
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:36,759
Where is he?

300
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:37,680
He's upstairs.

301
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:43,400
Which room upstairs?

302
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,160
Take me upstairs.

303
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:50,440
Thank you.

304
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,240
Stop messing around.

305
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:06,880
Fifteen years ago,

306
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,119
all the recruits of the Wan Army got pneumonic plague,

307
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,640
They are all 17-or 18-year-old children.

308
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,039
No one can live for seven days.

309
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,160
You mean 15 years ago,

310
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,880
the pneumonic plague that spread from the Middle East railway

311
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,920
to Manchuria?

312
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:30,559
Xiaojiu,

313
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,720
Xiaojiu,

314
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,079
Wake up!

315
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:37,000
Wake up! Wake up!

316
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,160
My bracelet is still on it.

317
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:46,880
My entire fortune and life are upstairs.

318
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,759
You can't go up there.

319
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,200
You can't go up there.

320
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,839
Get out of the way!

321
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,279
Don't move.

322
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,160
Listen to me, Pan Jun,

323
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,519
if it's really pneumonic plague,

324
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:58,319
This is a severe infectious disease,

325
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,079
a severe infectious disease,

326
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,279
Everyone, run

327
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:03,960
and take your medicine.

328
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,359
At least take the medicine before you leave.

329
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,680
Take the medicine before you leave.

330
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,160
Wait, wait, wait.

331
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:13,000
Sister,

332
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,279
Sister.

333
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,559
Sister,

334
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:21,519
what's going on?

335
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,039
What's going on?

336
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,759
Mom said it was pneumonic plague,

337
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,960
but she hasn't seen Yan Ying for a day,

338
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,039
Why do you say you're sick?

339
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,640
Miss Yan Yun, this way.

340
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:39,960
Yan Ying

341
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,640
Miss Yan Yun. Miss Yan Yun,

342
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,160
it's dangerous. You can't go in.

343
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:43,799
It's dangerous.

344
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:44,640
Yan Ying

345
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,720
Miss, you can't enter here.

346
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,400
Miss,

347
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
it's really dangerous here.

348
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,000
Get out of the way.

349
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,599
I can't let you go.

350
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,400
Get out of the way!

351
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,400
Calm down, girl.

352
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,839
I know.

353
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,720
I know it's dangerous inside.

354
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,960
But my own brother is inside.

355
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,880
I just want to go up and see him.

356
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,039
Shall I take care of it for you?

357
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,359
I'm a doctor.

358
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,960
Our ancestors have been practicing medicine for generations,

359
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,319
Miss, think about it,

360
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,079
You can't help him if you go up there now.

361
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:10,799
It's possible that you might also be infected

362
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,880
with pneumonic plague,

363
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,519
It's really a life-threatening disease.

364
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,400
Fifteen years ago,

365
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,400
just four months ago,

366
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,960
They took the lives of 60thousand people outside the Pass.

367
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,799
As long as one person is sick,

368
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,079
it will be transmitted to a group of people.

369
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,240
One person's life is the life of a group of people.

370
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:48,519
Go to Beizhou Hospital to see Dr. Smith,

371
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,640
and tell Pan Jun to ask him to come,

372
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,400
Okay,

373
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,440
Can you help me too?

374
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,039
Sure

375
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:56,880
Go to Cordyceps Hall to find Sister Hua,

376
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,039
and ask her to bring herbs for epidemic prevention and disinfection.

377
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,160
She'll understand.

378
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,359
Stop watching.

379
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:22,079
Let's go.

380
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,440
Heart veins are blocked.

381
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,240
Slight stab and blunt,

382
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,480
clear away heat and toxic materials,

383
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,599
Open your mind, Su Jue.

384
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,680
Then stab the inner pass.

385
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,200
It calms the mind, calms qi

386
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,400
and relieves pain.

387
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,039
Moxibustion at Feishu

388
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:59,160
can regulate lung qi,

389
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,279
Tonifying deficiency and clearing heat.

390
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Father,

391
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,480
This is the prescription you prescribed to cure plague.

392
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:17,079
This is my first time

393
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
to bless me.

394
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,519
Don't smash my signature.

395
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,839
But after all,

396
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,160
I think they might have pneumonic plague.

397
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,759
Did you do anything to him?

398
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,279
I gave them bloodletting needles,

399
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,839
Zhongchong acupoint and Neiguan acupoint,

400
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,039
And Fei Yu

401
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,920
also took lung-protecting pills,

402
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,039
Bleeding?

403
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,599
What kind of treatment is this?

404
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,039
Before our doctor comes,

405
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,759
you can't just deal with it like this.

406
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,799
What do you mean?

407
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:59,119
You look down on Pan's medical skills, don't you?

408
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,079
Your medicine is about bugs and plants.

409
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:03,759
What's wrong with bugs?

410
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:05,559
Bugs can still save people, right?

411
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,359
What about this one? You're here

412
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:11,240
without waiting for treatment.

413
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,160
Luckily,

414
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
I said Smith,

415
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,119
I invited you here.

416
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:19,160
It wasn't me. Pan Jun

417
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,920
admitted that your medical skills are better than mine,

418
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,920
It's because there's no medical condition here.

419
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,799
Your hospital has a professional quarantine area.

420
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,440
When our ancestors

421
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,160
started to heal the wounded and rescue the dying,

422
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,119
You didn't even reclaim the land.

423
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,200
Well,

424
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,880
I won't talk nonsense with you, okay?

425
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,279
You don't understand what I'm saying.

426
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,720
Hurry up, everyone.

427
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,599
Young master, do you think it's okay to disinfect it like this?

428
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,839
Dr. Pan,

429
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,279
how is my brother?

430
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,480
Where are the two people up there?

431
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:52,400
I've already given medicine to one of them.

432
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,599
The other one is being treated by Dr. Smith.

433
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:58,079
There should be no problem.

434
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:00,960
Thank you.

435
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,279
Why are you saying thank you so much?

436
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,079
Just give it to me.

437
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:07,039
As long as you can cure my brother,

438
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,599
I will give you a hundred acres of fertile land,

439
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:11,480
You're from the Ouyang family of Ba Song,

440
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:13,599
Yes.

441
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,839
Then you must be rich.

442
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,279
A hundred acres of fertile land,

443
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:22,480
never break your promise.

444
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,240
Okay,

445
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:24,559
By the way,

446
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:26,720
this is the prescription,

447
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,039
Give it to your brother three times a day.

448
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,759
Quick test. Quick.

449
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:01,200
It's horrible.

450
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,440
This is even scarier than pneumonic plague.

451
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,640
It can't be called a severe infectious disease.

452
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,839
It's more like a synthetic pathogen.

453
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:10,519
Dr. Smith,

454
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,720
is my brother okay?

455
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,920
It can be cured, right?

456
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,200
Well,

457
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,559
don't worry too much.

458
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,200
I gave your brother the medicine

459
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,680
my father used to treat pneumonic plague 15 years ago,

460
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:25,279
So if it's an initial infection,

461
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
there should be no problem.

462
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:30,759
You two have been in contact with patients for a long time,

463
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,640
so you must isolate them as quickly as possible.

464
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,240
I have to keep an eye on my brother,

465
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
even if it's isolated,

466
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,359
You have to lock me up with Yan Ying.

467
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:39,680
Here's the thing.

468
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:42,680
Before we came into contact with the patient,

469
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:44,359
we had already taken anti-epidemic measures,

470
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,200
And wherever he touched it,

471
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,160
we also disinfected it with herbs.

472
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:52,920
A wild doctor who treats diseases with insects,

473
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:55,279
and disinfects them with herbs.

474
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,880
He even came to Beizhou Hospital

475
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,559
to teach us how to treat the disease.

476
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,759
What doctor from Cordyceps Hall?

477
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:04,640
I got carried away when I heard those beggars

478
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,759
and pawns bragging about it.

479
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,720
Physician,

480
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,799
15 years ago, when my father was curing the sick and saving lives,

481
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,200
Where are you?

482
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,680
Where are you?

483
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,559
Do you know how many lives he saved?

484
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,480
Our Pan family has been practicing medicine for generations.

485
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:25,279
Don't think that only your medicine can save people,

486
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,279
there are still patients in Cordyceps Hall,

487
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,160
I'll get going.

488
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:35,920
Where's Dr. Pan? When will Dr. Pan be back?

489
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,119
Don't be chaotic. Don't be anxious.

490
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,759
My young master will be back soon.

491
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,759
When will Dr. Pan come back?

492
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:45,759
I'm still waiting for a follow-up visit.

493
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:46,640
He went to fill the medicine.

494
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,079
I'll be back soon.

495
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,240
Look, Young Master is back.

496
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,680
Doctor Pan,

497
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,480
Young Master is back.

498
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,920
Don't worry, everyone.

499
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,480
I know, I know.

500
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,799
We're all here for a follow-up visit.

501
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,880
As you've heard,

502
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,000
a new plague has been discovered in our city.

503
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,680
I hope you can give me some time.

504
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,400
I'll prepare the medicine.

505
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,839
If there's nothing serious between you two,

506
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:05,240
Just wait in the side hall.

507
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,799
Go back and inform the neighbors,

508
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:07,720
can you come to our Cordyceps Hall

509
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,480
at about six o'clock to get the medicine?

510
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,279
Okay.

511
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:11,119
I'm going to fill the medicine.

512
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:11,559
Come on.

513
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:12,359
Thank you, Dr. Pan.

514
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,640
Follow me,

515
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:14,440
this way.

516
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,240
Follow me.

517
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,640
Okay.

518
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:29,759
Uncle Pan,

519
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,000
give it to me! Give it to me!

520
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,160
Give it to me!

521
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,279
This is the bug medicine you prescribed.

522
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,000
Insect medicine,

523
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,400
I know

524
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,599
those foreigners don't believe you I believe you,

525
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,279
You saved my brother.

526
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,039
I'm willing to help you save people.

527
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,079
That's more like it.

528
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,640
Are you okay to sneak out of the hospital?

529
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,440
What do you mean by sneaking out?

530
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,519
Me

531
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,000
The blood test says there's nothing wrong with me.

532
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,880
I came out fair and square.

533
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,799
Aren't you afraid that the hospital won't be clean?

534
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:03,839
How about

535
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,119
this? You should keep a pair of medicines,

536
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:05,960
Don't give them all away.

537
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,119
Save one for yourself.

538
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:08,920
Don't worry.

539
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,039
I'm busy,

540
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,880
I didn't get a hundred acres of fertile land

541
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,759
but I built in a lot of it myself.

542
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,359
It's not that I won't give you money.

543
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,559
I spent all the money along the way.

544
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,160
As soon as my Second Prince arrives in Northern Zhou,

545
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,240
I'll give you the money.

546
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:27,039
This horse is nice.

547
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,880
How dare you?

548
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,200
That horse is worth more than you. Don't even think about it.

549
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,680
The horse is worth more than me.

550
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,720
Young master,

551
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:34,759
my young master was just joking with you,

552
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:36,880
Miss,

553
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,400
you misunderstood.

554
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,119
There is an old saying in my ancestors.

555
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,880
In case of plague, the medicine is free,

556
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,920
and the doctor is also a free clinic.

557
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,240
Do you hear me?

558
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,559
If you ask me for money,

559
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:53,359
you will forget your ancestors,

560
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,759
If I ask you for money,

561
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,519
will you be okay if you don't give it to me?

562
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,000
If you cure my brother,

563
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:05,160
I'll double the money for you.

564
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,279
Don't forget,

565
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:07,960
my name is Ouyang Yanyun,

566
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,079
My Ba Song Ouyang family never reneges on their words.

567
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,680
I know. I've told you so many times.

568
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,839
Are you saying that you're from

569
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,000
the Ouyang family of Ba Song?

570
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,759
Why did you come to the Northern Zhou Dynasty?

571
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,680
Uncle Pan,

572
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,519
you haven't packed your stuff yet, have you?

573
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:29,119
Go clean it up.

574
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:29,880
Okay.

575
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,400
Alright,

576
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,000
your brother's medicine,

577
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,839
Five pills for each pair twice a day.

578
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,039
I've already fed them for the first time.

579
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,079
Remember to feed me the second time.

580
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,400
Why are you still standing here?

581
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,799
What?

582
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:47,039
Chat with me for a while.

583
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,559
Let's go.

584
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,519
Don't think

585
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,440
I don't know what you're thinking.

586
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,359
You're thinking,

587
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,559
Ouyang Yanyun belongs to

588
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,119
the Ouyang Huo family of Ba Song.

589
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,799
You knew it.

590
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,759
Do you really think I'm a fool?

591
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:22,839
Let me put it this way,

592
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,319
where is Ouyang Yanyun?

593
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,480
Or you don't know

594
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,799
the relationship between Cordyceps Hall and our Floral Department,

595
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,799
or

596
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,480
You're just playing dumb like me.

597
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,920
But to be honest,

598
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,920
we haven't contacted each other for a long time.

599
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:39,839
It makes sense to

600
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,799
hide it from each other.

601
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,960
But Young Master,

602
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,119
the Ouyang family

603
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,039
has a strong background and strong financial resources,

604
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:51,039
It's the only Zerg family

605
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,079
that still has luck,

606
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,480
Why did she suddenly come to Northern Zhou?

607
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:57,680
Yes.

608
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,960
Why did you come to the Northern Zhou Dynasty?

609
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,839
Did you find out that I was selling the Water Family Emblem?

610
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:21,079
Gale,

611
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:22,880
Gale.

612
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,160
Second grandpa.

613
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,039
Gale,

614
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,240
Second Grandpa,

615
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:39,680
Second grandpa.

616
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,680
Second grandpa.

617
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,559
What are you doing in Northern Zhou?

618
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,400
Does your grandpa know?

619
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,079
Grandpa doesn't know.

620
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,119
We heard,

621
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:25,359
You sneaked out with you because the secret letter from the river system

622
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,319
was coming to Northern Zhou.

623
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:29,000
But we were afraid that you would find out,

624
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,680
so we took the path,

625
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:32,839
You got to the northern Zhou Dynasty

626
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,759
before you did. Nonsense,

627
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,880
What are you two up to?

628
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,319
Second grandpa,

629
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:41,279
since the water system is summoned by secret letter,

630
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:43,880
The Zerg Five Clans will definitely gather in the Northern Zhou Dynasty,

631
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:46,480
and the treasure will be opened in three months.

632
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,359
All forces are eager to move.

633
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:50,200
More importantly,

634
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:52,119
my father once said,

635
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:53,880
The day when the treasure is opened,

636
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,960
it will be the time when our parents return.

637
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
You two

638
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,279
are overreaching.

639
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,839
The Northern Zhou Dynasty is not as good as Ba Song.

640
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:07,039
If something really happens,

641
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:07,960
what should we do?

642
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,480
Something has happened.

643
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,320
On the day we first arrived

644
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:16,320
in the Northern Zhou Dynasty,

645
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,239
we met three suspicious people on the street,

646
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,440
All the disasters are caused by them.

647
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:22,800
Sir,

648
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,000
three bowls of Zhajiang Noodles,

649
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,199
-Okay. -Sit down. I lost Second

650
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,320
Grandpa.

651
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,400
Go back to Ba Song by yourself.

652
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,719
Don't ever think about North Zhou City again.

653
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:41,800
Sis,

654
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,360
If Second Grandpa is in Northern Zhou City,

655
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,199
he can really find the Zerg.

656
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,639
Eat your noodles first.

657
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,559
You must be careful when you talk outside.

658
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:50,960
Let me ask you,

659
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,079
the whole river system has been gone for more than 20 years,

660
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:55,559
Why did you suddenly send me a secret letter?

661
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,119
Summon all departments to come to North Zhou City,

662
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,800
the whole thing is complicated.

663
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,360
Maybe it has something to do with the treasure.

664
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,480
Do you remember what I said?

665
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:05,880
Treasure appeared in the world.

666
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,599
My parents will come back soon.

667
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,079
At that time, the little brother in the middle was injured,

668
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,119
as if he was being held hostage by them,

669
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,039
After being noticed by me,

670
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,679
they obviously had a guilty conscience

671
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:24,320
and were eager to leave the boss to pay the bill.

672
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,480
Okay.

673
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,039
Let's go.

674
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,280
-Take care, guys. -The accent of

675
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:31,840
that guy sounds like a Toyo.

676
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,800
Yanying, go check it out.

677
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,599
Don't worry, sister.

678
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:35,519
Saving people is more important.

679
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,079
I'll wait for you at Donglai Inn.

680
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,119
Okay,

681
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:39,039
After leaving Xiaojiu,

682
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Yanying Xiaojiu never came back.

683
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:43,920
When I got the news,

684
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,559
they were already infected with the plague.

685
00:35:58,719 --> 00:35:59,519
Young master,

686
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,679
something's wrong.

687
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:02,199
With your medical skills,

688
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:03,760
he should have woken up a long time ago.

689
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:24,000
I know what's wrong with him.

690
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:27,039
Pneumonic plague.

691
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,079
Pneumonic plague.

692
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:04,960
Please come in.

693
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,760
What can I do for you?

694
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,639
Elder Ouyang Leihuo of Fire Department,

695
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,800
has entered the city with the secret letter of the river system.

696
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,000
We've been keeping an eye on him.

697
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:18,960
Ouyang Lei

698
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,119
lived a good life after the Battle of Huobamen Mountain.

699
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,800
How is Pan's itinerant doctor?

700
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,039
Strangely enough,

701
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,159
your poisonous insect

702
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,639
doesn't seem to have much effect on him.

703
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:36,960
His eyes are just out of control.

704
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,880
It's just that my eyes are out of control.

705
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,800
Could it be that gangster has detoxified you?

706
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,840
It seems that Pan has some ways,

707
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,519
don't touch him yet.

708
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:48,800
Wherever he goes,

709
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,519
keep an eye on him.

710
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,400
Yes.

711
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,480
Steamed buns,

712
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,320
delicious meat buns.

713
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,679
Steamed buns with freshly baked meat.

714
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,639
Hunian, are you okay?

715
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,559
Boss.

716
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,360
Master,

717
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:29,119
Master,

718
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,079
Master,

719
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:31,079
master, what's wrong with you?

720
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,320
Master.

721
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:37,800
Take the anti-epidemic medicine from the Department of Health,

722
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,039
to prevent pneumonic plague,

723
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:40,320
Please go home and take the anti-epidemic medicine.

724
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,119
Take the anti-epidemic medicine

725
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:43,360
from the Department of Health. Please take

726
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,320
the anti-epidemic medicine home and take it.

727
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:45,880
Thank you.

728
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,320
The anti-epidemic medicine from the Department of Health. Take it

729
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:50,000
and drink it when you go home.

730
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,599
Prevention is very important.

731
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:51,679
I really don't need it.

732
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,800
Just take it.

733
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,360
I, Pan Jun,

734
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,360
Doctor Pan,

735
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:58,599
Nice to meet you.

736
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,760
My last name is Zhang.

737
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,159
I've been listening to your name for a long time.

738
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,880
Recently, plague is spreading in the city,

739
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:05,960
I hope

740
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,320
you can cooperate with our health department,

741
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,079
Are you okay?

742
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,519
Hurry up.

743
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,760
Stop looking! Spread out!

744
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,559
Are you really Dr. Pan?

745
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,400
Do I have to lie to you?

746
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:33,480
What are you waiting for? Wipe the ground turtle

747
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,800
to make the first black white

748
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,960
and steam a hundred purple river carts?

749
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,639
All of them are made into fine powder.

750
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:53,280
With the thick soup made from Radix Rehmannii

751
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,440
and Herba Euphorbiae,

752
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,920
One dose a day, twice a day.

753
00:39:59,199 --> 00:39:59,960
Remember,

754
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,880
take this prescription,

755
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,119
Go to the Baofu Hall

756
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,360
next to you. If you have money,

757
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,599
You can go to Yaxin Pharmaceutical.

758
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,320
The materials he uses are better.

759
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:07,840
We can also go to Cordyceps Hall.

760
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,199
Thank you.

761
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,079
Stop!

762
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,760
Help!

763
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:14,800
Help!

764
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,639
Help! Help!

765
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:19,480
Help!

766
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,679
Don't run over there!

767
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,400
What are you doing?

768
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,920
As long as you have high fever, cough and rash,

769
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,119
arrest them and send them to Beizhou Hospital for isolation.

770
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,960
Fang Rude,

771
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:32,920
they all have urticaria.

772
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,960
Why did you catch them?

773
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,480
I'm on an epidemic prevention mission.

774
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,639
It's not your turn to talk.

775
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,440
Their bodies are already weak,

776
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,559
what if you catch them and get infected with pneumonic plague?

777
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:45,599
You will only make the epidemic worse.

778
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,400
They live in low and dirty shack areas,

779
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,840
and the whole family will die if one person gets sick.

780
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:52,559
Rather than that,

781
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,880
it's better to die

782
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,119
in the quarantine area of Beizhou Hospital.

783
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,760
It saves a lot of trouble.

784
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,559
You are ignoring human life.

785
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

786
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,639
You look down on us like this.

787
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,000
Our lives are not fate.

788
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:11,079
Dr. Pan,

789
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,719
if I remember correctly,

790
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,280
It seems that you just

791
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,079
came into contact with a patient with pneumonic plague.

792
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:18,320
Somebody.

793
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,679
Arrest him.

794
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,159
Take them to the quarantine zone.

795
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:22,320
Let's go

796
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,079
Pneumonic plague kills people regardless of rank and rank,

797
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:26,599
let go of me! I'm not going!

798
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:27,840
Let go of me!
