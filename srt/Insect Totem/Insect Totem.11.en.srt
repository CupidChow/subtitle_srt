1
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,680
Mr. Jin,

2
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,120
as far as physical examination is concerned,

3
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,560
Everything is normal.

4
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,080
But he is very weak,

5
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,000
so he should be in detention for a long time.

6
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,439
It has something to do

7
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,719
with being tested in humans.

8
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,319
We still have a long way to go to Ling City.

9
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,360
Take him down first.

10
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,199
Yes.

11
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:39,719
Take him away.

12
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,479
Boss,

13
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,039
before we leave,

14
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,199
Dr. Fengchen contacted me specifically,

15
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,240
saying that for the opening of the Zerg treasure,

16
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,960
He hired four insect experts from overseas,

17
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,639
so we can wait for good news.

18
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,680
For the pneumonic plague in the Northern Zhou Dynasty,

19
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,639
Fengchen Jun should take full responsibility.

20
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,080
Although

21
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,680
The research on germs failed this time.

22
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,080
But he came up with pneumonic plague by accident.

23
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,319
Actually,

24
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,400
this is also a very good start

25
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,199
for the future of AsiaInfo Club.

26
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,759
After all, we Yaxin Club will be able to

27
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,759
deal with this illness in the future,

28
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,280
Do some in-depth research.

29
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,439
Then, after extracting some diseases,

30
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,800
Yaxin Club started with cosmeceuticals,

31
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,439
Everything we do is for profit.

32
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,159
Remember,

33
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,039
we don't cultivate germs for Toyotomi Jun,

34
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,039
I'm not a pawn of Yin and Yang,

35
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,439
Yes.

36
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,680
I understand.

37
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,960
Did you inform Shangfeng

38
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,319
about Matsui's death?

39
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,719
Yes But unfortunately

40
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,879
his young master resigned recently,

41
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,199
He also had a serious illness,

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,120
and his condition is not particularly good.

43
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,479
When you're old,

44
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,039
you should go home and have a good rest.

45
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,000
You guys are big businessmen,

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,600
can't you find a better carriage?

47
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,120
It's only a third-class carriage.

48
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,839
Can't we find a private room?

49
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,240
You should pay for it.

50
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,360
I … I didn't pay for it.

51
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,199
Isn't it all my money to eat and drink

52
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,519
on the way here?

53
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,879
Some people are really good.

54
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,920
I'm not afraid of the cold at all.

55
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,160
I'm afraid my heart is colder than the sky.

56
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,720
Probably?

57
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,839
I'll change seats with you.

58
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,279
I'm sitting by the window. I'm not afraid of the cold.

59
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,240
He's changing places with you.

60
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,439
Warm your hands, sister.

61
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,160
Thank you.

62
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,160
Thank you.

63
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,160
You're welcome.

64
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,079
I've grown up,

65
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,519
Is it your first time to go on a trip?

66
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,399
Is it your first time to take the train?

67
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,879
I've been in oxcarts and carriages before,

68
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:46,240
but it's really my first time on a train.

69
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,879
How do you feel?

70
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,319
It's interesting.

71
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,759
It's just that there are too many people,

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,839
and it's a little cold.

73
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,319
Is it still cold?

74
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,600
It doesn't matter.

75
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,480
Grandpa said,

76
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,600
be content with what you have.

77
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,360
Are you really not cold?

78
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,399
It's not cold.

79
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:44,680
What are you doing?

80
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,879
Look at that guy over there.

81
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,120
Who is he?

82
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,160
That person is very strange.

83
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,360
Which one?

84
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,079
The one in the hat.

85
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:35,519
Let's go.

86
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,360
It's too cold here.

87
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,040
Ziwu and He Luoshi,

88
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,600
how could they be sent to a place like this?

89
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,800
Do you have to shout like that?

90
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,240
I can't wait for others to hear me.

91
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,000
Let's go.

92
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,639
It's too cold here.

93
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,240
Let's find something to eat later.

94
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,079
As long as I'm with you,

95
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,279
I'm not afraid no matter how cold it is.

96
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,839
Yaxin Lab's lair is in Lingcheng,

97
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,680
and Ziwu is the key experimental object

98
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,839
of Toyo Toyotomi Lab,

99
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,839
According to Kobayashi,

100
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,360
it's only a matter of time before he's taken to Ling City.

101
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,919
We need to be vigilant

102
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,639
at all times. Let's go.

103
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,639
Let's go.

104
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,240
That's right.

105
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,360
What is it?

106
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,639
They are all children of rich families.

107
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,720
We can't go to those ordinary restaurants.

108
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,039
You have to come to this fancy restaurant,

109
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,720
but you don't know how to use a knife or fork.

110
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,240
Steamed buns and steamed buns are not delicious or something?

111
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,919
I'm not the child of a rich family.

112
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,919
Thanks to your parents,

113
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,039
after many years,

114
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,000
When people don't look like ghosts and ghosts,

115
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,279
you,

116
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,000
Why didn't you tell me

117
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,639
about your days as Matsui's wife?

118
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,720
Isn't it delicious and delicious to serve?

119
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,399
Pretty sister is not easy to mess with,

120
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,679
do you have to talk too much?

121
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,639
All right,

122
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:51,799
don't stare. Staring isn't pretty anymore.

123
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,000
Don't move.

124
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,039
Sister, Zhenlong

125
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,080
… Zhenlong, don't

126
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,200
move.

127
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,759
Wait.

128
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,120
Go after him!

129
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,639
Sir,

130
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,919
don't get me wrong. Here,

131
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,480
here,

132
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,200
Hurry up!

133
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,720
Excuse me.

134
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:35,759
This way.

135
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,440
Where is it?

136
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,279
Excuse me.

137
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,840
Sister, sister,

138
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,480
Zhenlong ran in.

139
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,840
Wait here.

140
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,080
Let's go inside and check.

141
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,840
Here's your luggage.

142
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Now that you're here,

143
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,279
let's stay here.

144
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,200
Stay here.

145
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,080
No,

146
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,919
we don't have that much money.

147
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,000
Hello. Hello.

148
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,360
Hello. Is anyone there?

149
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,039
Hello,

150
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:45,960
who are you?

151
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,000
We...

152
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,559
Do you know who's in there?

153
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,559
I can't disturb you easily.

154
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,360
What's wrong? We're guests here, too.

155
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,840
What can I do for you?

156
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
Our

157
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,320
little animal ran in.

158
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:02,720
Little animal.

159
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,320
It's okay. You may leave now.

160
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
It's Mr. Jin.

161
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,799
Please come in.

162
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,879
Please have a seat.

163
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,440
What would you like to drink?

164
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,919
No need to bother you. Thank you.

165
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,919
I'll make my own decision then.

166
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,840
Come on,

167
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,039
Thank you.

168
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,879
Thank you.

169
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,360
This is fresh nectar from Langshui.

170
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I didn't expect that I can also drink tea from my hometown here.

171
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,240
Sister.

172
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,080
Aren't you here to look for animals?

173
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,200
What are you looking for?

174
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,600
How many times have I told you?

175
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,639
Don't take out your grasshopper.

176
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,600
But he didn't listen.

177
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,519
My brother is naughty

178
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,559
and keeps

179
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,799
grasshoppers. There are grasshoppers in the cold winter months.

180
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:27,639
Yes,

181
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,720
our Ba Song,

182
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,200
People in our hometown

183
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,240
are very good at dealing with animals,

184
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,159
Are you from Ba Song?

185
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,960
What are you doing in Ling City?

186
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,360
Our family is in business,

187
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,000
so we're here to talk about business.

188
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,279
When I was your age,

189
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,840
the first time I came to Ba Song,

190
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,320
Everything I look at feels fresh to me.

191
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,200
Aren't you looking for a grasshopper?

192
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,840
Let's take a look around.

193
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,120
Thank you.

194
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,240
Excuse me,

195
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,759
is it convenient to open the cabinet?

196
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:23,960
Of course.

197
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,559
Madam, we've found it.

198
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,480
It ran out again.

199
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,159
Thank you, madam. The tea

200
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,639
is delicious. Nice to meet you.

201
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:01,519
Sorry to bother you.

202
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,279
Thank you.

203
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,240
Panasonic,

204
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,840
come out.

205
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,600
Take him to Fengchen Jun's lab.

206
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,919
Understood.

207
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,120
Let's go.

208
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:31,840
Let's go

209
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,240
Did you Zerg follow me

210
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,559
to Lingcheng in the north?

211
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,919
You think too much.

212
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
Who are you?

213
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,159
That woman just now,

214
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,799
wearing an ink jade bracelet,

215
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,879
It must be from the Zerg River System,

216
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,519
why do you know the Zerg so well?

217
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,240
It's said that the water system has been wiped out by the whole clan.

218
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:07,519
I can't believe there are descendants,

219
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,639
piccolo at waist is a descendant of Fire Department.

220
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,320
In that case,

221
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,480
the descendants of Pan Yingxuan

222
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,360
are indispensable to the Gold Department, aren't they?

223
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,240
You know my father?

224
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,159
More than that.

225
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,320
He doesn't respect the gods,

226
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,879
which is the scourge of the Zerg.

227
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,639
Don't insult my father.

228
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,639
For the last time,

229
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,240
after all these years,

230
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,559
What exactly do the five Zerg families

231
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,720
want to do in Lingcheng?

232
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,559
You must be a senior of the Zerg.

233
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,879
There must be some misunderstanding between us.

234
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,120
You don't want to either?

235
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,720
The joke of our Zerg is seen by others, right?

236
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,640
One word of advice,

237
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,960
don't be greedy.

238
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,559
Don't end up on the altar

239
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,240
with blood splattering like your parents did,

240
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:15,799
There are no bones left.

241
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,440
Anyway, if Zhenlong is here,

242
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,079
Ziwu must be here too.

243
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,000
But I have to say,

244
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,920
that auntie just now was really weird.

245
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,640
I think she's quite familiar with it.

246
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,799
I have something even weirder to do here.

247
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:45,640
What is it?

248
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,680
I was in the hallway just now,

249
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,200
and I bumped into that person.

250
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,400
What kind of person?

251
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:52,680
The one you showed me

252
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,039
on the train,

253
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:58,559
Who on earth is he?

254
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,839
Could it be someone from Yin and Yang?

255
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,400
There's only one possibility,

256
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,039
Priest Xue,

257
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,960
Yes.

258
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,640
Don't you forget,

259
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,400
the Xue family is a big family in charge of sacrifice,

260
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,000
Although they are different from the Five Clans,

261
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
they belong to the Zerg.

262
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,039
Then why are you so nervous?

263
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,240
What else did he tell you?

264
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,720
He said,

265
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,920
he said don't let us be like our parents,

266
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,880
So greedy.

267
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,680
Be careful

268
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,599
There are no bones left at the Death Altar.

269
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,920
We can't do this.

270
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,279
You're just sitting there waiting for death.

271
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,759
We have to split up

272
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,559
and follow Xue's Group all the way,

273
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:46,680
The woman who followed Yan Yun and Yan Ying all the way,

274
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,960
the woman he suspected,

275
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,400
Otherwise, whether it's Ziwu or He Luoshi,

276
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,319
we might lose clues at any time.

277
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,599
How about this,

278
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,599
Yan Ying,

279
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,480
You and Yanyun,

280
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:57,920
or Xiao'e,

281
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:01,000
The three of you continue to be responsible for the Meridian Line,

282
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,200
regardless of spiders or aunts.

283
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:04,960
Find Ziwu.

284
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,160
Miaomiao and I will continue to be in charge of Xue's Group.

285
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,160
There is no reason to let you

286
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,240
get better, sister.

287
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,519
At a critical moment,

288
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,160
if we split up now,

289
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,960
We need to discuss the meeting again.

290
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,759
Am I right?

291
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,039
Sis, forget it.

292
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,519
Well,

293
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,799
if you have nothing else to do, go to bed early.

294
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,039
It's getting late.

295
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,039
What about you?

296
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,240
Me,

297
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,880
Me?

298
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,799
I need to tell you something

299
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,440
very, very important.

300
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,279
Me

301
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,319
I have no money in my pocket.

302
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,319
You really have no money?

303
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,400
I'll show you if you don't believe me.

304
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:06,440
Can we just squeeze into this room?

305
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,480
Can you sleep in this bed?

306
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,640
How about this,

307
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,759
you three girls sleep on the bed,

308
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,599
Sleep on the sofa zone.

309
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,640
I'll just take a nap outside the door.

310
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,240
Priest of the Xue family.

311
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,200
Chief Priest, you're back.

312
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,000
Chief Priest,

313
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:50,640
Chief Priest,

314
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,079
Thank you for going south this time.

315
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,759
Did you get anything along the way?

316
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,119
Please

317
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:59,200
This time, I visited all the famous hospitals in the north,

318
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,920
but they were concerned about Young Master's illness,

319
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,880
Unheard of.

320
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,559
Besides, when I heard that

321
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,559
Xue family is far away in the mountains,

322
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,880
No matter how much money you give me,

323
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:09,359
you won't come to see me face-to-face.

324
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:12,240
The Thousand Worm Sacrifice is coming soon.

325
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,119
Young Master is seriously ill.

326
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,000
What should we do?

327
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,359
By the way, Old Priest,

328
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:23,279
there's one more thing you can't hide from me.

329
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,319
This time, I met the descendants of five Zerg families

330
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,920
at the station.

331
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:31,799
Mu Xi, Pan Yingxuan's son was among them.

332
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,759
I have to guard against it.

333
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,720
This way.

334
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,519
Let's go.

335
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:04,200
Let's eat. What are you waiting for?

336
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,519
Mr. Jin,

337
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,000
about last night,

338
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,480
Sorry to bother you.

339
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:10,680
Here's to you.

340
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,319
It's an apology.

341
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,680
Mr. Jin,

342
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,119
a toast to you, too.

343
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,880
Thank you for your hospitality last night.

344
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:23,319
Please let us treat you to this meal today.

345
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,440
Here's to you, too.

346
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,920
Sit down. Sit down.

347
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,079
When you come to my place,

348
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,440
of course it's my treat.

349
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:33,079
How can I let you spend money?

350
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,480
Cheers!

351
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,799
I … I'll go to the convenience store.

352
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:53,640
Urge the dishes by the way.

353
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,480
Have some food.

354
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:06,559
May I ask about

355
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,880
the meal fee of the expensive Hechun box,

356
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,519
How much ocean do you want?

357
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,240
Guihechun is a private room specially

358
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,680
used by Boss Jin for receiving guests.

359
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,720
Never take money,

360
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,000
never take money,

361
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,839
It seems that you are not from Lingcheng.

362
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,359
As we locals know,

363
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,400
this restaurant,

364
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,200
It's Boss Jin's own business.

365
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,559
What does Boss Jin do?

366
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,880
You're so imposing.

367
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,119
Boss Jin

368
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:32,720
is a real new female philanthropist.

369
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,559
The pharmaceutical factory she runs,

370
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,079
claims to be the best in the Far East,

371
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,119
She has a semicolon all over the country.

372
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,359
To tell you the truth,

373
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:40,920
I'm also a pharmaceutical worker,

374
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,559
What's the name

375
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:44,960
of Mr. Jin's factory?

376
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,640
I can visit Yaxin Pharmaceutical Factory

377
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,119
some other day. You must have heard of it.

378
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,640
Of course.

379
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
-The noodles are

380
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,039
ready. -Okay.

381
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,119
If you don't mind,

382
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,799
I'll give you all my meat.

383
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,279
Just eat first and give me the leftovers.

384
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,960
Of course I don't dislike you.

385
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:43,839
We shouldn't share

386
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,279
weal and woe and sleep together now,

387
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:48,000
Do you want to tie the knot?

388
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,480
Do you know how you will die in the future?

389
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,039
It depends on how you want me to die.

390
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,279
You're so glib,

391
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,160
and you die of nonsense,

392
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,640
Before I become a ghost,

393
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,319
I still have two wishes,

394
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:05,519
First of all,

395
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,960
I have to put Ziwu's two-headed,

396
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,599
Bring them all back.

397
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:10,960
Second,

398
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,640
I need to find He Luoshi,

399
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:15,039
I want you to get rid of the burden in your heart,

400
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:18,839
and live a happy life in the future.

401
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,920
Miss Xiao'e,

402
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
you've been waiting for this dish for a long time.

403
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,960
It's as big as a palace outside,

404
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,079
and I got lost as soon as I went out.

405
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,279
It took me a long time to get it back. It's no wonder

406
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,160
it's my first time here.

407
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,279
Boss Jin,

408
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,480
this is the first time I've seen you,

409
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,640
I think,

410
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,519
you are very close,

411
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,799
I'll do it.

412
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,240
If a girl goes out drinking is harmful to her health,

413
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,680
stop drinking.

414
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:58,559
Who are you?

415
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,640
You're the first one to tell me that

416
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,119
drinking will hurt your health.

417
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:08,720
My parents never told me that.

418
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,000
Sister, stop it. You're drunk.

419
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,160
I'm sorry, Mr. Jin.

420
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:19,680
It's okay.

421
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,640
You're just kids.

422
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:24,880
Did you hear that?

423
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,920
Today,

424
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,039
I have to say

425
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:32,119
what I want to say.

426
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,480
I'm leaving.

427
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,880
Yan Yun,

428
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,680
you're drunk. Let's go.

429
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,200
-Let me see you off. -Hi, sister. I'm

430
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,480
really sorry.

431
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,799
Mr. Jin, sorry

432
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,680
for being rude. Mr. Jin,

433
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:49,559
Let's go.

434
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,799
Be careful.

435
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,480
Xiao'e, open the door.

436
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,359
Okay,

437
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:05,279
Come on,

438
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:08,920
Help her lift the quilt

439
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:14,960
and hold it.

440
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,799
My sister usually drinks a lot.

441
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,680
Why are you so drunk today?

442
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,200
Maybe you're tired

443
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:30,359
from a long journey, right?

444
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,559
Boss Jin

445
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,160
works for Yaxin,

446
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,160
Yaxin.

447
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,279
Yaxin,

448
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,400
in that case,

449
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,440
Boss Jin is likely to be the investor

450
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,359
behind AsiaInfo Club and Yin Yang Road,

451
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,680
If she gets close to us, she has ulterior motives.

452
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,759
We might as well play along.

453
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,720
Find a way to follow her closely.

454
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,319
Close to AsiaInfo Pharmaceuticals,

455
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,440
like this,

456
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,960
It might help us find Ziwu.

457
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,640
Yes.

458
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,720
That's not

459
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,240
how you draw your eyebrows.

460
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:55,440
Don't move.

461
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,039
Do you like to cry so much?

462
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:14,680
Go down and cry.

463
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:15,960
No.

464
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,440
I don't want it.

465
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:19,720
I don't want to die. I don't want to die. Please.

466
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,839
I don't want to die. I don't want to die.

467
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,000
Come here.

468
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:47,119
None of you girls

469
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,160
looks like my mother.

470
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,880
Why none of you girls

471
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,519
looks like my mother

472
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,960
Who will be responsible for the spread of the plague in the Northern Zhou Dynasty?

473
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,519
There's no problem with the purification of germs.

474
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,759
There's something wrong with the injection measurement.

475
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
That's impossible.

476
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,880
The measurement of our injection is absolutely accurate.

477
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,599
Unless the subject has a rejection reaction,

478
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,880
before the injection of the pathogen,

479
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,519
I'll make sure he's fine.

480
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,920
Who will be responsible for the spread of plague in the Northern Zhou Dynasty?

481
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,519
You,

482
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,480
Or no one

483
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,920
is in charge of you?

484
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:57,960
You can do it then.

485
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,240
I'm sorry,

486
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,519
I'm sorry.

487
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,759
Before you get stung,

488
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:16,720
you have to find a way to open the treasure.

489
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,519
If you can't open the treasure,

490
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,200
I'll open your heads.

491
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,480
We got it.

492
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,160
I'm sorry.

493
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,880
Mr. Matsui's body has been sent back to Japan.

494
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,119
The investigation found that

495
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,160
he was shot with an 11. 43 mm

496
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,440
Browning pistol bullet.

497
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,759
Do you still have the one I gave you?

498
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:08,920
Get rid of it.

499
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,200
There were so many rumors in the meeting

500
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,559
because of the successor,

501
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,039
Don't let Mr. Matsui's legacy

502
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:17,480
harm you.

503
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,680
Doctor,

504
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,200
beast! Let us out!

505
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,480
Doctor,

506
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,640
how's the product development going?

507
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,200
This time we learned the lesson

508
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,680
of the Northern Zhou pneumonic plague,

509
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,039
The poison he was injected with,

510
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,319
was specially treated.

511
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,319
It's safe.

512
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,200
As he ingests different toxins,

513
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,720
he produces different antibodies.

514
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,599
In time,

515
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:08,719
we will be able to crack

516
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,800
the secret of the poison trap,

517
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,760
Besides,

518
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,039
we'll also get better bacterial products

519
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,920
than Yersinia pestis.

520
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,840
Fengchen Jun,

521
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,920
there are many traps in the Zerg treasure,

522
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,159
Without my Five Series Secret Treasure,

523
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:24,079
if you want to get in,

524
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,760
Dream on!

525
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,519
I just like to have unrealistic dreams.

526
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,480
What's wrong?

527
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,880
Where are the rest of the Zerg people?

528
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,239
Pan Jun and his party have arrived in Ling City.

529
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,639
Of course,

530
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,199
I came with them,

531
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,920
And Pan Jun, the secret treasure of the five departments,

532
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,280
is here.

533
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:47,679
It seems that the Zerg are still

534
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,360
so obsessed with the treasure,

535
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:52,159
Mr. Kim said,

536
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:53,559
Mr. Fengchen,

537
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,960
Just focus on your research.

538
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,320
Just leave such a trivial matter

539
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:58,079
as finding someone to her.

540
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:00,760
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

541
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,320
Fengchen Jun,

542
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:07,519
I'm warning you,

543
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:09,800
If you want to kill me, don't touch Pan Jun.

544
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,599
You'd better worry about yourself first.

545
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,320
Your friends

546
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:17,000
are having a drink with Mr. Kim right now,

547
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:18,880
However,

548
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,599
they are now Mr. Kim's guests,

549
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,920
It's also the fish on her chopping board.

550
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,199
Don't go! Come back!

551
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,280
Come back.

552
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:49,639
As for what? It's so hard.

553
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,559
Who are you?

554
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,400
Who are you going

555
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,199
to pay me back? You'll know in a minute.

556
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:03,199
Who are you?

557
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,679
Yukiya Matsushige on the Yin-Yang Road.

558
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,639
Since you're from Ba Song,

559
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:15,719
you can't adapt to the climate of Ling City,

560
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,360
You're wearing too thin clothes.

561
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,159
I've prepared some clothes for you.

562
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,920
And this rouge powder,

563
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,519
these are all made by Yaxin.

564
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:23,639
Take it back and try it.

565
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,519
Thank you.

566
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:29,000
You really put too much effort into it.

567
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:32,159
Sorry,

568
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,880
I haven't woken up yet.

569
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,880
I've told the people below,

570
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,679
and asked them to make you sober soup.

571
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:39,840
By the way,

572
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,760
I specially made this dress for you.

573
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,119
This color suits you very well.

574
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:47,519
Try it on.

575
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,039
Come on,

576
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:54,800
Your Ladyship, I'm really sorry

577
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,679
for drinking too much yesterday. It's so rude.

578
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,400
You're just kids.

579
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:06,400
Your Ladyship, why do you sound like that?

580
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,960
You've known us for a long time.

581
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:12,360
I just think it's fate to like you,

582
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:17,000
are you the boss of Yaxin Pharmaceutical?

583
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,199
It doesn't count.

584
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,400
I'm only responsible for part of the business.

585
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:22,119
I'm in charge of

586
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,480
these cosmetics. It's too modest.

587
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:25,480
If you have time tomorrow,

588
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:28,239
can you show the three of us around?

589
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,559
Yeah,

590
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,079
we're new here,

591
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,320
I'm not familiar with everything here,

592
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,199
thanks to your care.

593
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,320
I can't thank you enough.

594
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,760
It's not

595
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,400
a big deal. You want to visit?

596
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:43,960
I'll take you there.

597
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,199
Feel free to take whatever you like.

598
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,039
Her Ladyship gave us so many gifts.

599
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:51,760
We don't know what to give back.

600
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:54,760
We're back.

601
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,000
Let me introduce him to you.

602
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,400
These two are my friends.

603
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:00,760
Madam,

604
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,960
I told you before,

605
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,599
The grasshopper who ran into the room,

606
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,119
since you have friends coming,

607
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,920
I won't bother you anymore. Goodbye.

608
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,480
Take care.

609
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:22,239
Hurry up.

610
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,599
Over there! Hurry up!

611
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,639
Let's go.

612
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,119
Doctor,

613
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,360
I brought Jin Shun,

614
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,599
Got it.

615
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:54,440
Who are you?

616
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,840
Watchiro Toyotomi

617
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,280
I know.

618
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,679
Young Master of Tao of Yin and Yang,

619
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,760
A medical weirdo of AsiaInfo Club,

620
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,559
You know a lot.

621
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:15,000
But,

622
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:16,599
I'm an expert.

623
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,559
Medical experts,

624
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,440
experts who study bacteria.

625
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,800
I, Jin Shun, don't have much skill,

626
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
so I can only ask about news and old news.

627
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:39,440
Tell me.

628
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,440
What do you want from me?

629
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,320
Two things,

630
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,519
One

631
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:48,440
Gold Secret Treasure,

632
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,000
Two,

633
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,360
Ha Luoshi,
