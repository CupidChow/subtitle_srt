1
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,599
Yan Yun Yan Ying,

2
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,840
I never expect your forgiveness.

3
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,800
Because from beginning to end, I knew that

4
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:52,439
I was not a qualified father.

5
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,919
This is another goodbye without saying goodbye.

6
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,479
Hopefully,

7
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,599
this is the last time.

8
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,520
From now on,

9
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,080
you don't have to look forward to my return.

10
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,560
I don't want you

11
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,000
to hear from me anymore,

12
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,960
Your father, Ouyang Yanlei,

13
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,479
is so cowardly.

14
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,960
Life is full of blessings and misfortunes.

15
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,719
I can't change it.

16
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,800
But I can't accept that

17
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,800
your mother Mei'er

18
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,599
has left me again.

19
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
About the treasure,

20
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,919
about the Zerg,

21
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,599
As for the love and hate in the past years,

22
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,280
I don't want to have anything to do with it.

23
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,400
In this world,

24
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,719
nothing is necessary.

25
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,879
No one

26
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,120
is irreplaceable.

27
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,919
Even if I know this truth,

28
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,800
I'm still confused.

29
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,919
I hope my child,

30
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,759
Yan Yun and Yan Ying,

31
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,360
You can let go of

32
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,240
the struggle and entanglement between fame and fortune and ideals,

33
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,120
If I'm lucky enough

34
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,080
to find someone I really love in my life,

35
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,439
Let's spend the rest of our lives together.

36
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,199
When I pass by the temple,

37
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,759
I'll pray for you.

38
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,240
When I walk through the church,

39
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll help you confess.

40
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,920
Life is so hard and hard.

41
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,720
When you feel lonely and sad in the future,

42
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,360
don't doubt that

43
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,040
somewhere in the world,

44
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,720
There are also people

45
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,600
who still miss you deeply.

46
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,720
But in this life,

47
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,240
that's all I can do.

48
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,439
I hope I won't be a human anymore in the next life.

49
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,000
I can turn it into rain,

50
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,759
into sunshine,

51
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,319
Turn into a big tree,

52
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,519
and when you don't expect it,

53
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:07,839
Secretly moisten or light up your

54
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,360
next life,

55
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,639
Love or not,

56
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,680
there's no need to see you again.

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,199
My children,

58
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,040
I only hope you can live a safe life.

59
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,360
I heard that the Zerg Herbal Master has made great achievements in refining,

60
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,759
and the dynasty is overjoyed.

61
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,040
I just hoped that

62
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:55,600
you would go to Mount Ba Men on the day of the sting,

63
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,439
I also have 3thousand's elite soldiers to help me,

64
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,600
and you and I will explore the natural danger again,

65
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,279
We will surely win the battle and find the treasure.

66
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,519
To protect the peace of one side,

67
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,959
this letter is a challenge.

68
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,759
What are you afraid of?

69
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,120
Well,

70
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,600
I don't need to look for him.

71
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,480
You really don't know.

72
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,279
No matter how strong the Fire Department soldiers are,

73
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,839
the Wan Family Army is a regular army after all.

74
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,759
In terms of firearms and military strength,

75
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,439
it's far higher than the Fire Branch.

76
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,079
If we face each other head-on,

77
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,879
we'll really hit the stone with an egg.

78
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,480
Three thousand elite soldiers,

79
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,240
they just want to kill them all.

80
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,439
now

81
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,480
The world is in chaos and warlords are divided,

82
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,600
all forces

83
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:46,079
are recruiting troops to store up food and supplies,

84
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,560
The ten thousand dynasty tribe (... Zerg treasure has been around for a long time, now is a good

85
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,600
time.

86
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,439
How could he let it go?

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,279
It's good to threaten you,

88
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,519
or to restrain you from entering the treasure,

89
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,160
This Wanchao Sect,

90
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,399
we must fight against one of them.

91
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,040
Then let's stick to the previous plan,

92
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,279
Yanyun Xiao'e,

93
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,240
You prepare the clan soldiers,

94
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,759
Father,

95
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,319
If you restrain the Wan Army in the city tomorrow,

96
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,279
then Pan Jun and I

97
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,720
will enter the forest treasure of Bamen Mountain together,

98
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,319
Our secret treasure of Fire Branch,

99
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,399
and Ziwu's secret key of destiny,

100
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,560
I'll leave it to you.

101
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,439
And in the collection of heavenly artifacts of our gold department,

102
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,920
there are all kinds of secret treasures accompanying us along the way.

103
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:33,000
I believe Brother Pan and Miaomiao

104
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,920
will come back safely.

105
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,839
You'll be safe, too.

106
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,199
Here,

107
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,959
I wish you a successful victory.

108
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,680
After all, my brother and I

109
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,199
are going to fight each other.

110
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,680
The Fire Department soldiers are ready,

111
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,680
and some local people in Ba Song

112
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
also volunteered to participate.

113
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,439
There are more than 300 people in total.

114
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,759
There is another new force.

115
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,199
Uncle Yingxuan,

116
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,319
I'm worried about you.

117
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,240
He is afraid that you will be too resentful and lose your mind.

118
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,120
So what if you lose your mind?

119
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,439
Is there anything more important

120
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,800
than revenge for Ziwu?

121
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,839
But if we really lose both sides,

122
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,519
causing Ba Song's life to be ruined,

123
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,639
It's not our original intention.

124
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,159
Because of our original intention,

125
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,840
Ziwu died,

126
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,799
Yan Ying has changed.

127
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,879
Boss Kim is gone,

128
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,879
too. If you really want to say the original intention,

129
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,399
The original intention of the Zerg is hatred,

130
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,759
because of the treasure,

131
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,200
It has created hatred for us.

132
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,639
Don't worry.

133
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:17,960
One day,

134
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,000
I'll help you erect this flag again.

135
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,480
This flag belongs to my grandfather.

136
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,159
It's not mine.

137
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,480
The old man should be very pleased

138
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,200
to hear that.

139
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,600
In tomorrow's battle,

140
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,320
you'll be in the Southwest.

141
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,200
From then on,

142
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,840
the leader of Ba Song,

143
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,919
I, the commander of the Seventh Division of the Wanjia Army,

144
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:15,799
Cry

145
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,840
Ouyang Yanying.

146
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,879
Yan Ying,

147
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,360
all these years,

148
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,440
I feel sorry for you.

149
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,200
Grandpa,

150
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,840
although I hate that iron is not made into steel,

151
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:02,639
But I was too harsh on you in the past,

152
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,720
and you held a grudge,

153
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,919
I understand.

154
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,600
Even if you want to kill me now,

155
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,919
I won't stop you.

156
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,960
Yan Ying doesn't understand.

157
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,799
Dragon scales and soft gold armor,

158
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,279
are also treasures handed down by our ancestors.

159
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,080
Blades, swords, bullets,

160
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,759
all impenetrable,

161
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,039
At the wedding banquet tomorrow,

162
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,120
I'll wear it close to my body

163
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,759
and you'll take the chance to shoot me,

164
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,240
Grandpa,

165
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,759
I want Ouyang Xi

166
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:51,440
to announce my death to the world.

167
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,080
You take

168
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,480
the Tiger Tally that commands all the soldiers of the Fire Department,

169
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,279
Pretending to join the Wanchao Sect,

170
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,879
Grandpa, this is too risky.

171
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,000
Could it be

172
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:20,559
You don't want to avenge your mother?

173
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,919
The Wanchao Sect is sophisticated and shrewd,

174
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,320
and all the people who tried to take his life,

175
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,720
All of them were killed by him.

176
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,440
Without risking our lives and putting all our eggs in one basket,

177
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,159
how can we gain his trust?

178
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,159
Only when you get Wan Lao'er's attention,

179
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,360
can you find a way to defeat the Wan Army completely.

180
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,080
Yan Ying,

181
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,200
remember,

182
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,200
Don't tell anyone about this plan.

183
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,840
Including Xiao'e,

184
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,679
including your sister,

185
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,279
If anyone gets out of the way,

186
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,879
we'll lose everything.

187
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,639
After the fall of the Qing court,

188
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,600
the Wanchao Sect worked hard to drill camps in troubled times,

189
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,279
Gradually developing into a warlord on the separatist side,

190
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,559
this Wanchao Sect is ruthless and ruthless,

191
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,039
He sponsored the AsiaInfo Club in Japan

192
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,080
and destroyed several hostile forces.

193
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,159
Kill them all and leave none of them.

194
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,200
You're so cruel.

195
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:43,960
Insane.

196
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,240
Wanchao Sect has been coveting the treasure for a long time,

197
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,759
in order to get it,

198
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,159
I'll do whatever it takes.

199
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,559
I'm worried about Jun'er,

200
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,320
If he forces him,

201
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,159
he won't even be able to get out of Mount Ba Men,

202
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,799
Uncle, don't worry.

203
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,320
I'll protect him.

204
00:15:59,159 --> 00:15:59,960
Miaomiao,

205
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,759
from Lei Yun's birthday banquet to the wedding battle,

206
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,440
You're all facing each other,

207
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,559
but you have to promise me this time.

208
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,840
We must use all the advantages flexibly,

209
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,399
and never face them head-on,

210
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,120
we

211
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,240
I'll meet you in Ba Song City.

212
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,480
Don't worry.

213
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,399
you guys

214
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,240
Is everything ready?

215
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,200
The Tiger Tally of Ouyang family,

216
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,679
has been stolen by Yan Ying.

217
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,759
Now, all the Fire Department soldiers,

218
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,360
can only be dispatched by me personally.

219
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,159
Yan Ying is holding the Tiger Tally now,

220
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:38,039
plus his identity as the young master of Ouyang Family,

221
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,399
It will definitely cause chaos among the clan soldiers.

222
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,200
also

223
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,840
A traitor to my Ouyang family.

224
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,639
I have to deal with it myself.

225
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,120
I want to ask him face to face why he is so cruel.

226
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,559
I have to ask him,

227
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,320
what is his conscience?

228
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,360
What about loyalty, filial piety and righteousness?

229
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:10,559
Tomorrow

230
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,839
We're going to fight with the Wan Army.

231
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,559
There's something

232
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,480
I have to tell you,

233
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,200
On the battlefield,

234
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,319
if you run into Young Master Yanying,

235
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,759
Please show mercy.

236
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,319
Gentleman,

237
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,720
Young Master Yanying is your brother after all,

238
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,039
I know what to do with Yanying.

239
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,400
Gentleman,

240
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,039
Young Master Yanying,

241
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,799
Not a traitor.

242
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,319
After Yan Ying

243
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,759
shot me at the wedding banquet,

244
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:50,720
to gain the trust of the Wan family.

245
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,119
We managed to sneak into the Wan Army,

246
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,759
working from inside to outside,

247
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:59,720
Only in this way can we completely defeat the Wan Army.

248
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:02,440
Master

249
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,119
You can't do that.

250
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,079
You are the head of Ouyang Family,

251
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,920
if anything happens to you,

252
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,799
Ba Song City is leaderless,

253
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,480
it will be in chaos

254
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,000
for 24 years.

255
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:18,640
I'm sorry for Xinmei and Yanlei.

256
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,160
I'm sorry. Yan Ying

257
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,200
owes too much. You have to pay it back.

258
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,559
moreover

259
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,200
Is there any egg in the overturned nest?

260
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,400
As long as the Wanchao Sect doesn't give up on the Zerg treasure,

261
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,319
with or without me,

262
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:35,920
Ba Song will be in chaos,

263
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,160
I've made up my mind.

264
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,119
No need to say more.

265
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,519
Even if you've made up your mind,

266
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,160
I don't think Young Master Yanying

267
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,920
will agree to shoot you.

268
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:52,640
Go get Dragon Scales, Soft Gold Armor and Tiger Tally.

269
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,279
I have my own way to convince him.

270
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,319
But unexpectedly,

271
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,079
Old Master didn't want to wear

272
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:06,559
Dragon Scale Soft Gold Armor from the beginning

273
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,359
Old Master said,

274
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,319
He wants to use his own life,

275
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,640
to atone for the sins of this life.

276
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,319
I've never thought about it.

277
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,079
Yan Ying pretended to take refuge in Yan Ying

278
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,359
and treated me so well.

279
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,640
I can't believe I don't know him so well.

280
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:50,920
Sister,

281
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,680
tell me

282
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,440
how much pain has been buried in his heart.

283
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:05,799
Now that I think about it,

284
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,799
when I saw him in the woods that day,

285
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,960
He could have caught us directly.

286
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,519
But he shot the soldiers of the Wanjia Army.

287
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,279
Let us go.

288
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,599
I looked him in the eye.

289
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:32,920
Why didn't I jump up and hug him?

290
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,880
For the sake of the overall situation,

291
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,559
Yan Ying was misunderstood

292
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:42,279
as a traitor to his own grandfather,

293
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,960
I don't know.

294
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,160
How was he feeling at that time?

295
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,240
He's in the Wan Family Army now,

296
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:54,920
and he's in danger.

297
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,640
I don't know what kind of disaster we'll face.

298
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,599
I really want to

299
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:08,039
see Yan Ying again.

300
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,279
We'll see each other on the battlefield tomorrow,

301
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,920
we must trust Yan Ying,

302
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,640
He will surely

303
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,519
subdue Wan Chaozong.

304
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,680
The time for us to kill the enemy

305
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,880
is coming to

306
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,640
the time for the enemy to be destroyed,

307
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,400
It's the time when your relatives come back.

308
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,079
We've been together for so long,

309
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,759
fighting together all the way,

310
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,119
It never stops.

311
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,359
But,

312
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,839
because of the engagement,

313
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,079
I've had a lot of fights

314
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,640
with both of you.

315
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,799
We'll meet again tomorrow.

316
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,880
When we get the treasure,

317
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,880
we'll wait for you to win.

318
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,680
The way you two are in sync with each other,

319
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
it's really irritating.

320
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:53,480
My father told me,

321
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,279
he said in his letter,

322
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,279
May I be lucky enough

323
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,960
to find someone I really love in my life,

324
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,279
In the past,

325
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,359
I wouldn't have understood the meaning of the letter.

326
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,000
But we've come all the way here,

327
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:08,160
to see you two being together now.

328
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,880
I really understand,

329
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,160
it's really hard to fall in love.

330
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:19,880
This is the token of love that

331
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:23,200
the bride and groom will exchange when we get married,

332
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,240
The handkerchief is embroidered with the legendary one-winged birds,

333
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,799
each with only one wing and one leg,

334
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,759
Only when they combine into one,

335
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:32,119
can they soar into the sky.

336
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,759
I hope this one-winged bird

337
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:35,759
can bless you.

338
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:37,880
May you be together forever.

339
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:45,640
Yan Yun.

340
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:53,480
I hope everything goes well

341
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,319
between you two tomorrow.

342
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:01,480
I'm leaving.

343
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,759
Father,

344
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,960
You won't go to the treasure with me tomorrow.

345
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,279
People all over the world thought that

346
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,680
I would take my son into the treasure.

347
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,240
They guessed wrong.

348
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:46,640
Tomorrow,

349
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,720
Ouyang and I will have a big battle,

350
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,200
I'll involve all his troops.

351
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,240
So that you

352
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,160
can enter the treasure smoothly.

353
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,880
I didn't expect that.

354
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,680
Remember,

355
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,839
getting in and out of the treasure requires someone to lead the way,

356
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,640
Pan Jun can't get hurt.

357
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,279
Others don't care.

358
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:12,559
Just get rid of it.

359
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,559
But father,

360
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,160
do I remember you always said

361
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,480
you wouldn't let me kill people indiscriminately?

362
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:19,680
If you want to achieve great things,

363
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,279
you must be decisive in killing them.

364
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,160
We can't hesitate

365
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,000
to enter the treasure this time,

366
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,359
If you find a lot of gold and silver,

367
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,440
don't touch it.

368
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,000
Remember your position back, forth, left and right.

369
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:34,599
Report to me when you come back.

370
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,599
We'll organize our men to carry them in.

371
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:38,759
I won't go then.

372
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:40,079
No, father,

373
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,400
you're not allowed to take gold and silver treasures.

374
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,119
Why would I take such a big risk to go in?

375
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,640
The greatest value of Zerg treasure,

376
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,160
is not the gold and silver itself,

377
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,079
But can

378
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,240
command the world,

379
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:15,119
Overlooking all the great powers,

380
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,480
for this matter,

381
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,599
I've been planning it for more than 20 years,

382
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:26,319
so we must be careful this time.

383
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,880
Don't fall short.

384
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,160
Yes.

385
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:40,920
Jun,

386
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,559
as a doctor,

387
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,000
As a gentleman of the Department of Wood,

388
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,079
I'm worthy of my heart.

389
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,400
I did my job,

390
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,680
but for you,

391
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,000
Me,

392
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,240
Me,

393
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,200
I'm not a good father.

394
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:13,599
Father,

395
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,440
You know what?

396
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,519
When I'm in North Zhou City,

397
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,440
I feel like I lost money.

398
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,440
Every day, I think about saving money,

399
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,799
and everyone calls me a liar,

400
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,599
But only Uncle Pan knows,

401
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,359
I'm looking for you.

402
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,319
Whether it's opening the Zerg treasure,

403
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,440
you'll come back.

404
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,240
If I ask all the way to find you,

405
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:42,960
I just want to find you.

406
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:45,240
I want to compete with you.

407
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:47,519
Which one of us is good at medical skills?

408
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,359
I also want to ask you,

409
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:52,079
is the one missing in my blue silk bag

410
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,720
the Zerg's secret treasure?

411
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:58,759
It's because I lost my father's love for so many years.

412
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:03,960
But later,

413
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:06,960
when I went from Northern Zhou

414
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,319
to Lingcheng,

415
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,519
All the way to the Xue family settlement

416
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:13,839
and then to Ba Song,

417
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:16,480
Everyone loves you so much.

418
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,720
I've all been blessed by you.

419
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
They all say,

420
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,680
your father is a first-class gentleman.

421
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,599
But why is he such a nice person?

422
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,319
He thinks he has the whole world in his heart,

423
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:39,079
but he will leave his own son behind.

424
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,200
But when I came all the way,

425
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,200
I walked through every road you walked.

426
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,160
I'm starting to understand.

427
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:02,079
I seem to be the second you.

428
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:08,519
So, father,

429
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:11,680
I understand you.

430
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,920
I won't blame you.

431
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,400
You've grown up,

432
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,759
and you've got a big heart.

433
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,559
You're a man now.

434
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:37,839
You and Miaomiao can rest assured tomorrow.

435
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,359
I'm in Ba Song City,

436
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,440
and I'm your backup.

437
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,559
Remember,

438
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,319
Pan Jun.

439
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,119
No matter what happens,

440
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,559
I'll wait for you to come home.

441
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,359
All right,

442
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,680
that's all for now.

443
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,680
We'll see each other again, won't we?

444
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
The battle is just around the corner.

445
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,160
Take care, everyone.

446
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,799
This kind of occasion is not suitable for me.

447
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:02,839
I'm leaving.

448
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,559
Ever since Ziwu left,

449
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,920
Zhenlong has been following me,

450
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:42,480
Zhenlong's attacking power is strong,

451
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,960
so it's good to carry it with you.

452
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:47,960
Ziwu also said that

453
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:50,359
although Zhenlong is fragile,

454
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,359
But the spider silk it spits out,

455
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:54,880
it can heal wounds.

456
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,720
Just like my Moyu Bracelet,

457
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,680
and your wood-tied green silk,

458
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,200
Sure enough,

459
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,920
anything that can kill people can also save people.

460
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,680
Is this the right way?

461
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,920
According to Tiangong Collection,

462
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,359
after entering the forest,

463
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,680
Go all the way south,

464
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:17,599
and you'll reach the barrier bridge.

465
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:22,119
Let's go.

466
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,839
Doctor Pan,

467
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:32,720
Miss Shi,

468
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,319
Hello,

469
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,640
Hu Shan is leading the Wan Army

470
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,759
to escort you into the forest.

471
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,279
Please.

472
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,079
Row one,

473
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,199
go to the front and have a look.

474
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,800
What are you waiting for?

475
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,599
Take someone to have a look.

476
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,679
Come in with a row,

477
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,679
come in,

478
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:00,039
Get in.

479
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,679
Hurry up.

480
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,599
Aren't you a herbalist?

481
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:06,519
You two go inside.

482
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,760
Stay close to me.

483
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:19,320
Run!

484
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,400
Another one died.

485
00:37:58,679 --> 00:37:59,760
I told you to follow me closely.

486
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,920
Wan Hushan,

487
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:08,599
so many people have died.

488
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,360
Do you still want the rest of them to fold here?

489
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:14,679
So many people have died anyway.

490
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,360
We can't let the dead down.

491
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:22,559
Pan Jun,

492
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,679
what I want,

493
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,280
You have to get it.

494
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,519
Let's go!

495
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,199
Let's go.

496
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,280
Go inside.

497
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:06,559
What's going on?

498
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,239
Don't move! Don't move!

499
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,239
Run!

500
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,559
Let's go!
