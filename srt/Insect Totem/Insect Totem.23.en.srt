1
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,719
Master,

2
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,599
the battalion from the battalion commander's mansion left the city in a mighty way.

3
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,040
This time, Ba Song City

4
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,599
is going to pick up a real evil star.

5
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,800
If someone leaves, someone will come.

6
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,280
If the fake battalion commander leaves the city,

7
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,039
the real battalion commander will enter the capital

8
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,240
to change the King's flag.

9
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,360
I'm tired of watching it.

10
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,759
Let him do as he pleases.

11
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,039
But,

12
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,639
outside Ba Song City,

13
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,360
More than one Wanjia Army has been stationed,

14
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,400
it's been 24 years.

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,599
Xinmei is finally back.

16
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,360
She wants to celebrate my birthday.

17
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,400
We still have to ask our

18
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,199
Zerg brothers who sleep in Bamen Mountain if they agree or not,

19
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,439
Those brothers who were detained in He's Mansion,

20
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,960
often cried to me

21
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,960
that they buried their bones in the barren hills

22
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,800
and cried that they were helpless.

23
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,039
But Master,

24
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,520
Xinmei,

25
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,280
His crime is unforgivable.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,080
I'm afraid,

27
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:10,159
Young Master Yan Ying and Miss Yan Yun,

28
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,159
I'm in a dilemma.

29
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,080
Those of us who are alive are suffering from a bloody disaster.

30
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,199
On the day of the birthday banquet

31
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,879
when he was killed from the bones,

32
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,800
I don't care how horrible the sword and shadow are,

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,680
but I'd rather the kids hate me and hate me,

34
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,560
We'll never see each other again.

35
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,560
I have to protect them, too.

36
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,479
It's peaceful

37
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,800
all the time. Don't worry, Master.

38
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,240
On the day of the birthday banquet,

39
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,960
Ouyang Mansion

40
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,840
must be impregnable.

41
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,800
Remember,

42
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,360
I don't want to see a drop of blood

43
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,960
on the kids.

44
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,520
Understood.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,879
First commander,

46
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:58,879
Yes

47
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,919
I'll do something with the battalion commander later.

48
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,639
Everyone here is keeping an eye

49
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,719
on one of them. Don't leave.

50
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,680
Yes.

51
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,439
Pan Jun.

52
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,360
Yan Ying,

53
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,199
look,

54
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,439
Who is this?

55
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Are you Yan Ying?

56
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,399
Do you still remember me?

57
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,560
Father,

58
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,639
You're finally back.

59
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,560
Our family is finally reunited.

60
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,759
All right, all right.

61
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,639
Stop it.

62
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,639
Battalion Commander,

63
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,199
we just arrived in Ba Song,

64
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,959
I don't know much about the power here.

65
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,439
If we fight against Ouyang Family rashly,

66
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,360
we may not be sure.

67
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,160
At the moment, Kim So-Mei is saving her energy,

68
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,680
seeking revenge on Ouyang Leiyun.

69
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,439
What Mr. Shuai means is,

70
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,160
why don't we unite with Jin Sumei

71
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,199
to fight against Ouyang's family?

72
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,759
Jin Sumei and the old man haven't settled their accounts yet,

73
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:57,839
Why would she help us?

74
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,279
This one

75
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,000
The coach has his own plans.

76
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,639
After you go there,

77
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,360
you just need to be

78
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
careful with your words and deeds.

79
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,439
What?

80
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,360
You don't want me to ruin your good deeds.

81
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,279
No.

82
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,920
If you want to see Kim So-Mei,

83
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,560
go and see her yourself. Don't drag me down and play dumb with you.

84
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,800
Doesn't that mean we're more sincere?

85
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,120
It's that old man's sincerity.

86
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,279
New product,

87
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,040
give it to me.

88
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,639
battalion commander

89
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,600
I'm going to see Kim So-mi soon.

90
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,600
Can we be a little more patient?

91
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,000
Hit him!

92
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,319
Are you courting death?

93
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,480
Guards,

94
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,319
Yes

95
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,720
Execute the battalion commander's order.

96
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,079
Execute the battalion commander's order,

97
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,879
Yes

98
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,360
What are you doing?

99
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,920
As for me,

100
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,920
I'm the real son of the commander-in-chief.

101
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,680
You're just a dog.

102
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,279
Battalion Commander is right.

103
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,399
I'm a dog of the Wan family.

104
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,240
Are you calm now?

105
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,159
Calm down. Let's go.

106
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,519
General Commander's orders

107
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,000
must be carried out.

108
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,720
By the way,

109
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,000
the coach asked me to tell you,

110
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,519
A man who draws his gun at every turn,

111
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,639
may not be able to control it well.

112
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
What's going on?

113
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,360
He's a lunatic in the woods.

114
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Behave yourself.

115
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,240
Hold it then. I'm a doctor.

116
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,200
Let me have a look.

117
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,360
Wait! Don't move!

118
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,399
Don't move.

119
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,200
He almost strangled me to death.

120
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,639
Be careful, both of you.

121
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,519
Yan Yun

122
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,879
Go get some tranquilizers from Uncle Yanlei.

123
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:38,879
Let's call him first.

124
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,159
Let's go.

125
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,039
In the past few days, you two have been singing along with each other,

126
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,559
and you are very happy.

127
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,399
Stop talking nonsense.

128
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,679
Get the tranquilizer.

129
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,559
We're waiting to save her.

130
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,720
I like

131
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,480
the awkward look.

132
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,039
I'm happy.

133
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,240
Mr. Jin, long time no see.

134
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,759
Please have a seat.

135
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,279
Mr. Jin, it's been a long journey.

136
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,919
Our coach specially asked me to deliver medicine to you.

137
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,799
At Ouyang Leiyun's birthday banquet tomorrow,

138
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,600
be careful.

139
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,799
Shangfeng is so thoughtful.

140
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,279
But as the saying goes,

141
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,519
medicine has three points of poison.

142
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,360
But there are still seven points left to cure the disease.

143
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,000
Our coach said,

144
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,879
can the AsiaInfo Club live without Fengchen Jun?

145
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,759
But I can't live without you, Mr. Jin,

146
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,559
right?

147
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,000
But I feel like along the way,

148
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,000
Battalion Commander Wan is trying to kill

149
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,440
all my men.

150
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,159
Mr. Jin, you're being too harsh.

151
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,679
It's just a small fight

152
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,919
between us young people.

153
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,960
Battalion Commander Wan has a big appetite,

154
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,039
and likes all the women in the world,

155
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,759
Not only do you have to take Luo Xiu,

156
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,279
but now,

157
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,480
You have a crush on Yanyun again. Hushan

158
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,960
is used to being vulgar,

159
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,879
Mr. Jin, please show your respect.

160
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,559
Please show your mercy.

161
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,159
Haihan,

162
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,600
let's come here today,

163
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,639
But he came with the sincerity of Wan Jiajun.

164
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:04,679
so

165
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,559
If you don't say anything, I'll take it as your acquiescence.

166
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:09,919
It's a deal.

167
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,879
No way.

168
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm not leaving.

169
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,639
What are you doing here?

170
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:15,879
Your mom.

171
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,480
-Boss Kim. -Okay, Boss

172
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,000
Kim and your grandpa,

173
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,919
Tomorrow is going to be a big battle.

174
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:25,879
So,

175
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,960
I want to stay and protect my grandpa.

176
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,000
Okay. Protect your grandpa.

177
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:32,720
What about you?

178
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:34,759
Who are you protecting?

179
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,120
Do you have any relatives in Ba Song?

180
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:36,919
I don't have any relatives.

181
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,279
I have to protect Yanyun.

182
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,200
Do you know Ouyang Family and Wan Family?

183
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,519
The Ouyang Family and Wan Jiajun outside,

184
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,159
tomorrow will be a big battle,

185
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:53,960
This is a fight between a dragon and a tiger.

186
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,639
This is Hegemony Ba Song.

187
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,080
It's even a major event in Southwest China.

188
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,320
In such a big battle,

189
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,320
we watched the fire from the other side,

190
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,240
Isn't it good to sit on the mountain and watch the tigers fight?

191
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,440
Besides,

192
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:04,440
Boss Jin is just a chess piece,

193
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,039
Not to mention an abandoned child.

194
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,440
How can we help her?

195
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,519
Yan Ying will definitely stay with Mr. Jin.

196
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:11,519
I'm not leaving.

197
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,240
I'm not leaving either.

198
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,399
You don't want to die anymore, do you?

199
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,519
You don't want to die, do you?

200
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,519
Miaomiao,

201
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,200
Ouyang Leiyun,

202
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,360
Not only is it done after saving people,

203
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,679
but I didn't pretend to be a battalion commander for nothing,

204
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,080
I saw it.

205
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,240
His ambition is not as simple as you think.

206
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,440
Pan Jun,

207
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,960
I forbid you to say that about my grandpa.

208
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,000
Shut up!

209
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,879
I'm saving your life, you know?

210
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,120
What about my grandfather's life?

211
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,559
What about the lives of people in Ba Song City?

212
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,399
I want to stand with my grandpa.

213
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,759
I want to protect Ouyang Mansion.

214
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,200
Protect Ba Song City.

215
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,080
Yan Yun,

216
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,840
Ziwu,

217
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:07,960
I'll go talk to her.

218
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,759
Don't be angry.

219
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,080
Tomorrow Ouyang Mansion is a dragon ’ s pool and

220
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,600
tiger ’ s den, our coach asked me to give

221
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,120
you two special guns.

222
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,120
It's for self-defense.

223
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,360
Look.

224
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,720
This Browning pistol is made in the United States.

225
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,799
I heard it was just designed.

226
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,440
My father specially asked someone

227
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,919
to bring the samples back from the United States,

228
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:41,759
Although it's small,

229
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:42,919
it's more powerful than a Japanese gun,

230
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,039
I haven't used this guy yet.

231
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,159
I'll give it to you first.

232
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,320
Guns are good guns,

233
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,799
but only two guns will be used to hit Ouyang Mansion,

234
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,440
It's just a drop in the bucket,

235
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,000
Mr. Jin.

236
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,320
As long as you fire these two shots in Ba Song City,

237
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:04,480
the Wan Family Army will take care of you.

238
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:07,679
Battalion Commander Wan,

239
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,080
back then,

240
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,399
I followed your father to Japan.

241
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,240
All these years,

242
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,200
thanks to his care.

243
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,639
It can be said that

244
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,639
your father is the person

245
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,120
I trust the most in this world,

246
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,720
But he told me,

247
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,159
he wouldn't let me trust anyone.

248
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,639
Then tell me,

249
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,240
can I trust you?

250
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,120
Boss Jin,

251
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,440
with the strength of Wan Jiajun,

252
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:35,080
Do you still need to be afraid of Ouyang Leiyun?

253
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,320
Ouyang Leiyun has been in Ba Song City for decades,

254
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,559
and he doesn't even care about

255
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,039
the lives of his son and daughter-in-law,

256
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,159
In tomorrow's battle,

257
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,919
I hope you, Wan Jiajun,

258
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,720
Don't sacrifice your life for nothing.

259
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,720
Also,

260
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,879
I can't have any worries.

261
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,159
Don't worry about that.

262
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,080
Before the birthday banquet tomorrow,

263
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,919
we will send Yan Yun and Yan Ying to Ba Song City.

264
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,919
I'll meet you.

265
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,879
to reunite your family.

266
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:07,720
Let Boss Jin have no worries.

267
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,039
By the way,

268
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,159
And Ouyang,

269
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,679
Ouyang's daughter-in-law,

270
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,240
Duan Xiao'e

271
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,639
will bring it to you.

272
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,120
Yes, yes, yes.

273
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,200
We brought it here for you.

274
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,120
But whether Yanyun is willing to come or not,

275
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,320
it's up to two questions.

276
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,799
If she doesn't want to come,

277
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
don't blame us.

278
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,960
Just give it to me.

279
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:30,279
I'll ask Luo Xiu to meet you at the city gate.

280
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,039
Battalion Commander Wan,

281
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,000
what about tomorrow's battle,

282
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,799
I'll rely on the help of Wan's Army.

283
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:41,679
No problem.

284
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,200
Mr. Jin, we are a family.

285
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:46,799
Why are you being so polite?

286
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:48,399
Come on,

287
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,639
Cheers!

288
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,159
I'll do it first as a toast.

289
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,839
Father,

290
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,079
I was just thinking

291
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,920
if Mother knew you were in Ba Song,

292
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:20,960
She will definitely come to you.

293
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,240
She might not

294
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:25,400
have gone to seek revenge on Grandpa.

295
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,400
I'm worried Wan Jiajun

296
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:31,119
won't let her see me easily.

297
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,920
Now the most important thing is

298
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,440
to let you tomorrow,

299
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,039
Avoid this war.

300
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,240
If I have to go,

301
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,960
I want to follow her.

302
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,440
Senior Yanlei,

303
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,640
Sit down

304
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,559
Senior Yanlei,

305
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,519
I didn't dare to ask you before,

306
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,440
I hope you can tell me the truth.

307
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,680
Back then, you and my father

308
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,480
were expelled from the Zerg.

309
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,400
But now you're the only one who's back.

310
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,839
What's wrong with him?

311
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,559
Eunuch.

312
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,480
There is a letter from you,

313
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,960
saying that Mr. Gao

314
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,720
will personally deliver the relief money next month.

315
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:40,880
Also,

316
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,200
he wants to solve all the mysteries of Mount Ba Men.

317
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:47,680
Who is Mr. Gao?

318
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,559
Did you hear that?

319
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,200
Next month,

320
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,960
I'll see your father.

321
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,680
Gao Huaiyuan.

322
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,680
Yanyun,

323
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,000
I've been wanting to talk to you alone.

324
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,359
I know what you're trying to say.

325
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:36,000
Since you were injured,

326
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,680
how did Pan Jun stay up all night to take care of you?

327
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,000
I can see it all.

328
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,160
Along the way,

329
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,279
who did he love, care for and take care of?

330
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,880
I'm not stupid. I know everything.

331
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,000
And even if you want to cancel it,

332
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,559
it has to be me, Ouyang Yanyun, who proposed it.

333
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:56,720
Not him, Pan Jun.

334
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
Don't you forget,

335
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,839
Engagement is also one of the Zerg traditions.

336
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,880
You're right.

337
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,759
The Ouyang Family of Fire Department

338
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:11,079
has always been in charge of Zerg affairs,

339
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,559
Engagement is also a rule.

340
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,160
My grandfather taught me since I was a child,

341
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,799
that rules should be the first priority in everything,

342
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,400
Focus on the overall situation.

343
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,400
So in front of the interests and rules of the Zerg,

344
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,759
no one can cross the border.

345
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,640
Including my mother,

346
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,119
including Pan Jun,

347
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,920
I understand

348
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:37,000
your reasons, too.

349
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,640
I won't say anything else.

350
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,240
It's just that tomorrow's war is dangerous,

351
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:44,359
and the Wan Family Army has been playing tricks behind it.

352
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:45,960
On one side is your mother,

353
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,640
on the other is your grandfather,

354
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,279
I hope you can figure it out on your own.

355
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,240
Rules are important,

356
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,160
but it's more important not to let yourself regret it.

357
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,359
Come in.

358
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,519
I heard that Uncle Yingxuan is coming back.

359
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,839
Congratulations.

360
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,400
Thank you.

361
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,839
If,

362
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,200
my father and your father insist to preside over the engagement.

363
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,039
Will you still be with Shi Miaomiao?

364
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,440
Yanyun,

365
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,759
although rules are rules,

366
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:47,599
Needless to say,

367
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,440
I know.

368
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,039
The war is coming.

369
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,480
Maybe we're going to part forever soon,

370
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,000
can't you coax me?

371
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:03,759
I'm sorry.

372
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,119
Don't say sorry.

373
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,079
Brother Pan,

374
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:27,680
thank you.

375
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:31,640
Thank you.

376
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,039
You always respect me so much,

377
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,000
Yan Yun,

378
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,319
I hope you can think about it carefully.

379
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,920
Tomorrow's battle concerns you.

380
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,240
The lives of Yan Ying,

381
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,960
Ziwu, Xiao'e, and all of them,

382
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,079
Even if we postpone the birthday party for one day,

383
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,359
avoiding its edge is better than doing it recklessly.

384
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:52,799
Our Ouyang family in Ba Song

385
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,039
has never known what it means to avoid the edge.

386
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,240
Because we are Sharp.

387
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:00,119
Yanyun,

388
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:00,960
stop it,

389
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,960
Go back now.

390
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,839
Shi Miaomiao is waiting for you.

391
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:08,640
I have something else to do.

392
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,079
I'll leave first.

393
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,400
What?

394
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,039
You agreed?

395
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,119
Just because I agree doesn't mean my grandpa agrees too.

396
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,119
You're going to propose marriage to Ouyang Mansion

397
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,240
in Ba Song.

398
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:34,720
Give me a car tomorrow.

399
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,039
I'm going to Ba Song to see Grandpa.

400
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,119
No problem.

401
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,359
I'll deliver it myself.

402
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:40,599
Battalion Commander.

403
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:44,799
Well,

404
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,599
tomorrow you go to Ba Song first,

405
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,359
I'll send a car to see you off.

406
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,279
It's a deal.

407
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,920
It's a deal.

408
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,599
Why are you crying?

409
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,759
It's like a cat barking.

410
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:12,799
Battalion Commander,

411
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,400
what should I do?

412
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,920
What should I do?

413
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,640
You can still follow me.

414
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,799
To sing with you,

415
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,680
I've been serving you for so many years,

416
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:24,359
You can't just throw me away.

417
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:24,799
Battalion Commander,

418
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,480
stop howling,

419
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,240
Battalion Commander,

420
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:29,240
can I be your concubine?

421
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,079
Battalion Commander,

422
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:31,359
I want to sing for you.

423
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:33,279
I just want to sing to you Battalion Commander,

424
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,440
get lost!

425
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,720
-Battalion Commander. -Battalion Commander, please, Battalion

426
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:38,160
Commander. Battalion Commander,

427
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:39,480
If I don't leave,

428
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,000
what's wrong? Can you still shoot me?

429
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,359
Battalion Commander.

430
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,119
Battalion Commander, you

431
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:07,000
Lieutenant Wan,

432
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:09,279
Can you be the battalion commander?

433
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,640
Shoot me if you dare.

434
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,000
I just want to marry Yan Yun What's wrong?

435
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,920
Heavenly King, I can't control me either.

436
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,880
Your boss is here.

437
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,160
It's none of his business.

438
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:46,480
I guess I'll have to bite the bullet tomorrow.

439
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:48,839
We can't just leave him in the lurch.

440
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,759
You have too many people to protect.

441
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,200
I'll be there for you.

442
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,039
Mother,

443
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,200
Yan Ying,

444
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,720
Mother,

445
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,440
I found my father.

446
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,200
Your father,

447
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:46,920
where is he?

448
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,039
He's with Wan Jiajun. Let's go find him

449
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,640
and get out of here together.

450
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,279
Why is he with Wan Jiajun?

451
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,799
Mr. Jin,

452
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,559
it's already the time.

453
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
People from Wan Family Army

454
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,759
haven't come to Ba Song City yet.

455
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,200
Wan Chaozong,

456
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,720
you're so cruel.

457
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,160
The reinforcements of the Wan Army won't come.

458
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:25,440
Wan Chaozong,

459
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,400
I'm afraid that I won't go to the appointment.

460
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,920
He deliberately took the thunder as a hostage,

461
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,079
Wan Jiajun,

462
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,119
You're forcing Boss Jin

463
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,079
and Ouyang's family to do everything they can,

464
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,440
Do you want to meet me again?

465
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,160
Do you have to kill my grandpa?

466
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,599
Now the Wan Army is not coming.

467
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,039
Mother, why are you so stubborn?

468
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:48,519
I have no choice.

469
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:50,839
Only in this way

470
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,480
can I save your father.

471
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:58,680
Give him the gun.

472
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,119
Yan Ying,

And Xiao'e.

Mother,

476
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,279
You've been looking for my father for 24 years.

477
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:25,720
Do you have to avenge this?

478
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,920
Twenty-four years ago,

479
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,880
my He family took Luo Shi with them,

480
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,839
Come here in a clean and honest way.

481
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,039
Twenty-four years later,

482
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:38,319
I, He Xinmei, fought a bloody battle with Ouyang Mansion,

483
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,440
I also want to go and kill countless people in my life

484
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,599
without any guilt.

485
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,720
But this is the only way to shine a light on the world,

486
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,000
and I have no conscience for the Zerg.

487
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,640
Mother,

488
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,279
Young master,

489
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,000
Mother,

490
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,039
If you take the medicine,

491
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,720
you don't have to take it now.

492
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,559
Find a few people,

493
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,960
protect their mothers

494
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,839
and get out of the way.

495
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,680
Get out of the way!

496
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,119
Get out of the way!

497
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,319
Where is the leader?

498
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,519
The leader

499
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,839
is not here.

500
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,480
Please welcome the Fire Department Statue.

501
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:23,839
Please bow down to the statue,

502
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,839
Ouyang Yanyun,

You are not only a gentleman of Fire Branch,

515
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,279
but also the leader of Ba Song.

516
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:04,960
You have to lead everyone

517
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,319
to defeat the demons,

518
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:07,720
Get rid of evil spirits.

519
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,839
To protect the peace of one side.

520
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,200

Congratulations.

525
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,280
I'm glad to hear that.

526
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,960
Please come in.

527
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:28,760
I was watching the mountain view on the tower,

528
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:35,400
and I heard the chaos outside the city.

529
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,239
We share the same joy.

530
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,480
Congratulations. Congratulations

531
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,840

please.

534
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:07,639
Zhuge Liang is waiting at the enemy building for you

535
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:14,199
to come here and have a heart-to-heart talk.

536
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,800

Today is the 70-year-old birthday of Ouyang Leiyun,

545
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,039
70 years of my life.

546
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,159
Compared with the natural luck of heaven and earth,

547
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:58,320
it's just a drop in the ocean.

548
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,320
I can be here with you all in the age of eternity.

549
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,800
I have no regrets in my life.

550
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,280
Come on,

551
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:13,199
I'd like to propose a toast to all of you,

Jin Sumei, Director of AsiaInfo Pharmaceuticals,

555
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,719
wishes to congratulate Old Ouyang on his 70th birthday.

556
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:39,760
I wonder if I am qualified

557
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:42,159
to drink this glass of wine?

558
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,400
Ouyang Leiyun,

559
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:50,239
do you still remember me?

560
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,239
The daughter-in-law who was tortured by your Ouyang family

561
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:54,800
with thousands of insects eating bones,

562
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,159
You're the daughter of the He family?

563
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,119
He Xinmei.

564
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:03,840
It's been 24 years.

565
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,199
You're such a rare visitor.

566
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,639
Do you think I'm already dead?

567
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,320
I'm telling you,

568
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,760
as long as I'm still breathing,

569
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,760
I will seek justice

570
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,360
from you,

571
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,239
Grandpa,

572
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:18,960
Yan Yun,

573
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,239
You're a Fire Branch gentleman,

574
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,400
an old Zerg,

575
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,320
Let us old people deal with it.

576
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,519
Don't worry.

577
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,159
But she's my mother.

578
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,440
Unexpectedly,

579
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:42,880
a thousand insects can't do anything to you even if they eat bones.

580
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:46,320
The day has finally come.

581
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,880
Let me ask you,

582
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:51,559
do you dare to tell the world,

583
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:54,679
The Zerg brothers who died in vain in Bamen Mountain,

584
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,119
where are they tonight?

585
00:37:58,119 --> 00:37:59,159
Ouyang Leiyun,

586
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,239
I've been

587
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,000
wandering for the rest of my life,

588
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,559
If flesh and blood are separated,

589
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,719
it's better to live than to die.

590
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,119
It's all thanks to you.

591
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,079
At this point,

592
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:13,440
you're still reversing the orthodox and the unorthodox,

593
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,239
You want to put all the blame on me.

594
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,039
If things don't go well,

595
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:19,039
give this to your grandpa.

596
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:31,920
Yan Yun,

597
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,119
Yan Yun,

598
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:33,880
Ziwu,

599
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:34,960
Yan Yun,

600
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,000
Grandpa,

601
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,679
Grandpa

602
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:41,159
The Zerg's decline and separation of flesh and blood,

603
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,960
no matter how hard it is, the days will be over.

604
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,119
Are you going to

605
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:45,840
repeat the tragedy 24 years ago?

606
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,440
Forget it.

607
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,679
The visitors are all guests.

608
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,719
You missed the feast,

609
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,679
I'll make it up for you.

610
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,559
Ouyang Xi, serve the wine.

611
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,239
It's Old Master.

612
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,480
Please

613
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,519
I'll do it first as a toast.

614
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,320
Xin Mei,

615
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,239
Please.
