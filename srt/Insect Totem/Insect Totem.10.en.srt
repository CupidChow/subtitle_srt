1
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,959
I didn't expect that the origin of the battle of Mount Ba Men,

2
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,599
was Yan Yun and Yan Ying's mother,

3
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,319
As for my father, you carried the punishment of killing bones

4
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,360
with thousands of insects for him.

5
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:15,560
How many secrets did the previous generation have?

6
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,719
We don't know.

7
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,360
As soon as he gets older,

8
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,400
he can't remember anything.

9
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,039
In fact, that's what people do

10
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,240
all their lives.

11
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,080
If you don't want to tell me,

12
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,319
just tell me.

13
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,360
Uncle Pan,

14
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,919
thank you for your hard work.

15
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,639
You've given me my father all your life,

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,840
and the whole Cordyceps Hall depends on you.

17
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,800
I even gave the Cordyceps Hall to someone else.

18
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,000
Tell me,

19
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,439
in Uncle Pan's life,

20
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,759
Who's in your heart?

21
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,199
I only have Old Master.

22
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,159
It's just you

23
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,039
and our old house,

24
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,000
Do I really care about our old house that much?

25
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,360
I care more about you.

26
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:24,319
How many days can I live with my old arms and legs?

27
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,479
When I really leave one day,

28
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,479
you won't even have a place to live.

29
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:35,039
Do you think I can feel at ease if I die?

30
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,479
What are you talking about?

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,840
From now on,

32
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,240
the place with you will be home.

33
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,120
We won't be apart,

34
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,319
as long as you don't dislike me,

35
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,240
I don't think my limping is a burden.

36
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,039
I've been following you.

37
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,639
I don't mind.

38
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,240
I've never married a wife.

39
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,039
You don't have a child.

40
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,479
I should have taken you,

41
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,919
Think of it as your own.

42
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,479
Why don't I believe it?

43
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,240
Father Pan.

44
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,360
Yan Ying

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,240
Are you thinking about me, too?

46
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,199
It's been 24 years.

47
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,120
I really can't figure out

48
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,680
what happened to Ouyang's family?

49
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,879
No matter what others say about her,

50
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,079
no matter how they blame her.

51
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,120
After all, she is our mother.

52
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:29,000
Your mother loves crabapple flowers the most.

53
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,480
Some of the flowers along the Wulu River,

54
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,560
I planted them for her myself.

55
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,920
Look at you.

56
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,439
expression

57
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,040
She looks just like your mother.

58
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,680
Was your leg

59
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,519
hurt by my mother in Bamen Mountain?

60
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,759
Look at the Chinese flowering crabapple tree.

61
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,040
It's so beautiful.

62
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,319
Look at them more.

63
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,279
Just watch it for your mother.

64
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,000
These are all planted by you.

65
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,000
It's been 24 years.

66
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,759
Ever since your mother died

67
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,680
in the Battle of Bamen Mountain,

68
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,120
I'll live in seclusion here.

69
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,160
I want to know,

70
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,399
what kind of person is my mother?

71
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,000
Your mother is the best woman

72
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,600
in the world,

73
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,560
The best woman.

74
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,879
When you enter the village on foot,

75
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,399
don't let any Zerg go.

76
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,079
Cheer up

77
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,839
and capture them alive.

78
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,160
Let's go.

79
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,040
Pan Jun,

80
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,959
Duan Xiao'e,

81
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,199
Kneel down, both of you.

82
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:28,959
Why did you kneel

83
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,560
when I asked you to.

84
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,720
Stop talking nonsense.

85
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,200
I've told Wuyi what Wan Chun thinks.

86
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,879
He has agreed,

87
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,440
of course, the secret treasure of your wood department has not been found yet.

88
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
But you're Yingxuan's son,

89
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,840
a wood gentleman must be you if it's not you.

90
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,360
You become a gentleman so soon.

91
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,279
Master,

92
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,000
I can't take it.

93
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,639
If I say you can take it, you can take it.

94
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,799
Kneel down, both of you.

95
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,559
The Zerg are hiding

96
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,720
there! Go!

97
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,960
From now on,

98
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,840
from now on,

99
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,879
You two will take over.

100
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:32,080
Be sure to abide by the Zerg's ancestral motto of saving the world.

101
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,000
In troubled times,

102
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,799
The five departments belong to one,

103
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,720
which is the responsibility of protecting treasures.

104
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,759
I swear I won't let the treasure fall into the hands of thieves.

105
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,639
If you have second thoughts

106
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,000
and violate the ancestral rules,

107
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,559
Gan Shou

108
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,399
Bone-eating by thousands of insects.

109
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:03,840
today

110
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,799
It will be witnessed by Jin Wuyi, a gentleman of the Gold Department,

111
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,679
and Ouyang Leihuo, an elder of the Fire Department.

112
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,679
Duan Xiao'e,

113
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,919
it's not good to pick up the gold secret treasure

114
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,240
Someone outside touched the mechanism,

115
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
Could it be that there's an exit at the bottom

116
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,279
of the AsiaInfo Club to the outside of the mountain?

117
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,799
Protect the secret treasure

118
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,399
and we'll meet outside the mountain.

119
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,879
But shouldn't we defend the enemy together?

120
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,200
To tell you the truth,

121
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,159
under the bottom of the well,

122
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,759
Hiding the secrets of the Zerg for thousands of years.

123
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,559
I, the Gold Department, have been guarding this place for generations,

124
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,960
precisely because it concerns

125
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,399
the important matter of opening the Zerg treasure.

126
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:06,039
It's more important than the secret treasure in your hands.

127
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:09,159
I've been here for decades.

128
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,120
Just to keep it a secret.

129
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,720
The rise and fall of the Zerg

130
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,480
is more important than the lives of all of us.

131
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:16,919
We'll defend the enemy in front of us,

132
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,639
and then we'll meet down the mountain,

133
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,399
Young master,

134
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,120
don't hesitate any longer.

135
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,279
Don't let Old Master down.

136
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,240
Now the lifeblood of the Zerg

137
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,879
is in your hands.

138
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,240
Before the crisis was over,

139
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,639
you were in the underground,

140
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,759
You can't neglect it for a moment.

141
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:42,519
Okay,

142
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,639
Let's meet outside the mountain,

143
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,240
Matsui Jun,

144
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,360
There are many organs in the hospital,

145
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,879
and our people have suffered heavy losses.

146
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,480
I'm afraid I can't take it anymore.

147
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,240
You losers.

148
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,240
Go,

149
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,000
Yes.

150
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:18,639
Grandpa,

151
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,399
keep the secret,

152
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,360
You may leave.

153
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,960
They are too soft-hearted,

154
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,000
on the contrary, you can achieve great things.

155
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,039
After you get out safely,

156
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,480
take the secret treasure to Ling City

157
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
to save the earth system.

158
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,360
Back to the river Luoshi,

159
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,399
the five departments are united,

160
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,519
And all of us.

161
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,279
And your mother's wish.

162
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,240
Go ahead, son.

163
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,200
See you outside the mountain.

164
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,440
Be careful and stand still.

165
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,159
I've been neglected in Jifang Cove for more than 20 years,

166
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,720
even if I open the door to welcome guests today,

167
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:47,000
We can have fun today.

168
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,399
Retreat.

169
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:44,440
This well is too deep.

170
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,240
After the kids go down there,

171
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,799
can you find a way out?

172
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,960
Children are smart kids,

173
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,960
they will find their own way out.

174
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,759
Lu,

175
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,640
They have to leave on their own.

176
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,839
Old Jin.

177
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,759
When you opened the door to welcome guests today,

178
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:07,400
it was so lively.

179
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,319
Today,

180
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,200
we have enough money.

181
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,240
Then let's go

182
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,000
on the road together.

183
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,319
Mr. Jin,

184
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,480
what is it?

185
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:19,720
When I was chasing Ouyang Leihuo in Fuzhou Mountain that day,

186
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,440
I heard the sound of the flute,

187
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,799
Its tune is exactly the same as

188
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,839
the one you're playing now.

189
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,000
I used to hear you play this song,

190
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,960
so I felt very familiar with it at that time.

191
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,240
But I didn't remember that

192
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:36,440
Ouyang Lei blew it, did he?

193
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,559
I'm not sure.

194
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,200
Before that, he was surrounded by two young men,

195
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,680
a man and a woman.

196
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,160
For a man and a woman,

197
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:46,480
how old are you?

198
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,079
About

199
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:50,599
20 years old. Where

200
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:52,599
is he?

201
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,240
Where are they now?

202
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,440
They should be trapped in Mount Fuzhou by Matsui now.

203
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,759
I'm going to Mount Fuzhou.

204
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
Miaomiao,

205
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,880
Miaomiao,

206
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,680
Where are you?

207
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,880
Miaomiao,

208
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,200
Miaomiao,

209
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:12,079
Are you okay, Miaomiao?

210
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,079
Matsui Jun,

211
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,559
let go!

212
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:16,000
Matsui

213
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,359
Jun Miaomiao is still inside.

214
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:20,279
Miaomiao is still in there! Let go of her!

215
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,319
Go find her!

216
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:22,759
Let go of me and go find

217
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,519
Lord Matsui,

218
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,200
Stop chasing me.

219
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,920
Please spare Miss Shi.

220
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,559
Don't push her anymore.

221
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,400
Let go!

222
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,759
Can't I command you?

223
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:38,640
Get out of the way

224
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,000
Miss Shi didn't do anything wrong.

225
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:47,880
Don't push her anymore.

226
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,240
Listen,

227
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,519
who dares to stop me?

228
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,359
He's what will happen to you.

229
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:05,839
Miaomiao

230
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,319
Where are you, Miaomiao?

231
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,359
Why?

232
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:28,119
It's all your fault

233
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,200
that you shouldn't have taken the position of president.

234
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:32,000
Yaxin Pharmaceutical Co.,

235
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,680
Ltd. is Mr. Jin's lifelong effort.

236
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:41,039
I'm just looking for Miaomiao,

237
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:44,079
my Miaomiao.

238
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,960
Miaomiao.

239
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:57,599
Watch out!

240
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,359
I'm fine.

241
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,039
There are candles over there.

242
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,519
Xiao'e,

243
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,319
are these all your grandpa's masterpieces?

244
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,240
These murals are old and old,

245
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,119
they must not be made by Grandpa.

246
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,240
There are five murals here. Look,

247
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,960
there are words on the wall.

248
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,240
The first ten years of Emperor Qin,

249
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,119
the second year of Yuanshuo,

250
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,680
The fifteenth year of Tang Zhenguan,

251
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,079
the third year

252
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,079
of Qing Xuantong,

253
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,480
What do these years mean?

254
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,400
There seems to be a locust tree in this painting.

255
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,839
How many people are there under the locust tree?

256
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,640
My grandfather once told a story

257
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,720
about this.

258
00:25:59,119 --> 00:25:59,920
It's said that

259
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,519
in order to escape the tyranny of Qin Dynasty,

260
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,839
He went south to Bashu with countless gold, silver and jewels,

261
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,440
and walked to a virgin forest,

262
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,240
In front is the vast mountain,

263
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:10,200
behind is the Qin dynasty pursuers,

264
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,599
There is no way to go to heaven and no way

265
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,960
to enter the earth. At this moment,

266
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,039
A huge locust tree with a height of four feet

267
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:17,440
suddenly appeared in front of me.

268
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:20,079
There's an ant cave under the locust tree,

269
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,680
with a hole in it.

270
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:23,319
Hidden treasure,

271
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:24,880
like a dragon palace,

272
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,880
Then what they opened

273
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,519
must be the Zerg treasure.

274
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,039
Let's take a look at the next painting

275
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,039
This painting

276
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,160
should correspond to the Year of Yuanshuo,

277
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,839
I know.

278
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:46,640
My father told me,

279
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,960
back then, our army,

280
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,440
When we fought against the enemy outside the Pass,

281
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,000
we only had enough food to support us for two days.

282
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,359
Our Zerg ancestors

283
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,200
took 300 houses of grain

284
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,880
from the treasure,

285
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,880
It has satisfied the army's supplies.

286
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,160
In just a few days,

287
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,000
they returned triumphantly.

288
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,839
The third time I opened it,

289
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,640
my grandfather used to tell this story,

290
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,880
He said there was once a farmer who strayed into the treasure,

291
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,480
came to another country,

292
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,759
He was also valued by the king and held an important position.

293
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,000
He has been rich all his life.

294
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,799
I thought after a lifetime,

295
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,200
he went back to his hometown.

296
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:30,559
But I couldn't find

297
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,039
the entrance to that country.

298
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,599
It sounds like

299
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,039
Peach Blossom Spring.

300
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,000
I used to think my father went to that place too.

301
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:42,119
In this mural,

302
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,920
there might be clues about our parents.

303
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,000
This is the fourth one.

304
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,880
This one

305
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,599
It's the fourth time the Zerg treasure has been opened,

306
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,640
and the time is right.

307
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,480
It was my mother's misfortune

308
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,240
24 years ago.

309
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:51,519
Miaomiao.

310
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,200
In the past,

311
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,240
I can't go with you.

312
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:00,759
But in the future,

313
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,400
in the future, I can,

314
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:06,640
We can all do it.

315
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:14,279
Senior Jin Wu Yi once told us

316
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,960
to go to Ling City together,

317
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,519
Save Ziwu.

318
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,200
Back to the river stone,

319
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,160
Jin Shun also told me,

320
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,079
He Luo Shi is in Ling City.

321
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,359
You mean,

322
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,519
we can go to Ling City together.

323
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,000
You're not leaving, are you?

324
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,519
The first three murals,

325
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,799
have gone through hundreds of thousands of years.

326
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,799
There's no way to verify it.

327
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,519
It has been passed down from generation to generation and has become a legend.

328
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,799
But the fourth one,

329
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,759
pointing to 24 years ago,

330
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,279
And it was our parents who experienced it personally.

331
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,519
In that case,

332
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,519
The last one.

333
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:17,960
It indicates that next time,

334
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,759
when the Zerg treasure is opened,

335
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,960
That is to say,

336
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,759
on the day of the sting this year,

337
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:25,960
The Zerg treasure must be opened again.

338
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,720
But we can't be sure.

339
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,440
We opened the Zerg treasure.

340
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:31,960
If the Zerg prophecy is known by Ashin Club.

341
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,440
All of us could be buried with him.

342
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,200
It's no use talking about it now.

343
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Take a look at the fifth one.

344
00:30:58,519 --> 00:30:59,440
Mr. Jin,

345
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,519
Mr. Jin,

346
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,160
Why are you here in person?

347
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,079
Matsui Jun

348
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,000
was ambushed by the Zerg.

349
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,839
It's considered as Yaxin Club's death.

350
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,319
I'm sorry for your loss.

351
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:18,279
Matsui is an example for all of us in the AsiaInfo Association.

352
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,880
We should always remember

353
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,599
his hard work,

354
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,240
Do you want to

355
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,039
tell Shangfeng about this?

356
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,519
I'm worried that

357
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:28,960
his body won't be able to hold on.

358
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,799
Can you hide such a big thing?

359
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:31,880
Tell me the truth.

360
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,200
I ask him to pay my respects.

361
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,359
It's Boss Jin.

362
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,920
Where are the Zerg?

363
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,960
They led us here.

364
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:39,960
He detonated the explosives all of a sudden.

365
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,079
It's all blown up.

366
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:42,839
No

367
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,480
Three Zerg seniors

368
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,799
were killed,

369
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,559
We've also sent more men.

370
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,839
After searching Mount Fuzhou,

371
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:52,079
we only found a suspicious old well.

372
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:55,319
This is the gold family's lair,

373
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,559
and they're good at mechanism tombs,

374
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,799
Are you saying that Jing is suspicious?

375
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,359
We'll dig three feet into the ground.

376
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,519
Understood. Yes,

377
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:04,599
Follow me.

378
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:11,359
A woman lying on a boat,

379
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,200
her face pale,

380
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,000
It looks like

381
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:18,079
she passed away. No. What does this mean?

382
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,279
What's going on up there?

383
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,759
Hurry up and find the exit!

384
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:39,960
Xiao'e, see if there's any record

385
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,839
in Tiangong's collection,

386
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:41,559
Okay.

387
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,599
Who told you to use the explosives?

388
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,559
How can we find the secret treasure

389
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,440
in this way? Our people found

390
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:52,559
the secret chamber and the secret passage down there.

391
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,960
But because the way was blocked by gravel,

392
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,279
I had no choice but to use explosives.

393
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,640
If it goes on like this,

394
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,559
I'm afraid no one

395
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,160
can get out of there alive.

396
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:02,000
No, let's use more explosives.

397
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,839
You can't do that.

398
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,759
No.

399
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:30,480
The door is open,

400
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,639
Hurry up!

401
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:33,880
Hurry up!

402
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,599
In this area,

403
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,280
there are a lot of gold defense mechanisms.

404
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,079
So if it goes on like this,

405
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,960
I'm afraid you'll hurt yourself.

406
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,639
Luo Xiu is right.

407
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,280
I, Yaxin, can't have more casualties.

408
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,679
Understood.

409
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:52,320
Then I'll ask our men to withdraw.

410
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,559
Let's go.

411
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,400
Yes.

412
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,639
Come on,

413
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:03,960
Sister

414
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,880
Xiao'e, do you know where this is?

415
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:13,000
We have to hurry back

416
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,360
to find the two seniors and Uncle Pan,

417
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,360
This is another hill of Fuzhou Mountain.

418
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,239
Come with me.

419
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,760
Let's go.

420
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,000
Uncle Pan,

421
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,360

422
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:41,880

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,960
Uncle Pan, where are you?

437
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:05,760
Second grandpa,

438
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,800
Uncle Pan,

439
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:08,800
Miss Shi,

440
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:11,760
where's my second grandfather?

441
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,440
Lin.

442
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:16,599
Miss Shi,

443
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,239
I knew it.

444
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,519
I will wait for you.

445
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:22,199
Meridian

446
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,599
Ziwu was taken to Ling City by them.

447
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,679
Where are our seniors?

448
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,679
Where are the three seniors?

449
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,800
The three seniors

450
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:41,039
were all killed.

451
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,320

No way. You're lying.

458
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,920
Uncle Pan must be waiting for me to save him.

Please forgive Lin.

466
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,800
Although our relatives are gone,

467
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,400
from now on,

468
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:45,679
The five of us are the closest people

469
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:47,239
in the world.

470
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,239
No.

We live in the same bed,

475
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,599
while we die in the same cave.
