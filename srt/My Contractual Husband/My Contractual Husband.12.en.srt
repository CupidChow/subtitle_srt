(Mid-Autumn Festival)

16
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,100
Mr. Gu.

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,900
Mr. Li, Mrs. Li, Miss Li.

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,180
Thanks so much
for your support this time.

19
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,060
I'm doing this for the entire Qiantang.

20
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,860
Everyone,

21
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,260
creating a good environment
for matchmaking

22
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,860
and raising our marriage rate

23
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,380
is my duty

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,180
as a local official.

25
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,780
Great.

26
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,140
So here,

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,420
I recommend Tongque Tavern

28
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,060
as the venue for young people
to meet in Qiantang.

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,900
Good!

30
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,830
Good!

31
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,700
- Good!
- Good!

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,900
This is wonderful.

33
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,740
Yes.

34
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,500
Right.

35
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,060
Yes, that's great.

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,700
That's great.

37
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,060
Thanks, Mr. Li.

38
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,240
In response to Mr. Li's recommendation,

39
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,420
from today, Tongque Tavern is offering

40
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,120
a special promotion:
half price for female companions.

41
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,910
- On the first and 15th of each month,
- Half price.

42
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,610
- any couple who visits
- That's nice.

Great!

45
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,620
Mr. Gu,

46
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,940
you're truly a visionary.

47
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,700
Mr. Li, please.

48
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,540
Please.

49
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,560
(Tongque Tavern)

50
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,490
- Let's go.
- Let's go in.

51
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,380
Mr. Li, please.

52
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,060
Mr. Li, are you satisfied?

53
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,420
Very good.

54
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,340
The marriage rate in Qiantang

55
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,650
has been troubling me.

56
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,940
Mr. Gu,

57
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,500
your influence is well-recognized
by everyone.

58
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,500
Miss, do you want some grapes?

59
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,580
Everyone,

60
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,260
the lantern riddle contest
for the full moon night

61
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,780
begins now.

62
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,100
Tonight, the person
who wins the first prize

63
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,940
will get free desserts
for three months

64
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,340
at Tongque Tavern.

65
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,370
Great.

66
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,060
Here are the riddles.

67
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
After you guess the answer,

68
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,220
take the paper slip from the lantern

69
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,060
and come to me to register.

70
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,990
The person who solves the most riddles

71
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,560
will be the champion tonight.

72
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,960
Great.

73
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,940
Here.

74
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,660
Aren't you going to watch it?

75
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,580
Cihua and Feiyan are there.
It'll be fine.

76
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,660
As the manager,

77
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,940
you don't even take the lead.

78
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,400
Now you've learned to slack off too.

79
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,820
That's because I want
to watch the lanterns with you.

80
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,140
(Mid-Autumn Festival)

81
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,120
This one's good.

82
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,760
A bird flies to the table,

83
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,300
gets its tail pinched,
and jumps into the river.

84
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,180
A household item.

85
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,340
I know it now.

86
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,260
What is it?

87
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,220
I see.

88
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,460
Wanjun knows this one.

89
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,910
The answer is a spoon.

90
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,180
That answer...

91
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,500
- Is it wrong?
- The answer is correct.

92
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,580
Congratulations, Miss Li,

93
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,570
for answering
the first riddle correctly.

94
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,180
That's great.

95
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,380
I've prepared something for you.

96
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,460
What is it?

97
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,940
Fireworks.

98
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,220
Isn't that childish?

99
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,460
I'm too old for that.

100
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,380
So pretty.

101
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,740
I'm too old for that.

102
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,300
Come here.

103
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,410
Dare to laugh at me?

104
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,340
Then, hit me lightly.

105
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,020
Who said I was going to hit you?

106
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,340
Am I that wild?

107
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,140
Well, you should be fair, right?

Li Wanjun, Miss Li.

119

She solved 20 riddles.

120
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,940
Mr. Zhou, this should be yours.

so your sweetheart is...

125
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,090
Miss Li, please.

126
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,940
Miss Wanjun,

127
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,660
Tongque Tavern will provide you

128
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,220
with free dessert for three months.

129
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,340
Congratulations!

130
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,230
- Congratulations, Miss Li.

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,740
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

132
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,180
You solved such difficult riddles.

133
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,570
- How talented.
- Congratulations.

134
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,640
So clever and outstanding.

135
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,870
Really great!

136
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,980
Uncle Hai,

137
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,140
can the wastewater
be thrown out tomorrow?

138
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,500
The wastewater
must be thrown out today.

139
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,950
That's the rule you set.

140
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,140
Afraid of the dark?

141
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,980
Me?

142
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,020
Afraid of the dark?

143
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,420
How is that possible?

144
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:25,620
How about I go?

145
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,340
No need.

146
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,380
Let me go.

147
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,750
Let me go.

148
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,620
If I hadn't been scared unconscious
by Shirui,

149
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,160
I wouldn't be
this afraid of the dark.

150
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,060
Help! Help! Help!

151
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,690
Help!

152
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,060
- Mr. Gu.
- Canghai.

153
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,560
Are you alright?

154
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,540
I'm fine.

155
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,400
Let's go.

156
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,050
Mr. Gu, hurry.

157
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,110
Mr. Gu, hurry.

158
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,740
What happened?

159
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,400
Are you alright, darling?

160
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,710
Did you get hurt anywhere?

161
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,170
I'm fine.

162
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,500
Someone saved my life just now.

163
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,740
I'm not injured.

164
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,100
That person

165
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,480
tried to stab my vital area
with each strike.

166
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,900
They must have wanted to kill me.

167
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,960
So reckless.

168
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,740
Do they still have
any respect for the law?

169
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,390
When have you ever seen an assassin

170
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,860
respecting the law while killing?

171
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,050
Our manager is already lucky.

172
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,910
You said someone saved your life.

173
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,920
Who was it?

174
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,100
In the dark,

175
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,400
I didn't see it clearly.

176
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,660
They were wearing a mask.

177
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,380
But I saw they were wearing
a pair of silver bracelets.

178
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,530
They seemed a bit familiar.

179
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,610
Silver bracelets.

180
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,960
Come on.

181
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,800
You have a strong drinking capacity.

182
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,330
Here.

183
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:06,890
Mr. Li,

184
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:12,220
this lantern event you organized

185
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,660
is indeed lively.

186
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,980
Gu Ping'an's tail

187
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,660
is almost reaching the sky.

188
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,020
What do you mean by that?

189
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,920
