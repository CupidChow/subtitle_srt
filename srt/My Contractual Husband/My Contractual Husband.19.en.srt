14
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,000
I understand what you mean,

15
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,640
but Miss Xia

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,600
is not just Gu's childhood sweetheart.

17
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,030
Her family can help him
with his father's case.

18
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,600
As for me,

19
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,070
I'm just a humble cook.

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,520
Mr. Gu...

21
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,370
Feiyan,

22
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,800
could you let me be alone for a while?

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,480
Tell me.

24
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,680
Was it you who tried to kill Zhou Sheng?

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,870
Mr. Li, how can I do that?

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,510
I'm innocent.

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,430
Everyone knows

28
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,310
Mr. Zhou is your son-in-law.

29
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,400
Even if I had the guts,

30
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,710
I wouldn't dare commit
such a heinous crime.

31
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,840
Early this morning,

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,000
Zhou Sheng came
to say goodbye to Wanjun.

33
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,590
He mentioned the assassination.

34
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,510
Wanjun is terrified.

35
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,510
I'm warning you.

36
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,870
Zhou Sheng will become
a court official.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,710
I can overlook

38
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,870
your little actions.

39
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,040
Don't get involved in something

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,870
as fatal as this.

41
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,920
Yes, sir. I understand.

42
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,320
Mr. Li,

43
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,030
I've been staying at home,
cultivating my character.

44
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,600
I haven't dared to cause trouble,

45
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,310
but trouble still came to me.

46
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,680
See? I was suspected
of something I didn't do.

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,840
- Enough.
- I'm innocent.

48
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,870
Mr. Ximen, I hope you know

49
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,280
what not to do.

50
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,200
Of course.

51
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,200
Mr. Li, please take care.

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,640
Miao,

53
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,150
you heard it, right?

54
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,190
All our efforts are wasted this time.

55
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,280
Then let's deal with Gu Ping'an

56
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,360
before Zhou Sheng takes office.

57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,840
Miao, come on.
You still want to do that?

58
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,120
I've fought with Gu Ping'an for so long.

59
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,470
He's not tired, but I am.

60
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,430
It's been half a year,

61
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,220
and I haven't earned a single penny.

62
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,590
I lost a lot.

63
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,430
Foolish!

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,960
Don't forget

65
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,030
who gave Gu Qingfeng the fatal blow

66
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,590
that night.

67
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,550
Miao,

68
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,910
since illegal actions come with risks,

69
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,350
let's consider

70
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,360
the legal alternatives.

71
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,060
(Tongque Tavern)

72
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,590
The dishes are ready.

73
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,870
Darling, have a taste.

74
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,850
The sun must be rising
from the west today.

75
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,710
You actually cooked.

76
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,630
I've seen you work hard every day.

77
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,590
As your husband,

78
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,150
how can I not put myself in your shoes?

79
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,430
You've always cooked,

80
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,240
so today I especially learned
a few dishes

81
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,240
to let you try my cooking.

82
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,680
Please have a taste.

83
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,030
How is it?

84
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,430
The color and aroma are acceptable.

85
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,710
But the taste...

86
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:01,910
How is it?

87
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,640
It's too salty.

88
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,520
Too salty?

89
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,240
No way.

90
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,240
I asked Canghai.

91
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,400
He said half a spoon of salt.

92
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,710
What size spoon?

93
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,870
This big.

94
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,910
I didn't dare add more.

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,160
I studied it for a long time.

96
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,920
It only needs half a tablespoon.

97
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,200
It looks like

98
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,600
next time you'll have
to teach me step by step.

99
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,750
Since opening the tavern,

100
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,800
I've been thinking
about the meaning of eating.

101
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,750
Food is the foundation of the people.

102
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,480
Three meals a day may seem common,

103
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,880
but we work hard all day,

104
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,630
and it's really just so we can sit down

105
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,070
and enjoy a good meal.

106
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,440
Isn't that right?

107
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,900
Eating is the most important thing
in this vast world.

108
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,680
But what's more important than eating

109
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,270
is who you're eating with.

110
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,680
Darling, you haven't
talked much to me lately.

111
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,160
Are you angry with me?

112
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,720
I'm not angry with you.

113
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,870
I'm angry with myself.

114
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,510
Darling,

115
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,480
Wanwan and I were once engaged.

116
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,870
We grew up together,

117
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,430
but I've always seen her as a sister.

118
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,920
My heart has always been with you.

119
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,070
Xia Wanwan wants
to take you away, right?

120
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,190
I won't go with her.

121
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,160
What if I'm not here?

122
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,310
That's impossible.

123
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,190
I've been thinking these days.

124
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,000
You two were engaged.

125
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,630
I've been like a bandit,

126
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,920
keeping you by my side.

127
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,720
I promised to help you find clues,

128
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,920
but in the end,

129
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,560
I found nothing.

130
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,680
I can't help you.

131
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,630
Why don't you go back
to Kaifeng with her?

132
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,630
It's my business
to clear my father's name.

133
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,000
Even without the Xia family,

134
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,120
I have my ways.

135
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,430
What ways? To find Zhou Sheng?

136
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,170
You had secret talks with Mr. Zhou,

137
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,830
hoping he'd see the Emperor soon.

138
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,240
But you know,

139
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,800
placing your hopes on one person

140
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,640
is too uncertain.

141
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,270
To the Xia family,

142
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,270
this is just about a memorial.

143
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,560
So what?

144
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,730
I won't compromise
and ask the Xia family for help.

145
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,000
Gu Ping'an, are you being childish?

146
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,830
I know your heart is with me.

147
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,680
So what?

148
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,840
I can't help you.

149
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,600
If you offend Vice Minister Xia,

150
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,150
who will stand up for you?

151
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,100
Are you going to push me away for this?

152
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,730
I stayed in Qiantang because of you.

153
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,540
Now you're trying
to convince me to leave?

154
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,390
Even you think
that without the Xia family,

155
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,130
I won't be able
to clear my father's name?

156
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:07,670
You...

157
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,040
Ping'an,

158
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,610
I've been looking all over for you.

159
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,560
Miss Song, you're also here.

160
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,690
Ping'an, can we talk for a moment?

161
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,880
What's the matter?

162
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,110
Ping'an,

163
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,160
you're so smart.

164
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,870
Can't you see the situation clearly?

165
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,390
I know what you want to say.

166
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,800
Thank you, Wanwan.

167
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,190
I understand your kindness,

168
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,310
but I won't go with you.

169
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,040
Why was Mr. Zhou attacked?

170
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,430
Someone knew
about your close relationship

171
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,220
and didn't want him to be your support.

172
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,150
So,

173
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,360
that night, Mr. Zhou was in danger.

174
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,240
It shouldn't have happened to him.

175
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,480
If you don't leave,

176
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,950
I'm afraid more people
will be implicated.

177
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,600
Ping'an,

178
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,480
do you really want

179
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,750
to see other innocent people

180
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,470
caught up in your personal conflict?

181
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,320
Of course not.

182
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,860
I've asked Zhou Sheng for help.

183
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,650
You don't need to worry about it.

184
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,630
Father has reviewed
the shipwreck case files,

185
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,870
and he finds many doubts.

186
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,250
Given the relationship
between the two families,

187
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,190
if you go to ask him personally,

188
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,560
reopening the case
will just be a matter of time.

189
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,190
But you also said

190
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,800
the reason Uncle Xia would help me

191
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,840
was that he wanted
you and me to marry.

192
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,160
I can't agree to this.

193
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,430
I won't betray Shirui.

194
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,310
Are you going
to watch her fall into danger?

195
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,430
I have my ways.

196
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,920
I will protect her well.

197
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,390
Mr. Zhou narrowly escaped.

198
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,190
Miss Song might not be so lucky.

199
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,150
The Ximen family
treats human life as nothing.

200
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,570
Zhou Sheng, as the top scholar,
couldn't protect himself,

201
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,850
let alone the two of you.

202
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,560
Shirui, what are you doing?

203
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,040
Since she's heard everything,

204
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,070
she'll understand
what I'm saying is true.

205
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,080
What?

206
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,070
Arrest Gu Ping'an?

207
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,390
You two are crazy.

208
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,870
Mr. Li, please don't rush.

209
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,600
We're not trying to arrest Gu Ping'an

210
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,630
without reason.

211
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,870
The former Forwarding Magistrate
Gu Qingfeng's shipwreck

212
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,630
was suspicious from the start.

213
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,390
Who knows if he found himself

214
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,730
involved in the private salt case

215
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,290
so he committed suicide out of fear?

216
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,630
Now, his son is in Qiantang,

217
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,680
running a tavern successfully.

218
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,120
This just shows

219
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,630
that the Gu family
has deep roots in Qiantang.

220
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,120
Gu Ping'an is so suspicious.

221
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,240
Mr. Li, aren't you going to investigate?

222
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,900
Well...

223
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,560
Mr. Li, think carefully.

224
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,800
Once the higher-ups investigate this,

225
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,200
you might not be able
to protect yourself.

226
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,390
Why not

227
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,080
just arrest Gu Ping'an now
and interrogate him

228
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,720
to eliminate future risks?

229
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,390
You two siblings

230
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,440
truly have a talent for twisting things.

231
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,180
Tomorrow morning,

232
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,320
I'll arrest the guilty official's son,
Gu Ping'an.

233
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,630
Are you sure?

234
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,510
Miss Xia really wants
to take Mr. Gu away?

235
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,940
Mr. Gu hasn't given her an answer.

236
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,370
From what I heard,

237
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,600
the situation is urgent.

238
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,670
If Mr. Gu leaves with Miss Xia,

239
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,040
what will happen to Miss Song?

240
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,030
No, I have to stop them.

241
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,470
Don't go.

242
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,760
You can't stop it.

243
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,200
Mr. Gu carries the grudge

244
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,900
of his father's death.

245
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,700
So, are we just going to watch

246
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,680
this couple part ways?

247
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,550
Why didn't Shirui

248
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,480
fight for herself?

249
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,840
Mr. Gu came to Qiantang with the mission

250
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,790
of avenging his father,

251
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,960
so he can't be bound
by personal feelings.

252
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,440
Cihua is right.

253
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,240
If he really gives up the chance

254
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,360
to clear his father's name
for Miss Song,

255
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,270
then he's not a good man.

256
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,750
Everyone,

257
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,730
from what I know about Miss Song,

258
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,270
she will let Mr. Gu go.

259
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,220
After I leave with Mr. Gu,

260
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,960
please, everyone,

261
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,000
make sure to protect Miss Song.

262
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,910
