Last time, it was our fault

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,360
for beating you like that.

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,200
I'm begging you this time.

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,740
Shirui, this matter

18
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,300
is very simple

19
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,980
and complicated.

20
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,660
What matters is

21
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,220
how many relationships will be involved.

22
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,140
Do you understand?

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,260
But, it's not impossible.

24
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,260
Unless...

25
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,460
Unless what?

26
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,860
Unless you agree to be my concubine.

27
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,670
Don't even think about it.

28
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,540
Then I don't know whether Mr. Gu

29
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,740
is alive or dead in prison.

30
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,980
I'll send someone
to check on him another day.

31
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,180
Change the condition,

32
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,830
and I'll agree.

33
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,700
Then, give me Tongque Tavern.

34
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,800
That's Gu Ping'an's ancestral property.

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,500
I can't make that decision.

36
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,300
Nothing can work, huh?

37
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,780
Do you even have any sincerity?

38
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,780
I can't help Gu Ping'an.

39
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,640
Wait.

40
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,250
Fine.

41
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,930
I agree.

42
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,810
Here are the land deed
and the key to the tavern.

43
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,780
Shirui, you only have
an incense stick of time.

44
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,880
Say what you need to say quickly.

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,790

48
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,580
Darling.

49
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,220
How did you get in here?

50
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,100
How did you get in?

51
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,220
I wanted to see you,

52
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,620
so I begged Ximen to let me in.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,840
You're so foolish.

54
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,920
Why did you beg him?

55
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,450
Did he make things hard for you?

56
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,800
No,

57
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,540
but I gave him the land deed
to Tongque Tavern.

58
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,440
I had no other choice.

59
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,740
I'm sorry, darling.

60
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,420
It's alright.

61
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,550
It's just a land deed. It's okay.

62
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,310
It's not more important than you.

63
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,000
Alright, don't cry.

64
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,320
Speaking of which,

65
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,080
I came in to tell you something.

66
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,720
Li Wanjun will help us

67
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,410
plead with Mr. Li for your release,

68
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,510
so you must say
you don't know Zhou Sheng.

69
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,960
It was you who told her

70
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,700
the answers to the riddles,

71
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,980
and that's why she won first place.

72
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,100
Have you got that?

73
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,700
Yes.

74
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,380
I made

75
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,740
this Shibazi bracelet for you.

76
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,900
I had it blessed at the temple.

77
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,740
Wear it as a keepsake.

78
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,260
Thank you, darling.

79
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,740
Gu Ping'an,

80
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,570
remember this:

81
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,310
You are my beloved.

82
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,860
I'll find a way to rescue you.

83
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,410
Once we get through this,

84
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,920
we'll start over

85
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,430

00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,020
Shopkeeper, what's this?

187
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,860
Xiaodao.

188
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,300
I know that you played a big part

189
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,020
in me being released from prison.

190
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,060
And I also know

191
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,250
you're the one

192
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,000
who saved me last time.

193
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,710
I don't know

194
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,310
how to repay you for saving my life.

195
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,960
So, if you're willing,

196
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,740
I'd like to invite you back to join us.

197
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,360
Though Tongque Tavern is no longer here,

198
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,890
I'll find a way to support everyone.

199
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,690
What do you think?

200
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,780
If you're willing to take me in,

201
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,780
I'll certainly agree.
