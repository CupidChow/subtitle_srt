14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,450
You invited me to meet today.

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,150
Is there something you want to discuss?

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,390
After you take office,

17
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,000
I have a request.

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,240
I hope you'll consider it.

19
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,750
Mr. Gu, please tell me.

20
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,110
Tongque Tavern is

21
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,350
an ancestral property left by my father.

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,810
He was the Forwarding Magistrate
appointed by the court.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,790
Three years ago, to investigate
the private salt case in Jiangnan,

24
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,760
he encountered a shipwreck
and died in the river.

25
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,150
How unbelievable.

26
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,480
How was the case handled at the time?

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,850
The court sent the Court
of Judicial Review to investigate,

28
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,480
but strangely,

29
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,120
there was not a single clue.

30
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,560
In the end, the case was dropped.

31
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,040
I've always felt something
was off about it.

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,310
How can I help you, Mr. Gu?

33
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,000
I've visited many places recently

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,550
and have uncovered several clues.

35
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,240
There may be a deeper conspiracy
behind the private salt trade.

36
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,630
I want to ask you to cooperate
with me to investigate it.

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,490
We need to find clues

38
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,160
so that the Emperor can reopen the case.

39
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:38,790
I understand.

40
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,810
When I meet His Majesty,

41
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,270
I will report

42
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,910
the situation in Qiantang in detail.

43
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,070
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

44
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,840
I'll toast you with tea
instead of wine, Mr. Zhou.

45
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:53,890
How is it?

46
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,630
Thank you.

47
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,500
Gu.

48
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,410
Perfect timing.

49
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,590
Please try my new dish.

50
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,060
What is this?

51
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,380
This is a fish that Canghai caught

52
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,700
a few days ago in West Lake.

53
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,230
We kept them hungry for a few days,

54
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,360
then boiled them,

55
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,930
and poured sugar vinegar sauce on top.

56
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,500
I found that this way,

57
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,380
the fish tastes even more delicious.

58
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,660
By the way, I'd like to name it
West Lake Vinegar Fish.

59
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,700
Mr. Zhou, please help yourself.

60
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,660
Please.

61
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,420
It's delicious.

62
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,380
No wonder
you're the top chef in Qiantang.

63
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,060
Miss Song's cooking

64
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,980
is one of a kind in all of Qiantang.

65
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,820
By the way, Mr. Gu,

66
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,260
I need to trouble you
for the engagement banquet

67
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,620
between Wanjun and me in ten days.

68
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,300
Mr. Zhou, don't be so polite.

69
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,780
Gu Ping'an and his gang
still haven't been eradicated.

70
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,840
He can't even handle
such a small matter.

71
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,420
He's unfit for major tasks.

72
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,460
Don't blame the young master, Madam.

73
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,580
Mr. Gu grew up with you.

74
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,780
You know him best.

75
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,540
Since that's the case,

76
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,860
I'll have to handle him myself.

77
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,060
Darling, come drink your soup.

78
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,780
(Gu Ping'an)

79
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,660
Darling.

80
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,420
Gu Ping'an!

81
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,820
Gu Ping'an!

82
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,860
I'm here.

83
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,740
What's wrong?

84
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,340
Didn't you say

85
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,100
you wouldn't bully me anymore?

86
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,220
I dreamed that you ran off
with another woman

87
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,880
and even wrote me a divorce letter.

88
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,380
My dear wife,

89
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,740
even if you gave me ten lives,
I wouldn't dare.

90
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,380
Then swear it.

91
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,020
Alright.

92
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,190
There won't be a next time.

93
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,580
Okay, I'll listen to you.

94
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,660
I swear, there won't be a next time.

95
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,420
No, I didn't do anything this time.

96
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,980
What do you mean by "this time"?

97
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,580
Aren't you not sleeping anymore?

98
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,500
Who's there?

99
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,620
Mr. Gu, it's me.

100
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,860
Xiaodao, you haven't gone home yet?

101
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,260
Mr. Gu, there's progress.

102
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,740
We found a skeleton in the river

103
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,900
outside Fengshan Gate.

104
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,620
The skeleton was
wearing official clothes,

105
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,300
and there was a waist tablet tied to it.

106
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,560
It was tied with several knots
to keep it from being washed away.

107
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,400
Please take a look.

108
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,100
(Forwarding Magistrate)

109
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,020
Yes.

110
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,500
This is my father's waist tablet.

111
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,200
We dived to the bottom of the river
and found the skeleton.

112
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,580
It had stones tied to it.

113
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,860
He might be murdered
and then sunk to the riverbed.

114
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,620
Where is the body now?

115
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,100
We placed the body by the riverbank.

116
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,580
Several brothers are keeping watch.

117
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,900
I hurried back to ask you

118
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,020
how to proceed.

119
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,160
Find a place to properly handle it.

120
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,040
I'll go find Mr. Zhou

121
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,160
and ask for the coroner
to examine the body.

122
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,950
Should we put it
in my courtyard for now?

123
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,820
My home is near Fengshan Gate,

124
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,860
and there's no one around.

125
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,140
No one will find out.

126
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,580
Shirui,

127
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,340
don't you mind it?

128
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,840
Of course not.

129
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,260
Your father is like my father.

130
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,780
Also, examining a body
requires a quiet place.

131
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,420
My home is the best choice.

132
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,520
Alright.

133
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,800
Xiaodao, take people
to transport the body overnight.

134
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,830
Be sure to be careful.

135
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,190
Understood. I'll go now.

136
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,540
Now that we've found the body,

137
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,740
we're one step closer to the truth.

138
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,780
I hope so.

139
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,700
Next,

140
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,200
we need to figure out a way
to get the Emperor

141
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,700
to reopen the case.

142
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,940
Don't worry.

143
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,260
However difficult this road is,

144
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,520
I'll be with you every step of the way.

145
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,340
(Tongque Tavern)
Miss, please come in.

146
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,860
Try our new dish,
West Lake Vinegar Fish.

147
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,620
I'm here to see Gu Ping'an.

148
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,650
Who are you?

149
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,300
(Xia Wanwan,
daughter of Vice Minister Xia)

150
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,780
You're the lady from Kaifeng

151
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,560
who has an engagement
with Gu Ping'an, right?

152
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,260
He's mentioned you before.

153
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,660
I'm Xia Wanwan.

154
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,980
I've known Ping'an

155
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,340
since we were children.

156
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,380
Our parents arranged our marriage

157
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,500
before we were born.

158
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,100
(I'm fearless of heaven and earth.)

159
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,220
(Why would I be afraid
of a childhood sweetheart?)

160
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,760
Then why didn't you two get married?

161
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,900
The year of our engagement,

162
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,180
Uncle Gu had an accident.

163
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,860
Ping'an kept mourning for three years

164
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,460
and then vanished without a trace.

165
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,660
I only found out later

166
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,260
that he was driven out of his family
by his stepmother.

167
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,560
I searched for him for a long time
before I got here.

168
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,860
But we have already married.

169
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,720
I heard, though,

170
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,340
that your marriage is a sham.

171
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,100
Without the traditional ritual

172
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,580
or the bridal crown and veil,

173
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,440
is that considered a marriage?

174
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,580
Wanwan?

175
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,580
Ping'an.

176
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,020
Finally, I've found you.

177
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,940
Miss, it's been a long time.

178
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,140
Looks like the mission went well,
Guard Ning.

179
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,540
Guard Ning?

180
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,860
Wanwan,

181
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,600
why didn't you tell me before you came?

182
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,480
You're just a girl,

183
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,640
and the journey is so long.

184
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,220
What if something happens on the way?

185
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,660
How can I explain it to Uncle Xia?

186
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,540
Do you know?

187
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,980
Ximen Miao came to Qiantang.

188
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,860
My stepmother?

189
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,620
After you left,

190
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,460
I placed informants in your family.

191
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,040
A few days ago,
Ximen Miao received a letter,

192
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,980
and the next day,
she prepared a horse and left.

193
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,060
I rushed here ahead of her

194
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,980
to beat her to it.

195
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,700
Ms. Ximen is probably

196
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,460
planning something big.

197
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,020
Ping'an,

198
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,540
come back to Kaifeng with me.

199
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,320
My father is a Vice Minister
of the Court of Judicial Review.

200
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,300
He investigated this case back then.

201
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,940
Though there was insufficient evidence
to resolve it,

202
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,100
if you have proof now,

203
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,700
we can ask him to submit a petition

204
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,780
and reopen the case.

205
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,820
That way,

206
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,060
Uncle Gu would have a chance
to clear his name.

207
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,320
Is Uncle Xia willing to help me?

208
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,620
Of course, he is.

209
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,820
But you know my father.

210
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,460
He's watched you grow up

211
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,580
and considers you
a good match for me.

212
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,620
Ping'an,

213
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,940
why don't you divorce Miss Song

214
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,580
and go back to Kaifeng to marry me?

215
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,540
That way,

216
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,380
I'll have a reason
to ask my father for help.

217
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,780
We can submit a petition to His Majesty.

218
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,260
Canghai,

219
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,980
you're the spy sent by Miss Xia,

220
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,180
right?

221
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,260
I was just here to protect Mr. Gu

222
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,170
and work.

223
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,390
I didn't do anything else.

224
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,300
But I don't understand.

225
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,500
Shirui, you're Mr. Gu's wife.

226
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,980
Why is it that she can freely

227
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,500
share a room with him?

228
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,980
Aren't you going to check?

229
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,820
She met him first after all.

230
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,540
They do have an engagement.

231
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,300
I forced Gu to marry me.

232
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,660
So what?

233
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,660
They aren't married.

234
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,420
The engagement is just an empty promise.

235
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,780
Mr. Gu and you

236
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,420
have consummated.

237
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,760
What's there to fear from her?

238
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,900
Not yet.

239
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,460
Wow, Mr. Gu is incapable, huh?

240
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,260
I don't understand.

241
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,300
What's Miss Xia's purpose

242
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,180
in coming to Qiantang?

243
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,900
It should be to take Mr. Gu away.
