Bring the people from Tongque Tavern!

Justice!

16
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,780
Kneel!

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,870
Shirui, are you okay?

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,640
Let me ask you.

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,480
Where is Gu Ping'an?

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,480
Alright.

21
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,840
Since you all refuse to speak,

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,070
bring in the punishment.

23
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,950
Start with twenty lashes.

24
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,290
Let them watch Miss Song
getting beaten.

25
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,430
Beat her!

26
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,300
(Order)

27
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,430
I made a vow to the Bodhisattva.

28
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,640
I'm willing to exchange my marriage

29
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,000
for Tongque Tavern's success.

30
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,690
You're making such a big bet.

31
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,310
I haven't fallen in love.

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,230
I just want to be a chef.

33
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,910
So,

34
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,310
I scoff at the Yue Lao Temple

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,800
but kneel and pray
in the Kitchen God Hall.

36
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,840
Alright, I promise you.

37
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,680
I won't let you down.

38
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,500
Tongque Tavern will surely become
the largest tavern

39
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,590
in all of Jiangnan,

40
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,520
and you'll be the top chef in Qiantang.

41
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,030
(Gu Ping'an,)

42
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,190
(the Bodhisattva really heard my vow.)

43
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,150
Shirui.

44
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,800
Cihua.

45
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,560
Miss Song, we must protect you,

46
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,580
or we won't be able
to explain it to Mr. Gu.

47
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,400
You don't have to do this.

48
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,150
Alright.

49
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,910
You like to protect her, right?

50
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,640
Stop.

51
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,520
Pull them away.

52
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,280
Put Song Shirui on the nail board.

53
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,190
Who dares to do that?

54
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,190
It's Gu Ping'an. Take him down!

55
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,030
Mr. Li,

56
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,840
the Patrol Inspector is here.
How dare you act recklessly!

57
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,190
Surround them!

58
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,270
Zhou.

59
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,400
Greetings, Patrol Inspector.

60
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,150
Shirui, Shirui...

61
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,120
Come on. Here.

62
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,750
You...

63
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,490
You...

64
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,840
Why did you return?

65
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,080
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,400
I'm late.

67
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,630
You've suffered.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,840
Get up.

69
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,910
Bring the body.

70
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,840
Miao, isn't that...?

71
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,120
Zhou, what are you...

72
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,410
Mr. Li, please be patient.

73
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,140
I have an important case
to report to you.

74
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,760
Mr. Gu.

75
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,920
Mr. Ximen, Ms. Miao,

76
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,510
I have a story

77
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,950
to tell you both.

78
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,360
Please listen carefully
and tell me if I'm wrong.

79
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,190
Ximen's family business

80
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,190
is one of the best in Qiantang,

81
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,680
but unexpectedly,

82
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,140
this ordinary restaurant business

83
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,720
couldn't satisfy your appetites.

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,480
So, you started selling private salt.

85
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,680
Is that right or not?

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,140
My mother passed away early,

87
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,820
and my father raised me on his own.

88
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,900
But I was born a good-for-nothing,
unable to be of much use.

89
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,510
To protect the family's prosperity,

90
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,270
my father intended to remarry.

91
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,070
Your family valued my father's position
as the Forwarding Magistrate

92
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,600
and married Ms. Miao to my father.

93
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,360
Is that right or not?

94
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,480
Unexpectedly, my father,

95
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,510
true to his name,
was an honest man with no greed.

96
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,490
He went to Jiangnan
to investigate the salt case

97
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,830
and discovered the Yin-Yang Sect,

98
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,350
the largest private salt
trafficking organization in Jiangnan.

99
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,920
And the leader behind this sect

100
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,560
was you two.

101
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,480
So, unable to stop,

102
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,360
you orchestrated the shipwreck plot

103
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,430
and killed my father.

104
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,480
Is that right or not?

105
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,630
After Gu Qingfeng's death,

106
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,950
Ximen Miao seized all the assets
of the Gu family

107
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,600
without knowing Gu Qingfeng
left behind a Tongque Tavern.

108
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,630
However, Ximen Bang in Qiantang

109
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,880
had long been prepared

110
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,310
to wipe out Gu Ping'an completely.

111
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,850
Once the plan succeeded,

112
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,050
Tongque Tavern would still belong
to the Ximen family,

113
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,040
and you would suffer no losses.

114
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,630
But who would have thought

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,830
Ximen Bang wasn't Gu Ping'an's match?

116
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,070
So, you planned to kill me first

117
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,680
and then Gu Ping'an.

118
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,960
Is that right?

119
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,360
Patrol Inspector, please be fair.

120
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,950
Someone must be plotting against us.

121
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,270
Please look into it, Mr. Zhou!

122
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,070
Yes, yes!

123
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,160
This doesn't prove that we did it!

124
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,850
- Mr. Zhou, please investigate!
- Please!

125
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,140
Please look into it, Mr. Zhou!

126
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,390
I found this severed finger

127
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,040
and a Yin-Yang Sect ring

128
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,870
among Gu Qingfeng's remains.

129
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,480
Mr. Ximen,

130
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,950
can you tell me
which finger you lost?

131
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,360
Why was your name engraved on this ring?

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,560
How could you lose everything?

133
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,870
You didn't even look

134
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,390
for your finger or your ring!

135
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,350
Miao,

136
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,470
I didn't know this would be discovered.

137
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,560
I thought it would be done quietly,

138
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,960
so I didn't dare tell you.

139
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,930
- You!
- Miao!

140
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,840
You're more trouble

141
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,450
- than you're worth.
- Three years ago,

142
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,630
Gu Qingfeng brought evidence
of the private salt case

143
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,660
to board a ship at the dock
outside Fengshan Gate,

144
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,850
planning to report back.

145
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,950
But after you two found out about it,

146
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,920
you immediately decided
to eliminate Gu Qingfeng.

147
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,930
But when the assassins
arrived at Tongque Tavern,

148
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,470
Gu Qingfeng had boarded the ship.

149
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,430
They had to destroy the tavern first

150
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,920
to prevent any future risks.

151
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,430
Then, Ximen Bang
managed to board the ship

152
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,040
and struck Gu Qingfeng's head
from behind with a blunt weapon.

153
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,680
After Gu Qingfeng passed out,

154
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,750
you tied him to a stone

155
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,970
and threw him into the river.

156
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,150
But,

157
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,560
during the struggle between Gu Qingfeng
and Ximen Bang,

158
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,310
Gu Qingfeng bit off
Ximen Bang's ring finger.

159
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,480
This ring and the finger bone
are the evidence.

160
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,080
Mr. Li,

161
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,160
can these two be thrown directly
into the dungeon?

162
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,040
Yes, yes.

163
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,000
Someone, take these two away!

164
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,030
- Yes.
- Yes.

165
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,790
Miao!

166
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,070
- Please spare us, Mr. Zhou!
- Mr. Zhou!

167
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,930
- Please spare us!
- Please spare us!

168
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,790
Mr. Zhou!

169
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,190
- Mr. Zhou!
- Miao!

170
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,680
Please spare us!

171
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,950
What about the staff at Tongque Tavern?

172
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,680
They're all innocent.

173
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,320
Zhou,

174
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,960
I'll confess everything.

175
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,380
Please ask the Emperor to show mercy

176
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,420
and spare my family.

177
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,000
Mr. Li,

178
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,390
as the Patrol Inspector,

179
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,340
it is my duty to handle
the case impartially.

180
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,680
As your son-in-law,

181
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,630
I am deeply sorry.

182
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,080
Forget about it.

183
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,710
Forget about it.

184
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Zhou Sheng, can I entrust Wanjun to you?

185
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,440
I am honored by your trust.

186
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,920
I will love Wanjun
for the rest of my life.

187
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,360
Shirui, Shirui.

188
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,320
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,840
I'm so sorry.

190
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,720
It's all my fault.

191
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,080
I made you suffer.

192
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,260
I'm glad I got here in time.

193
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,270
I was wrong.

194
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Will you forgive me?

195
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,390
May I ask

196
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,750
if this lady

197
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,670
still needs a manager?

198
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,740
Well, my demands are very high.

199
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,750
I swear

200
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,850
that from now on,

201
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,750
I'll always follow Song Shirui,
never leaving her side.

202
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,720
Then,

203
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,270
eight taels a month.
You'll start tomorrow.
