14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,260
I'd like to invite you back to join us.

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,980
Though Tongque Tavern is no longer here,

16
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,660
I'll find a way to support everyone.

17
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,380
What do you think?

18
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,260
If you're willing to take me in,

19
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,260
I'll certainly agree.

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,940
(Employee: Liu Xiaodao)

21
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,980
Aren't you going to check the contract?

22
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,860
No need, I trust you.

23
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,460
Mr. Gu,

24
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,400
I still need to apologize
for what happened before.

25
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,700
Ximen has caused a lot of harm.

26
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,740
Sooner or later...

27
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,340
The Ximen family's power

28
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,020
in Qiantang is strong.

29
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,260
We need

30
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,680
solid evidence of his crimes

31
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,340
before we can act.

32
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,110
By the way, Mr. Gu,

33
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,500
I overheard Ximen say...

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,460
You're an easier target
than Gu Qingfeng.

35
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,820
Do you know

36
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,940
who Gu Qingfeng is?

37
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,380
That's my father.

38
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,380
Ximen said

39
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,140
that you were an easier target
than Gu Qingfeng.

40
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,210
Madam, the young master sent word

41
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,170
that he has got the land deed
to Tongque Tavern.

42
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,960
He's asking how to handle Mr. Gu.

43
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,610
Tell him

44
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,590
to eliminate everything

45
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,110
and leave no potential trouble behind.

46
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,610
But in that case,

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,080
the secret letter your father took

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,260
will never be found again.

49
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,440
What's to fear?

50
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,570
When the only person
who knows the secret disappears,

51
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,550
the secret naturally vanishes with them.

52
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,500
Xiaodao, I have a favor to ask.

53
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,300
Please, go ahead.

54
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,380
I think after my father

55
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,510
was killed by the sinister,

56
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,940
his body was dumped in the river.

57
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,190
You have many connections.

58
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,340
Could you help me search for him?

59
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,820
That's no problem.

60
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,620
But there are many waterways
around Qiantang.

61
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,440
Do you know the general location?

62
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,460
I heard a government ship
sank here three years ago.

63
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,430
Have you heard of it?

64
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,220
I've heard of it.

65
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,760
You know?

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,530
Mr. Gu,

67
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,260
three years ago, a government ship sank
outside Fengshan Gate.

68
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,280
The Forwarding Magistrate
sent to Jiangnan was on the ship.

69
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,250
I'm not sure if that's the one you mean.

70
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,100
That's exactly it.

71
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,450
My father was on that ship.

72
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,190
How do you know about this?

73
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,100
Three years ago,

74
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,400
I was unloading cargo at the dock
outside Fengshan Gate.

75
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,250
That dock was
a must-pass for many ships.

76
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,860
Many ships were parked there.

77
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,300
I heard the next day,
the ship was gone,

78
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,220
and many things from the ship
were floating in the water.

79
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,540
It's said there was a heavy storm
the night before,

80
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,340
and the ship was split in half
by lightning,

81
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,360
which caused it to sink.

82
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,380
Outside Fengshan Gate...

83
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,960
(Qiantang River under Mount Fenghuang)

84
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,340
(Ten li west of the Yin-Yang Sect)

85
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,700
Yes.

86
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,580
It was outside Fengshan Gate.

87
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,620
Time to eat!

88
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,590
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

89
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,460
Luckily, during this time,
we've helped each other,

90
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,150
so we got through this hardship.

91
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,820
This toast is for everyone

92
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,340
and also to welcome Xiaodao back.

93
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,700
- Great.
- Cheers.

94
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,340
Though Tongque Tavern is gone,

95
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,100
from now on, you can consider this place

96
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,180
as your home.

97
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,300
Mr. Gu,

98
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,050
what is

99
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,800
your next plan?

100
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,910
I'm thinking of launching
the Eaten Yet plan.

101
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,460
Eaten Yet?

102
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,580
Yes.

103
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,660
Xiaodao and Cihua will go out
to take orders

104
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,880
and bring them back home.

105
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,170
Once Canghai and Shirui
prepare the meals,

106
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,980
we'll send them out all together.

107
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,010
This way,

108
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,950
everyone can enjoy our food

109
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,580
without leaving their homes.

110
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,340
If we do this,

111
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,250
our operation will be more free.

112
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,020
I guess I won't be much help then.

113
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,250
How could that be?

114
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,610
Xiaodao will handle the accounts,

115
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,170
and you can go with me to take orders.

116
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,210
Who in Qiantang wouldn't want
to see you?

117
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,260
That's right.

118
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,640
I have a question.

119
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,300
Who will deliver the food?

120
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,060
As for delivery,

121
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,460
of course,
it'll be done by the fastest,

122
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,100
most handsome member of our team.

123
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,590
You'll do it.

124
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,200
I shouldn't have asked.

125
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,060
(Father,)

126
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,140
(when you left Tongque Tavern to me,)

127
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,400
(you hoped I could settle down
and start a family.)

128
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,190
(Though the tavern is gone,)

129
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,460
(I've found someone
I want to spend my life with)

130
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,820
(and a group of friends
who share both joy and hardship.)

131
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,620
(I have a home in Qiantang now.)

132
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,100
(I will find evidence)

133
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,500
(to clear your name.)

134
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,250
(Please help me)

135
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,970
(from above.)

136
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,480
Why aren't you asleep so late?

137
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,980
I can't sleep.

138
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,810
So much has happened lately.

139
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,520
I haven't been able
to spend time with you.

140
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,520
But I'm with you every day.

141
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,300
And with the case

142
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,740
making progress step by step,

143
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,020
I'm happy for you too.

144
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,780
Shirui,

145
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,180
I really miss you.

146
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,260
I'm right here in front of you.

147
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,780
I still miss you.

148
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,950
When I was in prison, I was worried.

149
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,830
What if I don't make it out?

150
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,920
What will you do?

151
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,970
Then I'll go sell buns
at the gate of the yamen,

152
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,300
so you can

153
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,960

179

00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,320
When people order their food,

185
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,120
they'll deliver it right to their homes.

186
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,640
I passed by just now,

187
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,940
and I saw people waiting in line
to place their orders.

188
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,660
Good job, Gu Ping'an.

189
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,060
You can't sit still for even a moment.

190
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:28,890
Mr. Ximen,

191
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,490
your sister sent a letter.

192
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,630
She wants you to eliminate
all future threats.

193
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,020
No rush.

194
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,720
First, I'll let Gu Ping'an know

195
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,460
that whatever he does...

196
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,200
What was it again?

197
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,500
Takeaway service.

198
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,260
His takeaway service will never

199
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,780
get Tongque Tavern back.

200
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,340
Understood.

201
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,100
The last two orders:

202
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,780
Miss Li's desserts and pepper fish head.

203
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,080
Mr. Xu's Dongpo pork, steamed bass,

204
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,010
and a longevity peach.

205
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,290
That's it.

206
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,930
Can we finish

207
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,240
the 120 orders today?

208
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,720
I'll work overnight; it should be fine.

209
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,830
The dishes can be made in time,

210
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,460
but can they be delivered tomorrow?

211
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,940
No problem. I'll add more staff tomorrow

212
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,420
to ensure they're delivered on time.

213
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,820
Tonight, Shirui and Canghai
will have to work hard.

214
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,540
Tomorrow, we'll hire more people.

215
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,820
No need, Mr. Gu.

216
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,450
There are many kids
at the Refugee Camp.

217
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,540
I raised them.

218
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,700
They're quick on their feet.

219
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,640
They'll help tomorrow.

220
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,740
They'll complete the task.

221
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,610
That sounds even better.

222
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,170
So what are we waiting for?

223
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,820
Let's get started.

224
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,110
Sure.
