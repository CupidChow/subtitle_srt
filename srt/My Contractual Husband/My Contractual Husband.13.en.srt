14
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,600
Mr. Li has issued an order.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,600
Tongque Tavern has been engaging
in immoral activities.

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,710
The manager, Gu Ping'an,
shall be arrested at once.

17
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,150
(Tongque Tavern)
Starting today,

18
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,840
- Wait.
- the tavern is closed for review.

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,760
What's going on?

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,680
Wait, wait.

21
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,710
Mr. Zhao, what's happening?

22
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,090
You can't arrest people like this.

23
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,960
Take him away.

24
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,150
- Go.
- Go.

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,800
Let go.

26
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,160
Darling.

27
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,460
Go back. Don't worry about me.

28
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,060
(Tongque Tavern)

29
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,040
No matter what,
we must think of a way to rescue him.

30
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,070
First, someone tried to kill Mr. Gu,

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,480
and now he's been thrown into prison.

32
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,400
Everything is aimed at him.

33
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,540
So,

34
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,400
what immoral activities did we even do?

35
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,870
I knew it.

36
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,760
Good things never come easily.

37
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,070
Mr. Ximen, please.

38
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,640
Yaoji.

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,910
Tell me.

40
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,430
Yesterday, Tongque Tavern
was bustling with customers,

41
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,000
but today,
why has it ended up like this?

42
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,200
If the manager fails,

43
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,770
the tavern fails too.

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,520
That's true.

45
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,410
Go away.

46
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,640
Shirui,

47
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,080
you should change your temper.

48
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,970
Your husband has been locked in prison.

49
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,250
Why still pretend to be tough?

50
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,060
If I were you,

51
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,150
I'd take these workers
and find another way out.

52
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,800
We can both be well off.

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,590
You'll still be the mistress.

54
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,650
What do you think?

55
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,410
Mr. Ximen, you're not welcome here.

56
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,160
Shut up.

57
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,730
When did it become your turn to speak?

58
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,040
Are you going to leave or not?

59
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,090
I won't leave.

60
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,810
Close the door.

61
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,800
What are you doing?

62
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,030
(Tongque Tavern)

63
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,560
- You dare to hit me?
- I'll beat you.

64
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,720
- Stop. Don't hit me.
- Stop.

65
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,090
Stop hitting me.

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,750
I'll hit you.

67
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,190
Get out!

68
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,470
- They got kicked out.
- Yes.

69
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,800
- Get out!
- Go!

70
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,640
Stop!

71
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,150
You violent commoners!

72
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,590
How dare you treat me like this?

73
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,000
How bold.

74
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,360
Oh, my. Take this!

75
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,200
Go away!

76
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,050
Go away!

77
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,520
You'll regret this.

78
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,390
You treat me like this today.

79
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,100
Gu Ping'an will never have it easy.

80
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,330
What are you looking at? Go!

81
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,100
- Mr. Ximen, wait.
- I'm not afraid of you!

82
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,240
Come back. Come back.

83
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,160
Close the door.

84
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,630
I want to find Mr. Li

85
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,000
and have him release Mr. Gu.

86
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,870
Mr. Li is obviously
in cahoots with Ximen.

87
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,150
Giving him money would be
like walking into a trap.

88
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:21,990
That's right.

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,190
We should go find Zhou Sheng

90
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,860
and ask him to help us
figure out a plan.

91
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,690
Zhou Sheng and Cui come here
at the Shen hour

92
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,340
to pick up desserts
and exchange letters.

93
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,240
No.

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,360
We can't let anyone see

95
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Zhou Sheng come here.

96
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,910
Cihua, stop him halfway

97
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,430
and bring him to my courtyard.

98
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,270
Okay.

99
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,640
Feiyan, tell Canghai

100
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,870
to wait at the tavern.

101
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,000
If Cui comes,

102
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,590
bring her to my courtyard too.

103
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,120
We'll go there now and wait for them.

104
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,960
Okay.

105
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,310
Mr. Zhou.

106
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,080
Mrs. Gu, Miss Li.

107
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,120
What happened?

108
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,980
Tongque Tavern was sealed
early this morning.

109
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,330
Our manager has been taken away.

110
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:07,970
What happened?

111
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,440
The yamen said the activities
on the 15th were immoral.

112
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,800
Mr. Zhou, I have a question.

113
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,360
You once told our manager

114
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,520
that you liked a young lady.

115
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,800
Is it Miss Li?

116
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,640
Indeed.

117
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,670
That night,
I helped Wanjun win the contest,

118
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,250
and we stayed together the whole night.

119
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,410
I see.

120
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,950
Mr. Li used this as an excuse

121
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,390
to take my husband away.

122
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,000
I caused trouble for Mr. Gu.

123
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,270
I'm truly sorry.

124
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,110
No, no.

125
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,120
This isn't your fault.

126
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,240
Someone set a trap for my husband.

127
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,220
Right now,

128
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,150
we need to find a way

129
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
to rescue him quickly.

130
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,800
I'll go back and write a petition,

131
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,200
asking Mr. Li to punish me instead

132
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,240
and release Mr. Gu.

133
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,920
Do you think a petition will help?

134
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,720
Miss Cui.

135
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,440
Miss Song.

136
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,040
Our lady has heard

137
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,800
about Mr. Gu's imprisonment.

138
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,510
Does Miss Li have a plan?

139
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,390
The lady said

140
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,630
this matter needs
to be considered carefully.

141
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,520
Mr. Zhou,

142
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,140
this is the money for your journey
from our lady.

143
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,430
She wants you

144
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,560
to take the money
and leave Qiantang now.

145
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,920
No need to say goodbye to her.

146
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,490
Mr. Gu has helped me countless times,

147
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,680
without asking for anything.

148
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,720
How can I leave now?

149
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,640
I won't go.

150
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,670
You are just a scholar,
without power or influence.

151
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,950
How could you possibly save him?

152
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,390
Your stay will only be a burden.

153
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,370
Miss Cui's words may be harsh,
but they are true.

154
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,360
You two are in love,

155
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,680
but it's hard to meet each other.

156
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,680
In the future,
how will you protect her?

157
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,920
Mr. Zhou,
now is not the time for sentiment.

158
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,290
Take the money and leave Qiantang.

159
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,880
We'll tell the yamen we don't know you.

160
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,160
They won't find any evidence.

161
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,230
When Mr. Gu is released,

162
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,870
we'll tell him you left without a word

163
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,390
and you had no choice.

164
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,630
Since that's the case,

165
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,830
I, Zhou Sheng, swear here

166
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,250
that I'll pass the imperial exam.

167
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,330
If not, I'll have no face
to meet you and Wanjun.

168
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,080
Miss Cui,

169
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,010
I wish to see your lady.

170
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,160
Can you help me?

171
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,240
Miss Song, to be honest,

172
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,310
my lady is also confined to her room.

173
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,250
Not only is she confined to the house,

174
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,730
but she can't even
leave her inner chambers.

175
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,980
Unless

176
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,160
you can find a way to enter.

177
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,870
I have a way.

178
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,280
Xiaodao.

179
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,120
Xiaodao.

180
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,770
Cihua.

181
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,510
- Xiaodao.
- Shh.

182
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,800
The kids are asleep.

183
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,560
What are you doing here?

184
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,050
On the night of the Lantern Festival,

185
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,950
Mr. Gu was saved by a masked person.

186
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,560
It was you, right?

187
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,720
Your silver bracelets showed,

188
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,600
and he saw them.

189
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,720
The manager has been kind to me.

190
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,760
I can't stand by and do nothing.

191
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,720
He's been imprisoned.

192
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,720
Imprisoned?

193
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,800
Only Miss Li can save him now.

194
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,120
I need to enter the Li Mansion.

195
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,040
You must help me.

196
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,560
That's the Prefect's home!

197
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,360
You have a way, don't you?

198
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,150
Are you afraid of heights?

199
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,680
This is the closest place
to Li Wanjun's bedroom.

200
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,980
If you climb over the wall,
you'll be right at her door.

201
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,050
But if you're discovered,

202
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,850
it'll be a dead end.

203
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,950
If we can't see Miss Wanjun,

204
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,800
our tavern will also face destruction.

205
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,050
Why are you risking your life

206
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,030
to save Mr. Gu?

207
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,680
You don't understand.

208
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,360
I've wandered for so long.

209
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,010
Now, I finally found a home.

210
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,070
I have to protect it.

211
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,050
Let's go.

212
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,250
Come on.

213
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,230
Come here.

214
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,360
This is so close to the sky.

215
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,340
Call Cui out.

216
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,080
Cui, can you hear me?

217
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,720
Yes. I'll let the lady hear now.

218
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,760
Miss Li.

219
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,920
Cihua, how is Mr. Gu now?

220
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,870
We haven't seen him yet.

221
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,150
Miss Li, you must save him.

222
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,960
Listen.

223
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,200
You must find a way to meet Gu Ping'an.

224
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,870
Once you meet him, tell him

225
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,360
never to mention Zhou Sheng,

226
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,170
the reason I won the riddle contest

227
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,890
was Mr. Gu told me the answers
in private,

228
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,760
and it had nothing to do
with Zhou Sheng.

229
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,550
Remember that.
I'll take care of the rest.

230
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,120
Okay, understood.

231
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,300
Who's there?

232
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,390
Right now, we have to see Mr. Gu.

233
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,080
Otherwise, his testimony will differ
from Miss Li's.

234
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,850
Shirui went there this evening.

235
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,080
But without Mr. Li's orders,

236
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,440
no one is allowed to visit.

237
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,320
Enough with this.

238
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
In my opinion, let's just break in.

239
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,140
Are you crazy?

240
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,120
You don't care about your life,
but Mr. Gu does.

241
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,440
Then what do you suggest we do?

242
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,040
Who else can help us?

243
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:28,890
Cihua,

244
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,940
you'll come with me tomorrow.

245
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,420
There's one person who can help us.

246
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,200
Mr. Ximen. Mr. Ximen.

247
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,320
Miss Song is here.

248
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,260
Shirui is here.

249
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,600
Hurry and let her in.

250
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,500
Please come in, Miss Song.

251
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,950
Shirui.

252
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,270
What brings you here?

253
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,790
Long time no see. Welcome!

254
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,020
Mr. Ximen,

255
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,670
I know Tongque Tavern and Caidie Resto

256
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,270
have always been rivals in the business,

257
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,010
but my husband has been imprisoned.

258
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,410
I want to visit him in prison.

259
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,600
Please, Mr. Ximen, have mercy

260
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,580
and help me.

261
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,700
Whatever the condition, please name it.

262
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,880
Is that so?

263
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,230
Shirui,

264
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,920
this is not a matter of money.

265
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,750
My family is large and prosperous.

266
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,700
I don't care about money.

267
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,360
What matters is that Mr. Li
is handling the case.

268
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,910
If I helped you,

269
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,550
that wouldn't be right.

270
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,080
I know you have influence
in front of Mr. Li.

271
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,670
Last time, it was our fault

272
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,150
for beating you like that.

273
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,960
I'm begging you this time.
