Why bother with those 200 wen?

16
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,710
She's also tired.

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,210
- It's not about her.
- Exactly.

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,710
- I just think Ximen is despicable.
- Come on.

19
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,520
Bullying someone
who hasn't been educated.

20

What's that?

21

- One more.

24

Place your bet.

25
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,760
You can bet on that?

Where are you going?

27
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,780
I'm going to take a look.

28
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,870
Wait for me.

29
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,400
Sorry, everyone.

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,760
Thank you.

31
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:22,870
I'm done playing.

32
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,400
Who can play after losing all morning?

33
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,230
Make a comeback in the last round.

34
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,250
The winner takes it all.

35
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,150
- The last round.
- Come on.

36
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,640
Come on, the last round.

37
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,140
(Liu Xiaodao,
a regular at the gambling house)

38
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,070
You go first.

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,590
There's a chance.

40
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:37,920
Go ahead.

41
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,800
Who is he? So impressive.

42
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,320
- Liu Xiaodao. He wins every time.
- Still don't want it, huh?

43
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,040
If you don't want it,
don't blame me then.

44
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,280
How else should I play?

45
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,590
I won.

46
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,350
The officials are here.

47
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,640
Let's go.

48
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,680
Liu Xiaodao

49
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,400
doesn't rely on luck.

50
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,840
He's a master at math.

51
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,680
He's been calculating the cards.

52
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,750
Aren't we looking for a bookkeeper?

53
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,630
Kids, I'm home.

54
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,000
- Xiaodao's home!
- I brought you goodies.

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,910
Come on.

56
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,070
Xiaodao's home!

57
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,160
- Xiaodao!
- Many goodies.

58
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,730
Here.

59
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,190
There's more.

60
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,350
I bought roast chicken today.

61
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,950
- Roast chicken!
- Roast chicken!

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,650
- Does it smell good?
- Yes!

63
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,920
Young man.

64
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,520
Who are you?

65
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,610
Sorry to bother you.

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,280
I'm Gu Ping'an,
Manager of Tongque Tavern.

67
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,520
This is my wife.

68
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,470
What's the matter?

69
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,710
Today, I saw you on the street.

70
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,910
You got the wrong person.

71
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,380
Go away.

72
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,280
Young man, wait.

73
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,920
We don't mean any harm.

74
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,500
I have a job for you.

75
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,290
How do you know I'm unemployed?

76
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,840
Young man, let me be straightforward.

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,710
I saw you at the gambling table,
observing everything.

78
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,150
I know you must have a way of winning.

79
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,310
You have many younger siblings
to take care of,

80
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,680
so your life must be tough.

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,470
Our Tongque Tavern just opened,

82
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,150
and we're looking for a bookkeeper.

83
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,710
We really need someone like you.

84
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,710
Four taels a month.

85
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,310
Four taels?

86
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,590
Food and drink included.
What do you think?

87
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,400
Well...

88
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,280
And you can take the extra food

89
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,240
from the tavern home for the kids.

90
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,840
- Xiaodao, you should go.
- Go ahead.

91
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,080
- Xiaodao, just go.
- Go.

92
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,080
When do I start work?

93
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,020
(Tongque Tavern)

94
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,540
(First Meeting)

95
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,900
(First Meeting for All Employees)

96
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,680
Everyone,

97
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,980
Tongque Tavern officially

98
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,330
starts operating today.

99
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,590
Good.

100
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,960
From now on,

101
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,830
we need to pool our ideas
and work together as one.

102
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,120
I will surely lead everyone

103
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,430
to make Tongque Tavern

104
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,040
the largest tavern in all of Qiantang.

105
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,780
Mr. Gu, raise my salary
when the time comes.

106
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,920
I support that!

107
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,230
Mr. Gu,

108
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,870
you have to give me and Mrs. Gu
a bigger kitchen.

109
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,100
The current stove is too small.

110
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,270
I can't work properly there.

111
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,720
No problem.

112
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,240
There will be a raise
and a bigger kitchen.

113
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,720
But

114
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,190
we must serve every customer well.

115
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,040
Is there a problem?

116
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,890
No!

117
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,560
Good. Let's all shout our slogan:

118
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,680
United and unstoppable!

119
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,390
Why is it so noisy outside?

120
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,200
I'll go take a look.

121
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,630
Come back soon.

122
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,680
(Tongque Tavern)

123
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,260
- Where are you going?
- Caidie Resto.

124
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,160
Order four and get four free
for all dishes.

125
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,120
Such a rare opportunity.

126
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,460
No more talk. I'm going to feast.

127
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,510
What's going on?

128
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,720
They're feasting.

129
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,230
Feasting at Caidie Resto?

130
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,390
Order four and get four free.

131
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,920
Order four and get four free?

132
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,000
The competition has begun, huh?

133
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,160
(Caidie Resto)
Table 54, welcome to Caidie Resto.

134
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,560
Sorry to keep you waiting.

135
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,630
Unsold, near-expiry dishes

136
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,750
are given away for free

137
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,510
with secretly raised prices.

138
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,270
How can they not see through this trick?

139
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,360
What do you know?

140
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,220
These customers

141
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,430
rarely come to Caidie Resto,

142
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,870
so they can't tell the difference
in prices.

143
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,120
Sir,

144
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,480
would you like a ticket?

145
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,600
What ticket?

146
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,560
Didn't you see?

147
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,160
There are over 80 tables waiting.

148
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,430
With my ticket,

149
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,160
you only need to wait for six tables.

150
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,040
Isn't that better
than waiting 80 tables?

151
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,640
Thanks.

152
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,030
One hundred wen.

153
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,800
One hundred wen?
Might as well go rob people.

154
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,640
Let's go.

155
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,800
You don't want it? Plenty of people do.

156
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,040
What's so great about Caidie Resto?

157
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,160
Their dishes aren't as good as mine.

158
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,070
When our business picks up,

159
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,240
I'll pick a day to invite
all the people to eat for free,

160
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,920
so everyone can judge
whose dishes are better.

161
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:31,830
You scared me.

162
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,630
Female bandit.

163
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,830
You really are my mascot.

164
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,430
What mascot?

165
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,070
I've got an idea. Let's go.

166
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,020
- How many people?
- One.

167
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,520
(Tongque Tavern)
One person, got it.

168
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,100
- Your ticket.
- Thanks.

169
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,430
Sir, if you exceed
an incense stick of time,

170
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,070
there's a 30-wen extra charge.

171
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,950
Please come in, sir.

172
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,200
Please come in.

173
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,310
Darling, you're really clever.

174
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,390
For just 30 wen per person,

175
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,160
they can try all the dishes.

176
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,600
Much more affordable than Caidie Resto.

177
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,750
Thanks to your superb cooking.

178
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,350
Mr. Ximen,

179
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,630
Tongque Tavern has started

180
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,270
a "Buffet Day" promotion,

181
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,160
and it's taken all our customers.

182
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,160
It looks like Gu Ping'an

183
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,000
is determined to go against me.

184
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,390
All the customers who were lined up
in front of our shop

185
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,720
have now gone to Tongque Tavern.

186
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,160
Where does Gu Ping'an
get all this energy

187
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,360
to run these promotions?

188
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,680
Here's the thing, Mr. Ximen.

189
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,270
Gu Ping'an first hired a burly man
as the deputy chef,

190
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,600
hired a thug as the waiter,

191
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,310
and found a gambler as the bookkeeper.

192
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,190
They sound like a bunch of riff-raff.

193
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,750
That's true.

194
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,390
That burly man's origin is unclear.

195
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,250
The waiter Cihua is a tomboy,

196
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,860
wandering around with no fixed home.

197
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,390
As for Liu Xiaodao,

198
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,800
he's never lost a gamble on the streets.

199
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,160
Liu Xiaodao?

200
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,230
The one who always wins?

201
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,560
Yes. He's an orphan
from the Refugee Camp,

202
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,240
often seen at gambling houses,

203
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,120
but the money he wins

204
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,360
always goes to the beggars
at the Refugee Camp.

205
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,670
Good.

206
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,830
I'll have a word with Liu Xiaodao.

207
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,270
You take care of it.

208
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,580
Understood.

209
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,820
(Tongque Tavern)

210
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,440
Mr. Gu, here's today's ledger.

211
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,280
Please take a look.

212
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,600
Let me see.

213
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,630
This ledger is quite a pleasure to read.

214
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,480
You take a look. I'll go help out.

215
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,360
Miss,

216
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,940
you shouldn't be doing such heavy work.

217
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,540
Miss?

218
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,470
I've been wandering the world
for many years,

219
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,960
and no one's ever called me "Miss".

220
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,750
What else should I call you then?

221
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,630
A big, burly man?

222
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,120
I don't think so.

223
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,360
In my eyes, you're just a girl.

224
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,200
From now on,

225
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,350
let me handle these chores.

226
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,640
Xiaodao,

227
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,420
take these dishes back to the kids.

228
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,540
They must be hungry by now.

229
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,010
Thanks, Mrs. Gu.

230
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,780
Xiaodao, where are you going?

231
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,620
Just got off work.

232
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,980
Going to bring food to the kids.

233
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,380
Xiaodao, you've turned over a new leaf?

234
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,850
What's so new about it?

235
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:00,750
Just trying to get by.

236
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,560
By the way,
a new gambling house opened here.

237
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,710
Let's go have a few rounds.

238
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,890
- Just a few rounds.
- Wait.

239
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,570
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

240
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,220
Kneel.

241
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,700
What do you want?

242
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,420
You young people

243
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,980
you just can't stay calm.

244
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,700
How much did he lose today?

245
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,900
Mr. Ximen, 500 taels in total.

246
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,510
If he can't pay within three days,

247
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,780
he'll lose one hand.

248
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,180
Less talk.

249
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,100
You've set a trap to frame me.

250
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,940
Despicable!

251
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,940
You're an old hand.

252
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,020
You should know cheating has
to be caught red-handed.

253
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,700
Go ahead and kill or cut me
if you want.

254
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,900
I don't want to kill or cut you.

255
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,340
I'm a businessman.

256
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,300
I just need a favor from you.
