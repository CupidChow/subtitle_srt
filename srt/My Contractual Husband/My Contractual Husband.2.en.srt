The ceremony is complete.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,280
Send the newlyweds
to the bridal chamber.

18
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,020
(Married)

19
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,000
Why do you look so gloomy
on your wedding day?

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,280
I got married
before the mourning period ended.

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,840
I even kissed you.

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,710
Come on.

23
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,040
You're a grown man.

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,350
Why are you acting like a woman?

25
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,640
You're taking advantage of me, alright?

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,310
I was forced into it.

27
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,280
I came to Qiantang

28
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,590
to open a tavern.

29
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,680
Who would've known...

30
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,790
Who would've known
I'd meet a female bandit like you?

31
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,280
Calm down.

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,120
It was my fault
for being attracted to you.

33
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,950
You just helped me act in a play.

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,310
Don't try to get close to me.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,840
How about this?

36
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,350
Let's sign a gentleman's agreement.

37
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,950
No consummation.

38
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,190
Is that okay?

39
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:58,990
Well...

40
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,560
Once your tavern is up and running,

41
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,600
we can divorce.

42
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,440
Alright.

43
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,410
It's a deal.

44
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,360
We'll have to sign it.

We're only pretending to be married.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,460
Why should we drink the wedding wine?

49
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,080
This isn't the wedding wine.

50
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,910
This is a drink to celebrate
our happy cooperation.

51
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,750
Come on.

52
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,240
Alright, I'll drink.

53
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,400
Hurry, another cup.

54
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,620
I really can't drink anymore.

55
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,830
What are you doing?

56
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,910
Don't take it off.

57
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,560
Stop taking it off.

58
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,310
We have a gentleman's agreement.

59
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,950
Don't blame me
for what's going to happen then.

60
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,800
It's so hot.

61
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,540
(Ximen Mansion)

62
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,030
How absurd.

63
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,240
Shirui.

64
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,680
My Shirui...

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,470
How strange.

Song Shirui

67
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,750
has had no luck in love for years.

68
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,680
Now out of nowhere, a husband appears.

69
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,080
This is suspicious.

70
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,960
Go check on him.

71
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,840
Find out everything about this brat.

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,030
What if this is true?

73
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,150
True?

74
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,710
Then we'll deal with her husband.

75
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,960
Understood?

76
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,240
Understood.

77
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,680
We agreed on a gentleman's agreement,
right?

78
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,120
Yeah, so what?

79
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,120
Then why did you take advantage of me

80
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,870
while I was drunk?

81
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,150
You're the one who got drunk
and acted wild.

82
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,120
Female bandit.

83
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,560
I was wrong, okay?

84
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,310
Female bandit! Female bandit!

85
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,240

Fresh buns! Come and take a look!

86
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,910
Miss Bride.

87
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,840
Selling buns
right after getting married?

88
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,680
Get lost!

89
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,280
Don't waste my time with business.

90
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,100
How else can you support your boy toy?

91
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,160
What do you mean by that?

92
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,110
You go wait over there.

93
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,270
- My money sachet!
- Stop!

94
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,360
You two are lucky today.

95
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,480
- Just wait!
- Stop!

96
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,680
- Serves you right!
- Stop!

97
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,040
These thugs abusing their power

98
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,920
deserve a beating.

99
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,540
Miss, five big buns,
with plenty of meat.

100
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,730
(Cihua, a street thug)
Got it.

101
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,240
(Song's Big Buns)
Thanks for helping me earlier, Miss.

102
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,080
Yeah.

103
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,720
Here, consider these buns a gift.

104
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,710
No need to pay.

105
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,760
You're welcome.

106
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,930
To deal with thugs,

107
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,830
you have to use
even more ruthless methods.

108
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,000
By the way,

109
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,510
call me "Young man".

110
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,890
Don't call me "Young lady".

111
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,800
Young man?

112
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,680
You're clearly a girl.

113
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,390
Young man, thanks.

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,840
Keep the money.

115
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,800
If you ever need help, just call me.

116
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,470
Bye.

117
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,030
Take care.

118
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,270
Qiantang River.

119
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,480
Golden on the outside,
silver frost inside.

120
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,460
What are you looking at?

121
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,760
Come on.

122
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,950
Why do you walk so quietly?

123
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,070
It's really scary.

124
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,430
We've only been married for two days,

125
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,310
and you're already complaining about me.

126
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,160
By the way,
where exactly is the Tongque Tavern?

127
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,510
That building is on the same street
where you fainted.

128
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,950
It's just a bit further ahead.

129
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,160
How would I know where I fainted?

130
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,170
Why don't you take me there?

131
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,470
I'm not going.

132
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,180
Then I'll go by myself.

133
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:09,190
(Tongque Tavern)

134
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,060
Drink up.

135
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,360
How come it's you guys again?

136
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,240
What a small world.

137
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,080
Everyone,

138
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,480
what are you doing in my tavern?

139
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,680
Please leave.

140
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,950
Your tavern?

141
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,180
Do you understand the rule
of first come, first served?

142
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,510
This is the deed to my tavern.

143
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,950
If you don't leave now,

144
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,510
you're trespassing on private property.

145
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,560
Stop talking nonsense.

146
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,920
The whole of Qiantang
belongs to Mr. Ximen.

147
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,590
I don't care about your property rights.

148
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,870
Give it back to me.

149
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:42,920
Come and take it.

150
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,070
I'll fight you!

151
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,560
Pretty boy, watch carefully.

152
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,270
Today, I'm going to tear up this deed.

153
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,120
How dare you?

154
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,630
Have you asked for my permission
before you bully my husband?

155
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,600
Mr. Ximen told me
not to make it hard for you.

156
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,480
Don't be ungrateful.

157
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,560
Tell these words to Ximen.

158
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,750
You wait here. I'll go get my helpers.

159
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,870
Bluffing.

160
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:28,870
You're so weak.

161
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,020
How did you make it all the way
from Kaifeng to here?

162
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,430
It was very safe the whole way.

163
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,650
It was only after I met you

164
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,520
- that things started going wrong.
- Trinkets!

165
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,240
Candied hawthorns!

166
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,120
- I've saved you twice.
- Come and take a look!

167
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,880
- Don't be ungrateful.
- Little trinkets!

168
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,640
Yes, yes, yes.

169
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,490
(Does the last time even count?)

170
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,450
The bun shop...

171
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,480
My bun shop.

172
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,760
What happened?

173
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,270
Let's report it to the authorities.

174
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,000
Report it? To whom?

175
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,560
They're in cahoots with Ximen.

176
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,040
No way. I'm not done with them.

177
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,370
Wait.

178
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,070
You just said they're in cahoots.

179
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,310
We can't act impulsively.

180
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,150
Let's go home first.

181
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,720
Mr. Ximen, we've investigated that brat.

182
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,720
His name is Gu Ping'an.

183
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,950
He's from Kaifeng.

184
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,330
Gu what?

185
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,340
Gu Ping'an.

186
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,250
(I need to send a letter
to Kaifeng right away.)

187
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,240
This news is very important.

188
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,560
Send out more pigeons.

189
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,680
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

190
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,520
Yes.

191
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,670
Those thugs think they're invincible
with Ximen's protection,

192
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,550
so they're running rampant in Qiantang.

193
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,440
I'll make sure to vent my anger
after this.

194
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,670
I have an idea.

195
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,030
Since your bun shop is gone,

196
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,670
why don't we just open a tavern?

197
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,910
I'll need seven taels of monthly salary.

198
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,840
Five taels.

199
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,710
Eight taels.

200
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,560
Seven taels.

201
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,630
- Ten taels.
- Ten taels it is. It's a deal.

202
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,510
Let's go to the Tongque Tavern tomorrow.

203
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,500
(Tongque Tavern)

204
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,360
Chef Song, please.

205
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,240
Manager Gu, after you.

206
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,480
The furnishings aren't too old,

207
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,480
but they haven't been used
in a long time,

208
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,390
so they're dusty.

209
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,130
We'll need to hire someone
to clean it up.

210
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,480
What do you think?

211
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,080
Are you satisfied with your kitchen?

212
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,840
Yes.

213
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,120
These bowls and chopsticks
are pretty new.

214
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,320
I guess they opened not long ago
and then shut down.

215
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,750
If there's anything you need,
or if something's inconvenient to use,

216
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,080
just let me know,
and I'll take care of it.

217
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,370
Within one tael of silver.

218
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,440
Then let's get started.

219
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,880
Stop.

220
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,630
That was close.

221
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,550
Looks like all of these lanterns

222
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,670
need to be replaced.

223
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,270
When do you want to open?

224
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,840
No rush.

225
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,550
We need to go

226
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,960
to a place first.

227
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,780
(Caidie Resto)

228
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,000
Caidie Resto? What are we doing here?

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,360
Know yourself and your enemy,
and you'll win every battle.

230
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,630
Today, let's check it out.

231
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,480
Let's go.

232
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,390
You ordered all the signature dishes.

233
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,600
You really don't hold back with me, huh?

234
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,200
You didn't go through the proper rituals
before marrying me.

235
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,910
What's wrong with treating me to a meal?

236
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,120
Mr. Ximen.

237
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm not dead yet.

238
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,330
- Mr. Ximen.
- What's going on?

239
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,150
Song Shirui's here at the Caidie Resto.

240
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,550
Really?

241
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,320
That's great.

242
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,200
I knew Shirui had feelings for me.

243
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,480
Let's go. Let's see Shirui.

244
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,120
Her husband is here too.

245
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,360
Mr. Ximen.

246
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,080
My dear guests,

247
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,760
here is your pastry.

248
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,120
Did you order pastry?

249
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,120
The manager knew Miss Song was here,

250
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,550
so he had someone make
our signature Six Treasures:

251
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,840
Empress's Red Date Cakes,

252
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,360
Icy Snow Dumplings,

253
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,440
Sweet Sugar Fruits,

254
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,270
Colorful Phoenix Five-Spice Cakes,

255
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,870
Immortal's Wealthy Pastry,

256
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,840
and Golden Chestnut Cakes.

257
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,840
Miss Song, please enjoy.

258
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,240
These are free, right?

259
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,070
Shirui.

260
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,720
Look.

261
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,120
Why didn't you let me know
you were coming here?

262
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,200
I would've welcomed you personally.

263
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,920
Stay away from me.

264
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,200
Don't be so aloof.

265
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,640
Mr. Ximen, how would you like to drink?

266
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,480
Fill it up.

267
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,320
Got it.

268
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,670
My husband drank too much yesterday,

269
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,940
so I will

270
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,880
drink it for him.

271
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,720
- Wait.
- Wait.

272
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,390
Mr. Ximen,

273
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,150
I'm not here to swear allegiance today.

274
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,510
These three bowls of wine

275
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,550
are for the future opening

276
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,200
of my Tongque Tavern.

277
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,530
Please show your support.

278
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,360
Take your time drinking.

279
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,960
Darling,

280
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,120
let's go.

281
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,960
Mr. Gu,

282
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,970
you've had the food and drunk the wine.

283
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,480
Do you want to leave without paying?

284
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,790
That's not proper, is it?

285
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,630
How much is it?

286
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,030
Eighty taels of silver.

287
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,000
That's so expensive.

288
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,270
Are you robbing us?

289
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,510
This is

290
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,630
one hundred taels.

291
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,870
You don't need to give the extra back.

292
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,320
Darling,

293
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,160
let's go.

294
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,750
My 100 taels.

295
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,320
It's just gone like that.

296
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,110
You didn't seem so heartbroken

297
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,870
when you tossed it to Ximen just now.

298
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,910
That was the startup capital
for my tavern.

299
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,290
My father only left me 200 taels.

300
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,080
- What?
- My money.

301
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,870
You gave away half of it, Gu Ping'an.

302
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,550
I just can't stand him eyeing you.

303
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,960
Why can't you stand it?

304
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,790
Why?

305
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,440
Because I'm your husband now.

306
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:40,620
What are you doing?

307
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,260
Darling.

308
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,960
Tonight,

309
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,350
can you not tie me up to sleep?
