The dishes are ready.

16
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,710
There's more?

17
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,350
Here.

18
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,150
What's this?

19
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,430
I've never seen this before.

20
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,310
This dish was passed down
from my grandma.

21
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,710
It's called Song's Fish Soup.

22
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,560
Was our grandma also a cook?

23
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,580
Even the Emperor loved

24
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,640
Grandma's fish soup.

26
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,910
We're opening the tavern,

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,480
not celebrating the New Year.

28
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,480
Why did you buy
so many red silk ribbons?

29
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,950
When we got married,

30
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,480
there was too much red cloth.

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,460
It's useless to keep it,

32
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,300
so I thought we might as well
hang it all up.

33
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,140
It's festive.

34
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,920
Festive indeed,

35
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,900
but it's also tiring.

36
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,040
Move it a little to the left.

37
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,310
Hurry up. My hands are sore.

38
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,840
We're about to open.

39
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,150
Are you nervous?

40
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,120
What's there to be nervous about?

41
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,710
I'm more excited than anything.

42
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,030
This is the closest
I've ever been to my dream.

43
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,960
Don't worry.

44
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,080
Just wait for me to help you
rake in gold every day.

45
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,200
You're so confident.

46
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,080

I didn't expect Chef Song
to be so impressive.

49
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,430
I wonder who you've arranged for.

50
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,060
How is it?

51
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,280
The person I arranged
is quite impressive, right?

52
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,540
Well...

53
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,600
Will it work?

54
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,080
This is the protector of the chefs,

55

the Jianzhai Bodhisattva.

56
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,080
I made a vow to the Bodhisattva.

57
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,910
I'm willing to exchange my marriage

58
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,710
for Tongque Tavern's success.

59
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,840
You're making such a big bet.

60
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,310
I haven't fallen in love.

61
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,190
I just want to be a chef.

62
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,680
So,

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,240
I scoff at the Yue Lao Temple

64
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,710
but kneel and pray
in the Kitchen God Hall.

65
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,120
Alright, I promise you.

66
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,960
I won't let you down.

67
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,280
Tongque Tavern will surely become
the largest tavern

68
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,430
in all of Jiangnan,

69
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,470
and you'll be the top chef in Qiantang.

70
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,360

72
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,080

Mr. Ximen,

91
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,270
should we teach him a lesson today?

92
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,720
Don't go too far.

93
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,040
Shirui made the dishes.

94
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,800
Let's wait and see.

95
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,070
Song Shirui is now a rival,

96

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,870
Why is it taking so long?

99
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,000
This is too slow.

I think it's troublesome

187
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,390
to run between the tavern

188
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,720
and home every day.

189
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,040
How about

190
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,270
we move into the tavern

191
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,510
and live with them?

192
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,320
It's up to you.

193
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,670
What are you doing?

194
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,840
Staring at the egg fried rice
but not eating it.

195
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,630
Ning Canghai is really something.

196
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,320
I've loved egg fried rice
since I was young.

197
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,510
But the one he made

198
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,720
tastes just like the one
my father used to make

199
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,910
before he passed away.

200
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,600
Now that you mention it,

201
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,000
Ning Canghai really is something.

202
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,030
He can make so many dishes

203
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,440
in just an incense stick of time.

204
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,250
By the way,

205
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,810
I've figured out how to solve
the slow-serving problem.

206
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,120
Our new promotion.

207
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,910
If all the dishes aren't served

208
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,320
within an incense stick of time,

209
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,550
the next dish

210
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,510
will be free.

211
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,390
Sir, cheating doesn't work here.

212
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,320
Pepper fish head. Please enjoy.

213
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,870
Mr. Gu.

214
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,080
How's business been lately?

215
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,960
Thanks to you, Mr. Ximen,

216
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,720
business has been pretty good recently.

217
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,040
Since you're here,

218
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,080
do you want to have a try?

219
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,480
Come on, I'll give you a discount.

220
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,600
I'll pay the original price.

221
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,550
Bring me the best dishes
and the best wine.

222
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,710
Got it.

223
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,710
Cihua.

224
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,720
Bring the best dishes for Mr. Ximen.

225
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,670
Serve the best of what we have.

226
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,630
Got it.

227
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,960
Cihua.

228
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,720
Did you keep track of today's accounts?

229
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,600
There were only a few tables today.
It can't be wrong.

230
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,270
Then why is there

231
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,960
200 wen missing from the account?

232
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,840
200 wen missing? That's a lot.

233
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,390
Who gave this 500-wen Feiqian?

234
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,560
It was from Ximen.

235
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,580
Waiter.

236
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,270
Coming.

237
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,110
I'd like to pay.

238
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,080
His table's total was 800 wen,

239
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,510
but he only had 200 wen in change.

240
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,320
So he gave me two 500-wen Feiqian.

241
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,670
I gave him back 200 wen.

242
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,590
Here.

243
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,320
Then he said he had change

244
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,720
and gave me 300 wen.

245
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,390
I gave him back 500 wen.

246
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,870
That's right.

247
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,110
Cihua.

248
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,910
Is it possible

249
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,480
that the reason he had change later

250
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,910
was because you gave him 200 wen first?

251
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,360
How can he trick me?

252
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,550
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

253
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,600
I'm not good at math.

254
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,150
Why don't you deduct

255
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,910
the 200 wen from my wages?

256
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,080
Deduct?

257
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,390
Forget it.

258
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,320
I was going to give him
a discount anyway.

259
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
But

260
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,970
it looks like we still need
a bookkeeper.
