what are you going to do next?

16
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,080
I'm going to take back
what belongs to me.

Canghai.

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,780
Mr. Gu.

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,180
I haven't been home for too long.

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,130
Let's go to the Gu Residence.

21
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,720
This news is very important.

22
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,910
Send out a few more pigeons.

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,280
Make sure there are no mistakes.

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:22,820
Yes.

25
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,220
By order of Vice Minister Xia,
the Gu family shall be investigated.

26
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,780
Anyone who disobeys will be executed.

27
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,860
Mr. Gu, please.

28
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,900
Ximen Miao,

29
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,920
your days of glory are numbered.

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,660
(Tongque Tavern; Closed Today)

31
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,180
Ladies, can you stop pacing around?

32
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,420
You've been pacing all night.

33
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,740
Then think of something!

34
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,740
You wait here.

35
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,580
I'll go take a look.

36
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,320
Can you go alone?

37
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,160
The guards aren't strict;
it should be fine.

38
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,780
Should we come with you?

39
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,540
No, it's too dangerous for you.

40
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,140
I'm more nimble. I'll go.

41
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,980
No.

42
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,840
Please, I beg you.

43
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,320
Feiyan, wait here.

44
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,820
Stick close behind me; be obedient.

45
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,230
Let's go.

(Qiantang County Yamen)

47
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,980
Thank you, thank you.

48
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,100
That's it?

49
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,700
This is my old friend.

50
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,840
You'll get into the barrel,
and I'll push you out.

51
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,860
Why aren't you getting in?

52
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,600
Have you ever seen
a woman pushing a barrel?

53
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,980
This is urgent. Stop being picky.

54
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,780
Get in the barrel.

55
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,380
Ping'an,

56
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,640
you've been reading it all night.
Eat something.

57
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,540
Leave it there. I can't eat.

58
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,860
How are the preparations going?

59
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,020
The evidence is irrefutable.

60
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,900
I'll return to Qiantang today.

61
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,160
Shirui is still waiting
for me to save her.

62
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,740
Ping'an,

63
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,420
can I ask you something?

64
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,320
When did you fall in love
with Miss Song?

65
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,580
I don't know.

66
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,420
My feelings for Song Shirui

67
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,220
are like a tree that grew quietly.

68
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,100
By the time I noticed it,

69
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,660
it had spread deep roots in my heart.

70
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,220
Alright.

71
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,340
I understand now.

72
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,940
Wanwan,

73
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,500
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,020
As your brother,

75
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,740
I can't give you any response.

76
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,500
Because love

77
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,780
isn't about matching family backgrounds,

78
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,940
or weighing the pros and cons.

79
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,300
I love Song Shirui,
and there is no alternative.

80
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,300
She is my top priority.

81
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,520
A lady doesn't take away
what others love.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,840
Besides, those who admire me

83
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,090
could easily circle Kaifeng three times.

84
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,060
Go back to her now.

85
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,340
You're really kind to me.

86
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,740
Let's search carefully; be quiet.

87
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,280
Shirui.

88
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,740
Shirui.

89
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,860
I'm keeping watch.

90
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,780
Hurry up.

91
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,740
Shirui.

92
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,180
Shirui.

93
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,860
Shirui.

94
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,920
Cihua?

95
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,080
How did you get in?

96
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,180
We just bribed the jailer

97
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,330
and sneaked in

98
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,380
while Mr. Li was away.

99
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,420
Shirui,

100
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,340
you've suffered.

101
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,260
It's fine.

102
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,320
I'm glad you're safe.

103
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,360
How can Mr. Gu

104
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,310
leave without coming back?

105
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,020
Is he really going to get married
in Kaifeng?

106
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,620
He's my husband,

107
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,900
so I have to protect him.

108
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,540
Cihua,

109
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,220
do you remember my recipe book?

110
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,100
Grandma left me a poem.

111
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,140
I've been reciting it
since I was a child.

112
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,460
Chicken, duck, fish, crab,
and shrimp in April.

113
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,700
A pot of warm wine, a stable home.

114
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,580
In this world,
the only thing that matters is

115
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,750
firewood, rice, oil, salt,
sauce, vinegar, and tea.

116
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,220
Grandma always encouraged me

117
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,860
to become an excellent chef.

118
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,460
So, for me,

119
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,700
making every meal well

120
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,100
is the most important thing in life.

121
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,500
I used to think

122
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,540
this was the great hope
Grandma had for me,

123
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,780
which is why I always wanted

124
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,700
to become the top chef in Qiantang.

125
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,970
Only when Gu Ping'an cooked for me

126
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,660
before he left

127
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,180
did I suddenly understand

128
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,500
whether the food was good or not,

129
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,220
besides having wine and dishes,

130
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,580
the most important thing is
having someone to share it with.

131
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,040
This poem talks about a meal,

132
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,020
but it doesn't mention
the people eating it.

133
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,540
So, the poem Grandma gave me

134
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,020
was meant to help me find

135
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,420
someone I love.

136
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,660
We've written a letter to Kaifeng.

137
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,460
Once Mr. Gu knows,

138
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,260
he will surely come to rescue you.

139
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,500
I married Gu Ping'an.

140
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,560
I'm already happy about it.

141
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,820
Let Tongque Tavern end here.

142
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,660
That's enough.

143
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,660
You should all go.

144
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,540
Take care of yourselves.

145
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:17,900
Someone's coming. Go!

146
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,860
Shirui,

147
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,960
you are one of the few people
who's been kind to me.

148
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,580
I will protect you.

149
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,100
Shirui, take care.

150
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,220
Let me see

151
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,140
which two fools

152
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,540
dared to break into my dungeon.

153
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,300
Mr. Yaoji...

154
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,380
Darn it. Get them!

155
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,300
(Xia Mansion)

156
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,500
Thank you, Uncle,
for the imperial decree,

157
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,460
which made my investigation
go so smoothly.

158
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,500
Ping'an, you're too kind.

159
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,780
To clear Qingfeng's name,

160
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,720
I've done my duty
with a clear conscience.

161
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,020
The Emperor has appointed
a Patrol Inspector to go with you.

162
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,540
Take care on your journey.

163
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,460
Thank you, Uncle.

164
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,020
I will send frequent letters

165
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,220
to update you.

166
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,140
Mr. Gu,

167
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,230
it's time to leave.

168
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,180
Bring the people from Tongque Tavern!

169
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,660
Justice!

170
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,020
Kneel!

171
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,260
Shirui, are you okay?

172
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,020
Let me ask you.

173
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,860
Where is Gu Ping'an?

174
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,860
Alright.

175
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,220

176
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,340
