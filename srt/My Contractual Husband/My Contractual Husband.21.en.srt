Food is the foundation of the people.

15
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,700
Three meals a day may seem common,

16
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,140
but we work hard all day,

17
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,200
and it's really just so we can sit down
and enjoy a good meal.

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,190
Isn't that right?

19
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,820
Eating is the most important thing
in this vast world.

20
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,570
But what's more important than eating

21
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,300
is who you're eating with.

22
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,460
Chicken, duck, fish, crab,
and shrimp in April.

23
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,060
A pot of warm wine, a stable home.

24
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,700
In this world,
the only thing that matters is

25
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,060
firewood, rice, oil, salt,
sauce, vinegar, and tea.

26
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,860
She was inspiring me

27
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,780
that if I wanted to be a good chef,

28
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,340
I must consider the stove my home

29
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,740
and make every meal well.

30
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,460
What if I don't make it out?

31
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,340
What will you do?

32
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,540
Then I'll go sell buns
at the gate of the yamen,

33
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,700
so you can

34
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,580
hear my voice every day.

35
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,980
So what?

36
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,420
I won't compromise
and ask the Xia family for help.

37
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,380
Gu Ping'an, are you being childish?

38
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,980
I know your heart is with me.

39
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,260
So what? I can't help you.

40
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,980
If you offend Vice Minister Xia,

41
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,340
who will stand up for you?

42
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,380
Grandma,

43
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,660
I finally understand your intention.

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,660
(Qiantang County Yamen)

45
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,660
Shirui.

46
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,700
What are you doing here?

47
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,580
Don't be nervous.

48
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,180
I'm here to see you.

49
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,660
Look at you.

50
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,780
You've become haggard these days.

51
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,780
Go away.

52
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,500
Shirui,

53
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,220
why can't you face reality?

54
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,300
Your man left you and ran away.

55
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,840
Why are you still thinking about him?

56
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,020
I have an idea.

57
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,620
As long as you marry me,

58
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,460
I'll tell Mr. Li at once

59
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,620
that your marriage
to Gu Ping'an is fake.

60
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,780
At worst, we can

61
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,220
pay the singles tax afterward.

62
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,100
Besides, Gu Ping'an's father is guilty.

63
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,220
It has nothing to do with you, right?

64
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,500
What do you think of this idea?

65
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,500
Don't touch me.

66
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,340
Shirui.

67
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,220
We could also have a fake marriage.

68
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,440
If there are no feelings,
we can develop it.

69
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,510
We can start now.

70
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,540
Pah!

71
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,500
I'd rather live as a widow
for Gu Ping'an

72
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,740
than marry you.

73
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,980
Alright.

74
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,140
Do you think

75
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,580
Shirui will be wronged inside?

76
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,280
With Shirui's personality,

77
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,360
we should be asking
if the jailer would be wronged.

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,660
The jailer is part of the yamen.

79
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,960
She wouldn't dare cause trouble.

80
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,860
Ximen has been inside for so long.

81
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,000
Why hasn't he come out yet?

82
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,820
Should we send a message to Kaifeng?

83
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,500
Someone's coming.

84
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,860
(Qiantang County Yamen)

85
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,100
Mr. Ximen.

86
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,330
Calm down.

87
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,180
Hide, huh?

88
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,040
Mr. Ximen.

89
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,030
Mr. Ximen.

90
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,140
Ximen seems to be in a bad mood.

91
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,500
He must have gone to see Shirui.

92
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,480
That jerk.

93
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,460
Jerk.

94
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,660
(Liu Xiaodao, Cihua)

95
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,700
Mr. Gu, what did the letter say?

96
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,020
Shirui has been imprisoned.

97
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,140
Imprisoned?

98
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,520
How could she be imprisoned?

99
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,050
Mr. Li wanted to arrest me.

100
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,190
When he saw I had left,

101
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,840
he arrested Shirui
to force me to appear.

102
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,300
Despicable.

103
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,670
This...

104
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,000
When has Miss Song
ever suffered in prison?

105
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:46,870
If they can do this,

106
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,780
it means they've set up a trap
in Qiantang,

107
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,700
waiting for me to panic and return,

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,280
so they can catch me.

109
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,940
What should we do now?

110
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,740
Wanwan, take me to see Uncle.

111
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,260
I need him to write a memorial now.

112
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,540
Life is at stake;
this can't be delayed any longer.

113
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,660
Stop.

114
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,740
Miss Song,

115
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,140
where is Gu Ping'an now?

116
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,540
I don't know.

117
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,500
I don't know.

118
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,060
Harder then.

119
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,140
Help Miss Song remember.

120
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,260
Your strength is so weak.

121
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,560
Haven't you eaten?

122
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,340
Since Miss Song is so strong,

123
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,680
then hit her harder.

124
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,780
Swing your arm and hit her.

125
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,020
(Xia Mansion)

126
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,580
(To Gu Ping'an)

127
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,860
Uncle, this is crucial
and involves innocent people.

128
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,180
I earnestly ask for your help.

129
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,740
Ping'an, I've said this is serious.

130
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,580
Uncle,

131
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,020
you and my father grew up together

132
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,240
and served in the same court.

133
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,360
Our families have had
a deep friendship for years.

134
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,020
My father was killed by the sinister,

135
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,380
and his case remains unresolved.

136
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,700
As your childhood friend,

137
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,700
my father died unjustly,

138
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,060
yet you choose not to help.

139
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,020
What will my father think
in the underworld?

140
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,060
Since you refuse to help,

141
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,220
there's no point
in me staying here any longer.

142
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,120
Life is at stake.

143
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,640
I have to go now.

144
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,300
Ping'an, please wait.

145
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,340
Ping'an, it's not
that I don't want to help you.

146
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,300
This case has been unresolved
for so long.

147
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,340
Without evidence or witnesses,
it's hard to investigate.

148
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,860
Uncle,

149
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,900
my father left me this.

150
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,200
(Father: Gu Qingfeng)
It records

151
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,660
all the crimes of the Ximen family.

152
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,800
Now everything is ready.

153
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,020
I just need an imperial decree

154
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,300
to search for evidence.

155
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,340
And I've already found

156
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,420
my father's remains.

157
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,480
There are people in Qiantang
who can testify.

158
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,780
You found Qingfeng's remains?

159
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,940
He was tied with stones

160
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,500
and sank in the river for three years.

161
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,560
If my brothers
hadn't been trying every day,

162
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,420
he might never have resurfaced.

163
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,100
So Qingfeng was...

164
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,100
Ping'an, this case was
concluded hastily back then.

165
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,440
Our colleagues at the time
didn't investigate it deeply.

166
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
I've failed Qingfeng.

167
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,100
I'll submit a petition

168
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,300
to request the Emperor reopen this case.

169
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,640
Thank you, Uncle, for your help.

170
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,060
(Gu Ping'an.)

171
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,100
(Don't come back!)

172
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,380
(Map of Qiantang)

173
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,220
Uncle, my father's remains

174
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,220
were found in the river
outside Fengshan Gate.

175
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,860
There is a dock there.

176
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,100
All passing ships

177
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,180
would pass by and dock there.

178
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,780
Now I understand.

179
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,460
So Qingfeng's ship also sunk there

180
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,300
after the private salt investigation.

181
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,860
Exactly. Take a look at this poem.

182
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,580
Butterflies.

183
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,540
The butterflies in the poem

184
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,060
refer to a local tavern in Qiantang.

185
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,780
It's Caidie Resto.
[*Caidie: butterflies]

186
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,920
I know that place.

187
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,140
It's owned by the Ximen family.

188
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,340
Before Ms. Miao married
into your family,

189
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,900
she was the manager there.

190
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,500
Now, the manager of the resto

191
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,500
is her brother, Ximen Bang.

192
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,700
They've trained a group of assassins

193
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,740
called the Pigeons.

194
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,020
Each Pigeon has

195
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,860
a Yin-Yang Sect mark on them.

196
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,100
Yin-Yang Sect...

197
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,140
Yin-Yang Sect smuggles salt.

198
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,620
They use their skills and connections

199
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,360
to gather large quantities
of private salt

200
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,020
and then sell it at the Fengshan dock.

201
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,140
If anyone discovers it,

202
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,820
they'll eliminate all witnesses
and silence them.

203
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,540
So, this Yin-Yang Sect

204
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,020
is also an assassin organization.

205
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,300
Now I understand.

206
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,750
For the Ximen siblings to operate
on such a large scale,

207
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,460
there must be support
from someone in the court.

208
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,490
You're right, Uncle.

209
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,920
The Prefect of Qiantang, Mr. Li,

210
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,190
is their backer.

211
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,660
The yamen has its rules.

212
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,700
If Gu Ping'an doesn't show up soon,

213
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,060
I have no reason to keep Miss Song
in prison any longer.

214
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,940
Mr. Li, please be patient.

215
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,180
Maybe that brat Gu Ping'an

216
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,540
knows that Song Shirui is fine in jail

217
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,380
and is secretly competing with you.

218
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,420
Are you suggesting...

219
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,860
Let's use that girl to force him out.

220
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,540
(Reports)

221
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,100
Ping'an, rest assured.

222
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,580
I'll go to the Palace to see
the Emperor right away.

223
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,960
Thank you, Uncle.

224
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,540
Father, Ping'an.

225
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,660
You wait for me to return.

226
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,380
You all heard it.

227
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,640
I'm just concerned about you.

228
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,860
Ping'an,

229
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,740
what are you going to do next?

230
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,420
I'm going to take back
what belongs to me.

231
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,080
Canghai.

232
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,260
Mr. Gu.

233
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,680
I haven't been home for too long.

234
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,580
