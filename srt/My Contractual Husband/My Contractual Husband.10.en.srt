Darling, what are you doing?

15
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,730
Gu Ping'an,

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,170
I think you're asking for a beating.

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,700
What makes you say that?

18
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,180
Do you like Feiyan because she's pretty?

19
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,020
Feiyan's beauty
has nothing to do with me.

20
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,900
Her face doesn't belong to my head.

21
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,780
You definitely like her.

22
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,300
Why do you say that?

23
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,870
Why do you always
revolve around her then?

24
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,380
Our main hall is small.

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,260
You care about her.

26
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,220
Our recent business depends on her.

27
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,560
When she was dancing today,

28
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,040
you couldn't take your eyes off her.

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,560
I was not looking at her.

30
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,140
I was looking at her tattoo.

31
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,590
Tattoo?

32
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:26,860
Yes.

33
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,710
I feel like

34
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,260
I've seen the mark

35
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,240
on her chest somewhere,

36
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,940
but I just can't remember where.

37
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,280
Now you're starting to make excuses.

38
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,830
Something's wrong with you.

39
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,860
Nothing's wrong.

40
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,460
- You do.
- I don't.

41
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,070
- You do!
- I really don't.

42
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,390
You do, you do, you do!

43
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,500
I like you.

44
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,090
Say it again.

45
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,510
I said I liked...

46
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,320
Can you wash your face first?

47
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,290
Go on.

48
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,300
I said I liked you.

49
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,900
Though at first,

50
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,540
I really didn't like you.

51
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,260
You were willful, headstrong,

52
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,470
and domineering.

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,430
But after some time with you, I realized

54
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,390
you're actually

55
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,370
a sincere and kind girl.

56
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,170
I don't know when it started,

57
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,080
but I find myself
always thinking of you.

58
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,140
I haven't figured out

59
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,560
how to say this to you,

60
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,700
because I remembered
our gentleman's agreement.

61
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,220
I was also afraid

62
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,470
you only saw me as a brother,

63
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,810
and even more afraid
that once you know I like you,

64
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,720
you'd ignore me.

65
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,140
- How frustrating.
- Are you telling the truth?

66
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,550
Who would lie to you at this point?

67
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,740
I've practiced

68
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,300
this confession for a long time.

69
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,620
Who would have thought
it'd end up being forced out?

70
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,500
But,

71
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,860
since you care so much about me,

72
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,340
does that mean

73
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,460
you like me too?

74
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,380
I've answered you,

75
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,660
but you haven't answered me yet.

Please come in.

101
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,000
At our best, we used to serve

102
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,220
a hundred tables a day.

103
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,580
But Tongque Tavern
has got 120 tables booked.

104
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,500
Mr. Ximen, I just checked.

105
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,060
They're booked to 160 now.

106
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,980
How many?

107
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,020
One hundred and sixty.

108
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,900
A bunch of ignoramuses.

109
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,060
It's just Li Feiyan.

110
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,090
I've seen enough of her at Huaman House.

Yaoji.

112
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,930
I can't stand
how lively Tongque Tavern is.

113
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,040
Do as you please.

114
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,900
Yes, Mr. Ximen.

115
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,420
(Tongque Tavern)

116
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,050
Is this the Yin-Yang Pattern?

117
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,800
Uncle Hai, do you know?

118
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,020
I've heard there is

119
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,820
a very powerful family in Qiantang.

120
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,320
They keep death warriors as assassins.

121
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,790
Their symbol is the Yin-Yang Pattern.

122
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,860
Death warriors?

123
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,860
Every force in the Jianghu

124
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,130
has its own followers.

125
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,090
They use special patterns

126
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,820
as marks to recognize each other.

127
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:48,820
Depending on their rank,

128
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,770
the placement of the pattern varies.

129
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,740
Some are on the sleeves
of their clothes,

130
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,380
and some are on accessories.

131
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,900
Only the lowest-ranked death warriors

132
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,890
will tattoo the pattern on their bodies.

133
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,040
Their masters use this
to recognize their bodies.

134
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,800
When the person dies,
the pattern disappears.

135
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,410
So that's how it is.

136
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,860
But Uncle Hai, how do you know?

137
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,270
I once dealt

138
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,500
with a smuggling gang leader.

139
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,140
Smuggling?

140
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,880
Uncle Hai, I have to go out.

141
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,780
Madam,

142
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,780
the pigeon you released has arrived.

143
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,100
Keep an eye on things.

144
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,340
Don't let any
unnecessary complications arise.

145
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,660
Yes.

146
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,140
The young master isn't efficient.

147
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,900
He couldn't even handle
such a small matter.

148
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,260
Now you have to take care of it.

149
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,640
Mind your own business.

150
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,220
The young master
isn't someone you can criticize.

151
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,460
Sorry, Madam.

152
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,460
Send it out.

153
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,420
Yes.

154
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,150
Come on.

155
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,060
Feiyan,

156
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,880
you've worked hard today.
Have some water.

157
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,790
Mrs. Gu, you're too kind.

158
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,300
Not at all. You just joined us.

159
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,680
I have to take good care of you.

160
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,620
By the way,

161
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,860
don't call me Mrs. Gu anymore.

162
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,860
Just call me Shirui.

163
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,780
Alright, Shirui.

164
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,990
If you ever need anything,
just let me know.

165
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,020
Really?

166
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,760
Then could you teach me
how to do makeup?

167
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,930
Sure, come on.

168
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,280
You have so many rouge and powders.

169
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,720
I usually have some free time,

170
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,250
so I enjoy playing around
with makeup.

171
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,350
I recommend this one.

172
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,450
This powder will make your skin

173
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,860
look like white jade without oil.

174
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,360
This lip balm is great too.

175
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,040
The color is soft and subtle.

176
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,430
It lightens your complexion at once.

177
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,780
It's perfect for someone like you

178
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,340
who likes a light, natural look.

179
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,610
Really? Let me try it.

180
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,910
There's a cockroach in this dish!

181
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,950
Manager!

182
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,100
Call the manager out here!

183
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,580
What's the matter, sir?

184
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,020
What kind of tavern is this?

185
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,450
There's a cockroach in the dish!

186
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,410
Mind your words!

187
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,560
Clearly, you put

188
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,960
these little bugs in yourself!

189
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,830
Arguing with us, huh?

190
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,300
It must be because I haven't exercised
in a while.

191
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,180
Today, you'll see what it's like

192
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,010
when I close the door
and beat the rogues.

193
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,740
You should think about it.

194
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,260
Who's stronger, the three of us

195
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,740
or just you?

196
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,240
Come on, smash away!

197
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,860
Stop!

198
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,320
Who is causing trouble

199
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,340
in Tongque Tavern while I'm here?

200
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,620
Ignore him. Just go ahead!

201
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,610
Cihua, call Mr. Gu back!

202
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,140
If the Yin-Yang Pattern is a tattoo,

203
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,100
and Caidie Resto's symbol
is a butterfly,

204
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,380
then what is located

205
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,760
ten li west of the Yin-Yang Sect?

206
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,580
There must be a smuggling sect.

207
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,740
Could it be the city gate?

208
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,860
Mr. Gu, bad news!

209
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,040
Cihua, what's the emergency?

210
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,800
Even if the tavern gets smashed,
stay calm.

211
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,110
The shop really got smashed.

212
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,420
Who did it?

213
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,410
Hurry!

214
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,950
What happened?

215
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,420
Darling.

216
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,410
Darling.

217
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,850
What's going on, darling?

218
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,790
They brought people
and smashed the tavern.

219
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,490
Canghai and I couldn't stop them.

220
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,450
It's my fault.

221
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,010
I shouldn't have been gone
for so long.

222
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,110
I made you suffer.

223
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,340
I didn't suffer.

224
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,780
But our tavern...

225
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,750
It's fine.

226
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,940
The shop got smashed.

227
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,500
We'll just renovate it again.

228
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,520
How about you?

229
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,420
Are you hurt anywhere?

230
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,700
Should we go to the clinic?

231
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,570
I'm fine.

232
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,060
That's good.

233
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,000
I'll take care of the rest.

234
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:19,970
Don't worry.

235
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,120
Feiyan,

236
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,780
are you alright? Did you get scared?

237
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,250
Mr. Gu, I'm fine.

238
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,820
But Uncle Hai...

239
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,350
