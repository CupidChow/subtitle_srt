I'm a businessman.

16
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,950
I just need a favor from you.

17
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:59,980
I'm coming in.

18
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:00,980
Come in.

19
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,100
Where are you?

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,740
Well.

21
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,820
A little

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,740
further forward.

23
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,410
- Here?
- Right.

24
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,120
Where exactly?

25
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,740
Here?

26
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,700
No.

27
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,640
Not here.

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,540
Go back.

29
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,900
Right.

30
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,160
Yes.

31
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,060
Right.

32
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,500
Come forward.

33
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,660
Here?

34
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,060
Can I take off this stupid eye mask?

35
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,780
Of course not.

36
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,180
Men and women are different.

37
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,540
Don't look around.

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,350
There are so many rules.

39
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,170
Wait, wait.

40
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,460
Alright, enough.

41
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,540
- Then I'll go.
- Wait.

42
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,300
Since you're already here,

43
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,140
how about

44
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,380
you help me scrub my back?

45
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,980
Can you stop treating me like your maid?

46
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,220
Aren't I not supposed to look?

47
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,180
I've been working all day.

48
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,140
My arms are so sore
that I can't even lift them.

49
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,700
Can't you give me a little reward?

50
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,220
By the way,

51
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,580
are you really engaged to a young lady

52
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,830
in Kaifeng?

53
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,900
If I tell everyone you are my husband,

54
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,740
and you run off, what should I do?

55
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,020
Don't act like a rogue.

56
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,700
I'm engaged.

57
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,820
How can I marry you?

58
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,780
We've been childhood sweethearts.

59
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,940
We are engaged,

60
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,900
but I...

61
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,980
Why are you asking about this?

62
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,980
Just curious.

63
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,740
What if one day you get successful,

64
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,580
leave me behind,

65
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,300
and go back to marry your young lady?

66
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,300
At that point,

67
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,420
our fake engagement

68
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,000
might have already been annulled, right?

69
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,300
Why should you care who I marry?

70
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,620
I just need

71
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,780
a favor from you.

72
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,740
Gather intel at Tongque Tavern for me,

73
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,260
and I'll settle
your 500 taels of silver.

74
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,620
No way.

75
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,740
You despicable man.

76
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,740
Come at me if you dare.

77
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,300
- Don't harm the kids.
- Liu Xiaodao.

78
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,820
These kids' lives

79
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,060
are all in your hands.

80
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,060
Wait a second.

81
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,740
You're not really

82
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,660
falling for me, are you?

83
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,100
Fall for you?

84
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,140
How could that be?

85
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,340
I'm going to be
the top chef in Qiantang.

86
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,520
Yes.

87
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,060
The top chef in Qiantang.

88
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,340
Who can make sure you will be?

89
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,420
Are you asking for a fight?

90
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,220
Annoying.

91
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,580
Looking for a fight, huh?

92
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,300

How can you be so careless?

120
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,700
There's so much stuff in the kitchen,

especially knives.

You're not allowed in the kitchen

00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,020

No.

Just blow on it again.

131
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,460

133

they'd think we were misbehaving.

140
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,100
I'll disappear.

141
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,700
Carry on.

142
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,600
Blow on it again.

143
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,420
I think it's already swollen.
Can you take a look?

All kinds of people are there.

153
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,140
I'm afraid...

154
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,400
I can fight.
Are you looking down on me?

155
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,420
No.

156
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,120
Let's go.

157
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,450
- Let's go.
- Okay.

158
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,620
There's plenty of food. You all eat up.

159
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,700
Eat that one. It's good.

160
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,420
- I'll have this one.
- Eat more to grow taller.

161
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,660
- Got it?
- Miss, you eat.

162
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,380
(Why do you refuse people
to call you "Young lady"?)

163
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,620
(You wouldn't understand.)

164
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,300
(For a girl to stand her ground
is not easy.)

165
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,180
(Life must be very hard for you.)

166
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,060
(I used to roam everywhere.)

167
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,200
(I had to pretend to be a boy
just to make a living.)

168
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,020
(But the life was still carefree.)

169
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,660
- Come on.
- Xiaodao.

170
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,980
I treat you all so well.

171
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,500
What should you say to me?

172
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,220
Thank you, Mrs. Liu.

173
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,050
You can't catch me.

174
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,110
Don't catch me.

175
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,690
- Careful. Slow down.
- I'm chasing you.

176
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,160
I... this...

177
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,000
Slow down.

Madam,

180
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,740
a letter says they've moved
against Tongque Tavern.

181
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,380
Gu Ping'an wants to open
a tavern in Qiantang.

182
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,540
It won't be so easy.

183
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,100
(Tongque Tavern)

184
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,300
Business seems
to have dropped a lot recently.

185

Yes.

186
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,140
Compared to days ago,

187
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,220
there are more than half fewer guests.

188
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,180
The repeat customers
aren't coming either.

189
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,020
Before,

190
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,040
Mr. Wang and Mr. Li

191
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,180
were practically treating our place
like a cafeteria.

192
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,540
But these days, they never showed up.

193
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,300
Cihua,

194
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,420
I have a task for you.

195
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,540
Go check out
what Caidie Resto is up to lately.

196
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,380
Is the culprit so obvious now?

197
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,300
(Ledger)

198
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,500
In Qiantang,
only he wants us to close down.

199
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,020
What do you think?

200
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,420
I'm leaving.

201
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,500
Miss,

202
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,740
do you want tickets?

203
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,500
What tickets?

204
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,940
Caidie Resto.

205
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,140
Song's Fish Soup.

206
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,340
Song's Fish Soup?

207
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,180
Yes.

208
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,700
It's been popular recently.

209
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,420
According to the rules,

210
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,100
you need a ticket to get the food.

211
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,130
However,

212
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,780
I can get it directly.

213
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,460
Get it directly?

214
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,820
Let me take a look.

215
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,100
Here, take a look.

216
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,780
(Song's Fish Soup, 50 wen per serving)

217
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,420
Here's the money.

218
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,220
One hundred and fifty wen.

219
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,040
This is good enough.

220
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,180
Do you believe I'll hit you?

221
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,050
What's wrong with you?

222
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:02,890
Shut up.

223
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,300
It's so similar.

224
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,460
Not only similar.

225
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,140
It's exactly the same.

226
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,620
Shirui.

227
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,940
It's exactly the same.

228
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,380
This is exactly like the fish soup
my grandma made.

229
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,780
Impossible.

230
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,780
No one in the world

231
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,580
besides me can make this taste.

232
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,020
Do you

233
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,240
and Ximen Bang share a grandma?

234
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,180
Speak nicely or shut up.

235
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,980
They clearly stole our recipe.

236
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,540
Let's go, Cihua.

237
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,660
It's time to have a proper talk

238
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,220
with Mr. Ximen.

239
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,780
Don't worry.

240
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,900
Even if Gu Ping'an comes to me,

241
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,300
I won't sell you out.

242
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,060
(Caidie Resto)

243
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,910
Mr. Gu, a rare guest.

244
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,780
You ordered Song's Fish Soup. Try it.

245
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,900
Far worse than the one my wife made.

246
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,140
Gu Ping'an,

247
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,900
you can lie to me,

248
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,100
but don't end up lying to yourself.

249
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,430
Mr. Gu, what does he mean?

250
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,740
The recipe is the same,

251
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,620
but the cook is different,

252
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,780
so the taste is different.

253
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,180
He's jealous of me.

254
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,940
Let's go, Cihua.

255
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,990
Let's go home and drink
our own Song's Fish Soup.

256
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,220
You're jealous of him.

257
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,140
You're jealous of him.

258
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,080
