to pretend to be married.

34
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,010
how about we hold
another grand wedding?

35
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,520
Why?

36
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,130
To marry you properly.

37
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,550
There must be a traditional ritual,

38
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,320
and you must wear
a bridal crown and veil.

39
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,590
I want to openly

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,360
and grandly marry you.

(Qiantang News)
Hello, fellow villagers and elders.

42
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,710
Welcome to today's Qiantang News.

43
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,660
Recently,

44
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,990
the notorious gang Yin-Yang Sect

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,530
(Caidie Resto)
in the Jiangnan region,

46
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,500
(Ximen Mansion)
has been uprooted with the help

47
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,270
of the kind people.

48
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,270
The Ximen siblings have been captured.

49
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,610
(Tongque Tavern)
Time for the interview from the scene.

50
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,700
Thank Mr. Xia and Mr. Zhou
for their full support

51
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,210
(Xia Mansion)
in eradicating the Yin-Yang Sect.

52
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,690
I also owe our gratitude
to our families for their trust.

53
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,310
And of course, I must thank my wife.

54
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,080
We're responsible for helping

55
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,360
bring justice

56
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,750
to the people of Qiantang.

57
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,590
We're united and unstoppable!

58
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,000
I believe I played a crucial role
in this operation.

59
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,300
What about me?
I even broke into the prison!

60
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,400
Don't make me talk
about your slot barrel.

61
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,550
Enough of the arguing.

62
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,960
It was I who protected them.

63
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
Don't listen to him.

64
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,480
- It was me!
- Nonsense!

65
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,030
It was me! It was me!

66
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,960
Let's get back.

67
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,310
(Qiantang County Yamen)
After the Yin-Yang Sect is gone,

68
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,590
the people of Qiantang now have

69
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,910
a cleaner business environment.

70
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,670
Also,

71
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,620
a few individuals have attempted
to evade taxes

72
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,780
(Gu Ping'an, Song Shirui)
by pretending to be married.

73
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,710
But they've admitted their mistake,

74
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,940
paid the taxes owed,

75
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,960
and accepted the punishment.

76
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,740
This has been recognized and praised
by the new Prefect Xu.

77
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,670
We hope this serves
as a lesson to everyone.

78
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,620
Do not rely on luck

79
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,060
and be diligent about paying

80
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,940

81
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,040
The yamen will
further introduce policies

82
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,530
to help single youths in Qiantang

83
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,880
with marriage matters.
