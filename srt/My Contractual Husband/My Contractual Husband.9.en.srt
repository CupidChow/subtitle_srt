Sir, are you okay?

I'm fine.

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,660
She tried to kill herself.

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,710
She doesn't want to go with you.

19
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,040
Why insist on forcing her?

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,320
Sir.

22
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,120
Isn't that a bit too nosy?

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,840
Nosy?

24
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,590
Life is at stake. It's no joke.

25
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,950
Why don't you just pay
to redeem her?

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,230
Fine. How much is it?

27
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,790
Fifty taels?

28
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,870
Five hundred taels.

29
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,790
This jade pendant is worth
over 500 taels.

30
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,280
She no longer belongs to you.

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,230
Alright.

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,040
Let's go.

33
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,220
Miss, I've heard
about your heroic deeds.

34
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,900
You're like the Du Qiuniang of Qiantang.

35
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,820
Go away.

36
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,100
Don't use metaphors like that.

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,540
Didn't you say

38
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,780
he bought me rouge and powder?

39
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,460
Why did he bring a girl back?

40
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,740
I don't understand either.

41
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,820
Is Mr. Gu

42
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,500
going to take a concubine?

43
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,580
He wouldn't dare.

44
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,860
But he gave her
the most expensive jade pendant.

45
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,860
What does that mean?

46
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,900
What else does that mean?

47
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,700
Miss Feiyan,

48
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,390
why don't you stay here and help out?

49
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,230
Alright.

50
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,300
Mr. Gu, what do you think?

51
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,460
I think it's good.

52
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,640
But the monthly salary
might be a little less.

53
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,780
One tael.

54
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,630
Alright.

55
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,390
Thanks, Mr. Gu.

56
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,900
- Thanks, Mrs. Gu.
- You're welcome.

57
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,180
Thanks, Mr. Gu.

58
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,340
Thanks, Mrs. Gu.

59
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,660
I didn't expect you to agree so readily

60
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,420
to let Feiyan stay.

61
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,370
You really are a true

62
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,130
heroine.

63
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,220
You brought her back.

64
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,380
And she's just a woman,

65
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,530
isolated and helpless
after leaving the brothel.

66
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,470
What else could she do?

67
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,700
Right, you're absolutely right.

68
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,900
And you brought her back,

69
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,940
so you can't just leave her be.

70
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,180
That's right.

71
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,220
You're absolutely right.

72
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,420
I even lost the jade pendant.

73
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,560
That pendant grew up with me.

74
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,620
I was reluctant to part with it.

75
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,140
Of course.

76
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,380
You're usually so stingy,

77
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,220
but today you were so generous.

78
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,300
Well,

79
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,660
she's about to die for it.

80
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,540
Are you angry now?

81
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,780
No.

82
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,660
You're definitely angry.

83
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,260
No.

84
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,000
You're angry. You're really angry.

85
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,920
Are you going to sleep?

86
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,130
If not, go out.

87
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,820
I'm sleeping.

88
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,780
(Tongque Tavern)

89
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,980
Mr. Gu, I'd like to pay.

90
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,140
Coming.

91
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,700
Take care, sir.

92
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,060
Ping'an.

93
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,500
Come here.

94
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,660
Let me pour you some tea.

95
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,860
Ping'an, have some water.

96
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,220
Thanks.

97
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,320
I'll do it myself.

98
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,220
It's fine. Let me.

99
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,660
I'll do it myself.

100
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,460
It's fine, really.

101
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,820
I'll do it myself.

102
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,530
Mrs. Gu,

103
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,830
how about some tea for you too?

104
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,520
I can see you're about to die of thirst.

105
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,560
- Here.
- Mr. Gu.

106
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,700
Caidie Resto has invited
the best opera troupe

107
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,950
to set up a stage,

108
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,140
offering free performances

109
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,610
with music and magic.

110
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,660
- It's lively.
- Really?

111
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,980
You have to pay.

112
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,340
Hey, you have to pay.

113
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,580
Is this a new strategy
to eat without paying?

114
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,800
Cihua,

115
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,980
can you speak more quietly

116
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,140
about such things next time?

117
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,310
They left. Our money!

118
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,200
Mr. Ximen,

119
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,780
your sister sent a letter
saying the pigeon has been released.

120
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,660
Did she mention the pigeon's
real identity in the letter?

121
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,060
Not a word.

122
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,260
It seems
she still doesn't trust me enough.

123
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,510
Maybe she has her own plans.

124
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,700
Keep a close eye on things for me.

125
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,580
Understood.

126
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,880
An opera troupe?

127
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,550
Ximen is really going all out
to steal business.

128
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,570
I wondered
why he's been quiet these days.

129
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,460
Turns out he's been hiding a big move.

130
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,300
Don't rush.

131
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,440
We can't perform art, but we can fight.

132
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,510
They'll sing and perform,

133
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,590
while we'll use knives and sticks.

134
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,320
Right.

135
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,360
You can start with breaking stones
on your chest.

136
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,780
Let me ask.

137
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,500
Who's going to break the stones?

138
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:09,710
You.

139
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,840
With your strong physique,

140
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,900
it would be a waste
not to use it to break stones.

141
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,980
Why does it have to be me?

142
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,840
Why don't you do it?

143
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,460
I still want to live a few more years.

144
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,300
We still need to come up with a show.

145
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,350
Let's vote.

146
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,740
Who agrees with Canghai
breaking stones on his chest?

147
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,900
Raise your hand.

148
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,070
No, no, no.

149
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,280
Wait, wait.

150
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,540
Shirui...

151
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,700
She can cut watermelons
with a flying knife.

152
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,630
I'll do it
after your stone-breaking act.

153
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,220
You can hold the watermelon.

154
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,260
Right, we have a professional here.

155
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,100
Who?

156
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,540
Alright.

157
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,340
If it's Ping'an asking,

158
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,740
I can give it a try.

159
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,620
Good.

160
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,420
- If it's Ping'an asking,
- Then get ready.

161
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,270
I can give it a try.

162
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,130
You'll dance tomorrow.

163
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,740
Cihua, go.

164
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,230
Put up a sign outside.

165
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,820
Why is it me again?

166

(Qiantang's Top,

167

175

the tavern has gotten much livelier.

- Good.
- Good.

178
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,020
I'm talking to you.

179
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,300
You're really engrossed.

180
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,660
Sorry, sorry.

181
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,100
I got lost in thought for a moment.

182
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,080

183
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,080
- Good.
- Good.

184
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,260
Forget it.

185
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,860
Tell me. What is it?

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,920
Look how well she dances.

188
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,500
If I were Mr. Gu,

189
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,740
I'd like her too.

190
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,890
You...

191
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,090
- You should dress up.
- Good.

192
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,980
After all, you are what you wear.

193
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,320
You...

194
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,310
Men really can't be trusted.

195
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,340
When they see a pretty girl,

196
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,630
they forget who they are.

197
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,990
No wonder he suddenly wanted
to give me a gift.

198
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,750
He thinks I look ugly without makeup.

199
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,430
This time, I'll wear heavy makeup

200
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,310
and stun everyone.

202
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,370
Feiyan,
you still have to dance these days.

203
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,630
Once our business stabilizes,

204
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,850
and things are going better,

205
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,210
you won't have to dance every day.

206
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,620
Just dance on the first and 15th.

207
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,130
Alright, as long as you need me,

208
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,310
I'll do it anytime.

209
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,020
What's wrong with you?

210
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,050
Gu Ping'an.

211
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,210
A ghost!

212
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,910
Darling, what are you doing?

213
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,020
Gu Ping'an,

214
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,100
I think you're asking for a beating.
