=A Trial Brings Unexpected Guests=

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,120
Everyone,

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,520
we're quite prominent in Qiantang.

16
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,600
I never imagined

17
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,200
we would face a sugar crisis.

18
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,880
Time to pool our ideas.

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,000
Come on, use your brains.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We need to come up with a detailed plan

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,230
that helps Shirui turn the tide

22
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,150
and solves the sugar problem.

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,430
Whoever has an idea will get a raise.

24
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,760
If you ask me,

25
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,400
we have nothing to lose.

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,680
Why not go to Caidie Resto
and steal their sugar?

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,840
Agree.

28
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,270
- Me too.
- Me too!

29
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,590
What's happening, everyone?

30
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,640
Working together to pool our ideas.

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,550
You're working together,
but where is your idea?

32
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,560
Be civilized, everyone.

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,280
If we lose, we go to the physician;
if we win, we go to the yamen.

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,590
Don't you understand that?

35
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,150
I think we should just close for now.

36
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,310
I'll go find some sugar.

37
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,430
Once I've got the sugar,

38
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,400
we can reopen.

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,870
Did you forget?

40
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,870
We have another chef here.

41
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,700
(Tongque Tavern)

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,040
Sir, your spicy lamb slices.

43
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,190
Good.

44
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,950
Your Longjing shrimp with pepper.

45
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,310
Ginger chicken.

46
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,360
Please enjoy.

47
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,000
Waiter, why is every dish here so spicy?

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,240
It tastes good,

49
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,430
but it's burning me alive.

50
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,360
When did you change your style?

51
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,470
Sir, you may not know.

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,900
We've had a new healthy menu
for spring and summer.

53
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,810
As the saying goes,

54
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,750
eating spicy food in spring and summer
helps with sweating and digestion.

55
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,190
Our food is healthy

56
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,520
and nourishing.

57
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,280
One tael of silver.

58
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,000
Xiaodao.

59
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,550
It's for that table.

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,840
Sure.

61
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,500
(Tongque Tavern)

62
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,360
First, our recipe was stolen,

63
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,960
and then the sugar sold out.

64
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,810
Ximen is playing a big game here.

65
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,290
If monopolizing sugar

66
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,630
was to stop us from operating,

67
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,760
why did they steal our recipe?

68
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,790
Guess what we need.

69
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,750
What?

70
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,540
(Bafang Gambling House)

71
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,400
Evidence.

72
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,590
Mr. Ximen,

73
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,560
according to reliable sources,

74
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,960
Song Shirui
and Gu Ping'an's marriage is fake.

75
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,870
Just as I suspected,

76
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,080
Shirui would never marry that scoundrel.

77
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,210
Yaoji, let's go find Mr. Zhao.

78
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,050
Yes.

79
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,020
(Inevitable Success)

80
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,920
Madam,

81
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,470
we've gained preliminary control
of Tongque Tavern.

82
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,310
I knew it.

83
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,030
He walked right into our trap.

84
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
A month ago,

85
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,960
you were listed

86
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,500
in every gambling house in Qiantang,

87
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,800
but one day,

88
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,280
you lost all your capital

89
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,910
and racked up huge debts.

90
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,910
You were supposed
to lose one of your hands.

91
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,630
But somehow, in one night,

92
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,590
you paid off all your debts.

93
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,400
Tell us. How did you manage that?

94
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,520
Xiaodao,

95
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,920
if you have any trouble,

96
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,240
you can tell us.

97
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,040
Mr. Gu,

98
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,830
I had no choice.

99
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,630
Ximen...

100
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,360
He used the kids to blackmail me.

101
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,270
If I didn't tip him off,

102
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,430
and with my past debts,

103
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,680
nothing would be left
at the Refugee Camp.

104
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,520
I deserve to die.

105
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,720
I really deserve to die.

106
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,390
I really deserve to die.

107
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,430
Mr. Gu,

108
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,870
I deeply regret it now.

109
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,630
I'm disloyal. Punish me.

110
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,630
Xiaodao,

111
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,430
you're a good kid,

112
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,680
but you handled this poorly.

113
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,120
If Ximen can help with your debts,

114
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,390
why can't Mr. Gu help you?

115
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,560
Why don't you trust us?

116
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,560
I really was wrong.

117
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,240
I've betrayed your trust.

118
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,600
Please, give me another chance.

119
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,070
Xiaodao,

120
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,270
the most important thing
in life is trust.

121
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,040
Once trust is broken,
it's hard to rebuild.

122
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,720
The tavern has suffered a huge loss.

123
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,750
As your friend,

124
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,830
I understand that you were

125
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,560
forced to do that.

126
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,240
However,

127
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,870
as your manager,

128
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,600
I won't trust a traitor again.

129
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,680
The recipe is
extremely important to Shirui.

130
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,510
I must protect her bottom line.

131
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,670
So...

132
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,480
In the middle of the night,

133
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,750
what's going on at Tongque Tavern?

134
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,520
Mr. Zhao.

135
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,030
Sorry.

136
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,390
The shop is closed
for the day at this hour.

137
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,630
Where's your wife?

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,070
She's in the kitchen.

139
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,070
I'm already married.

140
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,480
Who's still coming to find me?

141
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,320
Shirui.

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,360
I knew it was you. You're up to no good.

143
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,630
How could it be?

144
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,200
Mr. Zhao,

145
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,070
may I ask what you want

146
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,040
with us?

147
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,950
Someone reported

148
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,000
that you two aren't really married.

149
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,560
Please come with us.

150
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,950
Aren't really married?

151
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,830
I don't know

152
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,800
who is spreading such rumors

153
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,390
behind the scenes.

154
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,230
Call him out.

155
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,680
I want to confront him face to face.

156
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,360
Isn't the answer obvious enough?

157
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,020
Since you're a real couple,

158
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,500
there must be evidence, right?

159
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,820
What? Evidence?

160
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,180
Nowadays, a real couple needs
to prove they're married?

161
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,220
But I do have

162
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,580
some evidence.

163
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,260
Please wait.

164
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,140
Sorry to keep you waiting.

165
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,900
This is

166
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,340
my darling's bloodstain

167
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,980
from our wedding night.

168
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,580
It hasn't been washed off.

169
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,340
Why don't you check it?

170
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,060
This is indecent.

171
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,900
Fine, I'll check it.

172
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,400
- In that case,
- Please check.

173
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,060
we'll leave now. No more interruptions.

174
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,180
Mr. Zhao, I don't believe it.
I think this is fake.

175
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,440
- No more checking?
- Let's go.

176
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,500
- Why pull me?
- Let's go.

177
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,340
You're not checking?

178
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,500
Please take care.

179
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,060
- Mr. Ximen.
- Welcome to dine here.

180
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,900
Mr. Ximen.

181
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,620
Darling,

182
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,260
this is just a white cloth
with a few drops

183
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,780
of pig's blood on it.

184
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,500
Gu Ping'an!

185
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,660
Next time you use this trick,

186
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,460
can you discuss it with me first?

187
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,820
I acted in haste.

188
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,180
I was wrong.

189
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,500
What did you say?

190
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,180
- I was wrong.
- What did you say?

191
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,060
I was wrong.

192
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,540
Where's Xiaodao?

193
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,500
Mr. Gu.

194
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,820
Mr. Gu, Mrs. Gu.

195
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,420
Uncle Hai, Cihua.

196
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,220
I'm sorry.

197
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,900
I'm very fortunate

198
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,420
to meet you all.

199
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,220
Ximen bribed sugar merchants
to cause our sugar crisis.

200
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,500
I've recently found

201
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,900
a way to make sugar from beets.

202
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,780
Now, I'm sharing it with you.

203
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,620
I don't expect anyone's forgiveness.

204
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,180
I only hope to make up for my mistakes.

205
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,100
Liu Xiaodao.

206
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,340
Speak up.

207
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,620
Mr. Zhao.

208
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,860
What do you mean?

209
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,820
How can you believe Gu Ping'an's

210
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,220
obvious tricks just now?

211
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,660
Of course, I don't believe it.

212
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,660
Here's the plan: You go in with me,

213
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,820
and we'll expose them.

214
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,260
Mr. Ximen,

215
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,980
please calm down.

216
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,300
Mr. Gu is risking going to prison

217
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,660
to act this out.

218
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,940
Miss Song

219
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,180
is also risking her reputation

220
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,340
to play along with him.

221
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,740
How could they not have real feelings
for each other?

222
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,060
In my opinion,

223
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,940
it's hard to tell if their marriage
is real or fake,

224
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,950
but their affection
for each other is genuine.

225
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,660
Think it over.

226
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,440
Goodbye.

227
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,780
Mutual affection, huh?

228
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,980
I'll make them regret it.

229
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,300
Let's go.

230
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,940
Have you fallen asleep?

231
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,790
My back hurts.

232
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,980
Let me massage it for you.

233
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,100
Then I'll trouble Chef Song.

234
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,900
Wait a moment.

235
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,260
You have to be gentle.

236
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,940
I'm not your dough for making buns.

237
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,020
I'm top-notch at this.

238
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,100
You don't believe me?

239
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,080
It's because I trust you so much

240
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,920
that I'm afraid.

241
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,220
Afraid of what?

242
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,820
Wait.

243
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,940
Stop tickling me.

244
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,020
It tickles.

245
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,620
Are you doing this on purpose?

246
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,820
Doing this on purpose?

247
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,990
You're doing it on purpose.

248
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,080
You're doing it on purpose.

249
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,260
I'm doing it on purpose.
