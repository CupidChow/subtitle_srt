Gu Ping'an!

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,280
Arrogant, huh?

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,520
Acting high and mighty, huh?

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,000
Smiling smugly, huh?

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,840
Get lost.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,230
I've figured it out.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Mr. Gu, you pretended to be angry

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,840
to make Ximen
let his guard down, right?

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,880
Yes.

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,740
But my anger was real.

25
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,030
Our signature dish was stolen after all.

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,640
No.

27
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,760
What angers me is

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,400
that Song Shirui's family recipe

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,350
was stolen.

30
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,300
I have to get revenge for your mistress.

31
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,650
Mr. Gu,

32
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,140
you really like Mrs. Gu, don't you?

33
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,100
I like Song Shirui?

34
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,890
How did you figure that out?

35
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,860
You're stammering.

36
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,760
I... I...

37
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,400
I've always spoken like this.

38
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,700
(Ximen Mansion)

39
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,500
(Ximen Bang)

40
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,870
Shirui, my love.
A day without you is like three years.

41
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,710
Mr. Ximen.

42
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,950
Go and deliver this love letter
to Shirui.

43
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,910
Yes.

44
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,680
But, Mr. Ximen,

45
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,350
the first 18 letters this month

46
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,840
have been returned

47
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,000
unopened.

48
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,400
Do as I say.

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,680
Why so many questions?

50
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,590
Yes.

51
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,080
Mr. Ximen, may I ask

52
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,870
what's so special about Song Shirui?

53
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,360
If you want something new,

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,870
plenty of girls in Qiantang

55
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,280
would love to be your concubine.

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,710
Shirui is different from all other women

57
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,680
in the world.

58
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,800
It was a clear afternoon,

59
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,030
and you were there too.

60
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,750
Come back. Come with me.

61
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,630
Please let me go.

62
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,800
- Come with me.
- I promise I won't tell anyone.

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,000
It's not up to you. Hurry up.

64
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,710
Please spare me, sir.

65
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,680
Come with me.

66
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,960
We have your slave deed.

67
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,120
Leave her alone.

68
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,440
You can't afford to meddle in it.

69
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,280
Kidnapping a girl in broad daylight?

70
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,960
This is my business.

71
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,800
Listen up.

72
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,590
She sneaked

73
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,190
out of our master's room.

74
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,240
What's that to do with you?

75
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,560
Didn't you see she didn't want
to go back with you?

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,000
Our master bought her.

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,190
Who do you think you are,
meddling in this?

78
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,080
Show respect to this lady.

79
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,360
Step back.

80
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,200
Yes.

81
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,520
Alright.

82
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,080
I can let this lady go,

83
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,360
but you have to come back with me.

84
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,870
Mr. Ximen, does it hurt?

85
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,150
What a strong slap.

86
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,750
Seems I haven't shown
enough sincerity.

87
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,520
How about this?

88
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,080
To show my sincerity,

89
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,470
let me introduce myself.

90
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,000
My name is Xi...

91
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
Let me tell...

92
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:04,990
Go away.

93
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,960
Naughty.

94
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,680
I can let this lady leave with you,

95
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,270
and I'll return her slave deed to her.

96
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,830
May I ask if I could, in exchange,

97
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,800
get your contact info?

98
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,350
Glad you're smart. Let's go.

99
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,390
Everyone, go home. Bye-bye.

100
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,510
So spicy. I like it.

101
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,750
Canghai.

102
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,730
Where's the mistress?

103
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,420
Xiaodao.

104
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,920
You're back.

105
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,360
This recipe was my grandma's hard work.
She passed it down to me.

106
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,310
Chicken, duck, fish, crab,
and shrimp in April.

107
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,870
A pot of warm wine, a stable home.

108
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,600
In this world,
the only thing that matters is

109
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,190
firewood, rice, oil, salt,
sauce, vinegar, and tea.

110
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,950
Since the fish soup is so famous,

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,830
and you come from a family of chefs,

112
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,870
why have you ended up like this?

113
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,800
My family once lived a carefree life,

114
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,310
but after a big fire,

115
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,310
it was just me and this recipe.

116
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,920
Everything else is gone.

117
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,400
What are you doing here?

118
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,600
Didn't I tell you not to come
into the kitchen?

119
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,150
Are you crying?

120
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,070
No.

121
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,420
If you want to cry,

122
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,940
go ahead.

123
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,940
My recipe was stolen.

124
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,820
What's wrong with crying for a while?

125
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,700
Who would've thought

126
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,460
the usually competitive,
fearless Chef Song

127
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,220
would have a slip-up?

128
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,700
You...

129
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,060
You're making fun of me.

130
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,360
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,220
Are these snacks from Tasty Pastry?

132
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,100
Of course.

133
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,020
My wife deserves the best
in all of Qiantang.

134
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,020
Don't worry about Caidie Resto.

135
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,300
I will definitely get justice for you.

136
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,020
I'll let everyone know

137
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,500
that anyone who bullies Song Shirui

138
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,820
won't end up well.

139
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,540
Darling, you're so nice.

140
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,740
Heroine,

141
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,060
please go easy on me.

142
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,540
I can't breathe.

143
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,380
I...

144
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:13,980
Well...

145
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,220
Have you found the person
who stole the recipe?

146
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,420
(Ximen Mansion)

147
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,430
Shirui,

148
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,900
look at this.

149
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,130
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

150
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,280
Mr. Ximen,

151
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,820
I came today

152
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,860
to specifically thank you.

153
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,780
Thank me?

154
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,360
Did the sun rise from the west?

155
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,740
Caidie Resto's fish soup

156
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,710
has helped us receive unanimous praise.

157
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,300
Exactly.

158
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,140
I'm here to formally apologize

159
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,620
for my rude attitude yesterday.

160
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,980
Here.

161
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,240
A small gift.

162
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,620
It's nothing. Please accept it.

163
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,820
Your great deed today

164
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,740
is truly admirable.

165
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,100
Mr. Ximen, about that recipe...

166
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,260
I knew it.

167
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,540
It must have been
that unreliable gambler.

168
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,410
Mr. Ximen,

169
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,210
you must have a lot going on at home.

170
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,490
We've delivered the gift,

171
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,570
so we won't disturb you.

172
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,650
We'll take our leave now.

173
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,090
Let's go, Darling.

174
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,370
Mr. Ximen, have we been tricked?

175
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,770
Go.

176
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,770
Bring Manager Tang to me.

177
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,330
Yes.

178
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:49,850
Mr. Gu,

179
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,690
I've run to eight different sugar shops.

180
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,530
Not one of them is selling sugar.

181
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,920
Sugar isn't something rare.

182
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,260
Why is there none left
in Qiantang overnight?

183
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,410
Look around.

184
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,890
Those who sell candied hawthorns

185
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,850
or blow sugar figures
on this street are all gone.

186
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:07,810
What does that mean?

187
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,130
They don't have sugar either.

188
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,230
It means they don't want anyone else
to buy sugar.

189
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,410
What should we do?

190
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,170
We need sugar to cook our dishes.

191
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,170
Let's go home

192
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,250
and have a meeting.

193
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,410
Mr. Gu, slow down.

194
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,850
Wait for me. My legs are short.

195
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,770
Thirty percent.

196
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,690
Whatever Gu Ping'an offers,

197
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,530
I'll offer thirty percent more.

198
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,650
Thirty percent?

199
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,930
That would make me disloyal.

200
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,850
- I think we should...
- Forty percent.

201
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:44,930
Mr. Tang,

202
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,410
this is the greatest sincerity
