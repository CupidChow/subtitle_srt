So what are we waiting for?

15
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:52,890
Let's get started.

16
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,170
Sure.

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,060
(Tongque Tavern)

18
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,120
(Tongque Tavern: Eaten Yet)

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,460
Mr. Gu, the kids are here.

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,050
Hurry up.

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,490
Come on, one for each.
Don't mix them up.

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,340
Quick, quick, quick!

23
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,990
Make sure to deliver to each house.
Got it?

24
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:11,970
Be careful out there!

25
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,600
Mr. Gu, bad news.

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,540
Fifty orders from yesterday
have been canceled.

27
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,380
What?

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,490
What did you say?

29
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,920
The fifty orders are dishes

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,410
that take time with meat.

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,880
Almost all of them got canceled.

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,140
It must be Ximen causing trouble again.

33
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,640
Don't panic.

34
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,580
Which dishes have been canceled?

35
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,500
Thirteen pig knuckles,
six beggar's chickens,

36
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,430
nine Dongpo pork,
ten bowls of Song's Fish Soup,

37
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,380
ten pepper fish heads,
and two boxes of desserts.

38
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,580
Alright, keep those dishes.

39
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,480
Send out the rest now,

40
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,080
and let the customers who canceled know

41
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,500
that the deposit is non-refundable.

42
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:43,840
Sure.

43
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,340
What should we do with all these dishes?

44
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,500
I've stayed up all night to make them.

45
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,820
I have an idea, Mr. Gu.

46
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,240
There's a construction team
working outside our courtyard.

47
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,400
About ten people every day.

48
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,280
Why don't we send these dishes to them?

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,700
It's a good chance to build rapport

50
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,120
and get them to help promote us.

51
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,500
Alright.

52
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,540
We'll do it your way.
I'll let you handle it.

53
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,600
No problem.

54
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,380
I won't let
the mistress' efforts be wasted.

55
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,380
Xiaodao, I'll go with you.

56
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,500
(Ximen Mansion)

57
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,260
Good morning, Mr. Ximen.

58
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,580
When did you come in?

59
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,980
Why didn't you knock?

60
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,080
I got excited just now.

61
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,540
I'll go back and knock properly.

62
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,380
Forget it.

63
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,940
What's the rush so early in the morning?

64
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,700
Mr. Ximen,

65
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,180
all fifty orders of Tongque Tavern
were canceled.

66
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,260
We caught them off guard.

67
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,070
But we lost five taels in deposits.

68
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,060
It's only five taels.

69
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,500
It's well spent
to cause Gu Ping'an trouble.

70
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,020
Mr. Ximen,

71
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,900
what's our next move?

72
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,540
What more can Gu Ping'an do?

73
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,550
In a few days,

74
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,560
the weather in Qiantang
will start to get hot.

75
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,620
His dishes

76
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,940
won't be able to stay fresh.

77
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,820
After renovating Tongque Tavern,

78
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,560
I'll take over all of it,

79
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,330
including his takeaway service.

80
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,540
Mr. Ximen, you truly think ahead.

81
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,700
You truly think ahead.

82
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,020
(Tongque Tavern: Eaten Yet)

83
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,140
They're back.

84
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,990
How did it go?

85
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,380
They've been sent out.

86
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,600
Li from the construction team

87
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,300
really praised our pig knuckles

88
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,260
and said they'll order from us
from now on.

89
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,200
Really? They've all been sent out?

90
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,060
Mrs. Gu.

91
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,740
Darling.

92
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,760
Are we turning misfortune
into fortune here?

93
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,740
Of course.

94
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,220
You're the top chef
in Qiantang after all.

95
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,380
Come here.

96
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,580
What's this for?

97
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,780
My husband has been working hard.

98
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,060
Let me massage your back.

99
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,140
By the way,
we didn't make much today.

100
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,670
We haven't even broken even.

101
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,110
So, have you been guarding against me?

102
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,290
You...

103
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,790
Is this the kind of question

104
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,340
all women love to ask?

105
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,510
When I was little,

106
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,750
I often heard my mother
ask my father this.

107
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,520
My father always complained
that my mother nagged.

108
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,700
Then, one day,

109
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,660
my mother suddenly stopped asking,

110
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,100
and my father couldn't get used to it.

111
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,960
So, what happened to them later?

112
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,030
They reunited.

113
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,050
Sorry.

114
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,940
It's fine.

115
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:48,650
If they could see

116
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,850
Tongque Tavern

117
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,420
opening again,

118
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,370
they would surely be very happy.

119
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,900
The priority now

120
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,700
is to find the mastermind
who framed my father

121
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,160
and clear his name.

122
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,480
I believe that day will come.

123
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,850
I'll be with you.

124
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,990
Sure.

125
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,180
(Three months later)

126
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,350
It's rare to see you so at ease,

127
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,830
entrusting the kitchen to Canghai.

128
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,290
Canghai is now handling

129
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,580
Qiantang dishes with ease.

130
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,650
Can't I come out for a stroll now?

131
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,820
Of course.

132
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,590
Come with me to check out that rouge.

133
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,440
Okay.

134
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,190
What's going on?

135
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,240
Who is this?

136
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,420
It's a nobleman.

137
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,820
(Avoiding)
Such a grand procession.

138
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,400
- It's the top scholar.
- Who is that?

139
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,740
The top scholar? Isn't that Zhou?

140
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,460
Top Scholar Zhou.

141
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,040
- Top Scholar Zhou.
- It's Zhou Sheng.

142
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,660
He's the top scholar now.

143
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,120
Let's go.

144
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,070
Zhou Sheng.

145
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,910
Look.

146
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,540
Mr. Zhou, please.

147
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,890
Everyone, please sit down.
No need for such formality.

148
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,790
Could it be
that after I went to the capital,

149
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,860
we've grown distant?

150
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,890
Now you're the top scholar.

151
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,330
From now on,
we'll have to rely on you.

152
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,660
Look, Miss Shirui
is being polite to me again.

153
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,300
What top scholar?

154
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,220
We're all family here.

155
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,250
By the way, Mr. Zhou,

156
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,540
it must've been a long journey.

157
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,570
Was it smooth?

158
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,420
When I first entered the capital,
I was lost.

159
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,100
Fortunately,
Mr. Gu arranged it for me,

160
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,170
or I would've been stuck.

161
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,830
Mr. Gu, Mr. Li has arrived.

162
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,980
Mr. Li?

163
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,020
He said he came to see Mr. Zhou.

164
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,880
He even brought a suona band.

165
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,700
Mr. Zhou, how about we go greet him?

166
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,970
Mr. Zhou.

167
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,060
Congrats on becoming the top scholar.

168
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,780
Today, I've come with my daughter
to offer our congratulations.

169
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,620
Was your journey smooth?

170
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,290
Everything went smoothly.

171
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,180
In the past,
I didn't treat you well enough.

172
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,940
I hope you don't mind, Mr. Zhou.

173
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,340
Mr. Li,

174
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,310
I have admired your daughter
for a long time.

175
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,380
Everyone knows that.

176
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,820
In the past, I was too young

177
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,280
and didn't have the chance to visit,

178
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,980
so there were many misunderstandings.

179
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,300
Today, I...

180
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,580
You don't need to say more, Mr. Zhou.

181
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,180
It's an honor for our family

182
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,770
that you like my daughter.

183
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,060
You can get married
at an auspicious time.

184
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,160
But I haven't been assigned
an official post yet.

185
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,980
It's fine.

186
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,320
You can get engaged first.

187
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,000
After you return to the capital
and are given an official title,

188
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,460
we can hold the wedding.

189
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,900
Zhou, what do you think?

190
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,220
That sounds wonderful.

191
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,460
I'd like to hold the engagement banquet
at Tongque Tavern.

192
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,860
What do you think, Mr. Zhou?

193
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,700
Zhou, you don't know this.

194
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,240
Tongque Tavern

195
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,840
was sealed off for engaging

196
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,050
in immoral activities.

197
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,140
I'm afraid...

198
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,280
I'm afraid it's a misunderstanding.

199
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,780
I'll issue an order now

200
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,570
to reopen it.

201
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,370
I'll have Mr. Gu open the tavern again.

202
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,970
But Ximen took the deed to the tavern.

203
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,020
What should we do?

204
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,240
This is outrageous.

205
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,160
I'll have it returned immediately.

206
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,600
Mr. Ximen.

207
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,560
Return it?

208
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,860
But, Mr. Li,

209
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,850
do you know

210
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,900
that I just finished
renovating Tongque Tavern?

211
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,600
I've spent a hundred taels on it,

212
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,100
and now you want me to return it?

213
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,660
Tongque Tavern

214
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,940
was originally
Mr. Gu's ancestral property.

215
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,460
What is this forceful occupation?

216
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,410
We can't let Gu Ping'an
get off so easily.

217
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,280
You agreed far too quickly.

218
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,680
Mr. Ximen,

219
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,180
I know you're upset,

220
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,780
but since Mr. Zhou has spoken,

221
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,940
it's hard for me to refuse.

222
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,220
After all, he's the top scholar.

223
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,140
And he will be my son-in-law.

224
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,100
We're all family in the end.

225
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,820
(Tongque Tavern)
Tongque Tavern is now open again!

226
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,660
All dishes are 50% off!

227
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,260
Welcome in to try!

228
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,380
- Good!
- Good!

229
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,500
Please come inside!

230
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,440
Come in, come in!

231
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,660
Come in, come in!

232
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,740
There are seats inside!

233
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,580
I've worked so hard,

234
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,360
and in the end,

235
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,780
Gu Ping'an gets everything.

236
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,210
- Come in, please.
- Mr. Ximen.

237
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,680
Gu Ping'an must be dealt with,
or we'll have endless trouble.

238
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,520
Of course.

239
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,320
Do you think I'll let him off?

240
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,990
Sir, your dishes.

241
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,660
- Mr. Gu.
- Please enjoy.

242
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,880
Everything has been prepared.

243
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,100
I've rented the fishing boats.

244
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,600
Tonight, I'll bring my brothers out.

245
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,520
Wait for my message.

246
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,460
Be sure to be careful.

247
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,540
While I'm not around,

248
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,780
if Cihua needs any help...

249
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,820
Don't worry.

250
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,090
We'll look after her.

251
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,260
- Please enjoy.
- Also,

252
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,580
you should hurry up

253
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,540
and confess to her.

254
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,060
The timing isn't right;
I'm not in a hurry.

255
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,140
I'll be off then.

256
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,780
Alright, stay safe.

257
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,860
Take care.

258
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,740
Mr. Zhou is here.

259
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,480
Mr. Zhou, please come in.

260
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,590
- Mr. Zhou.
- Mr. Gu, congratulations!

261
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,400
I've prepared a little gift for you

262
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,560
to wish you good fortune.

263
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,720
You're too kind, Mr. Zhou.

264
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,820
Let's go upstairs.

265
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,860
Please.

266
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,460
You invited me to meet today.

267
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,160
Is there something you want to discuss?

268
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,300
After you take office,

269
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,080
I have a request.

270
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,200
I hope you'll consider it.
