Mr. Ximen,

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,610
the spicy dishes from Tongque Tavern

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,000
have been repeated over and over

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,320
for several days now.

19
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,520
Their business
is getting worse every day.

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,370
Your tricks

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,860
are quite brilliant.

22
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,950
I don't need any special tricks

23
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,040
to deal with Gu Ping'an.

24
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,920
Isn't he from Tongque Tavern?

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,350
What's he doing with so many taro?

26
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,410
Can they cook with those?

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,480
Taro?

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,680
Is it tasty?

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,310
Let's see what he's up to.

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,230
You're amazing, darling.

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,950
You really managed

32
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,840
to make the sugar.

33
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,200
- Mr. Gu.
- Well.

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,640
Thanks to Xiaodao's method.

35
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,350
For this jar of sugar,

36
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,070
the mistress and I

37
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,680
haven't had any rest for days.

38
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,350
The process is so complicated.

39
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,070
First, you have to cut
the beets into strips,

40
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,000
then take them out after they soften,

41
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,230
use gauze to filter out the juice,

42
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,250
and finally steam it into solid blocks.

43
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,400
It sounds easy,

44
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,070
but it's hard to do.

45
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,950
Exactly.

46
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,000
Mr. Gu,

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,430
you have to raise my wages.

48
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,760
Of course.

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,200
Once this is over,

50
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,920
I'll make sure you get

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,720
a paid half-day off.

52
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,710
What?

53
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,790
Half a day?

54
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,360
Half a day isn't enough for me
to catch up on sleep.

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,680
Then what reward do I get?

56
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,120
Don't worry, darling.

57
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,520
I've made arrangements.

58
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,080
We won't treat our skilled chef

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,840
unfairly.

60
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,680
Alright.

61
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,700
I'm extra again.

62
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,590
After this crisis passes,

63
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,800
Ximen may have another trick.

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,310
You must come up with a plan.

65
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,030
It's time to make them suffer a bit.

66
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,880
Otherwise,

67
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,010
they'll never learn what happens
when they target us.

68
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,680
Good job, darling.

69
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,020
(Tongque Tavern)

70
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,360
Here, Manager Yan.

71
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,030
Don't rush, Mr. Yan.

72
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,090
Try our signature pepper fish head.

73
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,840
It's fresh and spicy.
You'll surely like it.

74
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,280
My carriage isn't even parked yet.

75
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,360
No problem.

76
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,360
Cihua,

77
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,470
please help Mr. Yan park the carriage.

78
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,240
- Don't go over the line.
- Got it.

79
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,910
Mr. Gu, what's going on here?

80
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,750
I'll have to take people to buy goods.

81
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,960
Mr. Yan, please be patient.

82
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,520
Here, have some tea.

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,840
Mr. Yan,

84
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,430
I have a business deal

85
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,710
I'd like to discuss with you.

86
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,750
Make it short.

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,080
In the next three days,

88
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,840
beets will become
the hottest-selling vegetable

89
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,310
in all of Qiantang.

90
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,560
Selling beets in this heat?

91
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,920
You don't believe it?

92
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,470
No.

93
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,000
Qiantang is facing

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,030
a sugar shortage.

95
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,190
Every household can't get sugar.

96
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,870
If you were the manager,

97
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,960
what would you do?

98
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,800
I would look for a substitute.

99
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,550
Mr. Gu,

100
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,030
do you have a way to sell beets?

101
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,190
I have a plan

102
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,240
to make sure the beets you have
will sell out.

103
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,000
But after that,

104
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,710
I want thirty percent.

105
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,150
It's a deal.

106
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,140

(Jufu Resto)

109
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,120
Mr. Gu, what's going on here?

110
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,880
Mr. Gu.

111
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,310
Your wine is fifty wen a pot,

112
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,370
but I only had three cups.

113
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,210
Where's the wine?

114
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,800
Sir.

115
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,680
What's going on?

116
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,900
Your wine is short on quantity.

117
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,750
Short on quantity?

118
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,590
Right.

119
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,270
Well...

120
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,190
The waiter must've

121
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,800
grabbed the wrong bottle.

122
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,710
How about this?

123
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
I'll get you a new bottle

124
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,510
and give you an extra one for free.

125
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,310
- What do you think?
- That's better.

126
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,240
Then enjoy your meal.
I'll be right back with it.

127
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,360
Are you busy?

128
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,750
Explain it.

129
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,590
Mr. Gu,

130
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,680
I was wrong.

131
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,480
I shouldn't have drunk
the customer's wine.

132
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,040
It was a momentary lapse.

133
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,880
I...

134
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,630
You can scold me.

135
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,750
Glad you know
you can't drink the customer's wine.

136
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,630
This is a matter of principle.

137
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,350
Whether you're a person
or running a business, honesty is key.

138
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,230
Also,

139
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,830
you could've stopped after one cup,

140
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,430
but you drank half a bottle.

141
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,270
I...

142
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,750
He didn't.

143
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,190
I caught him drinking.

144
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,510
My hand trembled,

145
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,160
and I spilled half a bottle
into the pot.

146
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,560
You'll pay for that table's wine.

147
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,360
If this happens again, you're out.

148
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,630
Alright, stop scolding him.

149
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,680
It's thanks to him

150
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,240
that I made a new discovery.

151
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,880
Try this.

152
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,880
What's this?

153
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,680
This is Hangzhou Triple Veggies

154
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,160
made with shrimp,
pigskin, and fish balls.

155
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,510
By accident, alcohol was added,

156
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,360
and the taste became even more tender.

157
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,270
How is it?

158
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,310
It's really good.

159
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,510
Great.

160
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,370
But your wages will still be deducted.

161
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,560
By the way,

162
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,950
you met with the other shop managers.

163
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,390
Did you get any results?

164
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,010
Cihua.

165
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,760
Coming.

166
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,880
These are

167
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,040
all the gifts from the managers.

168
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,720
They were very upset

169
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,360
about the sugar issue.

170
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,390
After I shared the sugar recipe

171
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,240
with them,

172
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,600
they were really grateful.

173
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,240
Whether it's cakes,
fried snacks, candies,

174
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,480
or small taverns,

175
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,120
they'll all be more considerate
of our goodwill.

176
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,680
So now,

177
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,920
Ximen has offended everyone.

178
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,800
He deserves it.

179
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,430
Darling,

180
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,420
you're amazing!

181
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,570
What would we do without you
at Tongque Tavern?

182
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,890
Be more reserved.

183
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,870
There are still people here.

184
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,610
There's no one.

185
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,920
Right. There's no one.

186
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,320
The window.

187
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,430
(Hangzhou cuisine comes back
with new dishes)

188
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,620
Tongque Tavern has new dishes.

189
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,210
Let's go try them.

190
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,500
Let's go.

191
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,860
- Let's go.
- I'll try some too.

192
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,690
(Tongque Tavern)
Come on. Let's go try them.

193
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,280
Mr. Ximen.

194
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,170
Mr. Ximen.

195
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,680
You bought all the sugar earlier,

196
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,490
so I ended the partnership with Mr. Gu.

197
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,330
Now,

198
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,170
he's taught all the shops
how to make sugar.

199
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,040
What should I do now?

200
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,000
The price of sugar is falling
instead of rising.

201
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,950
How much business will I lose?

202
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,840
Mr. Tang, please calm down.

203
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,790
Come and sit.

204
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,250
I have other plans.

205
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,870
Competing with Tongque Tavern
is your business.

206
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,390
I'll no longer be involved.

207
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,990
Yaoji,

208
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,560
go send a message to the Master.

209
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,910
It's time for him to act.

210
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,720
Yes.

211
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,070
Madam, news from Qiantang.

212
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,390
The plan failed.

213
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,800
A bunch of useless fools.

214
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,360
Let her go, then.

215
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,000
But if we do that,

216
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,270
won't we expose ourselves?

217
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,000
(Ximen Miao from the Gu Mansion)
Don't worry, she never misses.

218
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,420
Alright then.

219
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,750
(Tongque Tavern)
One order of pepper fish head.

220
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,400
Alright.

221
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,720
Four blessings, six sixes, six sixes.

222
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,840
You lost. Drink!

223
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,680
Come on.

224
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,890
- Again.
- Come on.

225
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,350
Fill it up.

226
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,840
You're so busy.

227
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,720
Let Cihua handle the serving of dishes.

228
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,910
Cihua is running all over the place.

229
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,200
I can also serve. It's okay.

230
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,670
Today, more people are ordering
the pepper fish head.

231
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,490
Canghai is busier than me
in the kitchen.

232
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,550
No way.

233
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,960
I'll feel bad watching you
run around like that.

234
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,550
Don't move.

235
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,600
Alright, go back now.

236
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,270
Cihua's in the main hall.

237
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,590
You really don't treat me
as a person.

238
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,690
- Well, I'm off then.
- Sir.

239
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,440
Your dishes, please enjoy.

240
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,150
Please come inside.

241
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,480
Mr. Gu,

242
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,120
staring at Mrs. Gu again, huh?

243
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,360
Mrs. Gu isn't wearing any makeup,

244
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,320
and you're all smitten.

245
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,080
If she dressed up,

246
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,000
you'd lose your soul for sure.

247
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,430
By the way, Cihua,

248
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:29,770
what kind of makeup

249
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,000
does your girl usually like?

250
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,200
Well...

251
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,640
Forget I asked.

252
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,890
I'll pick it out myself later

253
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,230
and prepare a surprise for her.

254
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,670
What are you waiting for? Go!

255
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,960
- Keep it a secret.
- Sure.

256
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,440
Let me tell you a little secret.

257
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,030
What's up?

258
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,750
Mr. Gu is going to buy makeup for you

259
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,840
as a gift.

260
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,390
Really?

261
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
Really.

262
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,390
He just asked me and then went out.

263
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,510
You just wait for the gift.

264
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,120
(Tongque Tavern)
Mr. Gu is back. Who is this young lady?

265
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,080
What young lady?

266
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,450
Eat slowly. Don't choke.

267
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,460
Uncle Hai, get her some water.

268
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,130
Here.

269
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,610
Here's the water, Miss.

270
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,690
Thank you for your help.

271
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,760
Otherwise,

272
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,430
I wouldn't know

273
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,820
(Li Feiyan, a stunning dancer)
when I'd escape my suffering.

274
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,030
I won't go.
I'm a dancer, not a courtesan.

275
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,320
I'm just not going.

276
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,320
The nobleman wants you.

277
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,200
It's your hard-earned fortune.

278
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,630
It's not up to you.

279
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,270
Be good. Come with me.

280
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,120
I won't go.

281
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,600
If you insist,
