1
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,460
(Kaifeng)

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,080
The Emperor has issued an edict.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,100
He commands the Forwarding Magistrate,
Gu Qingfeng,

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,030
to secretly travel to Qiantang

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,030
and thoroughly investigate
the private salt case.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,760
By the Emperor himself.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,260
(Qiantang)

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,350
My son, I hope you're safe.

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,190
People only know
that Qiantang's flowers are flourishing,

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,870
but they don't know that in the dark,
snakes and rats are rampant.

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,080
Though I've been ordered
to investigate the case,

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,280
I am like an ant shaking a tree.

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,060
Danger lurks everywhere.

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,860
(Tongque Tavern)

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,710
If something happens to me,

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,960
be sure to bring the land deed here

17
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,150
to take over the Tongque Tavern.

18
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,380
(Tongque Tavern)

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,260
(Dad,)

20
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,330
(they say you used the investigation
as an excuse)

21
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,580
(Gu Mansion)
(to open a tavern)

22
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,680
(and exploited the people.)

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,420
(After being exposed
by your colleagues,)

24
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,380
(you took your life
out of fear of punishment.)

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,310
(I don't believe those rumors.)

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,150
(I will make sure to clear your name.)

27
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,980
=My Contractual Husband=

28
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,860
(Two years later, Kaifeng)

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,230
It's been two years.

30
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,590
You've scoured Qiantang.

31
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,890
Why haven't you found the evidence
left by Gu Qingfeng?

32
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,140
Sorry for my incompetence.

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Where is Gu Ping'an?

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,310
He's arrived in Qiantang.

35
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,640
Since he wants to meet his father,

36
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,510
let's help him.

37
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,430
Yes.

38
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,140
(Qiantang)

39
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,460
(Gu Ping'an, son of Gu Qingfeng)

40
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,200
Miss, excuse me.

41
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,380
Trying to scare people like this?

42
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,200
Hey, wake up.

43
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,560
Map of Qiantang.

44
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,670
Gu Ping'an.

45
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,190
I'll take him home first.

46
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,900
(My name is Song Shirui.)

47
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,080
(An orphan.)
Selling buns!

48
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,030
(Grandma died in a fire to save me.)
Meat, vegetables. We've got it all.

49
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,770
(People think I'm a jinx.)
Come and try it.

50
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,340
(They avoid me.)
One Triple Veggies.

51
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,960
(Grandma taught me how to cook.)
Sure.

52
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,430
(Though I'm alone,)

53
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,030
(I still get by.)

54
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,310
(But...)

55
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,310
(According to the yamen,
people who are not married by 16)

56
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,550
(have to pay the singles tax.)

57
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,370
(Great.)
Another notice for the singles tax.

58
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,420
(Tax list: Song Shirui.)
(I'm now a major taxpayer.)

59
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,420
(Thankfully,)

60
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,190
(heaven let me find him.)

61
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,960
(Where is this?)

62
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,430
Where are my clothes?

63
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,280
Who is it?

64
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,510
We're here to collect the singles tax.

65
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,240
Sirs, look.

66
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,240
Why don't you come back in a few days?

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,080
Miss Song, sorry,

68
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,080
- Take the valuable items.
- Don't.

69
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,150
Zhao.

70
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,190
I don't really have anything valuable.

71
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,430
Chief.

72
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,240
She doesn't have
any gold or silver jewelry.

73
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,380
(Song's Recipes)
We only found this old recipe book.

74
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,700
It's wrapped up carefully.

75
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,210
Why did you touch my recipe book?

76
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,400
Give it to me.

77
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,110
You're doing this again.

78
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,960
Give me the stuff.

79
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,990
Give it to me.

80
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,470
Stop right there.

81
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,360
Where is my letter?

82
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,360
Stop right there.

83
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,470
Who dares to collect
Shirui's singles tax?

84
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,780
(Ximen Bang, Qiantang's overlord)

85
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,520
Mr. Zhao,

86
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,470
my family has a great influence
in Qiantang.

87
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,360
Today, I've come to propose.

88
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,840
I think the singles tax

89
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,390
should be waived.

90
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,150
Who are you?

91
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,560
He's my husband.

92
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,830
What nonsense are you saying?

93
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,150
What?

94
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,240
You don't believe it?

95
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,710
Young Master.

96
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,670
You...

97
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,040
Now do you believe it?

98
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,200
In that case,

99
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,910
Miss Song, you should get married soon.

100
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,120
Congratulations.

101
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,270
Let's go.

102
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,480
Go.

103
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,830
Leaving.

104
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,160
Who are you?

105
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,560
You sure have a talent
for making up lies.

106
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,480
I'm Song Shirui.

107
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,160
Yesterday,
you passed out by the roadside,

108
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,680
and I saved you.

109
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,290
That doesn't give you the right
to take advantage of me.

110
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,430
Oh, please.

111
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,490
Don't profit and then act all innocent.

112
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll report you.

113
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,510
You're going to report me?

114
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,240
Alright, go then.

115
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,720
I won't report you, okay?

116
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,510
Let me go.

117
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,680
Try the dishes I made.

118
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,530
I'm not eating.

119
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,060
If not,
you'll never get your bundle back.

120
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,870
You're a female bandit.

121
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,470
If you want me to eat,

122
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,670
untie me first.

123
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,830
Not bad at cooking.

124
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,310
It's just a letter.

125
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,720
(Thankfully, the letter is here.)

126
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,630
Is this necessary?

127
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,240
It contains my family's land deed.

128
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,080
What land deed?

129
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,520
Nothing.

130
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,380
Tell me.

131
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,950
If you don't, I'll tear it up.

132
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,760
It's the deed for a tavern in Qiantang.

133
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,040
It's called the Tongque Tavern.

134
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,310
Tongque Tavern?

135
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,710
It's the ancestral property
my father left me.

136
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,270
I came to Qiantang this time

137
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,720
to manage it properly.

138
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,200
Now, can you return it to me?

139
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,160
Before I escape the singles tax,

140
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,240
you won't be able to run away.

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,840
By the way,

142
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,100
tomorrow you have to play along
with me in this act.

143
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,570
Once we're done, I'll let you go.

144
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,580
Play along? What act?

145
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,400
Marriage.

146
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,750
A vow of eternal love,
written on a red scroll,

147
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,440
is to be bound in a pact of love
with the red leaves.

148
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,820
This hereby proves it.

149
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,190
Bow to heaven and earth.

150
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,550
Mr. Ximen is here.

151
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,680
I oppose it.

152
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,270
Mr. Zhao,

153
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,560
in my opinion,

154
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,880
you need to consider
this marriage further.

155
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,360
Are you from Qiantang?

156
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,600
Why have I never seen you here before?

157
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,830
More importantly,

158
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,100
Shirui would rather marry

159
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,840
this brat she only met once

160
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,180
than marry

161
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,950
someone as handsome, rich,
and talented as me.

162
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,070
This is strange.

163
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,390
Should I ask for your opinion

164
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,720
before I get married?

165
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,720
Hurry and stand up for me,

166
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,310
or you'll never get your letter back.

167
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,560
I think he has ulterior motives for you.

168
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,320
I'm just...

169
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,600
Did you hear that? He admitted it.

170
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,310
We're just...

171
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,560
We're true love.

172
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,560
True love?

173
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,700
Your words alone don't count.

174
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,880
(For the land deed, I'll risk it all.)
