Manager of Tongque Tavern,

74

arrest everyone from the Tongque Tavern.

to do with the staff.

106
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,780
aren't they supposed
to arrest Gu Ping'an?

107
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,500
Why are they arresting Song Shirui?

108
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,500
Oh no, Gu Ping'an has escaped.

119
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,320

You can stay here at ease.

121
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,740

The tavern my father left me

135
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,780
I've been gathering many clues

136
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,140
about my father's case
while managing it.

137
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,460
Ping'an came this time because...

138
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,940
Ping'an,

139
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,340
I see you're at the age to get married.

140
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,100
You went to Qiantang earlier,

141
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,620
and now you've come back.

142
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,660
Why don't you let me
arrange your marriage

143
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,020
with Wanwan as soon as possible?

144
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,830
Uncle,

145
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,100
thank you for your kind consideration,

146
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,180
but my father's case
is still unresolved.

147
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,260
I am focused on clearing his name.

148
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,860
I understand how you feel,

149
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,400
but this is

150
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,250
a big matter,

151
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,620
and it requires careful planning.

152
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,660
Uncle, I've gathered some clues...

153
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,500
Alright.

154
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,620
Let's eat first.

155
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,240
You know how to take care of me.

156
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,160
You're worried
I'll be bored in the courtyard,

157
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,080
so you came to see me.

158
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,970
Yes.

159
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,100
That's not quite it.

160
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,200
Miss Xia is afraid you'll run away,

161
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,860
so she asked me to watch over you.

162
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,740
Canghai,

163
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,940
you're as straightforward as ever.

164
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,100
What are you thinking?

165
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,700
I'm worried.

166
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,900
This time I returned to Kaifeng,

167
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,420
Mr. Li and Ximen

168
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,300
won't easily let Shirui go.

169
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,440
I'm worried Ms. Miao will cause trouble,

170
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,300
so I need to get the search warrant
as soon as possible.

171
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,380
What do you plan to do?

172
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,300
Tomorrow, no matter what,

173
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,620
I'll ask Mr. Xia to write the memorial.

174
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,780
Qiantang is full of danger.

175
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,340
I can't waste a moment.

176
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,020
I went back alone

177
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,640
just to investigate the case
and make plans.

178
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,700
If anything happens to Shirui
because of me,

179
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,980
I'll never forgive myself.

180
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,220
So, I've made up my mind.

181
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,860
In three days, no matter what,

182
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,580
I'll return to her side,

183
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,740
even if I can't get the memorial.

184
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,300
Mr. Gu,

185
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,100
you're a faithful man.

186
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,660
I'll clear any obstacles for you.

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,260
I'll go back with you.

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,840
Come on.

189
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,860
I wonder what Shirui is doing now,

190
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,520
if she's eating well,

191
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,860
and if she's thinking about me.

192
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,020
You wrote that divorce letter
so decisively,

193
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,640
and now you want her to think about you?

194
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,620
I had no choice.

195
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,780
Wait, you peeked at my divorce letter?

196
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,380
Who would want to look?

197
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,780
You soaked so many sheets of paper
with your tears.

198
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,500
I was just cleaning up for you.

199
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,520
I happened to glance at it.

200
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,460
Do you think I'll believe you?

201
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,480
Are you going to hit me?

202
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,220
Alright, I won't stay any longer.

203
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,740
I'm going to sleep now.
