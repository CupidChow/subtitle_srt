in coming to Qiantang?

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,000
It should be to take Mr. Gu away.

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,350
Miss, let me escort you back to the inn.

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,400
No need.

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,430
I've troubled you all today.

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,000
Please forgive me.

21
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,680
Ping'an,

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,430
please think

23
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,680
about what I said today.

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,890
I'll wait for your answer.

25
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,430
- Shirui.
- No need to explain.

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,840
I understand.

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,840
Uncle Gu's matters are more important.

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,560
You haven't seen each other
in a long time,

29
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,790
so it's natural to catch up.

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,120
- Well...
- Alright.

31
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,840
Tomorrow is Mr. Zhou's

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,480
and Miss Wanjun's engagement banquet.

33
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,840
There's still a lot to be done.

34
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,920
Let's rest now.

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,480
Mr. Gu, take care of yourself.

36
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,310
Mr. Gu, don't be a heartless man.

37
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,280
Mr. Gu, are you incapable of doing that?

38
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,280
I'm incapable?

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,710
Mr. Gu.

40
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,590
Shut up.

41
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,240
Got it.

42
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,870
Mr. Ximen, something's wrong.

43
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,280
Big trouble!

44
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,710
- Mr. Ximen,
- What now?

45
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,280
Why are you making such a fuss?

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,280
Tell me. What happened to Gu Ping'an?

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,560
It's not Gu Ping'an.

48
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,430
Why are you making such a fuss then?

49
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,680
It's Ms. Miao.

50
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,840
Ms. Miao is back!

51
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,510
You should've said so earlier.

52
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,960
Mr. Ximen.

53
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,150
Miao.

54
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,030
- It's hot, right?
- Sit down.

55
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,430
Miao, look.

56
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,030
Why didn't you tell me
that you were coming?

57
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,710
I wanted to see

58
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,120
how your business is doing.

59
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,010
You can't even handle your nephew.

60
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,310
Miao,

61
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,520
I was so close to success,

62
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,080
but the top scholar Zhou
came out of nowhere.

63
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,080
He ruined everything.

64
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,630
What's his background?

65
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,540
(Ximen Mansion)

66
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,960
Why didn't you tell me
about such a big matter earlier?

67
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,710
Miao,
I didn't take Zhou Sheng seriously.

68
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,400
I thought he posed no threat to us.

69
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,800
No threat?

70
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,690
That's because he isn't an official yet.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,120
Once he becomes an official,

72
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,360
he'll definitely become
Gu Ping'an's support.

73
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,520
Then there will be no place
for you in Qiantang.

74
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,270
Right, right.

75
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,360
So what do you think we should do next?

76
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,360
Things have come to this.

77
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,430
Zhou Sheng can't be left alive.

78
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,140
(Tongque Tavern)

79
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:00,990
Please.

80
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,310
Mr. Zhou, on the day of your wedding,

81
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,630
I'll come to drink to your joy.

82
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,840
- It's a deal.
- It's a deal.

83
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,680
Take care.

84
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,400
Help!

85
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,750
Help!

86
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,640
Someone, come!

87
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,320
Run!

88
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,200
Run!

89
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,720
How dare you attempt

90
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,190
to murder Mr. Zhou?

91
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,880
Feiyan?

92
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,520
As expected.

93
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,480
Explain yourself.

94
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,630
Ximen sent me to assassinate Mr. Zhou.

95
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,160
I didn't want to kill him.

96
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,560
Now that I've been caught,

97
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,800
I'm actually relieved.

98
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,870
Mr. Gu, I'm sorry.

99
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,510
I was the one

100
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,070
who attacked you last time.

101
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,910
You...

102
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,240
I've wronged everyone.

103
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,480
Kill me or punish me as you wish.

104
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,510
Feiyan, why are you doing this?

105
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,390
I've been lonely since I was a child.

106
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,920
The Ximen family adopted me

107
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,070
and trained me as a pigeon.

108
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,080
A pigeon?

109
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,510
The killers trained by the Ximen family
are called pigeons.

110
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,680
Every task is delivered through pigeons.

111
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,950
Being saved from Huaman House

112
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,120
is the beginning of my plan.

113
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,500
I wanted to lure Mr. Gu into the game.

114
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,160
Unexpectedly,

115
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,040
when I actually arrived here,

116
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
it was the first time
I felt the warmth of home.

117
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,070
After that, pigeons came several times,

118
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,830
but I couldn't respond.

119
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,920
I realized I had softened.

120
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,630
Why have I never seen any pigeons?

121
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,240
I've seen them.

122
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,920
I thought they were gifts from heaven,

123
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,950
so every time they came,
I'd catch them.

124
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,750
The one came before,
and I just killed it today.

125
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,750
I was wondering
why the meat was so tough.

126
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,630
I know I've made a terrible mistake.

127
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,240
I dare not ask for your forgiveness.

128
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,000
I can only apologize with my death.

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,840
Feiyan!

130
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,230
It's alright.

131
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,000
Feiyan,

132
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,160
I don't care what you were before,

133
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,500
but from today on,

134
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,350
you

135
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,750
are under our protection.

136
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,720
I didn't expect Ximen Bang
to have this kind of wit.

137
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,510
It's not Ximen Bang.

138
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,780
My superior is his sister, Ximen Miao.

139
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,120
Ximen Miao?

140
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,870
Mr. Zhou, sorry about today.

141
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,950
Feiyan, what is that mark on you?

142
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,940
This one?

143
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,620
That's the Yin-Yang Mark.

144
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,240
Anyone from the Yin-Yang Sect

145
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,800
carries this mark.

146
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,390
Even Ximen Miao herself

147
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,360
has a Yin-Yang Sect ring.

148
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,680
The Yin-Yang Sect.

149
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,600
Every force in the Jianghu

150
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,120
has its own followers.

151
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,050
They use special patterns

152
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,050
as marks to recognize each other.

153
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,000
Alright, I understand.

154
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,110
You should go back now.

155
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,170
Stay indoors for a while.

156
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,240
Understood. Thank you, Mr. Gu.

157
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,060
Mr. Zhou, take a look.

158
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,820
Who wrote this?

159
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,320
This was my father's stuff.

160
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,810
He came to Jiangnan and died here

161
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,220
because of this poem.

162
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,720
Since coming to Qiantang,

163
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,270
I've been investigating its meaning,

164
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,990
and I've found many clues.

165
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,520
Qiantang River under Mount Fenghuang.

166
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,140
Butterflies fly around in the landscape.

167
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,700
Ten li west of the Yin-Yang Sect.

168
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,180
Golden on the outside, silver frost inside.

169
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,220
(Outside Fengshan Gate)

170
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,420
Outside Fengshan Gate?

171
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,640
According to my investigation,

172
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,340
the Yin-Yang Sect is
trafficking in salt.

173
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,760
All ships in Qiantang
must dock outside Fengshan Gate.

174
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,900
So, I suspect

175
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,220
their trading dock

176
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,180
is located here.

177
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,540
So, the silver frost in this poem

178
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,140
means the Ximen family
uses gold as a cover

179
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,980
while transporting private salt.

180
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,840
Speaking of which,

181
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,360
I haven't had a chance to tell you.

182
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,900
The coroner has given me
the autopsy results.

183
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,820
- Mr. Zhou...
- No need to say more.

184
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,660
You've helped me multiple times.

185
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,660
I'm willing to do anything for you.

186
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,480
This assassination failed.

187
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,440
The Ximen family will surely
make another move.

188
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,860
I'll gather evidence asap

189
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,100
and convince the Vice Minister Xia
to reopen the case.

190
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,000
Mr. Zhou, please help me.

191
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,460
I'll go to say goodbye
to Wanjun tomorrow

192
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,540
and set off at once.

193
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,660
(Tongque Tavern)
Sir, please come in.

194
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,220
You're injured. Why didn't you tell me?

195
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,940
I have Jinchuang ointment
from the Palace.

196
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,300
Let me apply it for you.

197
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,820
It's nothing, just a minor wound.

198
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,020
Canghai,

199
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,620
go check on Shirui in the kitchen.

200
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,540
She's alone in there.

201
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,020
I've been there but was sent back.

202
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,980
Why?

203
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,340
What do you think?

204
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,380
Ping'an,

205
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,860
have a peach.

206
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,220
I sent someone to buy it
from the morning market.

207
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,740
Wanwan,
don't you have other things to do?

208
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,020
My task is waiting for your answer.

209
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,140
I already

210
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,780
answered you yesterday.

211
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,580
I think your answer lacks consideration.

212
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,620
(I've known Ping'an)

213
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,220
(since we were children.)

214
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,260
(Our parents arranged our marriage)

215
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,220
(before we were born.)

216
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,060
It's delicious.

217
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,540
Darling.

218
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,220
Actually...

219
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,740
Actually, I came to Qiantang

220
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,060
for another reason.

221
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,980
What reason?

222
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,780
My father was killed by the sinister.

223
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,940
I came to Qiantang

224
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,020
to look for clues.

225
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,620
Without the traditional ritual

226
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,300
or the bridal crown and veil,

227
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,080
is that considered a marriage?

228
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,740
Shirui,

229
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,620
Miss Xia has been around Mr. Gu a lot.

230
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,140
Aren't you worried at all?

231
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,220
Why should I be worried?

232
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,060
Exactly. There's nothing to worry about.

233
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,980
If that's true, why hide in the kitchen?

234
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,300
If that's true,

235
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,060
why haven't you spoken
to Mr. Gu for days?

236
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,980
If that's true, then...

237
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,990
Feiyan.

238
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,380
Shirui,

239
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
you can't keep avoiding this issue.

240
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,340
I understand what you mean,

241
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,980
but Miss Xia

242
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,940
is not just Gu's childhood sweetheart.

243
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,380
Her family can help him
with his father's case.
