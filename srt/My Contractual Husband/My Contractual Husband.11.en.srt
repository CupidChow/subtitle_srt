- The flowers inside are better.

would've taken seven days,

125
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,720
So, may I ask which young lady it is?

126
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,720
She

127
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,900
is a lady of a prominent family.

128
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,180
I met her on a rainy day.

129
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,670
She invited me to the pavilion
to take shelter

130
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,100
and lent me her umbrella.

131
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,590
I fell for her

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,200
(Li Wanjun, Prefect's daughter)
at first sight.

133
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,900
Please don't laugh, Mr. Gu.

134
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,800
Every time I see her smile,

135
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,020
I feel overjoyed.

136
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,200
I'm not as wealthy as she is.

137
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,430

138
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,260
Thanks, Mr. Gu.

139
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,040
I'll take my leave now.

140
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,920
Mr. Zhou, you're too polite. Take care.

141
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,390
Do come again.

142
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,030
Mr. Gu,

143
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,340
do you think that young lady

144
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,810
likes Mr. Zhou?

145
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,060
Well,

146
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,460
if she didn't like him,

147
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,060
would she eat the same dessert
for seven days in a row?

148
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,020
Sure.

149
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,580

152
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,740
why did you eat my dessert?

153
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,390
- This...
- Well...

154
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,580
We can't eat them?

155
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,620
It's not that.

156
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,050
I asked Cui to buy them

157
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,680
and was about to bring them to you.

158
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,840
Which shop did she buy them from?

159
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,780
I didn't see Cui leave today.

160
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,390
It's Tongque Tavern.

161
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,890
(Mr. Li, Prefect of Qiantang)
They've become popular lately.

162
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,090
Cui woke up early to get them.

163
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,680
Tongque Tavern?

164
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,090
In that case,

165
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,490
why don't we go together sometime?

166
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,550
Sure.

167
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,360
Still not the time yet?

168
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,140
(Tongque Tavern)
This place is crowded!

169
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,780
Both Madam and Wanjun
said the dessert was delicious.

170
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,940
Let's taste them today.

171
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,260
Wait.

172
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,770
You need to take a number first.
Please wait.

173
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,480
Mr. Li.

174
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,710
Apologies.

175
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,780
We didn't greet you properly.
Please come in.

176
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,130
- Please.
- Wait a moment.

177
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,120
Mr. Li, please sit.

178
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,360
Mr. Gu, you look so handsome.

179
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,440
You're too kind, Mr. Li.

180
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,740
My wife and daughter

181
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,780
both said your desserts were excellent,

182
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,060
so I decided to try them myself.

183
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,700
Thanks for your support, Mr. Li.

184
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,500
I'll bring all of our best dishes

185
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,830
to you right away.

186
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,150
I appreciate it, Mr. Gu.

187
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,800
Darling!

188
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,360
- What's going on?
- Hurry.

189
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,780
Good news. Mr. Li is here.

190
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,660
Mr. Li?

191
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,060
The only Prefect of Qiantang.

192
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,070
Hurry, hurry.

193
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,300
Prepare our signature dishes.

194
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,480
We'll take it over together.

195
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,720
Let's show them the strength

196
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,960
of Qiantang's future top chef.

197
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,800
Alright, alright.

198
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,680
Hurry.

199
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,060
(Tongque Tavern)

200
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,230
You truly live up to your reputation.

201
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,140
Thanks, Mr. and Mrs. Li,
for your compliments.

202
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,520
We will continue to improve.

203
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,460
I'm planning to hold
a lantern riddle gathering

204
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,100
on the night of the 15th

205
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,880
and invite all the unmarried young men

206
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,740
and women from the county.

207
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,960
Why not

208
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,740
hold it here at Tongque Tavern?

209
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,570
We can have a lively gathering.

210
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,060
Thanks, Mr. Li,
for this wonderful opportunity.

211
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,980
It's settled then.

212
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,610
On the 15th,

213
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,580
I'll bring my wife and daughter

214
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,860
to support you.

215
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,410
We'll be expecting you.

216
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,790
By the way,
don't make it public just yet.

217
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,720
Mr. Li, Mrs. Li, please take care.

218
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:50,770
Come on.

219
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,860
Mr. Gu,

220
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,260
we lost 30 percent today.

221
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,700
Just 30 percent is fine.

222
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,580
If this continues,

223
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,600
we might lose 30 percent
for three days in a row.

224
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,590
It's alright.

225
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,460
It's just three days.

226
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:12,790
Not just that.

227
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,980
Considering the food waste
from the kitchen,

228
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,340
after three days,

229
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,770
we might lose up to 60 percent.

230
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,020
Are you done yet?

231
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,220
Then let's show them
who's really in charge.

232
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,000
Let's show Gu Ping'an

233
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,670
