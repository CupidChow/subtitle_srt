1
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,439
All right

2
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,479
Game over

3
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:53,520
I'm done playing with you guys

4
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,439
Don't go

5
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,439
Untie me

6
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,520
Wait a sec

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,320
Were you laughing at me just now?

8
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,760
You always bully me

9
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,719
Now

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,879
You

11
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,159
Kiss me

12
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,480
And I'll forgive you

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,319
I can't move right now

14
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,280
How about this

15
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,400
I'll make a sacrifice

16
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,159
I'll kiss you

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,400
You

18
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:34,680
Happy now?

19
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,480
Let's go

20
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,200
Me?

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,760
Not you

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,359
Boss Chu

23
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,840
How did he do it?

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,840
A standard AI Eye

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,480
could never hack my glove

26
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,000
Unless his Eye has upgraded again

27
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,359
Possessing a treasure is a crime

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,079
Huo Ming

29
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,359
You're dead

30
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,719
The great hero Huo is back

31
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,240
I'm so sleepy

32
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm going to sleep

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,680
Sit down

34
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,719
You took Lao Ding

35
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,080
but didn't take me, right?

36
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,080
No

37
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,400
It's mainly because Lao Ding

38
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,680
is more familiar with Du Sze's club

39
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,759
You're not jealous of Lao Ding, are you?

40
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,680
You're still making excuses

41
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,159
Do you know how worried I was about you?

42
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,599
Have some fruit and veggie smoothie

43
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,280
You'll feel better after drinking it

44
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,520
How is it?

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,680
Feel any better?

46
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,840
Just so-so

47
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,159
Of course

48
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,120
I was mainly worried you'd be in danger

49
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,360
The most critical thing is

50
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,680
I didn't want you

51
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,120
to see Chu Chen

52
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,080
So you were the one being jealous

53
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,520
Being jealous

54
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,000
Forgive me?

55
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,039
Forgive you?

56
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,599
You lied to me twice

57
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,199
I'm keeping score

58
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,240
Liar

59
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,199
Alright, alright, alright

60
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,120
Let me show you something

61
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,319
You got it

62
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,919
There's a problem with Fu Xue's password

63
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,560
Xiao Cang

64
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,560
Connect to surveillance

65
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,319
Locate Fu Xue

66
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,439
Surveillance connected

67
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,639
Searching for Fu Xue

68
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,039
I see

69
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,439
her leaving here with a bag

70
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,480
It looks like

71
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,040
she must have discovered something

72
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,800
Her phone isn't going through now

73
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
Nearby surveillance

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,639
can't track her trail either

75
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,079
She must be hiding

76
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,480
Now, until Cang Qiong self-destructs

77
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,720
there's only half a day left

78
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,800
If we don't find her

79
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,439
all our efforts will be wasted

80
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,079
Don't worry

81
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,600
I will find her

82
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,399
Time is tight

83
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Let's split up

84
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,639
Okay

85
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,920
Xiao Cang

86
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,639
I'll search for Fu Xue's whereabouts with you

87
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,720
Yes, Master

88
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,240
Impressive

89
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,680
This is too exhausting

90
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:20,959
What's wrong with me?

91
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,680
Master

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,839
Although time is stretched here

93
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,839
it actually consumes your brain power

94
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,079
Let me help you relax

95
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,839
So thoughtful, Xiao Cang

96
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,839
Xiao Cang

97
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,639
Massage my shoulders again.

98
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,720
But...

99
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,680
my program settings

100
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,279
are to massage from head to toe.

101
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,720
To massage the shoulders,

102
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,120
I have to start all over again.

103
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,399
Why are you so rigid?

104
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,639
Can't you redo the parts you've already done?

105
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,160
Wait a minute.

106
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,000
The places already touched...

107
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,240
cannot be touched again.

108
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,279
So if you were a puzzle fanatic,

109
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,800
would you go back to places you've been?

110
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,879
It sounds strange,

111
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,920
but it makes sense.

112
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,120
So,

113
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,680
the places the researchers have been to before

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,120
are the safest places.

115
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,279
You are right, Master.

116
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,720
The first three researchers

117
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,920
were found in public places.

118
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,600
The fourth researcher and Professor Ning

119
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,000
were found outdoors.

120
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,240
Only Professor Yang has her own apartment.

121
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,040
Therefore,

122
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,360
she is likely at

123
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,639
Professor Yang's apartment.

124
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,079
Master, you are so smart.

125
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,079
Go quickly.

126
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,639
Huo Ming.

127
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,600
Are you okay?

128
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,680
How did you find me?

129
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,319
The most dangerous place

130
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,720
is the safest place.

131
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,639
All seven Cang Qiong researchers have been found.

132
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,639
That means all seven passwords should be correct.

133
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,439
However,

134
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,279
Cang Qiong still cannot be activated.

135
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,839
If we cannot

136
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,120
activate Cang Qiong today,

137
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,079
it will initiate its self-destruct sequence.

138
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,079
I'm sorry, Huo Ming.

139
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,920
I'm not actually a researcher.

140
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,639
The password I gave you

141
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,759
was fake.

142
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,319
Why did you lie to me?

143
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,639
I am your father's student.

144
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,439
Before he left, he asked me to protect you.

145
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,199
I approached you on purpose

146
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,639
just to help you recharge

147
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,839
and repair the AI Eye.

148
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,240
I'm sorry I lied to you,

149
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,000
but I had no other choice.

150
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,639
This was the only way

151
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,600
I could protect the real researcher.

152
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,519
Then who is the real researcher?

153
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,639
I'm still investigating.

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,839
I have a blurry piece of evidence now.

155
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,519
The real researcher

156
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,639
is right in here.

157
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,120
I've checked everyone whose face is visible.

158
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,920
None of them are the one.

159
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,040
They must be in the damaged half.

160
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,600
Can I still trust you?

161
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,000
Huo Ming, you finally remembered me.

162
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,039
-I thought you forgot me. -Xiao Hui.

163
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:48,799
Xiao Hui.

164
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,480
I came to see you for something.

165
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,200
Xiao Hui.

166
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,039
You're not allowed to forget me again.

167
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,759
Okay, okay.

168
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,120
Xiao Hui,

169
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,320
I really need your help with something.

170
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,320
What is so urgent?

171
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,440
This photo...

172
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,879
I need the original version.

173
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,159
Time is tight and it's urgent.

174
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,879
Only the Bai Family can do this.

175
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,200
Xiao Hui, please.

176
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:14,799
This...

177
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,840
Butler, look at the photo I sent you.

178
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,799
Find me the original copy.

179
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,600
As fast as possible.

180
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,320
It's an emergency.

181
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,399
Get everyone to look for it.

182
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,360
Xiao Hui.

183
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,879
I have to go check other places for clues.

184
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,799
Thank you.

185
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,240
You're welcome.

186
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,039
Don't go. Wait for me.

187
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Thank you, Xiao Hui.

188
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,080
Thanks for your trouble.

189
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,200
Don't just say it.

190
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,840
How do you plan to repay me?

191
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,320
After this is over,

192
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,879
I'll do whatever you say.

193
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,919
You said it!

194
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,240
Xiao Cang, start the search.

195
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,120
Searching.

Information matching for 23 people complete.

197
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,440
None of them are the researcher.

198
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,159
Unable to match the three with erased faces.

199
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,639
It seems the real researcher...

200
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,879
...is among these three.

201
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,679
Xiao Cang.

202
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:27,799
This ring...

203
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,799
Why does it look so much like Lin Yun's?

204
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,639
Zoom in. Restore.

205
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,879
Restoring and matching.

206
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,399
100% match.

207
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,000
Master, it's not just similar.

208
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,440
This is Lin Yun's ring.

209
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,639
Could the real researcher...

210
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,919
...be Lin Yun?

211
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,000
Brainiac.

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,799
Lin Yun.

213
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,200
You're too naive.

214
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,519
Don't you know you are the researcher?

215
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,320
What?
