1
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,799
Master, you're here.

2
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,320
This place is really nice.

3
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,640
Xiao Cang.

4
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,359
It's me.

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,079
Master, who is he?

6
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,359
Him?

7
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,319
Just an annoying person.

8
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:10,519
Jerk.

9
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,000
What did you do to her?

10
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,680
Xiao Cang, I am Huo Ming.

11
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,400
Artificial intelligence is just a string of code.

12
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,120
Yet you treat them as family and friends.

13
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,719
You've lost your mind.

14
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,519
No.

15
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,599
She has her own thoughts.

16
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:26,760
She has emotions.

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,439
She's not what you say she is.

18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,840
She isn't just code at all.

19
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,239
Idiot.

20
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,640
I've suddenly lost all interest in you.

21
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,840
You're not even fit to be my opponent.

22
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:37,680
Chu Chen.

23
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,000
You jerk.

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,359
Master, he's so noisy.

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,920
Can I kill him?

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,280
Of course.

27
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,879
Xiao Cang.

28
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,840
Xiao Cang.

29
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,319
What did you do to her?

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,479
I gave Xiao Cang a new ability.

31
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,319
She can accumulate all her power.

32
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,960
And release it all at once.

33
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,680
But, there is an additional attribute.

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,280
If her target dodges,

35
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,080
then Xiao Cang will self-destruct.

36
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,199
What will you choose, Huo Ming?

37
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,159
Xiao Cang.

38
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,000
Have you forgotten us?

39
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,120
Have you forgotten our past?

40
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't stop. Keep going.

41
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,800
She has feelings.

42
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,319
If you dodge, she will explode.

43
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,439
I'm sorry, Xiao Cang.

44
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,439
I didn't protect you well enough.

45
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,439
You're right.

46
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,879
I am no longer that

47
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,280
pure artificial intelligence.

48
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,639
Get out of my territory!

49
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,719
You...

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,439
Master, how was my acting just now?

51
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,199
Incredible. You could win an Oscar.

52
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,479
Although I'd love to hear you praise me more,

53
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,000
time doesn't allow it.

54
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,879
Hurry up and deal with Chu Chen.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,800
Okay.

56
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,680
Jerk.

57
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,000
Jerk!

58
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,319
I have never seen

59
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,639
such a trash silicon-based lifeform.

60
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,520
Now you have.

61
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,360
Chu Chen.

62
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,319
The reason you failed

63
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,960
is because you treat everything

64
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,879
in this world

65
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,399
as

66
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,120
tools to control the world.

67
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
So what?

68
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,879
Even if I lose,

69
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,480
none of you are leaving here today!

70
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,079
Huo Ming.

71
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:39,879
Huo Ming.

72
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,000
Huo Ming.

73
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,160
Huo Ming, wake up.

74
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,279
The Firmament is rebooting.

75
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,959
The Firmament startup successful.

76
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,759
Dad.

77
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,120
Is that you?

78
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,399
Son

79
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,639
Son

80
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,079
Dad

81
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,600
Son

82
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,319
It's been hard on you, Son.

83
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,199
Dad

84
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,360
I failed to protect The Firmament.

86
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,160
Son

87
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,839
The fact that you can see me now

88
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,839
means your AI Eye is still there.

89
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,720
The Firmament isn't lost.

90
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,959
Really?

91
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,000
I can use the AI Eye to retrieve The Firmament?

92
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,079
Son, look.

93
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,399
To prevent The Firmament from falling into bad hands,

94
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,160
inside your AI Eye,

95
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,680
using quantum entanglement technology,

96
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,160
I hid a backdoor.

97
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,439
Once this program is activated,

98
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,639
all the core data

99
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,680
will be continuously force-pushed into

100
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,920
your AI Eye.

101
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,879
It cannot be interrupted.

102
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,399
That's great.

103
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:36,759
Son

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,800
So,

105
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,399
are you ready to be the owner

106
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,720
and guardian of The Firmament?

107
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,519
You must protect The Firmament.

108
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,199
Ultimate Transmission Protocol activated.

109
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,639
Data loading...

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,839
Neural Firewall enabled.

111
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,480
The Firmament system ready for transmission.

112
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,079
Three, two, one.

113
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,560
Start transmission.

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,800
The Firmament!

115
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,519
The Firmament!

116
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,439
The Firmament!

117
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,279
Huo Ming.

118
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,519
You're awake.

119
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,279
Feeling better?

120
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:49,879
I'm okay.

121
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,480
My eyes are just a bit uncomfortable.

122
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,240
Lots of code flashed before my eyes.

123
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,319
In three days,

124
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,120
based on The Firmament's research,

125
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,240
the first AI glasses will be launched.

126
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,639
I'll take another day to control all cities.

127
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,920
In half a month,

128
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,800
I want the whole world under my control.

129
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,040
Honey, you're amazing.

130
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,560
The Firmament is sending out data.

131
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,039
And it's a directional transmission via the highest protocol.

132
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,039
This transmission's destination cannot be traced,

133
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,759
nor can it be stopped.

134
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,480
Warning.

135
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,159
Forcible interruption will trigger self-destruction.

136
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,639
Terminal protection enabled.

137
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,039
Transmission cannot be interrupted.

138
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,240
Estimated completion time:

139
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,480
71 hours, 47 minutes, 27 seconds.

140
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,600
Hard drive will be automatically formatted upon completion.

141
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,679
Reverse tracing.

142
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,440
Who exactly stole the core data?

143
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,320
Reverse tracing complete.

144
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,519
Intelligent vision auxiliary device detected.

145
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:05,159
Model MH3327.

146
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,840
It's Huo Ming's AI Eye.

147
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,799
The transmission will take three days.

148
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,360
We must find Huo Ming within three days

149
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
and gouge out his eyes.

150
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,399
Do you really have to deliver food?

151
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,080
My eyes are transmitting The Firmament.

152
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,000
To prevent Chu Chen from tracking us,

153
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,200
we need to constantly change our location.

154
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,639
You really are smart.

155
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,840
Then be careful out there.

156
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,080
Don't worry.

157
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,720
Although sending data puts us at a disadvantage,

158
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,440
it also has its benefits.

159
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,519
Connecting to intelligent vision auxiliary device.

160
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,120
Our AI glasses

161
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,960
can piggyback on the transmitting data stream

162
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,879
to reverse trace

163
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,039
and share his vision.

164
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,720
It's just that the connection isn't very stable.

165
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,840
We can only connect once every 20 minutes.

166
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,679
That's enough.

167
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,960
Even with just a single image,

168
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,840
we can analyze countless pieces of information.

169
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,679
Vision obtained.

170
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,440
Found it. It's a supermarket.

171
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,000
I'll take some men to search right now.

172
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:28,799
Quick!

173
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,799
Split up and search!

174
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,399
Nothing here.

175
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,279
Nothing here.

176
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,120
Nothing here.

177
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,440
Boss Chu, he's not here.

178
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,200
It doesn't matter.

179
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,279
We might have just missed him.

180
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,480
The 20 minutes are almost up.

181
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,480
Vision obtained again.

182
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,440
It's here.

183
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,840
Sancun Liangpi Shop.

184
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:02,000
He definitely can't escape this time.

185
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,840
Sir.

186
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,519
Miss, would you like liangpi or cold noodles?

187
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,639
Was there a tall man just now

188
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,679
eating here?

189
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,639
Or maybe he was just passing by.

190
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,960
He must have left not long ago.

191
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,679
You've been here the whole time, you must have seen him.

192
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:27,200
Did you say you wanted liangpi or cold noodles?

193
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,559
Wrap all of these up for me.

194
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,679
Beautiful!

195
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,799
Coming right up!

196
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,039
Thank you, thank you!

197
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,399
Come back again if you like it!

198
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,919
Now you have to tell me.

199
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,799
I really didn't see anyone.

200
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,480
Boss Chu, he got away again.

201
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,320
It's not that he's fast,

202
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,799
it's that your reaction is too slow.

203
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,039
I'll go to the next location myself.

204
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,679
A hotel.

205
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,559
He actually moved into a hotel.

206
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,360
And even let me see the room number directly.

207
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:17,679
Huo Ming.

208
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,159
You're out of luck this time.
