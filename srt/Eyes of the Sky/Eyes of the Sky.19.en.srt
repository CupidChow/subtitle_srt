1
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,840
The Firmament and the seven passwords have been secured.

2
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,680
Good girl.

3
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,560
That's the woman I love most.

4
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,840
Wait for me.

5
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,400
I've finally found you.

6
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:07,359
The Firmament.

7
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,919
Analysis complete.

8
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,400
The Firmament's data capacity is immense.

9
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,280
Decoding will take a long time.

10
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:15,199
Begin now?

11
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,080
Keep an eye on it.

12
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,159
Don't relax for a second.

13
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,159
Yes, sir.

14
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,240
As long as you behave.

15
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,360
The Firmament is mine.

16
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,120
And yours too.

17
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,919
Cheers.

18
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,280
Forget Huo Ming.

19
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,879
Being with me is the best choice.

20
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,039
Yes.

21
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,199
Forget Huo Ming.

22
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,919
You mean Lin Yun is controlled by Chu Chen?

23
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,280
That's right.

24
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,879
That jerk pretended to help Lin Yun recover her memory.

25
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,639
But actually implanted a virus program inside.

26
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,240
Don't worry.

27
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,280
I will help you.

28
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,639
My connection program is in here.

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,599
It can connect to surveillance and seize control.

30
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,240
However...

31
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
I need the energy from your AI Eye.

32
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,080
We must get within a certain distance.

33
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,280
I understand.

34
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,120
Careful.

35
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,439
I hear something.

36
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,519
The surveillance blind spot here is too small.

37
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,120
There's no room for both of us like this.

38
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,399
I have a way.

39
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,279
Let's focus on hacking in first.

40
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,480
After the camera shuts down...

41
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,279
...laser protection mode activates automatically.

42
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,000
I'll handle it for you.

43
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,120
Control secured.

44
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,360
I'll go save Lin Yun first.

45
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,959
Xiao Cang.

46
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,399
Scan Lin Yun's status.

47
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,600
Master.

48
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,199
Lin Yun is still under control.

49
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,920
Since you're already here...

50
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,560
...won't you come in and sit for a while?

51
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:55,759
Lin Yun.

52
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,399
Don't move.

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,639
One move and she gets deleted.

54
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:07,920
Xiao Cang.

55
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,319
Can you connect to The Firmament's hard drive?

56
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:09,920
Master.

57
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,319
He has successfully activated The Firmament.

58
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,319
It is currently decoding.

59
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,480
There is nothing I can do.

60
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,759
I won't fight for The Firmament anymore.

61
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Exchange it for Lin Yun.

62
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,519
The Firmament is mine.

63
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,920
Lin Yun is also mine.

64
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,439
Trading my things for my things?

65
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,839
Is your eyesight bad...

66
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,120
...or is your brain bad too?

67
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,680
Don't celebrate too early.

68
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,759
Careful, joy often turns to sorrow.

69
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,439
Sorrow?

70
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,639
I have The Firmament here.

71
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,759
I have the beauty here too.

72
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,519
I'm so happy I could fly.

73
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:53,560
Xiao Cang.

74
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,680
Connect to available devices.

75
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,399
Master.

76
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,360
The interference from The Firmament's decoding is too strong.

77
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,600
We need to get closer.

78
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,839
Even if you get The Firmament...

79
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,920
...using these methods...

80
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,959
...you won't get her heart.

81
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,439
Heart?

82
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,680
She is right here.

83
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,959
Her heart belongs to me too.

84
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,800
And my heart belongs to her.

85
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,480
Still trying to hack my Gauntlet?

86
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:27,319
I won't fall for the same trick twice.

87
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,319
You're not my father's student

88
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,319
That's right

89
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
She's always been one of mine

90
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:53,759
Huo Ming is awake

91
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,000
The AI Eye has restarted too

92
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,560
He's the key to cracking The Firmament

93
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,360
I'm abroad right now and can't return

94
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:03,279
Find a way to win his trust

95
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,360
Get close to him

96
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,519
Keep an eye on him

97
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,319
Don't worry

98
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,160
I'll take good care of him

99
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,680
Back then,

100
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,879
I really did want to be Professor Huo's student

101
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,399
It's a pity

102
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,839
He wouldn't take me

103
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,000
He died

104
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,279
But I haven't forgiven him

105
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,960
So,

106
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,320
I'll just have to take my revenge on you

107
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,759
Take him away

108
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,120
I want to see exactly

109
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,919
what secrets his eyes hold

110
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,600
You performed very well just now

111
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,039
Decoding complete

112
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,799
Initiating The Firmament

113
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,080
Wait for me outside

114
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,120
Yes, sir

115
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,000
Master, wake up

116
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,000
You were in a deep coma

117
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,519
I'm trying to wake you up

118
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,679
Just hold on a little longer

119
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,360
Done

120
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,080
Xiao Cang

121
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,600
There's a problem with Lin Yun's retrieved memories

122
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,759
See if you can clear and restore them

123
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,519
Without hurting her

124
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,120
I've connected to her ring

125
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,840
Target her brain now

126
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,120
I'll perform the counter-hypnosis

127
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:14,840
Clear

128
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,720
Lin Yun

129
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,519
Huo Ming

130
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,600
Are you okay?

131
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,679
I can't believe I just...

132
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,320
It wasn't your fault

133
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,279
That wasn't you just now

134
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:40,519
All these years,

135
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,240
I've been obsessed with researching technology

136
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,039
I never thought I'd be controlled by it

137
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,320
and become someone else's puppet

138
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,639
If anyone is to blame,

139
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,320
it's that jerk Chu Chen

140
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,120
But the worst part is,

141
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,919
he's already cracked The Firmament

142
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,320
Neither of us is a match for him

143
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,159
You have to leave with me right now

144
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:57,960
Let's go

145
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,039
Barging into someone else's room

146
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:02,279
isn't very polite, Huo Ming

147
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,000
Pretend I'm not awake yet

148
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,639
Okay

149
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,240
You're in the wrong room, baby

150
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,960
Come here

151
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,759
Yes

152
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,120
Fresh from an upgrade,

153
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,600
and you're already showing off?

154
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,080
Aren't you afraid of glitches?

155
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,879
My Gauntlet

156
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,480
already carried part of The Firmament's tech

157
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,120
It shares the same origin as The Firmament

158
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,320
It will only be stronger

159
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,879
Once I load all the code,

160
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,799
I'll be able to control every electronic device,

161
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,399
the entire internet,

162
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,480
and even...

163
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,240
humans.

164
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,759
When that time comes, the whole world

165
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:41,720
will be under my control

166
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:43,960
Chu Chen

167
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,200
Stop this

168
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,000
You're too arrogant

169
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,159
No, no, no

170
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,159
This is the real me

171
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,360
I will be the one who controls everything

172
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,879
You're not leaving today

173
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,720
That's not for sure

174
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,720
You have a Xiao Cang's Space, right?

175
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,120
I'd actually like to see it

176
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,799
Master, you're here

177
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,600
This place is quite nice

178
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,159
Xiao Cang
