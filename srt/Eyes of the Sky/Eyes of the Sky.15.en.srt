1
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,560
This is a copy of Cang Qiong

2
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,480
The passwords of five researchers

3
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,879
are all in here

4
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,799
Fu Xue and Shen Meng's passwords

5
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,159
are all with Huo Ming

6
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,359
I planted a Phantom Virus in him

7
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,000
This virus can trigger

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,439
the deepest fears in his heart

9
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,560
That kind of childhood fear

10
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,480
will force him to shut down the AI Eye

11
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,159
He's acting like a fool right now

12
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,239
It's the best chance to catch him

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,799
Xiao Cang

14
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,879
Xiao Cang

15
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,759
There's a ghost!

16
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,960
There's a ghost! There's a ghost!

17
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,800
System intrusion detected. Forcing shutdown

18
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:22,840
Countdown

19
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,759
Three

20
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,800
Two

21
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,840
One

22
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,439
Why didn't you wait for me last night?

23
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,479
Who are you?

24
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,080
Where am I?

25
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
Who are you?

26
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,039
I'm Huo Ming, Employee ID 9527

27
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,439
Five-Star Delivery Guy

28
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,560
I am Lin Yun, Employee ID 9528

29
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,719
I'm your colleague

30
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,080
Nice to meet you

31
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,879
I have a new order

32
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:01,840
Go ahead

33
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:03,879
Stop

34
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,319
Don't worry, I'll deliver it on time

35
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,039
Huo Ming

36
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,400
How do you plan to catch him?

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,039
He'll come over to deliver food soon

38
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,759
How do you know?

39
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,840
Because I ordered the takeout

40
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,159
Could the AI Eye function be disabled?

41
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,840
Hello, your delivery is here

42
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,240
Bring it in

43
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,479
Put it here

44
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:44,680
Wait a moment

45
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,439
The water pipe in my house is broken

46
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,599
Help me fix it

47
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,560
Sorry, I don't know how to fix pipes

48
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,759
But you fixed it for me last time

49
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,560
Sorry, I forgot

50
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,400
Looks like he really has turned into a fool

51
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,599
I still have deliveries to make

52
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,719
Enjoy your meal

53
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,639
I'm leaving now

54
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,360
The takeout is spilled

55
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,879
I didn't spill it

56
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,800
The takeout is spilled. I'm giving you a bad review

57
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,560
I didn't do it

58
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,879
You can't give me a bad review

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,400
Fine, then fix the pipe for me

60
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,759
and I won't give you a bad review

61
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,680
Sorry, I don't know how to fix pipes

62
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,839
It's okay, I'll teach you

63
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,600
Article 18 of the Employee Handbook

64
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,560
No physical contact with customers

65
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,560
Don't be like this

66
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,079
Huo Ming

67
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,079
Hello, I don't know you

68
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Who are you?

69
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,560
I'm Huo Ming, Employee ID 9527

70
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,680
Harassing customers leads to complaints

71
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,160
Please don't file a complaint

72
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,800
If you don't want a complaint

73
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,759
you have to hand over something

74
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,800
Sorry, I don't know what you're talking about

75
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,199
There is something

76
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,639
It's right on you

77
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,439
But it doesn't belong to you

78
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,000
Think carefully, what do you have

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,279
that doesn't belong to you?

80
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,519
Think

81
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,600
I really don't know what there is

82
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,600
I'll give you everything I have, okay?

83
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,439
Th- This...

84
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,160
I don't know whose this is

85
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,240
Give it to me

86
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,439
Can you not file a complaint?

87
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:09,480
Don't worry, I won't complain

88
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll even give you a five-star rating, okay?

89
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,360
Thank you

90
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,240
You're welcome

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,800
Go now

92
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,439
Won't you say goodbye to me?

93
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,560
Goodbye

94
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,720
Goodbye

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,639
Huo Ming, are you okay?

96
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,319
Here, are you okay?

97
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,240
Thank you

98
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,680
9528, hurry up and deliver your orders

99
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,160
I'm going to be late too

100
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,839
Huo Ming

101
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,279
Xiao Qing

102
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,879
Check where Huo Ming is. Immediately.

103
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,600
President Lin.

104
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,600
We found Huo Ming delivering food near the company.

105
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,199
What do you think you're doing?

106
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,240
Why are you touching my bike?

107
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,439
I just wanted to straighten it.

108
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,439
I didn't do anything.

109
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,560
Straighten it?

110
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,600
I saw you.

111
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,839
Did you break my bike?

112
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,360
Aren't you just bullying me?

113
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,319
You broke my bike. I'm gonna beat you up.

114
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,079
It wasn't me.

115
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,439
I'll beat you to death.

116
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,639
No deliveries allowed inside.

117
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,839
I'm going to be late.

118
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,959
Why can't I go in?

119
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,959
New company rule.

120
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,079
I said no entry, so no entry.

121
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:48,560
Get lost.

122
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,959
I'm going to be late.

123
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,759
Get lost, idiot. Get lost.

124
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,279
Huo Ming.

125
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,439
Then can I go in?

126
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,839
President Lin, please come in.

127
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:00,480
9528, my delivery is going to be late.

128
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,360
Let's go. I'll help you deliver it.

129
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,800
Come home with me after we're done.

130
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,759
Thank you, 9528.

131
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,000
Incorrect password. Login failed.

132
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,560
It must be that kid Huo Ming.

133
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,199
He gave us a fake password.

134
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,480
He dares to trick me? I'll turn his house upside down.

135
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,959
Watch the steps.

136
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,960
This isn't my home.

137
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,159
This *is* your home.

138
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,120
Look.

139
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,320
These are your favorite plants.

140
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,879
Aren't they?

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
This coffee table.

142
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,799
Your favorite potted plants.

143
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,200
You arranged them so neatly.

144
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,960
You take care of them every day.

145
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,840
Do you remember now?

146
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:04,600
There's a ghost! A ghost!

147
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,799
Don't be afraid. What's wrong?

148
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,279
There's a ghost!

149
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,200
Where is the ghost?

150
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,200
There's a ghost in the TV.

151
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,039
Don't be afraid. Wait a second.

152
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:23,679
Don't be afraid.

153
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,440
I've covered it up.

154
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,480
Take a look.

155
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,279
Look.

156
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:31,039
Look, it's gone, right?

157
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,840
There's still a corner.

158
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,399
There's a ghost!

159
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,039
Scaredy-cat.

160
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,799
Can't see it now, right? Scaredy-cat.

161
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,480
There's still a corner.

162
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,000
She's going to crawl out again.

163
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,440
Wait a second.

164
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,679
Huo Ming.

165
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,600
I've covered it up.

166
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,799
Take a look.

167
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,799
Put the pillow down, okay?

168
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm right here.

169
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,639
I'm here with you.

170
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,879
Look.

171
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,000
Sadako is gone, right?

172
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,440
Lin Yun.

173
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,240
Long time no see.

174
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,000
Don't be afraid. Wait for me.

175
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,200
Du Sze, this is my house.

176
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,360
How did you get in?

177
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,480
Don't be nervous, President Lin.

178
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,639
I'm just here to settle a score with Huo Ming.

179
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,840
Get out.

180
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,399
Or I'll sue you for trespassing.

181
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,039
Let go of me.

182
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,480
So what if I'm trespassing?

183
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,799
Huo Ming, look out!

184
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:20,720
You big idiot, look at you now.

185
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,039
The TV is showing!

186
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,919
The TV!

187
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:23,320
The TV!

188
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,080
Get lost.

189
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,159
Stop it!

190
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,840
You're bleeding.

191
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,399
Blood. Scared?

192
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,200
The TV is showing!

193
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,960
Scared?

194
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,159
Still on about the TV?

195
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,000
The TV... The TV is showing!

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You idiot. Useless trash.

197
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,039
Huo Ming.

198
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:46,960
Huo Ming.

199
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,480
You're of no use anymore.

200
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,799
Go to hell.
