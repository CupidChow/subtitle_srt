1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,840
You have a new delivery order

2
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,880
Please check and accept it

3
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,320
Who?

4
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,840
Stop!

5
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,479
President Lin.

6
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,039
Did you see his face clearly?

7
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,680
Mind-Bender has been posing as a delivery driver.

8
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:17,039
I just received the surveillance video from the archives.

9
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,719
The one who helped us solve the problem

10
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,680
was also a delivery driver.

11
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:21,639
Look.

12
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,560
Have you investigated his identity?

13
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,960
Based on big data analysis,

14
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,000
this person is indeed a delivery driver.

15
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,800
And he seems to have some intelligence issues.

16
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,680
It seems his name is

17
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,680
Huo Ming.

18
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,000
You know him, President Lin?

19
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,280
Three years.

20
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,479
Huo Ming, you've finally appeared.

21
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,800
Activate the company's latest

22
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,719
AI tracking technology

23
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,240
to find his current location immediately.

24
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,639
How can an AI system

25
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,680
change its own appearance?

26
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,280
Master,

27
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,960
what I wear is determined by your consciousness.

28
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,960
If you are not satisfied, Master,

29
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,840
I can change my outfit right here.

30
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,280
No need.

31
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,639
Help me check Professor Yang's room.

32
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,080
See if there's any news about The Firmament.

33
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,719
I've scanned it many times.

34
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,159
This set of photos

35
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,240
seems to have a problem.

36
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,240
Photos?

37
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,560
Search more thoroughly.

38
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:13,280
Okay.

39
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,439
I've already used Quantum Heuristic Bayesian Decoding,

40
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,280
superimposed with the Epsilon Hidden Sequence,

41
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,360
and applied a Fractal Recursive Hash Verification.

42
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,719
The verification failed.

43
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,800
I re-substituted the Popchevlov Function's

44
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,000
Adaptive Chaos Model

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,280
to generate the underlying logic,

46
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,439
but that also failed.

47
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,560
Xiao Cang,

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
what are you talking about?

49
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,800
I suspect

50
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,159
that it's just a QR code.

51
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,319
It's just a QR code?

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,240
Video message detected.

53
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,360
Read it?

54
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,400
Read.

55
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,199
Son,

56
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,759
if you are seeing this video,

57
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,479
it means you have survived.

58
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,599
A treasure invites disaster upon us.

59
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:57,639
We are being targeted.

60
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,560
In the laboratory,

61
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,759
there are two top-tier scientific achievements.

62
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,719
One is the AI Eyeball.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,039
I gave it to you.

64
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,360
The other is The Firmament.

65
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,680
Only an AI Eyeball loaded with The Firmament

66
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,159
can become a complete Super-Entity.

67
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,479
Go find the strongest version of yourself.

68
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,480
Help me find the truth of what happened back then.

69
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:21,959
Dad...

70
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,879
Don't worry.

71
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,600
I will definitely find The Firmament

72
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,360
and uncover the truth of the past.

73
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:31,839
Here are your noodles.

74
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,120
Thanks.

75
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,040
Lin Yun?

76
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,079
How did she find this place?

77
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,720
Master,

78
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,160
I've detected that Lin Yun is also looking for The Firmament.

79
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,600
I suggest you continue playing the fool.

80
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:46,839
Huo Ming.

81
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,279
So you are still alive.

82
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,399
I've finally found you.

83
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,519
You... who are you?

84
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,600
I'm Lin Yun.

85
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,399
We lived in the same courtyard when we were kids.

86
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,399
Your dad and my dad were colleagues.

87
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,120
You're actually pretending not to know me?

88
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,399
I know you've been to the company

89
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,319
and even helped me.

90
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,839
It seems she came prepared.

91
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,079
They are bad.

92
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,759
Wanted to steal things and hit people.

93
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,879
According to Article 51 of the Staff Regulations,

94
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,079
I subjected them to criticism and education.

95
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,199
I wonder if I can fool her.

96
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,040
Still playing the fool.

97
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,680
You're right.

98
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,319
Thank you.

99
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,920
President Lin.

100
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,560
Master,

101
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,480
dangerous individuals detected approaching.

102
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,480
They are carrying weapons.

103
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,120
They seem to be coming for Lin Yun.

104
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,920
You brat, it's you again.

105
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,000
Get him out of here.

106
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,439
Watch him closely.

107
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,879
Don't ruin my plans again.

108
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,519
Hello, President Lin.

109
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,839
So you were bought off by Du Size long ago.

110
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,319
Don't blame me, President Lin

111
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,399
President Du just pays more

112
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:06,199
I take the money, I solve the problem

113
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,759
This is a Neural Inhibitor

114
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,399
It'll make you obediently listen to me

115
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,480
The data on The Firmament is still at your company

116
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,720
The company transfer contract

117
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,240
Sign it

118
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,279
It seems Du Size wants The Firmament too

119
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,319
Master

120
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,199
It is C05 Neural Inhibitor

121
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,279
It can cause her to act irrationally

122
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,040
And be at the mercy of others

123
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:37,839
After them!

124
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,399
Xiao Cang

125
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,800
Find me a place where I can take action

126
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,199
Planning route

127
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,600
Chase them!

128
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,519
Go straight for 263 meters

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,759
Turn left, Master

130
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,720
Obstacle ahead

131
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
No one within a 500-meter radius

132
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,759
You can show off to your heart's content

133
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,240
You stinking fool

134
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,920
Run! Keep running!

135
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,600
Bring the contract over here

136
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:09,839
Come on, come on

137
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,680
Darn it

138
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:19,800
Beat him to death!

139
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,519
Xiao Cang

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,040
Activate Slow-Motion Mode

141
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,639
According to Article 19 of the Staff Regulations

142
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,000
one must be flexible in emergencies

143
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,560
Appease the customer's emotions

144
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,120
You guys won't file a complaint, right?

145
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:58,519
Thanks

146
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,959
Master, stop showing off

147
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
Lin Yun is in danger

148
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,600
She cannot clear the inhibitor on her own

149
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,600
You need to wake her up using my method

150
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,839
Just stimulate three neurons

151
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,720
Located at the collarbone, thigh, and calf

152
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,800
That will do it

153
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,360
In broad daylight

154
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,879
This isn't appropriate, is it?

155
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,800
Rest assured, Master

156
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,360
No passersby detected nearby

157
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,040
Saving her is what matters

158
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,600
Alright then

159
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,680
First, collarbone depth 0.25 centimeters

160
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,160
Press for 0.18 seconds

161
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,200
Then touch the thigh and calf simultaneously

162
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,559
Up then down, reverse push and rub

163
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,759
Pervert!

164
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,879
You dropped your bag

165
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
Pick... pick up bag

166
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,159
He was able to neutralize the inhibitor so quickly

167
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,879
A fool couldn't possibly do that

168
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
I need to test him again

169
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,679
Let's go. Come with me somewhere

170
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,480
How much longer do I have to play the fool?

171
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,679
Why did she bring me to her home?

172
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,639
Master

173
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,000
Lin Yun's intentions are unclear

174
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,559
You'd better keep playing the fool

175
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,879
So big

176
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,159
To thank you for helping me

177
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,559
you will live here from now on

178
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,759
I will take care of you

179
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,200
Article 27 of the Staff Regulations

180
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,480
do not stay in a customer's home

181
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,600
I have to go

182
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,360
Wait

183
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,639
Come with me

184
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,120
Look

185
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,480
This is your home

186
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,480
Looks like she prepared in advance

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,559
She actually moved all my stuff here

188
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,759
Not tidy

189
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:00,759
Huo Ming

190
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,879
Let's see how long you can keep pretending

191
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,320
Sorry, Huo Ming

192
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:05,440
I took the liberty

193
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,000
of having people move your things here

194
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,080
From now on, you can stay here with peace of mind

195
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,519
Cute

196
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
You can't even beat a fool

197
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,039
What use are you to me?

198
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,519
President Du

199
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,399
Give me one more chance

200
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,080
Sit

201
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,720
Sit

202
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,720
Don't be nervous, Lao Ding

203
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,639
I'll give you a chance right now

204
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,679
This is Neurotoxin A13,

205
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,320
extracted from a viper.

206
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,679
It amplifies pain sensitivity fivefold.

207
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,159
Since you want a chance,

208
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,679
I'll let you test its effects first.

209
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,360
The effects look promising.

210
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,600
It can be used against Huo Ming.

211
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,840
Sisi, handle this yourself.

212
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,480
Let him experience

213
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,200
a fate worse than death.

214
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,120
Yes.

215
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,919
President Lin, I've investigated.

216
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,519
Huo Ming really is a fool.

217
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,679
His colleagues say

218
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,480
he just recites the Staff Regulations all day.

219
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,080
He's been foolish for over two years.

220
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,080
Huo Ming was a genius from a young age.

221
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,399
Now that he's suddenly returned,

222
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,919
and he's so agile,

223
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,440
he doesn't seem truly foolish.

224
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,360
Master, you haven't done enough.

225
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,879
You need to act even more foolish.

226
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,159
President Lin suspects he's pretending.

227
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,919
But why would he pretend?

228
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,759
He must be here for The Firmament.

229
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,679
As for his motive,

230
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:21,440
keep a close eye on him.

231
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
If you find any clues,

232
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,279
contact me immediately.
