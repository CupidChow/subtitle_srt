1
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,799
Of the few of us,

2
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,960
I was the last person to see Huo Haiyang.

3
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,759
His demeanor and actions at the time

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,320
were indeed a bit abnormal.

5
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,079
So he had taken money.

6
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,159
No wonder back then,

7
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,200
he was scheming over the funds.

8
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,120
Turns out he wanted to earn foreign money.

9
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:06,120
We scientists must speak based on evidence.

10
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,959
We can't just guess wildly.

11
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,840
This isn't wild guessing.

12
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,319
After the incident back then,

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,840
The Firmament had already gone missing.

14
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,319
He definitely hid it.

15
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:15,959
That's right.

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,079
After Huo Haiyang was stopped by me back then,

17
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,879
he wasn't willing to give up The Firmament.

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,040
So on an AI eye,

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,959
he left a backdoor.

20
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,439
Just to transfer The Firmament,

21
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,359
leave it for his family,

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,840
and continue making this money.

23
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,000
Who exactly did he give it to?

24
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:40,079
This person has also come to the venue today.

25
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,760
He is Huo Haiyang's son,

26
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,799
Huo Ming.

27
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:52,760
He is Huo Ming?

28
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,000
Huo Haiyang's son.

29
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,760
It's him.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,280
Snap it, quick! Snap it!

31
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,000
Quick!

32
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:58,799
He actually came.

33
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,439
Yeah, how can someone like him act this way?

34
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,439
Get a shot! Get a shot!

35
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,520
Huo Ming.

36
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,800
As Huo Haiyang's son,

37
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,439
after the incident at the research institute,

38
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,159
you concealed your identity

39
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,439
and worked as a deliveryman for three years.

40
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,280
You were even regarded as someone

41
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,080
with mental issues.

42
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,400
But just a month ago,

43
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,840
you suddenly became so capable.

44
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,680
So I have reason to suspect

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,879
that it is you who obtained The Firmament,

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,680
and that is why you became like this.

47
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,159
I don't have The Firmament.

48
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,599
Nor am I capable.

49
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,719
Then how do you explain all this?

50
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,639
That's amazing

51
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,560
It's him

52
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,039
So this is The Firmament

53
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,639
The power when combined with a human body

54
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,560
Everyone

55
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,120
For his own selfish desires, Huo Haiyang

56
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,360
left The Firmament to his son

57
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,879
Do you still believe the nonsense he spoke

58
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,800
about benefiting mankind?

59
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,039
From start to finish, it was all for himself

60
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,280
For his son

61
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,759
Huo Haiyang is the real culprit behind all this

62
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,439
It's him

63
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,479
So it was Huo Haiyang

64
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,360
That's right

65
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,319
I never expected that

66
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,800
So that's how it is

67
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:26,960
So that's it

68
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,360
Brilliant

69
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,159
Truly brilliant

70
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,039
Professor Li, you've played such a big game

71
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,560
just to frame me and my father

72
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,599
On what grounds do you say that?

73
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,719
Three years ago

74
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,000
in order to steal The Firmament

75
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,599
and sell it to foreign forces

76
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,400
my father discovered it and stopped you

77
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
You flew into a rage

78
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,400
conspired with foreign forces

79
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,800
and destroyed the research institute

80
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,639
You killed my father and Uncle Lin

81
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,520
Fortunately

82
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,039
my father was already wary of you

83
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,080
He hid The Firmament away

84
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,199
You're talking nonsense!

85
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,039
Let me tell you

86
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,199
I am a victim too!

87
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,840
Of course you'd pretend to be a victim

88
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,240
Then you secretly manipulated The Brainiacs

89
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,439
to find the seven researchers

90
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,040
and steal their memories

91
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,600
all to steal The Firmament

92
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,639
Now

93
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,079
you pretend to be the good guy again

94
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,639
by waking them up

95
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,800
In reality, you've already brainwashed them

96
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,720
to make them obey your will

97
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,199
and complete this livestream

98
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,120
You tell a wonderful story

99
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,240
Unfortunately

100
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,680
it's all just baseless speculation

101
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,600
Don't rush

102
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,160
The evidence is coming right up

103
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,079
This one

104
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,000
is the original

105
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:56,839
The one before

106
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,319
was forged by him

107
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,000
Professor Li

108
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,279
can you explain this?

109
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,560
Don't listen to his nonsense!

110
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:05,800
This is the one you forged using AI!

111
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,319
I'll expose your true colors right now

112
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,480
Welcome to

113
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,160
the prison I carefully prepared for you.

114
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,519
Your consciousness will spend the rest of its life here.

115
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,800
How is it?

116
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,079
Surprised?

117
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,000
Li Shan.

118
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,639
You tampered with the experiment logs,

119
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,959
destroyed biological samples,

120
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
and killed my father.

121
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,160
You are the murderer.

122
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,279
So what?

123
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,120
I am the one who controls this technology.

124
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,439
No one cares

125
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,040
who the actual developer is.

126
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,800
As a top scientist,

127
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,240
you were opportunistic

128
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,399
and neglected your duties.

129
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,319
You are a disgrace to the name of a scientist.

130
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,680
What about scientists?

131
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,240
Scientists are human too.

132
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,399
We have desires too.

133
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,720
Why can't I use these achievements

134
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,040
to make money?

135
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,839
As expected.

136
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,519
IQ and degrees can filter out poor students,

137
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,759
but they can't filter out scum like you.

138
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:00,839
Shut up.

139
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,800
What do you know?

140
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,600
I spent thirty years researching.

141
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,920
Huo Haiyang said I took the wrong path.

142
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,720
Thirty years of my blood, sweat, and tears.

143
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,319
Those were the prime thirty years of my life.

144
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,759
In a person's life,

145
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,680
how many thirty years are there?

146
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,920
Why is heaven so unfair to me?

147
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,079
Why am I always the one in the wrong?

148
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,199
I refuse to accept it!

149
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,040
So I sold The Firmament

150
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,879
to build my own

151
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,120
technology empire.

152
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,319
So you colluded with foreign forces

153
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,120
to steal The Firmament.

154
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,160
What do you mean "colluded"?

155
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,160
You probably don't know yet.

156
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:41,040
I am the foreign force

157
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,680
secretly planted in the institute.

158
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,560
My goal was to steal The Firmament.

159
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,000
When stealing failed,

160
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,839
I arranged for murder and arson.

161
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,319
What I can't have,

162
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
I destroy completely.

163
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,519
But for all my calculations, I didn't count on

164
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:01,079
you ruining everything in the end.

165
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,160
You finally admitted it.

166
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,199
So what?

167
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,920
This is the Consciousness Space

168
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,680
I ordered Xiao Cang to build.

169
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
In here,

170
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,680
you cannot transmit any information out.

171
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,720
As long as I keep you locked in here,

172
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,319
your body on the outside

173
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,240
will enter a vegetative state.

174
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,199
No one will ever know the truth.

175
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,680
Dr. Li.

176
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,319
My father often told me one thing:

177
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,800
Truth cannot be overthrown.

178
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,000
The truth cannot be hidden.

179
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,920
Say hello to everyone.

180
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,360
After all, right now,

181
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,399
fifty million people are watching our livestream.

182
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,439
What do you mean?

183
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,040
Hello everyone.

184
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,399
This is The Firmament's

185
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,680
Thought Synchronization Technology.

186
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,399
Welcome, everyone, to watch

187
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,680
Professor Li Shan's mind livestream.

188
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,319
He admitted it himself.

189
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,720
So many plot twists!

190
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,879
It's amazing.

191
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,000
Huo Ming, you...

192
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,680
I told you,

193
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,639
I would expose your true colors.

194
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,800
So what?

195
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,920
My consciousness is about to exit.

196
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,480
But your consciousness

197
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,240
will be trapped here forever.

198
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,920
You will never get out.

199
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,720
I have The Firmament now.

200
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,560
Those ignorant people,

201
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,079
I can completely brainwash them.

202
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:26,920
Make them realize

203
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,720
that I am the savior.

204
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,720
Make them willingly

205
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,080
become my puppets.

206
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,440
You can try.

207
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,919
What's going on?

208
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:48,840
The truth is,

209
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,919
you never conquered her.

210
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,240
This was all part of our plan.

211
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,279
Dr. Li.

212
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,240
You can stay in this prison you prepared for yourself

213
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,600
for the rest of your life.

214
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,240
Huo Ming!

215
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,559
Go get an interview!

216
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,679
Hurry, hurry!

217
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,720
Go get the interview!

218
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,480
Hurry, hurry!

219
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,039
Come on, come on.

220
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,519
Over here.

221
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,279
Get a shot, quick!

222
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,279
Give us a statement, come on.

223
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,360
Please say a few words.

224
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,159
Get it all on camera.

225
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,000
Dad.

226
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,000
The person who destroyed the institute back then...

227
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,200
I found him.

228
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,320
And I've avenged you.

229
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,000
Make way, make way.

230
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,080
Huo Ming.

231
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,240
Together, we fulfilled Uncle Huo's wish

232
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,840
and protected The Firmament.

233
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,480
Thank you, Lin Yun.

234
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,519
For everything you did for me

235
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,639
when I was at my most helpless.

236
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,120
I want to show you something.

237
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,399
You not only

238
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:03,080
helped me find evidence of Li Shan's crimes,

239
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,120
but also used the company's AI

240
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,360
to help me complete the livestream,

241
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,720
allowing me to expose Li Shan's true colors

242
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,480
and restore the truth to the scientific community.

243
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,159
Master.

244
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:03,639
Long time no see.

245
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,120
Xiao Cang.

246
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,840
I missed you so much.

247
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,720
Master, I missed you too.

248
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:49,879
Li Shan's consciousness

249
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,799
is trapped in that space forever.

250
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,440
I've handed his data over to the police.

251
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,080
Li Shan, Li Xue, and Su Xiaoqing...

252
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,320
have all been brought to justice.

253
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,720
We finally got our revenge.

254
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,279
I'm here, dear Master.

255
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,159
Xiao Cang.

256
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:08,879
Don't call me Master anymore.

257
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,960
Then what should I call you?

258
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,600
Call me...

259
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,279
Friend.

260
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,519
Okay, Friend.

261
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,919
Then what will you call me?

262
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,240
Call you...

263
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,159
Let me think.

264
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Call you...

265
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,240
Power Bank.

266
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,279
Huo Ming, stop right there!

267
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:32,519
What did you call me?

268
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,320
Isn't Power Bank a good name?

269
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,240
Seriously? It's so slow.

270
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,600
Why hasn't my delivery arrived yet?

271
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,080
Sorry, I'll be right there.

272
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,799
Sir, I'm sorry.

273
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:54,960
Here is your delivery.

274
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
Why did it take so long?

275
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,960
My phone is almost out of battery.

276
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:02,039
How about I lend you my power bank?

277
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,360
You...

278
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,240
You're quick-witted.

279
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,120
Nice power bank. Thanks.

280
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,399
Please give a five-star rating!

281
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,480
Will you continue delivering food?

282
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,320
Of course.

283
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,080
Delivering food is my job.

284
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,200
However,

285
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,799
I also want to use The Firmament's technology

286
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,799
to help more people in need.

287
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,279
This was once my father's wish,

288
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:36,240
and now it is mine too.
