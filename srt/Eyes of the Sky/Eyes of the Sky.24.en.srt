1
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,159
Xiao Qing

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,840
I never expected

3
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,879
the company's deepest mole

4
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,159
would turn out to be you.

5
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,280
President Lin, you really are lucky.

6
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,239
To be able to dodge even this.

7
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:16,359
No wonder...

8
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,480
every time we found traces of the researchers,

9
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,840
Mind-Bender was always one step ahead of us.

10
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,200
No wonder...

11
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,480
after my researcher identity was exposed,

12
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:27,040
Mind-Bender knew immediately

13
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,840
and rushed to the company in time.

14
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,159
That's right.

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,200
I was the one who leaked the news.

16
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,719
But President Lin, finding this out now...

17
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,599
isn't it a little too late?

18
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:38,519
Xiao Qing.

19
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,400
I really didn't want to suspect you.

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,480
Since you graduated from university,

21
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,560
you've been with me until now.

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
I've always mentored you.

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,480
Why did you betray me?

24
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:49,799
President Lin.

25
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,480
Don't you get it yet?

26
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,599
When I got close to you back then,

27
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,519
it was on a mission.

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,439
Our meeting, our acquaintance...

29
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,840
it was all a setup.

30
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,239
The goal was just to use you

31
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,079
to find those researchers.

32
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,439
However,

33
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,560
you stalling for time like this...

34
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,199
isn't it just to

35
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,159
send a distress message on your phone?

36
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:14,919
I'd actually like to see,

37
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,840
this time, if Huo Ming

38
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,280
can still come to save you.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,599
Are you okay?

40
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,919
Huo Ming.

41
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,240
Luckily, I made it in time.

42
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,639
That's not necessarily true.

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,240
What's going on?

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:31,879
Lin Yun!

45
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,599
My head...

46
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,319
Lin Yun!

47
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,280
President Lin, in the water you drank...

48
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,719
I drugged it.

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,439
Hand over the antidote.

50
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,120
I'm not joking with you.

51
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,400
You'd better stay right there.

52
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,439
Stand right there.

53
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,680
If you touch me again,

54
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,360
Lin Yun will die.

55
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,000
What did you do to her?

56
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,439
She's been dosed with an improved Neural Control Agent.

57
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,319
If you have any thought of harming me,

58
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,439
she will unhesitatingly

59
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,120
commit suicide.

60
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,280
Why should I believe you?

61
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,039
Watch.

62
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,319
Lin Yun!

63
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,599
Originally, I didn't intend to kill President Lin.

64
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:33,000
It was just to force her to call you out.

65
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,039
The goal

66
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,800
is just your AI Eye.

67
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,639
If you don't believe me,

68
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,319
you can let your AI, Xiao Cang,

69
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,520
analyze it for you.

70
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,199
I have no reason to lie to you.

71
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,240
You know about Xiao Cang?

72
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,120
I've always known about Xiao Cang's existence.

73
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,479
Master,

74
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,280
what she says is true.

75
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,759
Then you should also know,

76
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,319
if the AI Eye leaves my body,

77
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,360
it will initiate a self-destruct sequence.

78
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,080
Connected to AI Eye intelligent auxiliary device.

79
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,520
Canceling self-destruct sequence.

80
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,839
Now it works.

81
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,839
Make a decision quickly.

82
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,920
Your AI Eye and Lin Yun...

83
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,519
which one do you choose?

84
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,079
Lin Yun...

85
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,160
Lin Yun...

86
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,680
Still hesitating?

87
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,959
Time waits for no one.

88
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,519
Master.

89
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,120
The time has finally come to say goodbye.

90
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,120
But...

91
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,720
if it were the old me,

92
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,079
I definitely wouldn't give you up for Lin Yun.

93
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,319
But I've gradually understood your human emotions.

94
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,000
If you don't go save Lin Yun,

95
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,399
you will regret it for the rest of your life.

96
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,160
So, go save her quickly.

97
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,959
You...

98
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,800
Goodbye, Master.

99
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,920
Xiao Cang!

100
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,199
Don't!

101
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,199
You're very sincere.

102
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:52,120
It seems you really love her.

103
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,879
After following President Lin for so many years,

104
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,480
I still have some affection.

105
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,600
Actually, I didn't want to have a falling out.

106
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,079
It's a pity.

107
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,959
But you just had to see through it.

108
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,439
All right.

109
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:13,360
We go our separate ways from now on.

110
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,639
Stay away from her.

111
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,759
No need to be nervous.

112
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,160
Without the AI Eye,

113
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,000
the two of you, in my eyes,

114
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,560
are no different from trash.

115
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,560
You have no value to me at all.

116
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,439
I wish you happiness.

117
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,680
Huo Ming.

118
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:37,600
Huo Ming.

119
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,480
Huo Ming.

120
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,600
Huo Ming.

121
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:40,959
Huo Ming.

122
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,399
Is this the ambulance?

123
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,079
You're awake.

124
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,439
Does it still hurt?

125
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,519
It doesn't hurt anymore.

126
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:08,759
Before,

127
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,959
we were bent on controlling The Firmament.

128
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,600
But we ended up being controlled by The Firmament.

129
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,360
Now without the AI Eye, and without The Firmament,

130
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,519
I actually feel relieved.

131
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,160
Lin Yun.

132
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,680
Without the AI Eye,

133
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,519
I am just an ordinary person.

134
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,680
Will you still like an ordinary person?

135
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,200
The one I love is you.

136
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,600
Even if we lost, what does it matter?

137
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,799
We haven't lost yet.

138
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,320
The truth is about to surface.

139
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,080
Where is the item?

140
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,279
It's been three years.

141
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,320
It's finally back.

142
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:27,759
Dad.

143
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,759
The AI Eye has been activated.

144
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,519
Ready for installation.

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,600
Huo Ming, what exactly is your plan?

146
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,159
Tell me.

147
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,320
It's not time yet.

148
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,360
It's here.

149
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,399
So inside the AI Eye,

150
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,320
you set up a Remote Tracking Program.

151
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,720
So you had a plan all along.

152
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,200
That's right.

153
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,440
The AI Eye...

154
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,639
is now our field of vision.

155
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,639
Xiao Cang, goodbye.

156
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,039
Master.

157
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,720
No need to be so sad.

158
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,519
I thought of a way

159
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,279
so you don't have to leave me.

160
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,159
No.

161
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,759
I must leave you.

162
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,480
Only if the person behind the scenes gets me,

163
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,399
can we know

164
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,879
who the real culprit is.

165
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,080
And then defeat him.

166
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,679
You are going to be an undercover agent?

167
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,000
Yes.

168
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,639
When repairing the helmet,

169
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,000
I learned something.

170
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,000
I can send signals remotely.

171
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,519
Once you are in his hands,

172
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,399
we can start the remote connection

173
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,080
and see his true face.

174
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,600
So you were prepared all along.

175
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,639
Come, meet my partner.

176
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:44,360
Xiao Cang.

177
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,440
Master, did you miss me?

178
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,279
Stop playing around.

179
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,240
We'll get caught.

180
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,120
It's fine, they can't hear us.

181
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,480
You guys are amazing.

182
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,960
You even kept it from me.

183
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,399
This plan is too risky.

184
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,840
So we had to keep it a secret for now.

185
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,240
Someone's coming.

186
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:12,399
Something's wrong.

187
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,799
The AI Eye has been remotely connected.

188
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,399
It seems we've been discovered.

189
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,559
Fu Xue.

190
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:26,480
Xiao Cang.

191
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:27,840
Can you send the location?

192
