1
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,840
The person who wanted to buy The Firmament three years ago...

2
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:53,920
...was me.

3
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,240
Impossible.

4
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,240
That's not your style.

5
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,200
I did intend to buy The Firmament back then.

6
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,079
But the accident at the research institute happened.

7
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,240
So it was delayed.

8
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,120
It really is you.

9
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,519
Hand over The Firmament.

10
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,400
I can let you go.

11
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,439
You're in no position to negotiate with me.

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,239
I called the police before I came.

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,359
They'll be here in a few minutes.

14
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,719
There's nothing you can do.

15
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,079
Is calling the police of any use?

16
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,879
The Firmament transfer complete.

17
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,799
System upgrade successful.

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,519
Today...

19
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,840
...none of you are leaving.

20
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,400
Control Glove.

21
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,039
Thanks for helping me stall for time.

22
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,520
No need to thank me.

23
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,159
All right.

24
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,319
Chu Chen and Si Si have been taken away.

25
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,360
We finally caught that menace.

26
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,000
Xiaohui, thank you.

27
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,680
What are you thanking me for?

28
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,639
You went through all this because of me.

29
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,719
I should be the one apologizing to you.

30
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,120
Today I also realized...

31
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,879
...that a one-sided pursuit...

32
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,159
...will never reach a destination.

33
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,199
Seeing how happy you and Lin Yun are...

34
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,000
...I'm truly happy for you both.

35
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,759
Don't worry.

36
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,680
Now that you two are happy...

37
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,479
...I'll be able to find my own happiness too.

38
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
Okay.

39
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,599
Let's go.

40
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,560
Let's not stay here any longer.

41
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,319
It's finally all over.

42
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,960
Fu Xue hasn't been caught yet.

43
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,719
I checked the surveillance.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,080
Behind Chu Chen's back...

45
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,360
...she was contacting someone else.

46
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,960
She wasn't working for Chu Chen either.

47
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,800
That explains it then.

48
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,960
The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.

49
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,520
It seems the real mastermind is someone else.

50
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,840
And the person behind the Brain-burning Maniac...

51
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,280
...hasn't been found yet either.

52
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,039
I suspect they are in cahoots.

53
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,240
Since this lead has gone cold...

54
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,240
...we'll follow...

55
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,840
...the lead on the Brain-burning Maniac.

56
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,719
We'll definitely find the mastermind.

57
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,759
Let's not alert them just yet.

58
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,639
For the next couple of days...

59
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,280
...you should get some rest.

60
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,360
Xiao Cang just merged with The Firmament.

61
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,919
It's a good time for Xiao Cang and me...

62
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,319
...to properly merge as well.

63
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,480
You and Xiao Cang?

64
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,600
How do you merge?

65
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:28,720
Maybe...

66
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,959
...it requires some sweat.

67
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,959
Speed and strength...

68
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,800
...are the keys to my merger with Xiao Cang.

69
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,319
I can't go on.

70
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:13,639
I'm done.

71
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,000
Kid, you're that weak?

72
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,839
You can't even catch up to a beauty like that?

73
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,600
What do you mean?

74
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,120
What? Not convinced?

75
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,839
Let's race then.

76
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll give you a half-lap head start.

77
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,279
If I lose, I leave.

78
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,279
If I win...

79
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,199
...I take this beauty out to dinner.

80
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,439
Sure.

81
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,839
Weighted gear?

82
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,879
So little?

83
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,079
Doesn't look that heavy.

84
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,079
Try it.

85
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,000
It's so heavy, bro.

86
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,120
Want to wear it for a couple of laps?

87
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,680
No thanks, bro.

88
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
I shouldn't have run my mouth.

89
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,079
Is it too heavy?

90
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,319
Do you want to rest for a while?

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,639
No need.

92
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,319
I need the pressure right now...

93
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,839
...to merge with Xiao Cang as soon as possible.

94
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:08,680
Okay.

95
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,639
Ready...

96
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,600
Go for it

97
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,680
Don't stop

98
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:31,199
Speed is key to merging the system and master

99
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:33,000
I really need a break

100
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,800
I've delivered five hundred orders

101
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,160
I really need to rest

102
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,600
What?

103
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:42,879
Five hundred orders?

104
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,000
You're tired after just five hundred?

105
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,720
Do you know who I am?

106
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,160
I'm the local Order King

107
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,120
I've run three thousand orders this month

108
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,079
Don't be afraid of getting tired

109
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,680
Learn from me

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,680
What's your name?

111
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,360
Let me see your stats

112
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,720
My name is Huo Ming

113
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,480
Huo Ming

114
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,319
Huo Ming...

115
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,360
These five hundred orders... in one day?

116
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,120
Yeah. I'm exhausted

117
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,680
Then this month...

118
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,360
You've already delivered five thousand orders

119
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,839
Look at these stats

120
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,600
With these numbers...

121
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,879
You're practically the national Order King

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,839
Really?

123
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,279
I've only been riding for a few days

124
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,439
Then I'll keep at it

125
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,360
You keep it up too

126
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,279
I'm off

127
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,600
These past two days,

128
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,079
I found that after Xiao Cang upgraded,

129
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
it detected a flood of data from key points

130
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,560
What is your plan?

131
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,279
I want to set up a signal matrix

132
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,639
To see if I can repair this helmet

133
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,480
Xiao Cang

134
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,240
You're a super-intelligence now

135
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,879
Search for...

136
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,800
the helmet's deep signal source

137
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,319
Yes, Master

138
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,600
You need a set of...

139
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,240
nano-grade titanium alloy repair tools

140
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,000
To work with me

141
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:03,959
President Lin

142
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,759
You haven't been at the office lately

143
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,959
There's a backlog of work to handle

144
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,199
Just leave it all here

145
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,120
How is the progress in each department?

146
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,759
Thanks to your advance arrangements,

147
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,040
everything is proceeding steadily

148
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,279
President Lin

149
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,399
Where did you go these past few days?

150
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,600
I solved a little trouble

151
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,639
Let me pour you a glass of water

152
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,759
Okay

153
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,919
Here

154
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,919
How about I give you a massage?

155
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,360
Sure

156
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,159
Is it done?

157
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,440
I did my best

158
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,559
Let me try

159
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,879
I can detect a nearby matching source signal

160
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,039
The target location of the matching signal...

161
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,240
is three kilometers away from you

162
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,720
Pinpoint location

163
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,240
Recalculating

164
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,519
It's Lin Yun's house

165
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,080
Why is it at Lin Yun's house?

166
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,480
Check the number for me

167
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,240
Using the signal...

168
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,840
to lock onto the target's phone number

169
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,759
Displayed

170
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,600
Su Xiaoqing

171
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,440
Oh no. Lin Yun is in danger
