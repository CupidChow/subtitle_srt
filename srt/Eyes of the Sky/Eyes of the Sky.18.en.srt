1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,320
Could the real researcher be...

2
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,640
...Lin Yun?

3
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,520
Ming.

4
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,159
Do you like it?

5
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,480
Close your eyes.

6
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,200
Huo Ming.

7
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:29,439
Today...

8
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,640
You're not getting past me.

9
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,879
Made it just in time.

10
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,680
Xiao Cang, connect to the helmet.

11
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,079
I'd like to see...

12
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,560
...who tipped you off.

13
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,439
You don't actually think your Lin Yun...

14
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,599
...is safe now, do you?

15
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,280
As long as I'm here...

16
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,959
...you can't get in.

17
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,959
Another Mind-Bender...

18
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,360
...is already extracting Lin Yun's memories.

19
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,360
Extracting memory.

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,080
Once we get your password...

21
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,400
...The Firmament can be cracked.

22
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,039
Stop!

23
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,759
Lin Yun!

24
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,080
Lin Yun!

25
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,759
Lin Yun!

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,400
You got here fast.

27
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,879
But seventy percent has already been extracted.

28
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,240
Those memories can't be retrieved.

29
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,080
What did you do to her?

30
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,000
I asked you, what did you do to her?!

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,759
Stand still.

32
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,039
If you move again...

33
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,479
...I will destroy her memories completely.

34
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,240
Memory extraction forcibly interrupted.

35
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,759
If we don't continue...

36
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,120
...she'll turn into an idiot just like you.

37
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,719
Do you want a normal Lin Yun...

38
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,520
...or an idiot?

39
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,159
You choose.

40
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,120
Xiao Cang, reverse control.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,199
Cut the signal.

42
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:24,680
Lin Yun.

43
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,319
Xiao Cang, what should I do?

44
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,960
Her consciousness is in chaos right now.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,080
We need to link your consciousness...

46
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,159
...to stabilize her.

47
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,080
How do I link?

48
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,759
Use the Mind-Bender's memory extractor.

49
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,360
Master...

50
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,639
...consciousness linking is very dangerous.

51
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,639
First, you will endure the same pain she does.

52
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,319
Secondly...

53
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,680
...if she doesn't trust you enough...

54
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,800
...you will be affected by her...

55
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,960
...and turn into an idiot.

56
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,360
Are you sure you want to link?

57
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,759
Link.

58
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,439
Xiao Cang.

59
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,959
Where is this?

60
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,439
You have entered Lin Yun's Mindscape.

61
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,279
Where is Lin Yun?

62
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,439
She is likely hiding in her subconscious.

63
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,600
Hiding?

64
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,879
She would likely hide in...

65
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,680
...a place she feels safe.

66
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,560
How do I get to her home?

67
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,959
This is Lin Yun's mind palace.

68
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,279
Master...

69
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,639
...you can use your imagination.

70
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,959
Okay, I'll try.

71
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,199
Master.

72
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,959
These are her truest subconscious thoughts.

73
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,480
Even in this situation...

74
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,240
...she's thinking about how to help me overcome my fear.

75
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,879
Who are you?

76
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,560
I am Huo Ming.

77
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,079
But I don't know you.

78
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,639
I can take you out of here.

79
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,360
Don't come any closer.

80
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,160
Huo Ming.

81
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,800
You found me.

82
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,839
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,199
I came too late.

84
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,040
I was trying hard to resist.

85
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,040
The Mind-Bender was extracting my memories.

86
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,079
I wanted to help you find the password...

87
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,279
...to unlock The Firmament.

88
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,720
But I can't get out.

89
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,639
Don't be afraid. It's okay.

90
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,160
I'm here.

91
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,120
I'll take you out.

92
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,519
Xiao Cang.

93
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,360
How do we get out?

94
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,000
Clear your minds.

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,519
Just synchronize your consciousness.

96
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,000
Close your eyes.

97
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,720
Huo Ming

98
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,199
I think I just dreamt of you.

99
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,480
It wasn't a dream. It was real.

100
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,480
But...

101
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,759
I feel like I've forgotten something.

102
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,399
Master.

103
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,120
Lin Yun has only woken up.

104
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,240
But she lost another part of her memory.

105
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,519
Password lost.

106
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,759
The Firmament will self-destruct in 15 minutes.

107
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,720
Is this how you protect Lin Yun?

108
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,040
I retrieved Lin Yun's extracted memories.

109
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,959
How could he get Lin Yun's memories?

110
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,879
Did he make a deal with Mind-Bender?

111
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,560
Why should I trust you?

112
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,639
I love her far more than you do.

113
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,920
No external signs of hacking.

114
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,519
It is indeed Lin Yun's memory.

115
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,560
Yun.

116
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,240
Don't forget me.

117
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,360
Xiao Cang, scan it.

118
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,199
Master, the scan is safe.

119
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,839
Prepare to link.

120
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:23,759
Master.

121
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,279
Actually, we could delete...

122
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,879
all memories regarding Chu Chen.

123
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,079
Let Lin Yun forget him.

124
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,399
No.

125
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,720
I want to respect all of Lin Yun's memories.

126
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,000
Lin Yun, close your eyes.

127
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,519
Let's try again.

128
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,960
Memory recovery in progress.

129
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,279
Lin Yun.

130
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,840
It's me.

131
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,960
Huo Ming.

132
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,399
It's me.

133
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,080
I remember everything now.

134
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,519
When Mind-Bender extracted my memories...

135
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,279
I was so afraid I would forget you.

136
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,360
I'm sorry.

137
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,279
I didn't protect you well enough.

138
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,519
I don't blame you.

139
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,679
Let's go.

140
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:13,840
Let's go home.

141
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,279
I think I love you even more now.

142
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,759
After I entered your Mindscape...

143
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,480
I saw your heart.

144
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,279
Even in that situation...

145
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,159
you were still thinking of helping me overcome my fear.

146
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,279
Lin Yun, I promise...

147
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,240
I will never hide anything from you again.

148
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,120
We will never hurt each other again.

149
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,080
I remember now!

150
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,000
The Firmament will self-destruct in less than five minutes.

151
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,559
We're just one step away.

152
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,279
You were one of the researchers.

153
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,080
You must have the password in your memory.

154
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,440
But no one ever gave me a password.

155
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,320
Think back carefully.

156
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,480
Did Uncle Lin leave any clues?

157
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,279
Clues...

158
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,960
Fu Xue took my identity.

159
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,559
So rule out Fu Xue's password.

160
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,120
The password is...

161
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,000
Incorrect password.

162
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,759
Two login attempts remaining.

163
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,480
What do we do?

164
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,600
I don't remember.

165
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,639
It's okay.

166
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
Think harder.

167
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,159
Incorrect password.

168
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,000
One login attempt remaining.

169
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,159
What now?

170
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,639
I really don't remember anything.

171
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:09,480
Don't panic.

172
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,919
Calm down first.

173
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,919
Think again.

174
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,039
My dad never told me any password.

175
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:22,720
When I was little...

176
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,200
the character combination my dad taught me...

177
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,360
The Fibonacci sequence.

178
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,519
My dad made me memorize it too.

179
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,720
Son, you must remember...

180
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:34,879
the Fibonacci sequence I taught you.

181
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,000
Could it be our respective password characters...

182
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,919
combined together?

183
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:47,919
Enter mine first.

184
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,120
It worked!

185
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,559
Look quickly.

186
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,120
We really unlocked it.

187
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:24,960
Look.

188
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,559
I retrieved Lin Yun's extracted memories.
