1
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,319
Xiao Cang, full power.

2
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,239
Unleash your full potential, Master.

3
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,560
Thank you.

4
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,000
I don't smoke.

5
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,640
Huo Ming, you were amazing.

6
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,680
It's okay. You're already excellent.

7
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,840
Let's go home.

8
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,239
They're pretty affectionate.

9
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,400
Huo Ming.

10
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,639
I had the butler take my car away.

11
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,719
I'll go with you.

12
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,599
How do we ride this?

13
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,560
Slow down. Slow down.

14
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,159
This is my first time riding.

15
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,680
It's so much fun.

16
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,879
Thank you.

17
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,879
For still supporting me like before.

18
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,280
With our relationship...

19
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,759
Is there any need to say thanks?

20
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,960
Today's events are also a reminder to me.

21
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,080
I need to catch up to you again.

22
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,919
And now, there's another strong rival.

23
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,719
Huo Ming's AI Eye is very powerful.

24
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,479
Did he use The Firmament's technology?

25
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,800
There are only two days left.

26
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,280
We must hurry and decrypt the hard drive.

27
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,000
Hold it.

28
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,560
Hand over the hard drive.

29
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,360
I'll help you decrypt it.

30
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,080
Du Sze.

31
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,719
So you haven't given up yet.

32
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,240
Persistence is my strong suit.

33
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,319
Without Huo Ming...

34
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,319
You'd better give in quietly.

35
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,439
Hand it over, now.

36
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,199
You go first.

37
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,039
I'll deal with them.

38
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,439
A hero saving the beauty, huh?

39
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,280
Do you take me for a fool?

40
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,719
Letting her go to call the police?

41
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,879
Let her go.

42
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,719
Or I'll destroy the hard drive.

43
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,079
Huo Ming.

44
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,360
Stop, stop, stop.

45
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,879
Chu Chen is surrounded by Du Sze's men.

46
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:28,879
The hard drive is in his hands too.

47
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,519
Where?

48
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,720
In the underground garage.

49
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,399
It must be dangerous.

50
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,199
You call the police first.

51
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,199
Okay.

52
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,920
Be careful.

53
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,160
You think you can steal The Firmament?

54
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,199
Nano... nanotechnology?

55
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,879
How do you have this technology?

56
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,759
Mr... Mr. Chu.

57
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,639
I... I didn't know who I was dealing with.

58
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,040
I'm willing to follow you.

59
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,879
With absolute loyalty, at your service.

60
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,680
I'm not afraid of your disloyalty.

61
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,600
I know all your dirty secrets.

62
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,240
If you dare make a wrong move...

63
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,800
The evidence that could ruin you...

64
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,680
Will immediately appear where it shouldn't.

65
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,199
Take your men.

66
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,759
Get out.

67
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,879
We're going, we're going.

68
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,079
Du... Du...

69
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,000
Where is Du Sze?

70
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,720
Are you okay?

71
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,879
I've already called the police.

72
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:15,920
Don't worry.

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,839
The hard drive is safe.

74
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,759
It's you I'm worried about.

75
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,399
Don't tell me this is Young Master Chu

76
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,319
staging a "hero saves the beauty" act?

77
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,879
I don't have the brains for that.

78
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,720
There were at least seven or eight of them.

79
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,800
Yet you are safe and sound.

80
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,199
You're pretty impressive.

81
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,720
The roads at night are treacherous.

82
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,759
One must always have a backup plan.

83
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,480
Tomorrow, the company executives will meet

84
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,319
to officially announce your return.

85
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,040
Alright. I'll take you back.

86
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,160
I-I-I...

87
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,720
I'll take you. I'll take you.

88
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,800
I happen to be... riding a bike.

89
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,120
Sometimes, people...

90
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,360
really need to know their place.

91
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,120
Don't you think?

92
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,920
Of course I know my place.

93
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,560
I live right next to Lin Yun.

94
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,600
I live next door to her.

95
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,160
Me taking her is called "on the way".

96
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,920
You are in the other direction.

97
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,360
You taking her is called being a simp.

98
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,959
Right, right, right. A simp.

99
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,839
You dare talk to me like that?

100
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,720
That's because you don't know my true power.

101
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,000
Your glove.

102
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,399
Sure enough, nothing escapes your eyes.

103
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,680
Is there really only one?

104
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,720
Shouldn't there be two gloves?

105
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,959
You're wearing just one. It's so mismatched.

106
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,199
It has to be like this.

107
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,240
You only have one glove. It's so uncomfortable.

108
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,399
How about this? I'll give you my gloves.

109
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,439
He has OCD.

110
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,240
Let's go.

111
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,079
I'll give you mine.

112
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:21,720
Here.

113
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,120
Here.

114
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,879
Put it on before you say hello.

115
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,000
If you need it...

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,039
I can give it to you.

117
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,919
I really can give it to you.

118
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,519
I...

119
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,679
I really can give...

120
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,600
This is just too uncomfortable.

121
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,120
This Chu Chen isn't simple.

122
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,360
How could an ordinary person...

123
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,159
...possibly take down seven or eight people?

124
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,320
He must have a motive for suddenly returning to the company.

125
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,399
The complete Firmament is at Lin Yun's company.

126
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,679
I have returned to the company.

127
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,200
Vice President Chu Chen has officially returned to our company.

128
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,279
Welcome, Mr. Chu. Welcome, Mr. Chu. Welcome, Mr. Chu.

129
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,919
Welcome.

130
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,159
Thank you for your trust.

131
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,039
I will do my utmost to expand the company's business...

132
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,480
...and improve company performance.

133
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,279
After multiple previous tests...

134
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,879
...it is confirmed that Huo Ming's AI Eye...

135
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,919
...indeed uses The Firmament's technology.

136
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,799
He came back saying he wants to help Lin Yun expand the company.

137
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,399
He also said he wants to propose to her.

138
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,919
Don't worry. I will get it.

139
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,320
This is for you.

140
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,840
I hope our wishes come true soon.

141
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,120
Thank you.

142
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,039
No matter what your objective is...

143
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,480
...I will find out.

144
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,919
Chu.

145
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,120
Don't think I don't know...

146
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,159
...what you're plotting.

147
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,039
You just want to push me out, don't you?

148
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,879
That's not right.

149
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,919
We're the ones with shared interests.

150
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,159
Who shares interests with you?

151
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,759
Since you delivered yourself to me...

152
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,679
...I'll make good use of you.

153
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,039
Stop pretending.

154
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,279
You came to the company for Huo Ming, right?

155
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,639
Whether I came to the company for Huo Ming...

156
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,720
...what does it have to do with you?

157
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,759
You like Huo Ming.

158
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:19,960
That's right.

159
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,320
But Huo Ming likes Lin Yun.

160
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,200
Only if Lin Yun and I are together...

161
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,559
...will you have a chance.

162
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,320
How wonderful it is for two people to be in love.

163
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,840
You two are such a good match.

164
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,279
You look so much like a couple.

165
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,039
It makes me angry just looking at them.

166
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,200
You two should be together.

167
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,159
Then, how can that happen?

168
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,080
I'll help you.

169
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:44,120
Take this and put it near Huo Ming.

170
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,600
It can interfere with his brain.

171
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,000
Make him more interested in you.

172
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,000
He will be yours.

173
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,320
No one can take him away.

174
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,960
What is this thing?

175
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,200
Will it harm him?

176
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,600
Of course it's harmful.

177
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,600
Then I...

178
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:59,120
He won't be able to avoid backaches.

179
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,200
He might not be able to get out of bed tomorrow.

180
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,120
Use your imagination.

181
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,679
Decide for yourself whether to use it.

182
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,480
Don't lie to me.

183
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,799
You can't escape my grasp.

184
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,240
Mr. Bai.

185
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,879
Bai Xiaohui.

186
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,440
How did you know I love eating this?

187
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,799
You brought it especially for me.

188
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,080
Come on, let's eat together.

189
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:55,039
Come on, let's eat together.

190
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,960
Didn't you order this yourself?

191
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,960
Don't worry about who ordered it.

192
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:03,519
It's already ordered, just eat with me.

193
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,360
-Come on, come on. -Stop it.

194
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,039
Are you all right?

195
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,559
I'm not.

196
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,720
If you keep this up, I'll give you a bad review.

197
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,679
How about we make a bet?

198
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,639
If I can get you to come in on your own...

199
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
then you have to stay.

200
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,440
What is there to bet on?

201
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:26,639
Xiao...

202
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,360
Xiaohui, how many times have I told you?

203
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,720
The office must not be messy.

204
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,879
It makes people feel very uncomfortable.

205
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,639
You have to keep things tidy.

206
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,600
Xiao Cang, what's going on?

207
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,279
Master.

208
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,559
I detect that your body temperature

209
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,960
is rising inexplicably.

210
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,320
Hormone levels are abnormal.

211
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,879
Something is interfering with me.

212
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,519
Check what's happening, quick.

213
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,320
Do you like it?

214
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,039
I do.

215
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,159
I knew you liked me.

216
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:30,639
Yun, Bai Xinhui is looking for you.

217
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,840
She says it's important.

218
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,080
She wants you in her office.

219
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,399
Okay.

220
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,759
You never say what you mean.

221
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,480
I don't like this feeling.

222
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,840
I feel like something is controlling me.

223
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,240
It's your instinct.

224
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,840
The instinct of love.

225
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,440
Undo my buttons.

226
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,879
Okay, come here.
