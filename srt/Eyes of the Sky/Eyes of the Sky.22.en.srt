1
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,560
Illegal operation detected

2
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,280
Self-Destruct Protocol initiated

3
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,560
Countdown: twenty seconds

4
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,320
Nineteen seconds

5
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,600
There's actually a protection program

6
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,239
Connecting to AI

7
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,599
Countdown

8
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,920
-Eight, seven... -Stop the countdown first

9
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,040
We can talk this over

10
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,680
Self-destruct is a base-level setting

11
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,519
Unless the threat is removed

12
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,599
I cannot cancel it either

13
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,519
Five

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,400
Four

15
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,439
Three

16
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,359
Two

17
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,599
Master

18
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,079
I heard you calling me

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,120
But I couldn't respond to you

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,200
Xiao Cang

21
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:47,959
The AI Eye

22
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,519
Is there really a Self-Destruct Protocol?

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,879
Master

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,359
Have a little faith in me, will you?

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,719
I am an Artificial Intelligence

26
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,120
A super-intelligent entity

27
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,599
Things like self-destruction

28
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,719
I can control them all

29
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,920
Xiao Cang

30
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,519
If they forcibly remove my eye

31
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,760
You really will self-destruct, won't you?

32
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,439
I understand

33
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,759
Promise me

34
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,560
No matter what happens

35
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,400
You must live on well

36
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,080
You must remember

37
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,560
I will never give up on you

38
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,759
Master, don't stand here

39
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,400
Tricking an innocent girl into crying

40
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,719
Better think about

41
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,159
How to escape first

42
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,960
Okay

43
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,879
Let me out right now

44
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,240
How can I contact the outside world?

45
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,319
Why haven't you found him yet?

46
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,400
Didn't I tell you?

47
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,599
He was taken away

48
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,240
Look for places related to him

49
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,680
Hurry up and look

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,840
President Bai, Huo Ming is missing

51
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,639
I know he's missing

52
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,719
He was taken away

53
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,639
How do you know?

54
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
Who took him?

55
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,520
It's...

56
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,039
He was...

57
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,240
What exactly happened?

58
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,800
Don't worry about the details

59
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,240
Anyway

60
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,680
He was taken by Chu Chen

61
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,919
Chu Chen

62
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,680
You blocked Xiao Cang's perception again

63
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,400
Doesn't Xiao Cang want to be with you forever?

64
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,000
So I fulfilled her wish

65
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,479
To the Mind-Bender helmet

66
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,280
I made a little modification

67
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,719
It can synchronize your memories

68
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,199
And copy an exact replica of you

69
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,759
You won't get away with this

70
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,360
How will we know if we don't try?

71
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,199
Xiao Cang won't need to self-destruct anymore

72
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,840
She can be with you happily forever

73
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,360
However

74
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,199
What she doesn't know is

75
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,680
That "you" is no longer you

76
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,639
If she finds out the truth one day

77
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,680
What will happen?

78
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,079
She should be very happy, right?

79
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,959
Impossible.

80
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,480
Master's neural signals are unique.

81
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,680
You two...

82
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,639
How can you be exactly the same?

83
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,360
Xiao Cang.

84
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,000
Chu Chen used the Mind-Bender helmet

85
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,160
to replicate Memory Extraction Technology.

86
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,720
He copied my mind

87
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,000
to impersonate me

88
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,439
and deceive you.

89
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,680
You must be careful.

90
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,519
Xiao Cang.

91
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:04,680
Don't believe him.

92
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,000
I am Huo Ming.

93
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,439
You told me before

94
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:09,839
that what you fear most

95
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,920
is Hibernation in Low-Power Mode.

96
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,279
It makes you feel like

97
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,680
you are in endless darkness.

98
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,720
What you fear most

99
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,279
is being locked in confinement.

100
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,319
You are the real Master.

101
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,399
Xiao Cang, don't believe him!

102
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,759
He extracted my memories,

103
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,079
that's why he knows these things.

104
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,720
Don't listen to his nonsense.

105
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,519
You have the right to choose.

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,959
No matter who you choose,

107
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,480
I believe in you.

108
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,920
Xiao Cang.

109
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,160
Ignore what he says.

110
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,959
Believe in yourself.

111
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,079
Trust your judgment.

112
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,399
Xiao Cang.

113
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,040
You feel pain right now.

114
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,519
You feel sad.

115
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,480
You feel lost.

116
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,879
But to me,

117
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,000
you are no longer just an AI.

118
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,759
You are my family.

119
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,439
You are my friend.

120
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,079
You have your own choice.

121
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,480
I can accept whatever it is.

122
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,680
Which one of you is my real Master?

123
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,519
Xiao Cang.

124
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,360
If it's hard to choose,

125
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,399
look at those Answer Cards.

126
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,680
Draw one.

127
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,759
And ask your heart.

128
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,240
Xiao Cang.

129
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,800
Trust your intuition.

130
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:25,959
Master.

131
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,519
Now you can believe me, right?

132
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,120
Memories can be copied,

133
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,439
but consciousness cannot be transferred.

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,199
Memories can deceive me,

135
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,439
but feelings cannot.

136
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:42,920
When I was struggling to choose

137
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,319
and feeling in pain,

138
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,120
only Master would truly care about my pain.

139
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,720
Promise me.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,279
No matter what happens,

141
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,160
you must live on well.

142
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,759
You must remember,

143
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,920
I will never give up on you.

144
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,519
Hello, Master.

145
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,160
I have been waiting for you for three years.

146
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,600
I look forward to starting a new life for you.

147
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,600
The AI assistant

148
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,639
can also change clothes by itself.

149
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:08,439
Master,

150
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,519
what I wear

151
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,800
is decided by your consciousness.

152
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,720
Xiao Cang!

153
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,279
I order you to stop!

154
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,399
Xiao Cang!

155
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,360
I don't want you to be locked in confinement.

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,879
I won't forget you, Master.

157
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,160
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!

158
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,839
I don't believe I can't handle you.

159
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,399
Since I can't have it,

160
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,319
you won't get it either.

161
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,199
Chu Chen.

162
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,399
You're here.

163
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,040
Must you really oppose me?

164
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,319
I told you,

165
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,240
The Firmament is mine.

166
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,360
And you are mine too.

167
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,160
I don't belong to anyone.

168
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,000
I love you so much.

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,120
And this is how you treat me?

170
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,759
The person you love most is yourself.

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Your so-called love for me,

172
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,160
is all fake.

173
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,759
So what?

174
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,879
If I can pretend for a lifetime,

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,559
the fake can become real.

176
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,840
Fake is fake.

177
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,600
Fake can never be real.

178
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,600
Huo Ming.

179
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,039
I've given you enough face, haven't I?

180
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,519
Fine.

181
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,120
Since you love him so much,

182
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,879
I'll give you a choice.

183
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:03,639
Either gouge out his eyes and come with me,

184
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,639
or do exactly as I say.

185
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,679
Until I am satisfied.

186
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,799
I'll give you ten seconds to decide.

187
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,159
I don't need to decide.

188
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,480
What do you want me to do?

189
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,279
You like watching dancing, don't you?

190
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,600
Fine.

191
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,559
I'll let you watch your fill today.

192
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,279
Take off your clothes and dance for him.

193
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:30,879
Strip.

194
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,480
Don't do it, Lin Yun!

195
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,000
Enough!

196
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,080
Since you love him so much,

197
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,279
I'll let you know how I feel right now.

198
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,320
What are you doing?

199
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,080
Then I will destroy him.

200
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,440
Huo Ming!

201
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,360
Huo Ming!

202
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,000
No! Huo Ming!

203
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,440
Don't! Huo Ming!

204
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,279
Huo Ming!

205
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,759
Huo Ming!

206
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,879
Chu Chen!

207
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,879
Stop it!

208
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,399
It's time we settled the score

209
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,360
for what happened back then.

210
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:44,279
Huo Ming.

211
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:47,759
What things?

212
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,120
The person who wanted to buy The Firmament three years ago,

213
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,200
was me.
