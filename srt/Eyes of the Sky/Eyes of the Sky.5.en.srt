1
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,520
Run!

2
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,280
Why stop running?

3
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,359
Let me see what your AI Eye looks like.

4
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,200
Photosensitive sensors overloaded by strong light.

5
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,359
Unable to generate images.

6
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,920
Master, shall I overclock?

7
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,000
To improve image resolution.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,239
Do you even need to ask? Overclock now!

9
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,480
Overclocking consumes a lot of power.

10
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,640
It can only last ten seconds.

11
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,000
Ten seconds is enough.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,760
Hurry!

13
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,040
Give me the strongest light!

14
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,359
Master, insufficient power.

15
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,159
Unable to overclock.

16
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,280
Closing all auxiliary functions.

17
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:34,840
I'll do it myself.

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,159
But Master, they'll beat you to death.

19
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,280
I want you to save power.

20
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,120
Xiao Cang.

21
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,799
I don't want you to get locked up.

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,719
Get him!

23
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,359
Under strong light,

24
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,680
he's just a piece of trash.

25
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,040
Kill him.

26
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,159
Master.

27
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,519
I can activate slow motion to escape.

28
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,439
No.

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,719
You will go into hibernation.

30
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,879
Master.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,799
I can hold on.

32
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,280
Who turned off the lights?

33
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
There's no strong light.

34
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,359
President Du.

35
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,159
My showtime has arrived.

36
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,200
I can't see anything.

37
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,599
President Du.

38
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,039
Don't you want to take off your goggles?

39
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,400
Thanks for the lesson, President Du.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,199
I'm taking the chip.

41
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,039
Huo Ming.

42
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,360
I let you in on purpose.

43
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,159
Just to use you to find the chip sample.

44
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:48,199
And then, destroy it.

45
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,520
Warning, warning.

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,879
Chip destroyed.

47
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,280
Please evacuate immediately.

48
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,800
The chip is already destroyed.

49
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,080
Without the chip,

50
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,879
Lin Yun won't get the investment.

51
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,719
Yunzhi Technology is mine.

52
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,879
It's me.

53
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,719
Timely light switch, right?

54
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,879
Although I'm not very educated,

55
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,639
I thought,

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,319
they're wearing goggles.

57
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,879
It's unfair to fight like that.

58
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,520
It's only fair if everyone can't see.

59
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:41,759
Golden partners.

60
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,319
I always felt that

61
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,159
no one dares to resist someone like Du Size.

62
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
Even someone like me,

63
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,159
I can only submit to him.

64
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Listen to everything he says.

65
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,159
Even knowing he does things that are

66
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,400
wicked and immoral.

67
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,479
Until I met you.

68
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,159
You dare to resist.

69
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,560
And you made that jerk suffer.

70
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,560
I respect you.

71
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,319
I want to follow you.

72
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,599
Master.

73
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,960
Based on micro-expressions,

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,159
he is telling the truth.

75
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,960
We're partners from now on.

76
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,079
You're praising me so much I'm embarrassed.

77
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,120
Old Ding.

78
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,399
Low battery warning.

79
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,360
Master, need to charge immediately.

80
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,360
I have something urgent.

81
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,199
I'm leaving first.

82
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,160
Master, I'm sorry.

83
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,879
System is entering hibernation.

84
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:41,959
Lin Yun.

85
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,319
Lin Yun.

86
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,439
Lin Yun.

87
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,120
Help me.

88
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,560
Master.

89
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,360
Detected heart rate accelerating.

90
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,600
Starting to charge now.

91
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,000
It's charging.

92
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,199
It's just a bit slow.

93
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,720
Master.

94
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,959
Adrenaline soaring.

95
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,040
Charging has sped up.

96
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,160
Entering super fast charge.

97
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,000
Activating overclocked charging.

98
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,439
So all her groundwork earlier

99
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:03,000
was to test the charging mode.

100
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,720
It should be fully charged by now.

101
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,360
H-How did you know?

102
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,360
Why...

103
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,720
did we charge so fast?

104
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,519
The speed of bioelectric charging

105
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,199
has nothing to do with voltage.

106
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,519
Theoretically,

107
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,480
any woman who moves your heart

108
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,240
can stimulate your adrenaline secretion

109
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,920
to charge it.

110
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,480
But only someone whose soul aligns with yours

111
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,040
can achieve rapid charging.

112
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,399
You mean...

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,079
our souls are aligned?

114
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,399
Don't get the wrong idea.

115
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,040
In my eyes,

116
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,439
you're just a test subject.

117
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,759
That kiss just now

118
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,879
didn't mean anything else.

119
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:05,759
Thank you.

120
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:06,800
By the way,

121
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,680
the chip was destroyed by Du Size.

122
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,399
We'll have to play it by ear tomorrow.

123
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,240
Okay.

124
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,959
You don't have the chip sample,

125
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,199
and you didn't get the investment.

126
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,000
Sorry,

127
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,000
the company doesn't belong to you anymore.

128
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,480
Lin Yun,

129
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,720
stop struggling.

130
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,800
Drop your high and mighty attitude

131
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,680
and beg us.

132
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,160
Actually,

133
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,240
the most exciting part of hunting

134
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,639
is the prey's final struggle.

135
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:41,240
Bai Xinhui said she decided not to invest.

136
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,399
Lin Yun,

137
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,839
it's time to let go, isn't it?

138
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,079
Lin Yun,

139
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,240
why don't you kneel down

140
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,759
and be my woman?

141
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,120
That way,

142
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,040
maybe I'll cut you some slack.

143
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,800
Sorry about that.

144
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,839
Sorry about that.

145
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,360
Traffic was bad, I'm late.

146
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,519
Everyone's here.

147
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,920
Please continue.

148
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,680
Didn't you say you decided not to transfer the funds?

149
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,079
I said I wouldn't transfer the funds.

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,120
But this is my first collaboration with President Lin.

151
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,639
So to show my sincerity,

152
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,960
I came in person.

153
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,480
You dare to invest without seeing the chip sample?

154
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,600
President Du,

155
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,240
you're talking about this, right?

156
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,200
The chip was destroyed by Du Size.

157
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,879
But what he destroyed was a fake.

158
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,200
Knowing President Du would do this,

159
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,240
luckily, I swapped it out beforehand.

160
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:12,240
From now on, I've officially entered the tech circle.

161
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,480
President Du,

162
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,000
we'll be peers from now on.

163
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:20,480
President Lin,

164
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,399
I can transfer the money once the contract is signed.

165
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:22,759
Good.

166
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,240
But as for certain traitors,

167
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,399
I suggest you make him leave right after getting the money.

168
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,679
I don't want to see him in the company again.

169
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,360
President Xiao, you're fired.

170
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,279
Get out, now.

171
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,000
President Du!

172
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,159
President Du!

173
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,120
Pleasure doing business.

174
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,759
Pleasure doing business.

175
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,879
The company reorganization is complete.

176
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,559
Everyone bought off by Du Size

177
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,519
has been cleared out.

178
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,559
Thank you.

179
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,080
No need.

180
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,200
What did you find?

181
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,120
Based on our AI chip's

182
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,000
search results of the entire server,

183
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,639
the reason The Firmament couldn't be found before

184
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,919
is because a researcher

185
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,080
dismantled it into many segments

186
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,639
and placed them in different locations.

187
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,840
This technology is extremely difficult.

188
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,879
If we want to find The Firmament,

189
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,480
we must find this researcher.

190
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,080
Any leads?

191
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,000
This person,

192
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:26,399
do you recognize her?

193
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,440
It's her.

194
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,759
Her name is Li Xue.

195
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,440
After the incident three years ago,

196
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,679
she said goodbye to scientific research.

197
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,840
Now she's the owner of a gym.

198
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,679
The former Dr. Li

199
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,120
has suddenly transformed

200
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,639
into a gym owner.

201
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:05,759
That's quite a leap.

202
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,279
Hello, sir.

203
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,720
We're closed.

204
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,080
I'm not here to work out.

205
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,639
I need to talk to you.

206
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,840
Li Xue.

207
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,519
I'm sorry,

208
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:25,919
my name isn't Li Xue.

209
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,320
My name is Fu Xue.

210
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,080
This photo...

211
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,200
you remember it, right?

212
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,519
The towel is over there.

213
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,399
Pass it to me.

214
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,080
Thanks.

215
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,279
I'm Huo Ming.

216
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,159
My father is Huo Haiyang.

217
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,879
I have something important to discuss with you.

218
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,919
I don't know Huo Haiyang.

219
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,320
That photo of yours...

220
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,799
Master, dangerous target approaching.

221
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,879
It's the Brain-Burner.

222
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,879
Danger.
