1
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,479
It's completely hopeless now.

2
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,039
You are the murderer who killed President Bai.

3
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,679
President Bai's glorious reputation...

4
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,840
...has ended in your hands just like that.

5
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,799
Butler, call the police.

6
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,479
Call the police! Arrest him!

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,920
Didn't you say you could save my dad?

8
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,599
Dad!

9
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,400
It's been hard on you lately.

10
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,599
Not at all. Sisi did it willingly.

11
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,799
Little Cang, any problems?

12
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,319
Master, no problems.

13
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,480
Dad.

14
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,959
I haven't left yet, and you're already panicking?

15
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,400
Dad!

16
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:46,920
Dad, you're awake!

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,079
This is simply impossible.

18
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,879
How is it possible to use the naked eye...

19
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,799
...to perform nano-level operations?

20
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,480
How did he do that?

21
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,000
What is going on?

22
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,040
How did the chip restart?

23
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,480
Young man, thank you for saving me.

24
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,319
Tell me, what reward do you want?

25
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,879
President Bai, I don't want anything.

26
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,199
That you are alive...

27
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,759
...is the greatest benefit to Cloud Intelligence Tech.

28
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,479
So you're from Cloud Intelligence Tech.

29
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,080
Since you saved me...

30
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,039
...I'll add another 300 million to the investment.

31
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,080
Then I thank you on behalf of President Lin.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,199
So he is Huo Ming.

33
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,000
So you're the Huo Ming my daughter likes.

34
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,680
She's always talking about you in front of me.

35
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,360
Dad!

36
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,120
My ears are callused from hearing about it.

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,840
Why are you bringing this up now?

38
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,960
Very good. I've decided you're my son-in-law.

39
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,840
My great benefactor, thank you.

40
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,599
I...

41
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,319
You ungrateful traitor.

42
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,960
Gather all the data from just now immediately.

43
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,000
Call the police.

44
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,800
I was wrong! I was wrong!

45
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,599
Please, spare me!

46
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,919
Little Cang.

47
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,840
Help me check what the problem really is.

48
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,199
Master.

49
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,960
According to the image analysis just now...

50
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,360
...someone tampered with it.

51
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,759
They remotely controlled the chip...

52
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,360
...and turned off the pacemaker.

53
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,120
Who could it be?

54
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,000
Back-tracing now.

55
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,199
Found it.

56
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,000
It really is President Du behind this.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,479
Why am I not surprised at all?

58
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,639
What nonsense are you talking about?

59
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,159
How did you hack into my computer?

60
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,599
You should thank me.

61
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,159
If I had been ten minutes later...

62
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,360
...and something happened to old man Bai...

63
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,960
...you would be guilty of premeditated murder.

64
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,759
Do you understand?

65
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,479
Jerk.

66
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,479
Didn't you take care of it?

67
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,680
I did everything exactly as you ordered.

68
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,000
He can still turn the tables in this situation?

69
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,280
Get out!

70
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,439
The wealthy son-in-law is back to work.

71
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,199
You really have time on your hands.

72
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,319
I went there to help you.

73
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,560
Are you jealous?

74
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:15,879
Who's jealous?

75
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,240
I'm just asking you...

76
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,360
...if you really became the Bai family's son-in-law...

77
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,279
...can Bai Xinhui charge you?

78
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,160
You like me.

79
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,879
If you like me, just admit it.

80
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,920
What's the big deal?

81
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,160
We're all adults here.

82
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,079
I like you too.

83
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,800
Who are you fooling?

84
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,879
You just want to get charged, don't you?

85
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,600
That's right. Charging.

86
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,399
Yun.

87
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:56,879
I'm back.

88
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:26,759
Make way.

89
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,920
Chu Chen.

90
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,240
When the princess is in trouble,

91
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,920
I, as her guardian knight,

92
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,680
must naturally return to your side to protect you.

93
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,240
Who is this guy?

94
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,079
He talks like he's in a stage play.

95
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,879
That's President Chu Chen.

96
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,439
President Lin's college classmate.

97
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,800
Back then, they were a perfect match.

98
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,040
A match made in heaven.

99
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,040
Lin Yun actually looks so happy to see this guy.

100
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,839
She's even tucking her hair.

101
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,120
He came back this time to propose to President Lin.

102
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,240
Propose?

103
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,199
That's right.

104
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:04,160
Three years ago, when the institute had that accident,

105
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,360
and the company nearly went under,

106
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,240
it was President Chu Chen who saved it.

107
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,600
This company is the fruit of their love.

108
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,439
What fruit?

109
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,560
Staying makes it a fruit of love.

110
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Leaving makes it a kidney stone of love, got it?

111
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,639
Mr. Huo, right?

112
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,000
You look unfamiliar.

113
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,439
But that doesn't matter.

114
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,079
Thank you for helping Xiao Yun guard the company for me.

115
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,720
You're welcome.

116
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,399
I am a shareholder of the company myself.

117
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,720
The two of us happen to have some business.

118
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,360
If you're not busy, you can leave now.

119
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,319
I heard you're a delivery driver, Mr. Huo.

120
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,199
Something like finding Cang Qiong...

121
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,399
is better left to...

122
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,160
professionals like me.

123
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,199
Fine. Let's have a contest then.

124
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,199
See who finds it first.

125
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,399
Do you know why you can't find it?

126
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,600
Because Cang Qiong was disassembled

127
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,920
and hidden in the database.

128
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,199
It was broken down into parts.

129
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,959
The disassembled data possesses camouflage properties.

130
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,879
Ordinary people can't trace it at all.

131
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,079
He's actually showing off.

132
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,800
Xiao Cang, search for some pretentious lines for me.

133
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,160
Okay.

134
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,399
What level of pretentiousness, Master?

135
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,759
Max effect. Super pretentious.

136
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,759
The more pretentious, the better.

137
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,439
Here it comes.

138
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,360
That's right.

139
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,680
The disassembled Cang Qiong

140
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,279
indeed possesses camouflage properties.

141
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,399
It is just like...

142
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,959
the observer paradox in quantum entanglement theory.

143
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,800
The act of observation itself is problematic.

144
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,639
Just like Schrödinger's cat in the box.

145
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,839
What is most important for us now

146
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,360
is to identify the anomalous data,

147
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,720
and then reassemble the parts into a whole.

148
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:50,360
Half each. Can you handle it?

149
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,040
I'll give you a handicap.

150
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,079
Not bad at all.

151
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,959
Your skills are pretty good.

152
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,199
Almost catching up to my level in college.

153
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,279
You're not bad either.

154
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,279
You've forced me to use half my hand speed.

155
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,120
Hand speed is useless.

156
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
The method you are using

157
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,720
is one I discarded ten years ago.

158
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,879
My effective operation rate is 100%.

159
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:14,360
Worry about yourself.

160
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,560
With such fast hand speed,

161
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:16,560
call me "Daddy" when you lose later.

162
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,439
Surprisingly, there are no wasted movements.

163
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,079
Your skills had better be as tough as your talk.

164
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,800
Or I'll look rude for bullying a moron.

165
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,720
The data has all been copied to the hard drive.

166
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,960
Great.

167
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,600
I didn't expect Cang Qiong, which we've sought for three years,

168
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,279
to have been hiding in the company all along.

169
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,279
This is our company's

170
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,919
only remaining lab core chip.

171
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,440
It can activate Cang Qiong.

172
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,840
A password is required.

173
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,320
It's actually this kind of encryption technology.

174
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,600
This is the highest level,

175
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,320
Hydesville-Aipulos data password.

176
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,759
It requires the passwords held separately

177
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,879
by seven researchers to crack.

178
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,720
With the aid of artificial intelligence now,

179
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,279
cracking passwords isn't hard.

180
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,519
Each researcher holds a password of six to thirty characters.

181
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,519
A minimum of forty-two characters,

182
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,840
and a maximum of two hundred and ten.

183
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,279
And it's a combination of numbers and case-sensitive letters.

184
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,200
Each character has sixty-two possibilities.

185
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
That's sixty-two to the one hundred seventieth power,

186
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
combined with the sequence from forty-two

187
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,759
to two hundred and ten characters.

188
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,120
This number approaches infinity.

189
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,399
It cannot be cracked.

190
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,399
You just rattled off a whole bunch of gibberish.

191
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,639
Can you speak human language?

192
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,679
I am speaking language humans can understand.

193
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,440
What do you mean?

194
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,600
Cang Qiong has been activated.

195
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,120
If the correct password isn't entered within three days,

196
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,519
the self-destruct program will initiate.

197
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,679
Countdown: seventy-two hours.

198
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,559
We have to find the researchers' passwords in three days.

199
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,519
That's just too hard.

200
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,120
Mind-Bender has the memories of four researchers.

201
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,120
He should have four passwords.

202
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,519
You must catch him.

203
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,200
How do we catch him?

204
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:21,519
Lin Yun.

205
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,919
Fu Xue has agreed to be the bait.

206
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,519
I will deliberately spread the news

207
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,080
that she has already obtained Cang Qiong.

208
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,919
You went to great lengths to lure me here,

209
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,559
only to use such a cheap trick.

210
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,960
Don't be in such a hurry.

211
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,279
There's a surprise waiting for you.

212
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,120
I've always felt there was something wrong with your helmet.

213
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,080
Today, I'm giving you a little gift.

214
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,159
What do you mean?

215
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,360
Let's see if you can withstand electromagnetic interference.

216
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,679
How are you feeling today?

217
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,399
I'm okay.

218
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,000
I've pretended to lose him as planned.

219
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,480
He's heading back now.

220
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,440
Get ready.

221
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,440
Okay, got it.

222
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,279
Tell me the Cang Qiong password.

223
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,679
I don't know any Cang Qiong password.

224
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,600
You won't talk?

225
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,240
If you won't talk, I'll take it myself.

226
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,639
Let me see your true face.
