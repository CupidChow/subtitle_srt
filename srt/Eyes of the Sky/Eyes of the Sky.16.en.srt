1
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:01,799
Stop!

2
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,480
You're of no use to me anymore.

3
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,040
Huo Ming.

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,799
Wake up.

5
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:10,040
Go to hell!

6
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,680
That's impossible.

7
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,879
Nothing is impossible.

8
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:22,040
Thanks to President Du, I've recovered.

9
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,519
Huo Ming.

10
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,640
See? It's all fine now.

11
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:30,719
Don't be afraid.

12
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,599
I'm here with you.

13
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,920
Don't be afraid. See? It's gone.

14
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
I'm not afraid anymore.

15
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,239
System rebooted.

16
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,959
Master, I am back.

17
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,519
Combat mode activated.

18
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,879
Please go all out.

19
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,080
Huo Ming, are you okay?

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,159
Thank you, Lin Yun.

21
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,000
For helping me overcome my fear.

22
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,319
It still hurts a bit here.

23
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,080
Du Sze has been taken away by the police.

24
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,080
Trespassing and intentional injury.

25
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,000
Plus all the bad things he did before.

26
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,280
He'll be locked up for a long time.

27
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,639
Next up is the paid content.

28
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,800
What are you still doing here?

29
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,120
The TV.

30
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,000
Scared.

31
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,360
It's so scary.

32
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,280
Are you scared?

33
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,560
Not anymore.

34
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,520
Master, I have upgraded.

35
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,080
You won't need to charge me anymore.

36
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,240
Shut up.

37
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,039
Once The Firmament is cracked and the truth is found...

38
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,400
...I will marry you.

39
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,280
I know you came back for The Firmament.

40
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,680
We could have researched The Firmament together.

41
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,840
But instead, you came back to steal the hard drive.

42
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,639
That changes everything.

43
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,800
Boss Chu.

44
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,920
Is Boss Chu missing Lin Yun again?

45
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,639
President Du has been arrested.

46
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,759
What am I going to do now?

47
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,800
I've taken over here.

48
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,600
You're with me now.

49
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,399
Then Sisi...

50
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,279
...belongs to Boss Chu now.

51
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,319
I don't care what you say.

52
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,680
But what you do.

53
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,800
I wonder what Boss Chu wants me to do.

54
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,199
It seems you came prepared.

55
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,399
So, Boss Chu...

56
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,720
...are you ready?

57
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,120
I don't like this.

58
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,800
Forget it.

59
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,879
You have no idea what I want.

60
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Chu Chen.

61
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,240
Chu Chen, what are you doing?

62
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,519
How about...

63
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,560
This place is such a mess.

64
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,920
It's fine.

65
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,160
That's life. A little mess is good.

66
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,519
Your OCD is cured.

67
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,319
I have your exposure therapy to thank.

68
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:52,279
I should still tidy up for you.

69
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,920
How did you make it so messy?

70
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,519
The Firmament's countdown is almost up.

71
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,920
I must get the hard drive back as soon as possible.

72
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,639
Huo Ming.

73
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,559
You didn't really think...

74
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,399
...I'd just leave the hard drive here...

75
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,559
...waiting for you to take it, did you?

76
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,279
The hard drive is on me.

77
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,759
No one can take it away.

78
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,919
You are not Huo Ming.

79
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,360
You dare trick me?

80
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,440
You have a death wish.

81
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,159
Don't!

82
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,120
I'm just a supporting character.

83
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,559
A minor character.

84
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,679
The main character is over there.

85
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,879
You're finally wearing both gloves.

86
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,759
Wearing one glove was too uncomfortable.

87
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,879
Xiao Cang, hack his gloves.

88
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,919
Master.

89
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,120
The gloves have three layers of firewalls.

90
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,919
You need ultra-close contact with the carrier.

91
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,639
To crack it.

92
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,000
Just tell me what to do.

93
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,919
Touch his chest.

94
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,200
The place closest to the heart.

95
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,320
What are you doing?

96
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,000
It's not working, Master.

97
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,120
Connection interrupted.

98
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,720
You need to touch for at least ten seconds.

99
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,919
You just won't stop, will you?

100
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,279
Is it done yet?

101
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,600
Hold on for five more seconds.

102
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Are you crazy?

103
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:42,559
I can't hold on much longer.

104
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:43,960
Connected.

105
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:48,120
I...

106
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,840
I...

107
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Can't move, can you?

108
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,600
You hacked the gloves.

109
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,000
Boss Chu installed smart devices on me.

110
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,279
I'm being controlled too.

111
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,240
Come on, hit me.

112
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,879
You must be tired from fighting.

113
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
Your posture looks quite elegant.

114
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,120
Perfect. Dance for me.

115
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,159
To liven things up.

116
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:20,840
You...

117
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,480
There we go.

118
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,440
Huo Ming!

119
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,440
Just you wait!

120
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Just you wait!

121
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,000
Stop it!

122
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,600
I am your father!

123
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,399
Huo Ming!

124
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,000
I beg you.

125
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,360
I beg you.

126
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,720
Huo Ming! Huo Ming!

127
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:57,559
Huo Ming!

128
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,440
Fight me one-on-one if you have the guts!

129
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,080
Don't go too far!

130
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,559
I...

131
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,360
Huo Ming!

132
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,360
Huo Ming, just you wait!

133
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,000
Just wait until I kill you!

134
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,480
Change it.

135
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,320
I...

136
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Change it again.

137
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,240
Huo Ming!

138
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:54,960
Fight me one-on-one if you have the guts!

139
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,720
Just you wait!

140
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,759
Just you wait!

141
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,480
Alright, alright.

142
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,120
Give me the hard drive.

143
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:07,879
Just wait!

144
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Wait till I'm free!

145
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,399
Wait till I kill you!

146
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,919
Hurry up.

147
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,519
Just wait!

148
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,440
Sit.
