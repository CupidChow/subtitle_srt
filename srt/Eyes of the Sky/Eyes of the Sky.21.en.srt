1
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,799
I'm really lucky today.

2
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,680
It's full of handsome guys.

3
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,040
Where is Huo Ming?

4
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:15,079
Why look for Huo Ming or Huo Dark?

5
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,599
Finding me is good enough.

6
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,920
Cut the crap. I asked where Huo Ming is.

7
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,040
You're a fitness buff, too.

8
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,719
You're so manly.

9
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,680
I like it so much.

10
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,680
Are you sick in the head?

11
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,920
What a good man.

12
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,439
Jerk, I...

13
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,280
Such a magnetic voice.

14
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,879
Magnetic my foot!

15
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,519
Boss Chu, did you catch Huo Ming?

16
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,120
Shut up.

17
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,280
It seems this Huo Ming has strong counter-reconnaissance skills.

18
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,719
Should we try a different method?

19
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,280
No.

20
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,120
Once every twenty minutes.

21
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:02,879
I want to see...

22
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,000
...how long he can hide.

23
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,000
All of you, go!

24
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,239
Keep tracking him for me!

25
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:06,920
Yes, sir.

26
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,599
Darling.

27
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,680
It's been over twenty hours.

28
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,159
You should get some rest.

29
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,120
He's too amazing.

30
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,159
Too scary.

31
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,639
Too perverted.

32
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,280
They say a cunning rabbit has three burrows.

33
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,759
Huo Ming has thirty, even three hundred burrows!

34
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:02,360
From east to west, from south to north.

35
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,240
There's no pattern at all.

36
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,879
In my heart...

37
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,199
...you are always the best.

38
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,599
Sisi believes...

39
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,280
...that as long as you try...

40
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,000
...you will definitely catch Huo Ming.

41
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,400
It seems...

42
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,719
...he knows we are tracking his vision.

43
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,759
We have to call in outside help.

44
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,879
We still have outside help?

45
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,159
The Bai Family, Bai Xinhui.

46
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,639
What reason does she have to help us catch Huo Ming?

47
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,319
Then give her a reason she can't refuse.

48
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,319
A rare guest.

49
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,520
What do you want with me?

50
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,960
Isn't President Bai curious...

51
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,639
...where Huo Ming went?

52
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,439
Why he disappeared?

53
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,560
If he wants to find me, he'll find me naturally.

54
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,199
Then aren't you curious who he went to find?

55
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,199
Who did he go to find?

56
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,319
Actually, I didn't want to say it.

57
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,240
Your Huo Ming and my Lin Yun...

58
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,160
...got engaged.

59
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,279
Who are you fooling? That's impossible.

60
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,199
How could Huo Ming do such a thing?

61
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,600
Besides, Lin Yun is a strong tech woman.

62
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,519
How could she abandon her...

63
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,839
...company she poured her heart into...

64
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,959
...to go get married?

65
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,040
Talk is cheap.

66
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,480
See for yourself.

67
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,560
Someone as excellent as President Bai...

68
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,759
...should be cherished properly.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,319
But that kid Huo Ming doesn't know what's good for him.

70
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,720
He let you down.

71
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,240
Where are the two of them now?

72
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,120
I also want to know where they are.

73
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,360
But I'm not good at finding people.

74
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,160
You came to use me on purpose, didn't you?

75
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,399
How can you call it using?

76
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,199
I just want my Lin Yun...

77
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,639
...to return to my side.

78
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,839
That is all.

79
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,439
If she returns to my side...

80
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,319
...then Huo Ming is...

81
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,600
What exactly is going on with you two?

82
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,959
Is there a problem?

83
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,439
Huo Ming is mine.

84
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,959
I'm going to find him right now.

85
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,480
Xiaohui.

86
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,519
Xiaohui, what a coincidence.

87
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,600
I have things to do, I'm leaving first.

88
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Come back, come back.

89
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,199
What coincidence?

90
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,800
Do you know how many people from the Bai Family I mobilized...

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,360
...and how many hours it took to find you?

92
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,399
Find me?

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,920
Why were you looking for me?

94
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,240
You don't know why I'm looking for you?

95
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,560
You're not here to congratulate me, are you?

96
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,519
Me? Congratulate you?

97
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,439
Thanks.

98
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,519
You know what, Xiaohui?

99
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,360
To get back to the position of Order King...

100
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,399
...do you know how much effort I put in?

101
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,519
I haven't eaten a single bite all day.

102
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,000
I haven't sat on this throne for a long time.

103
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,680
As of right now...

104
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,920
...I'm leading second place by a full forty orders.

105
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,360
Do you know what this means?

106
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,680
Way ahead.

107
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,120
What "way ahead"?

108
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,800
No, wait...

109
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,839
Sit.

110
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,519
That's not what I want to ask you.

111
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,199
You got engaged to Lin Yun?

112
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,680
I might have had that thought in my head before.

113
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,439
But...

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,360
...it was just a thought.

115
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,000
Your Bai Family is really something.

116
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,399
This is my privacy.

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,560
This is called invasion of privacy, you know?

118
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,160
You just thought about it?

119
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,199
You two didn't get engaged?

120
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,319
Of course not. Who told you that?

121
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,439
Chu Chen.

122
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,160
Chu Chen?

123
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,319
Lin Yun might be in danger.

124
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,160
Don't go.

125
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,519
I've already taken Lin Yun away.

126
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,079
Where is Lin Yun?

127
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,199
Come with me and I'll tell you.

128
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,680
Where is Lin Yun?

129
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,360
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,959
I don't know where Lin Yun is either.

131
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,800
Don't go.

132
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,720
I just want you to stay by my side.

133
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,480
Wait a moment.

134
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,360
Chu Chen.

135
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:26,360
President Bai, thank you for helping me find Huo Ming.

136
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,160
What do you mean?

137
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,360
Nothing much.

138
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,360
It's just that he stole something of mine.

139
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,320
I just want to take it back personally.

140
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,200
Let me tell you.

141
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,360
Give up on that idea.

142
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,960
I won't let you get to Huo Ming.

143
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,799
Is that so? That's not up to you anymore.

144
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,919
President Bai.

145
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,399
Haven't you noticed...

146
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,159
...that your personal driver has been replaced?

147
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,080
What is he saying?

148
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,279
Have a good sleep.

149
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,679
Huo Ming!

150
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,000
Chu Chen, where is Huo Ming?

151
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,360
Don't be in such a rush.

152
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,440
Once I get what I want...

153
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,000
...I will return him to you.

154
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,759
Only, whether he'll be in one piece then...

155
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,399
...I can't guarantee.

156
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,519
I'm warning you.

157
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,600
Don't you dare touch him.

158
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,679
You're awake.

159
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,000
Do you see it?

160
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,240
In half an hour,

161
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,720
The Firmament's transfer will be complete.

162
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,720
Now if I gouge out your eyes,

163
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,159
The Firmament will be mine.

164
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,039
You forced me to do this.

165
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,399
Don't worry.

166
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,360
It's just a simple little surgery.

167
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,399
I only want your eyes,

168
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,759
not your life.

169
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,320
Xiao Cang, wake up!

170
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,679
Don't waste your energy.

171
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,840
This room was custom-made for you.

172
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
It blocks all electronic signals.

173
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,919
Your AI Eye cannot be activated.

174
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,159
Just lie there obediently

175
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,639
and let me take back what you stole.

176
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,159
What I stole?

177
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,919
You have the nerve to say that?

178
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,159
I know.

179
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,399
The Firmament was left to you by your dad.

180
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,919
But you don't deserve to own it at all.

181
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,039
Only I do.

182
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:41,360
I will modify my entire body

183
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,679
and become

184
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,240
the King of the World.

185
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,399
High above everyone else.

186
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:49,759
Chu Chen!

187
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,120
You lunatic!

188
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,000
Thanks for the compliment.

Let's begin.
