1
00:00:59,039 --> 00:00:59,840
Lin Yun

2
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,480
Master, you're finally awake.

3
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,560
I found it. It's the third doll on the left.

4
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,640
No.

5
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,120
Chu Chen gave me those.

6
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,200
Lin Yun.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,200
Still angry?

8
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:28,640
Lin Yun.

9
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,959
Listen to my explanation.

10
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,040
This is what Chu Chen gave to Bai Xinhui.

11
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,680
It uses Du Sze's technology.

12
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,120
It can control people's minds.

13
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,599
That's how I was harmed by him.

14
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,480
Believe me.

15
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,680
You don't need to explain to me.

16
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,040
You're free to do whatever you want.

17
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,560
I...

18
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,079
I'm not making excuses.

19
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:49,159
I'm trying to say there's something wrong with Chu Chen.

20
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,239
There is nothing wrong with Chu Chen.

21
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,959
He just wants to acquire Du Sze's company.

22
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,480
Don't you know there's a problem with Du Sze?

23
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,680
Chu Chen will keep him in check.

24
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,280
Their goal is Cang Qiong.

25
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
Are you done?

26
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,439
You trust them that much?

27
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,520
Before the final cut in a pig-butchering scam,

28
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,080
people trust them just like you do.

29
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,639
Is it because of Bai Xinhui?

30
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,520
There is really nothing between Bai Xinhui and me.

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,840
You have to believe me.

32
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,639
Except for charging,

33
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,120
you never actively look for me.

34
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,639
What am I in your eyes?

35
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,560
A power bank? A portable charger?

36
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,840
As for Chu Chen, he's different.

37
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,840
He was abroad for so many years,

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,800
yet he remembers that whenever I accelerate while driving,

39
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,879
it means I'm sleepy.

40
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,680
That I love cilantro.

41
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,120
That I'm allergic to eggs.

42
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,560
Do you know that?

43
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,759
Do you understand that?

44
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,719
Do you get me?

45
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,599
Move out. Leave this place.

46
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,639
So your AI Eye

47
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,560
relies on Lin Yun to recharge.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,039
Without power, it's useless trash.

49
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,319
Huo Ming.

50
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:28,840
I never expected your biggest weakness to be Lin Yun.

51
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,759
Boss, that's impressive.

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,639
You found his weakness so quickly.

53
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
Boss.

54
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,560
You transitioned into the role quite naturally.

55
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,680
Thank you for the compliment, Boss.

56
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,319
It is my honor to follow you, Boss.

57
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,360
Huo Ming's AI Eye

58
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,280
fuses so perfectly with his cerebral nerves.

59
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,080
What a magnificent test subject.

60
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:51,879
Boss.

61
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,840
Why don't we just take some men and grab Huo Ming,

62
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,719
to do research on him?

63
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,520
Do you know why you can't beat Huo Ming?

64
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,360
Why?

65
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,080
You look like you have a high IQ,

66
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,479
but you do nothing but stupid things.

67
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,599
Yes.

68
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,240
Then what should we...

69
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,439
Stop always thinking about fighting and killing.

70
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,960
Use your brain.

71
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,759
Since he needs Lin Yun to recharge,

72
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,879
we make sure he can't recharge.

73
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,639
A phone without a battery,

74
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,519
is useless no matter how smart it is.

75
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,279
Boss, brilliant.

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,639
Get lost.

77
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,680
You got it.

78
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,439
Huo Ming, just go.

79
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,160
I've packed your things for you.

80
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,360
How can I make Lin Yun believe

81
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,319
that there's something wrong with that kid Chu Chen?

82
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,079
Finally found you.

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,839
Let's go. There's a jade auction needing an expert eye.

84
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,959
Come do a guest appearance.

85
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,759
Not in the mood.

86
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,160
What's wrong?

87
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,519
Had a fight with Lin Yun?

88
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,120
How did you know?

89
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,040
That's a good thing. Why the long face?

90
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,639
Come on, give me a smile. Smile.

91
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,720
Xiao Hui, do me a favor.

92
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,480
Keep an eye on Chu Chen for me.

93
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
I think there's something wrong with him.

94
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:18,959
Chu Chen played me, too.

95
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,079
I've got people watching him closely, too.

96
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,839
Just now they reported that...

97
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,360
he went to a gym.

98
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,839
Found a beautiful female coach.

99
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,279
The two of them were flirting and getting cozy...

100
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,560
He went to a gym?

101
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,040
Who did he go to see?

102
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,800
I don't know.

103
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,879
Anyway, it's called Xiaoxue Gym or something.

104
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,480
Lend me your car.

105
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,040
Xiao Cang.

106
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,639
Activate AI Eye intelligent analysis.

107
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,480
Yes, Master.

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,160
Analyzing lip movements.

109
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,279
They are discussing the research institute from back then.

110
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,720
So they knew each other all along.

111
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:20,879
Hello.

112
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,040
Your delivery is here.

113
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,439
I didn't order delivery.

114
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,639
Must be a mistake.

115
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,439
No mistake.

116
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,639
Fried chicken and fries.

117
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,480
Ordered for you.

118
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,000
Huo Ming.

119
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't you know fried chicken is the gym's

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,759
number one enemy?

121
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,439
People come here to work out.

122
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,680
They all care about body management.

123
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,720
I know.

124
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,519
So I brought you a fruit and vegetable smoothie.

125
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,399
Guilt-free, tasty, and non-fattening.

126
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,639
Business is pretty good at the gym today.

127
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,120
Even Chu Chen came to get a membership.

128
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,839
What are you talking about?

129
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,240
Why would Chu Chen come here?

130
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,319
I must have seen it wrong.

131
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,959
I'm going to class.

132
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,160
She's lying to cover something up.

133
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:19,199
Analyze all the research institute data for me.

134
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,240
See if you can find any clues about Chu Chen.

135
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,639
Integrating analysis, searching for key information.

136
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,879
Master, I found it.

137
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,680
Chu Chen is definitely suspicious.

138
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,680
Lin Yun, look at this photo.

139
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,240
He knew my father a long time ago.

140
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,360
Yet he pretended not to know him.

141
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
He's quite the actor.

142
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,079
Chu Chen worked at the research institute back then.

143
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,240
Many people know that.

144
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,839
You weren't there at the time, so you didn't know him.

145
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,879
I was the one who introduced him to the institute.

146
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,160
Three years ago, when the accident happened at the institute,

147
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,639
he went abroad just a couple of days later.

148
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,879
Is there really such a coincidence?

149
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,160
Even if he isn't the mastermind,

150
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,199
he's still highly suspicious, right?

151
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,240
Chu Chen's plan to go abroad

152
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
was decided long before that.

153
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,319
Even if nothing happened at the institute,

154
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,560
he would have left on schedule.

155
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,199
That could have been planned too.

156
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,360
He destroys the institute first,

157
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,959
then goes abroad to clear himself of suspicion.

158
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,040
Huo Ming.

159
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,720
I know you hate Chu Chen,

160
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,319
but without evidence, you can't just

161
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,600
make wild speculations about others.

162
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,120
I...

163
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,720
You're like a completely different person now.

164
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,040
You are controlled by jealousy.

165
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,839
I'm controlled by jealousy?

166
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,480
You're the one being controlled, Lin Yun.

167
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:28,959
You should go.

168
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,480
You've been practically brainwashed by him.

169
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,039
Boss, that was brilliant.

170
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,759
They were inseparable before,

171
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,080
but now they're about to break up.

172
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,200
My relationship with Lin Yun...

173
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,480
how can a delivery guy like him compare?

174
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Then he can't go to Lin Yun to recharge now.

175
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,360
Our chance has come.

176
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,440
I'll arrange for someone to deal with him right now.

177
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,519
I told you, stop always thinking about fighting and killing.

178
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,639
Use your brain.

179
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
Yes, Boss.

180
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,799
Then... then what do we do now?

181
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,840
I'll send you Dr. Shen's number in a moment.

182
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,879
Just tell her the last researcher has been found.

183
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,600
And then?

184
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,639
I have my own plans.

185
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:18,840
The number.

186
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,759
You go first, I'll send it to you in a bit.

187
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,759
Got it.

188
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:32,399
Huo Ming.

189
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,080
Dr. Shen.

190
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,399
I received a call today.

191
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,000
It said the last researcher has been found.

192
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,440
Who called?

193
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,120
I don't know, it was a strange number.

194
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,200
They hung up right after speaking.

195
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,679
Could it be Mind-Bender?

196
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,120
Mind-Bender is nothing more than

197
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,360
a puppet wearing a helmet.

198
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,840
His true goal

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,960
is to find the seven researchers of Cang Qiong

200
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,559
and get the passwords they hold.

201
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
You're not safe either. Come with me.

202
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,039
Wait a moment.

203
00:09:58,879 --> 00:09:59,759
This is the password.

204
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,759
Huo Ming, it's safer with you.

205
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,200
Thank you.

206
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,320
I will definitely find out the truth.

207
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:13,960
I have some other clues.

208
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,600
He was my doctoral supervisor.

209
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,759
He participated in many major studies.

210
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,200
I suspect

211
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,279
he is the last researcher we're looking for.

212
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,559
Where is he?

213
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,080
Professor Ning.

214
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:41,600
Professor Ning.

215
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,799
What professor? Who are you looking for?

216
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,240
Professor Ning.

217
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,720
Mind-Bender has already found six researchers.

218
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,000
The password you hold is also his target.

219
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,320
If you don't want to end up in a vegetative state,

220
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,399
you'd better choose to believe me.

221
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,879
What is this nonsense?

222
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,399
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

223
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,279
Don't get in the way of my work, okay?

224
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,159
Professor Ning, stop pretending.

225
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,120
My father is Huo Haiyang.

226
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,519
Come with me.

227
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,799
I usually like to listen to some music.

228
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,759
Here, have some water.

229
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,039
Thank you.

230
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,240
Professor Ning.

231
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:42,440
Mind-Bender has now...

232
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,240
...already obtained four passwords.

233
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,320
These are all researchers...

234
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,759
...whose memories were extracted by him.

235
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,639
They have all been left in a vegetative state.

236
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,559
They used to be your friends...

237
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,559
...students, and colleagues.

238
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,799
I never expected...

239
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,360
...that their own scientific achievements...

240
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,879
...would harm them like this.

241
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,000
Professor Ning.

242
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,600
Cangqiong used part of the research...

243
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,960
...to create Mind-Bender.

244
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,279
If they get their hands on all the research...

245
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,200
...the consequences will be unimaginable.

246
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,159
Cangqiong isn't what you imagine.

247
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,000
Once cracked, it will be even more dangerous.

248
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,039
You're too impatient.

249
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,000
I...

250
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,440
I just want to keep the initiative...

251
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,759
...in my own hands.

252
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,480
What are you laughing at?

253
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,720
Master, system anomaly.

254
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,200
System shutting down.

255
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:45,799
There's something wrong with the water.

256
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,200
There is nothing wrong with the water.

257
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,799
I know you have the AI Eye.

258
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,360
It can scan for and detect abnormal substances.

259
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,480
How do you know?

260
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:58,960
I led the development of the AI Eye.

261
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,960
My research focus is intelligent assistive devices.

262
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,759
I know it very well.

263
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,960
But the AI Eye is just an eye, after all.

264
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,240
It can only see...

265
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,559
...it cannot hear.

266
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,679
This playback device...

267
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,720
...emits sound waves at a special frequency.

268
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,519
It creates vibrations that interfere with all electronics.

269
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,279
Even if Mind-Bender were here...

270
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,080
...he'd have to obediently shut down too.

271
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,440
You know clearly that I am not Mind-Bender.

272
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,440
Why are you doing this to me?

273
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,120
I'm sorry, Huo Ming.

274
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,399
You came too late.

275
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,360
I have already reached a deal with him.

276
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,559
I gave him the passwords too.

277
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,879
Now, as long as I catch you...

278
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,240
...I will be safe.

279
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,159
Professor Ning.

280
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,399
I didn't expect you to be this kind of person.

281
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,279
Just leave me alone.

282
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:21,559
Because I have so many unfinished projects.

283
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,759
I don't want to become a vegetable yet.

284
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:31,159
Xiao Cang, boot up, quick!

285
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,919
After fighting you for so long...

286
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,960
...I'm actually a bit reluctant to end this.

287
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,279
Xiao Cang, boot up, quick!

288
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,399
I really want to see...

289
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,559
...as Huo Haiyang's son...

290
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,240
...what else you actually know.

291
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,399
I didn't expect it to go this smoothly.

292
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,480
Extraction nearly complete.
