1
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,920
Low battery warning. Low battery warning.

2
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,719
Master, please charge immediately.

3
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,480
Otherwise, the system will automatically sleep.

4
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:14,000
Xiao Cang, how do I charge you?

5
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,920
I don't know.

6
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,120
Master, I cannot sleep.

7
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,560
Once the system shuts down...

8
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,120
...you will become a fool again.

9
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,280
We must try every possible way to charge.

10
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,280
Searching for charging devices.

11
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,040
Power strip ahead on the left.

12
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:38,959
Come on.

13
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,879
You're so high-tech...

14
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,079
...can't you have a charging port like a phone?

15
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,359
Huo Ming.

16
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,000
Huo Ming.

17
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,439
Huo Ming, wake up.

18
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,560
What's wrong with you?

19
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,000
I...

20
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,280
What's going on?

21
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,120
Does Lin Yun need charging too?

22
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,599
Lin Yun.

23
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,000
Master, it's charging.

24
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,080
It feels so good.

25
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,639
Hold her tight. Hold her tight.

26
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,840
Don't let go.

27
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,639
Don't let go, keep charging.

28
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,080
Master.

29
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,639
Lin Yun is your power bank.

30
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,680
I know why when you first saw her...

31
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,080
...those codes flashed up.

32
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,520
Those codes were guiding you to charge from her.

33
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:00,000
What the hell kind of tech is this?

34
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,840
Get close to her, quick.

35
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,039
Let me charge a bit more.

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,000
Master, it's charging.

37
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,080
Get closer.

38
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,439
A little closer.

39
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,800
A little closer.

40
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,879
Closer, closer.

41
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,439
So fast.

42
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,280
Super fast charge connected.

43
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,199
Let's switch positions.

44
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,319
Maybe it'll be faster.

45
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,280
Not fully charged yet.

46
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,199
One more time.

47
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,759
Pervert

48
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,639
Pervert

49
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,600
I... I... I...

50
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,720
Well, you just fainted.

51
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,199
I put you on the sofa.

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,079
If I said I was charging,

53
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,360
would you believe me?

54
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,199
I believe you.

55
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,680
You do?

56
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,319
You have an AI eye.

57
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,759
It needs bioelectricity to function.

58
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,439
Other energy conversion rates are too low.

59
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,759
This is the only way to charge.

60
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,240
How do you know?

61
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,920
Because this energy supply method...

62
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,079
was designed by me.

63
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,439
But the problem is,

64
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,959
the way you just acted...

65
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,600
you didn't seem like a fool.

66
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,600
If I hadn't seen you charging,

67
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,600
I would have almost been fooled by you.

68
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,360
Huo Ming.

69
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,639
Isn't it tiring pretending to be stupid?

70
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,240
It's alright.

71
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,839
The first time I went to your company,

72
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,600
you suspected me, didn't you?

73
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,399
I checked.

74
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,800
The person at Professor Yang's apartment that day...

75
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:10,879
was you.

76
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,839
Yes, it was me.

77
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,000
Why did you run?

78
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,439
You wouldn't suspect

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,199
that I'm the Brain Burner, right?

80
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,279
You were highly suspicious.

81
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,480
Of course I suspected you.

82
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,319
But since you used me to charge,

83
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,639
and you have an AI eye,

84
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm sure you aren't him.

85
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,399
But why pretend to be stupid?

86
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,800
Three years ago,

87
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,399
the institute was destroyed,

88
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,560
and Cang Qiong went missing.

89
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,480
Those who wanted to steal Cang Qiong back then...

90
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,720
are still at large.

91
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,120
To protect myself,

92
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,639
I had no other choice.

93
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,000
Besides,

94
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,879
I didn't know what your intentions were,

95
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,279
so I played the fool.

96
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,639
My goal...

97
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,879
is to investigate the truth of what happened,

98
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,120
and retrieve Cang Qiong.

99
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,680
Then we are the same.

100
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,600
Why don't we team up?

101
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,199
Defeat Du Size,

102
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
find all the researchers,

103
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
and find Cang Qiong.

104
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,279
Pleasure working with you.

105
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,240
Since we're partners now,

106
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,639
could you stop monitoring me?

107
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,800
Acting like a dog in front of cameras...

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,879
is really tiring.

109
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,319
Mr. Du,

110
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,120
are you here to give me money again?

111
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,480
You're right, Mr. Bai.

112
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,920
Cooperate with me,

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,639
and I guarantee you'll make money.

114
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,839
Why should I trust you?

115
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,519
Lin Yun needs 200 million to buy back shares.

116
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,680
That's the price after I intentionally inflated it.

117
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,120
Once Yunzhi Tech becomes mine,

118
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,079
you can invest at the original price,

119
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,000
saving at least half the money.

120
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,240
But I already promised Lin Yun.

121
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,000
I should at least wait for her to arrive.

122
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,240
No need to wait.

123
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,720
They can't make it.

124
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,959
You are...

125
00:06:59,439 --> 00:06:59,879
Let's go.

126
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,839
Mr. Du has suddenly become so humane.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,759
I'm really not used to it.

128
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,600
There are no eternal enemies or friends,

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,399
only eternal interests.

130
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,920
If our two companies cooperate,

131
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,680
it's a win-win.

132
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,000
Such a beastly deed...

133
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,079
only Mr. Du could pull it off.

134
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,000
You were clearly unconscious.

135
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,639
How can you be here?

136
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,000
We have Mr. Du to thank for that,

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,720
and the doctor you kindly sent us.

138
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
She wants 200 million for the investment.

139
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,040
Once I acquire Yunzhi Tech,

140
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,800
Mr. Bai, you'll only need 100 million

141
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,600
to get the same equity.

142
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,399
This math...

143
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,240
Mr. Bai can surely figure it out.

144
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,639
That's right, Ms. Lin.

145
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,279
Mr. Du has a point.

146
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:25,040
I knew Mr. Du would pull this.

147
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,480
Mr. Bai, to show our sincerity,

148
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,360
of the 200 million,

149
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,720
100 million will be for shares,

150
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,200
and 100 million for fixed-income investment,

151
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,960
which will enjoy double returns.

152
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,320
We won't let Mr. Bai lose out.

153
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,919
All right.

154
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,039
Since Ms. Lin is so sincere,

155
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,120
I'll invest the 200 million.

156
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,000
Scientific research isn't a game.

157
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,440
Technical reserves are useless.

158
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,159
We need to see actual results.

159
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,000
We already have the chip sample.

160
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,320
We can go to the company to see it now.

161
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,320
Sure.

162
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,600
Let's go take a look right now.

163
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,120
I'd like to see something impressive.

164
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,720
Mr. Bai.

165
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,080
Trust me.

166
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,960
Even if you go,

167
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,080
you won't see anything.

168
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:03,559
Sorry, Ms. Lin.

169
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,080
Move aside.

170
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,039
Sorry, Ms. Lin.

171
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,799
You can't go any further.

172
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:11,559
Move aside.

173
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:12,960
This is my company.

174
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,720
That's not necessarily true.

175
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,440
Ms. Lin.

176
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,879
I am very sorry.

177
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,919
Until you buy back the shares,

178
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,080
the board has decided

179
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,919
that I will temporarily take over the company.

180
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,080
Mr. Xiao.

181
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,279
This is Mr. Bai.

182
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,840
As long as he sees the chip sample,

183
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,080
we can sign the contract

184
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,720
and secure the investment.

185
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,799
The chip sample...

186
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:34,279
is the company's most important core technical asset.

187
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,399
How could I possibly let you

188
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,039
access it so casually?

189
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,639
Ms. Lin, don't blame me.

190
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,039
Mr. Du's offer was too tempting.

191
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,720
Once Mr. Du acquires the company,

192
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,519
I'll be the CEO.

193
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,399
That's right.

194
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,480
Mr. Xiao is much more suitable

195
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,320
to run the company than Ms. Lin.

196
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,679
Ms. Lin.

197
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,480
Given the current situation,

198
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,840
I won't be investing.

199
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,399
I will definitely get the chip back.

200
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,080
It's all my fault.

201
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,480
I was too focused on research.

202
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,039
My control over the company was too weak.

203
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,039
I didn't guard against the traitor.

204
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,679
Have they already got the chip?

205
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,360
No.

206
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,279
The real chip sample...

207
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,200
only I know

208
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,799
what the serial number is.

209
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,320
190709.

210
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,120
The only way now

211
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,039
is to find the encrypted badge

212
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,080
and enter the data room.

213
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,039
I'll figure something out.

214
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,720
You have a new delivery order.

215
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,279
I have to work now.

216
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,080
Hello.

217
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,279
Your delivery has arrived.

218
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,279
Please put it on the table for me.

219
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,759
Excuse me

220
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,200
My water pipe is broken

221
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,639
Could you help me fix it?

222
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,200
The tools are all inside

223
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,480
I still have orders to deliver

224
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,440
It's about to time out

225
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,720
Don't be in such a rush

226
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:07,039
I can pay you ten times the compensation

227
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,120
Encrypted badge

228
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,200
This is useful

229
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,519
Master, something is odd here

230
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,679
It might be a trap

231
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
I must get the badge first

232
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
What?

233
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,320
Is that not enough?

234
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,440
Fine, I'll help you fix it

235
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,840
Mr. Du, he went inside

236
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,480
Good

237
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:31,000
You ruin my plans every time

238
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,720
I need to check if you have

239
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,840
any tech enhancements

240
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,399
Master, decryption and copying started

241
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,639
It will take a little time

242
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,120
It's not easy to fix

243
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,600
It needs some time

244
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,480
No rush

245
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,120
I have time

246
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:57,919
Start scanning

247
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:00,000
Sisi, stall him for twenty seconds

248
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,279
Guide his line of sight

249
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,480
to look at the camera

250
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,639
Xiao Cang, hurry up

251
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,679
I'm being scanned

252
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,440
Yes, Master

253
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,480
I'm speeding up now

254
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,399
Five

255
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,399
Four

256
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,799
Three

257
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,120
Two

258
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,639
Master, done

259
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,320
Scan interrupted

260
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,679
You idiot, just one second short

261
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,759
Sorry

262
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,000
I can't fix it

263
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,039
Stall him, quick

264
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,200
Don't go! Keep fixing it

265
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,440
Nice stockings

266
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:38,840
Remember to put your clothes on properly

267
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,120
I still have deliveries to make

268
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,120
Twenty seconds

269
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,080
You couldn't even stall him for twenty seconds

270
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,159
Useless

271
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,320
So it's the eyes

272
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,360
The nerves in the eyeball are incredibly complex

273
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,679
Yet they integrated so well

274
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,320
This must be Cang Qiong's technology

275
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,639
Since it is an AI Eye

276
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,399
it must be sensitive to intense nanowave light

277
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,039
Lin Yun said the sample number is 190709

278
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,240
Xiao Cang, initiate search

279
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,639
Found it

280
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:36,600
Mr. Du

281
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
Huo Ming has taken the bait

282
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,879
Looks like we can kill two birds with one stone

283
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,879
Huo Ming

284
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,240
Didn't expect this, did you?

285
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,879
The AI Eye's photosensitive elements

286
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,000
are most vulnerable to intense light

287
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,279
Don't you really want

288
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,720
the goggles we're wearing?

289
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,759
Sorry

290
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,159
None for you

291
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,200
Get him!
