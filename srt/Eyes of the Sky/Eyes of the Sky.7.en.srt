1
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,240
Master, you've been hacked by unknown code.

2
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,399
Your body is unable to move.

3
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,280
Capture Huo Ming for me.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,680
And bring Dr. Shen back with care.

5
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,480
Huo Ming, I really have to thank you.

6
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,840
By analyzing your AI Eye,

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,159
the AI Glasses that stalled me for two years

8
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,439
have finally been successfully developed.

9
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,840
They can even reverse-control your AI Eye.

10
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,480
You brat.

11
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,799
Let's see where you run now.

12
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,120
System receiving strong electrical stimulation.

13
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,560
Releasing control.

14
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,439
With these AI Glasses,

15
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,400
you're just a lamb to the slaughter.

16
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,920
A complete waste of space.

17
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,519
Move, then!

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,519
Aren't you tough? Get up!

19
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,159
Get him! Beat him hard!

20
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,599
Xiao Cang.

21
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,319
Help me track them.

22
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,520
Where have they taken Dr. Shen?

23
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,719
Master, battery too low. Unable to track.

24
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,199
Fine. Charge first.

25
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,719
This set of movements

26
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,159
is also one of the research results from back then.

27
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,120
Created by combining Five Animal Frolics and Yoga.

28
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,039
It can boost adrenaline secretion

29
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,280
and also charge your AI Eye.

30
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,639
Your heart rate has reached 160.

31
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,680
System charging.

32
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,599
As long as it helps you break free from Lin Yun's grip,

33
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,159
a little sacrifice from me is nothing.

34
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,080
President Lin, we found Huo Ming.

35
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,479
He's at Xiao Xue Gym.

36
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,319
Good.

37
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,000
How is it? Any reaction?

38
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,560
Is... is that something I can say?

39
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:07,080
I'm talking about the battery level.

40
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,199
Master.

41
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,000
You slow-charged with her for 30 minutes.

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,439
Battery level increased by 6%.

43
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,479
It... it works.

44
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,840
But it's very slow.

45
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,600
Did Lin Yun tamper with something?

46
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,800
Why is she the only one who can fast charge?

47
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,959
It seems

48
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,360
we'll have to charge a bit longer.

49
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,560
Come on, let's do the next move.

50
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,680
I think you should stretch this part.

51
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,160
That feels good.

52
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,759
I'll go get some drinks.

53
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:41,959
You saw it, too.

54
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,040
As for charging in the future,

55
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,199
I won't need to trouble you anymore.

56
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,439
Sometimes what you see isn't necessarily the truth.

57
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,600
I only believe my own eyes.

58
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:52,759
I traded with Mind-Bender just to catch him.

59
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,560
I didn't expect him to see through it.

60
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,600
No matter what,

61
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
our goals are the same.

62
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,240
Got it.

63
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,720
Huo Ming.

64
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,800
I've upgraded you to Diamond VIP.

65
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,000
Come see me often from now on.

66
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,879
Really?

67
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,040
You're so good to me.

68
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm afraid I might just give myself to you.

69
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,040
Master.

70
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,720
We must find Lin Yun to charge.

71
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,959
Otherwise, for the upcoming operation...

72
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:26,680
Shut up.

73
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,000
That kid Huo Ming actually messaged me.

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,240
He says he'll rescue her in five minutes.

75
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
Rest assured, President Du.

76
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,319
We've set up a laser array.

77
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,000
The laser power reaches 600,000 hertz.

78
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,040
It can instantly vaporize any matter.

79
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,839
Full-range grid scanning.

80
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,800
Even if Huo Ming grew wings, he couldn't get in.

81
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,040
Tell everyone to stay on high alert.

82
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,600
I'd like to see what tricks this kid has.

83
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,160
Yes, sir.

84
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,279
I'm taking her.

85
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,079
Farewell.

86
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,279
Quick! Quick! Go check!

87
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:20,839
Yes!

88
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,680
Come back! Protect me!

89
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,360
Stand here.

90
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,680
Protect the boss!

91
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,920
She's still here.

92
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:37,920
Darn it.

93
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,959
I really have to thank you.

94
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,639
For leading me to where Dr. Shen is being held.

95
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,240
So what if you found it?

96
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,000
Saving her won't be that easy.

97
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,480
Master, we need to move fast.

98
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,199
We're about to enter low power mode.

99
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,800
Huo Ming

100
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,879
Dr. Shen, come with me.

101
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,639
Huo Ming

102
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,240
Shen Meng is mine.

103
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,279
Do you have enough power without Lin Yun?

104
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,600
Master, battery level below 1%.

105
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,799
Need to charge immediately.

106
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,000
Huo Ming, you've fallen into my trap.

107
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,080
I gave Professor Yang's memories to Lin Yun on purpose.

108
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,080
Just so you would help me find Shen Meng.

109
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,399
And to drive a wedge between you two.

110
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,480
Running out of power, aren't you?

111
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,440
You can't beat me.

112
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,639
Master, power is about to run out.

113
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,679
I am about to go into hibernation.

114
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,639
Super fast charging in progress.

115
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Go to hell!

116
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,120
You've been tricked.

117
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,159
Impossible.

118
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,399
That day you called Lin Yun...

119
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,399
...to make her appear where I was chasing you.

120
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,039
Huo Ming

121
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,720
To make me misunderstand that Lin Yun was covering for you.

122
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,279
Lin Yun showed me her recorder.

123
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,240
I trusted her long ago.

124
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,000
Then we played along.

125
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,559
I made a deal with Mind-Bender...

126
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,200
...and we argued...

127
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,960
...just to make you think...

128
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
...that I didn't have enough power without Lin Yun.

129
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,480
Only then would you show yourself.

130
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,360
Stop chasing, you're out of power.

131
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,080
Are you okay?

132
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:00,759
Me?

133
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,159
What could happen to me?

134
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:03,759
I'm so awesome.

135
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,240
I'll definitely catch him next time.

136
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,279
Just now, I...

137
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,440
I knocked him to the ground in one hit.

138
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,480
You saw it too.

139
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,399
Really. You don't believe me? I...

140
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,799
You're doing all the talking.

141
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,240
Really.

142
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,000
If he hadn't run, I would've caught him for sure.

143
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,600
You're bragging.
