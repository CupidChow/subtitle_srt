1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,560
Master

2
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,159
Dangerous target approaching detected.

3
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,679
It's Mind-Bender.

4
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,679
Danger.

5
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,439
AI control system detected in the helmet.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,359
So it's an AI helmet.

7
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,920
His skills...

8
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,959
Truly Huo Haiyang's son.

9
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,360
Huo Ming.

10
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,199
Lin Yun.

11
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,000
Why are you here?

12
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,360
I...

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,080
Mind-Bender.

14
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,879
Mind-Bender is here.

15
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,360
I...

16
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,639
Too bad he got away.

17
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,960
Why are you here?

18
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
I came to take out the trash.

19
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,319
And to meet a client.

20
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,080
A client?

21
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,560
My client is here. I'm leaving.

22
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,879
I've arrived.

23
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,879
Meeting a client at 10 PM?

24
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,319
Her surprised expression lasted over a second.

25
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,759
Obviously faked on purpose.

26
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,479
Is she covering for Mind-Bender?

27
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,039
My name really is Li Xue.

28
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,319
I am one of the seven researchers.

29
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,240
Are you in charge of dismantling The Firmament?

30
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,080
I'm mainly responsible for The Firmament's repair and networking.

31
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,759
Can your AI Eye connect to the network?

32
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,159
Connect to the network?

33
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,840
This nanobot...

34
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,080
...can help fix the flaw preventing network connection.

35
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,159
Xiao Cang, is it safe?

36
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,280
Master, I cannot analyze it for now.

37
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,560
We have to take the risk.

38
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,159
AI Eye smart networking function upgraded.

39
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,680
This thing...

40
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,160
Lin Yun has it too.

41
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,279
She didn't use it on you.

42
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,680
Lin Yun is very complicated.

43
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,240
I've always felt...

44
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:35,639
...that Lin Yun is closely connected to Mind-Bender.

45
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,839
Xiao Cang, search for Lin Yun.

46
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,839
Yes, Master.

47
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,639
I found that...

48
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,920
...Lin Yun has been researching memory extraction technology.

49
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,439
It seems Fu Xue was right.

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,120
I have a USB drive here.

51
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,839
All the data I know is inside.

52
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,639
It's just a pity...

53
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,439
...the key is lost.

54
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,879
Now that your AI Eye is upgraded...

55
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,360
...you can crack it.

56
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,120
Charging in progress.

57
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,079
I'm also soul-compatible with her.

58
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,439
Not really.

59
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,519
It can also charge a little.

60
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,480
It's just very slow.

61
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,360
It can help out in a pinch.

62
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,120
Cracking the key...

63
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,720
...consumes a lot of the AI Eye's power.

64
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,480
If you need charging...

65
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,560
...you can come find me.

66
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,480
I've given you the USB drive.

67
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,439
I have things to do. I'm leaving now.

68
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,720
You went to find Li Xue today.

69
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,319
You gave a lot.

70
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,040
After you stopped playing dumb...

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,879
...you've changed a lot.

72
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,279
We've already clashed head-on.

73
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,639
No need to pretend anymore.

74
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,240
Since that's the case...

75
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,639
...why don't we speak openly?

76
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,639
You ask, I answer.

77
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,160
Okay.

78
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,639
For the past three years...

79
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,480
...you've been looking for the researchers.

80
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,279
But just as you find a researcher...

81
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:20,959
...their memories...

82
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,480
...have already been extracted by Mind-Bender.

83
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,879
Memories extracted...

84
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,720
Done by Mind-Bender again.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,079
Ever since what happened to Professor Yang...

86
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,959
...I've suspected there's a mole in the company.

87
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,160
While I was tracking Mind-Bender today...

88
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,639
...you just happened to appear.

89
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,519
Huo Ming.

90
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,720
Is this a coincidence?

91
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:46,519
No.

92
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,439
I went there today...

93
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,120
...specifically to find Mind-Bender.

94
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,279
You don't suspect...

95
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,920
...that I'm covering for Mind-Bender?

96
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,759
Lin Yun.

97
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,879
You're still keeping things from me.

98
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,360
President Lin

99
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,560
You're right on time.

100
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,079
Xiao Cang, help me locate Lin Yun.

101
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,279
Yes, Master.

102
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,279
Locating now.

103
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,639
Did you bring the item?

104
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,480
Of course.

105
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,480
I am very sincere.

106
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,639
Where is what I want?

107
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,839
You're not trying to get something for nothing, are you?

108
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,519
Huo Ming.

109
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,680
You can't go.

110
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,759
Why cover for him?

111
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,120
It seems what you traded...

112
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,759
...was Professor Yang's memories.

113
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,279
You covered for Mind-Bender several times...

114
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
...for this reason too, right?

115
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,480
Yes.

116
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,480
But I...

117
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,399
No need to explain.

118
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,000
In my eyes...

119
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,600
...lies are written all over your face.

120
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,080
I'm taking the USB drive.

121
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,720
Lin Yun went to great lengths...

122
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,320
...to get Professor Yang's memories.

123
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,919
Inside, there must be hidden...

124
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,320
...information on the next researcher.

125
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,799
Shen Meng.

126
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,840
It's Dr. Shen Meng.

127
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,840
I saw her at the research institute.

128
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,480
It seems...

129
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,440
...she is also one of the seven researchers.

130
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,039
What was she in charge of?

131
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,960
I'm not exactly sure.

132
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,879
But according to her resume...

133
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,399
...she's likely responsible for dismantling The Firmament.

134
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,720
If Shen Meng is the one dismantling The Firmament...

135
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,320
...then finding her...

136
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,120
...means we can find The Firmament.

137
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,200
This is Shen Meng's photo.

138
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,639
What I'm worried about is...

139
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,120
...since we found out...

140
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,919
...Mind-Bender definitely knows too.

141
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,399
Shen Meng is in danger.

142
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,120
I must find her before Mind-Bender does.

143
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,120
Dr. Shen Meng is a prodigy.

144
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,840
She's the youngest of all the researchers.

145
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,320
Exceptionally intelligent.

146
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,279
Good at hiding.

147
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,120
Ordinary methods...

148
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,919
...won't be able to find her.

149
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,039
If we can get the Bai family involved...

150
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,639
...maybe we can find her.

151
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,600
The Bai family is very powerful.

152
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,559
They have many eyes and ears.

153
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,960
They have informants in every building of every complex.

154
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,320
You coming here today...

155
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,279
...probably isn't just to...

156
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,840
...help me tidy up the office, right?

157
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,159
President Bai.

158
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,039
Of course not.

159
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:08,679
I...

160
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,080
...should thank you for helping us before.

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,720
No need for thanks.

162
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,480
And don't call me President Bai.

163
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,559
Just call me Xiaohui.

164
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:17,639
Xiao...

165
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,960
To be honest...

166
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,200
...you coming here today...

167
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,120
...is it because you missed me?

168
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,840
No, President Bai.

169
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:30,159
I told you to call me Xiaohui.

170
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:32,039
Calling me President Bai is so distant.

171
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,440
Then...

172
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,080
Xiao... Xiaohui.

173
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,679
I need you to help me find someone.

174
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,360
Find someone, huh?

175
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:45,879
Then beg me.

176
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,679
Beg you?

177
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:47,960
How should I beg you?

178
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,360
Depends on your performance.

179
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,000
I really want to find someone.

180
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,919
Don't be like this.

181
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,879
Who is it?

182
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,320
Is it your...

183
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,279
Don't be like this, Xiaohui.

184
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,639
Listen to me first.

185
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,039
It's her.

186
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,639
The unforgettable first love?

187
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,360
The one that got away?

188
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,240
That's fine then.

189
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,679
Send this to me.

190
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,679
I'll go back and have the butler check immediately.

191
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,440
Ming.

192
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,120
The person you're looking for is a cleaner at a hotel.

193
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,519
Dr. Shen.

194
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,840
Nice disguise.

195
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,799
Young man,

196
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,279
what are you talking about?

197
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,639
Dr. Shen.

198
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,039
Three years ago, the institute was invaded.

199
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,759
You and six other researchers...

200
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:00,960
What is this?

201
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,480
Don't rub it.

202
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,720
It's a calcified synthetic nano-powder.

203
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:09,759
Once contact is made,

204
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,399
it will rapidly spread across the entire eyeball.

205
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,120
I know who you are.

206
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,799
Mind-Bender.

207
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,480
Dr. Shen.

208
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,039
Do I look like Mind-Bender to you?

209
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,440
You might be able to fool others,

210
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,759
but you think you can fool me?

211
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,559
Don't bother trying.

212
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,480
No human can escape it.

213
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,600
That's right.

214
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,720
No human can escape it.

215
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,440
But my eyes

216
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:35,720
are not human eyes.

217
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:37,519
Dr. Shen.

218
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:38,639
My name is Huo Ming.

219
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,840
My father was your mentor, Huo Haiyang.

220
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,320
Impossible.

221
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,440
Professor Huo's son died long ago.

222
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,759
When the institute was invaded,

223
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,879
I was only injured.

224
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,360
My father replaced my eyes

225
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,679
with the AI Eye.

226
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,480
So,

227
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,039
the AI Eye

228
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,360
really can merge perfectly with human nerves.

229
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,320
Dr. Shen.

230
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,519
Two birds with one stone.

231
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,120
This trip was worth it.
