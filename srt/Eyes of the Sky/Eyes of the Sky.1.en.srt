00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,079
Deliver on time, rain or shine

3
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,599
If you arrive late

4
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,680
Two minutes left

5
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,079
No time left

6
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,159
No time left

7
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:13,719
The operation is starting now

8
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,000
Clear the area immediately

9
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,319
Copy that

10
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:20,959
Are you blind?

11
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,480
You can't go in now. Get lost

12
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,480
I... My name is Huo Ming

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,560
Employee ID 9527

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,719
I... I have a delivery to make

15
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,319
Alright, alright

16
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,400
Sir, I can't be late

17
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,719
If I'm late, the customer will yell at me

18
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,719
Is there something wrong with your brain?

19
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,799
Can't you understand human speech? Beat it

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,159
Please, let me go in

21
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:36,920
Begging God won't help

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
There's no time, Sir

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,959
No time? None of my damn business

24
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:39,879
I'm begging you

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,200
You low-life idiot

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,959
Keep talking crap

27
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,480
And I'll crush you with a wave of my finger

28
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,400
Delivery time is about to expire

29
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,359
I can't be late!

30
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,879
Sir

31
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,480
Can I kneel and beg you?

32
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,239
Let me in

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,599
Kneeling won't help either

34
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,120
You're trash even if you kneel

35
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,120
Let me in, please

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,199
The operation is starting now

37
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,840
Why is there still someone here?

38
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,919
What are you good for?

39
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,680
There's no time

40
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,680
Ruining my plans? You never stop

41
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,520
Get out, get out!

42
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,879
Beat him up

43
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,120
Please, Sir!

44
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,639
Let me in!

45
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,120
I beg you!

46
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,639
Deliberately ruining my plans

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,159
How does that feel?

48
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,199
AI Eye

Activating intelligent system

51
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:52,919
Hello, Master

52
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,280
Welcome to your intelligent space

53
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,479
I am your AI system, Xiao Cang

54
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,879
I have been waiting for you for three years

55
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,919
I... I'm sorry

56
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm in the wrong place, I...

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,919
Master, calm down

58
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,960
Listen to me

59
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,560
You are not a delivery man

60
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,280
You have your own mission

61
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,240
I will help you

62
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,080
Trust me

63
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,360
What happened just now?

64
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,719
Get up

65
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:16,879
You big fool

66
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,919
Faking it, huh?

67
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,759
It's going to be late

68
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,919
Still worrying about being late?

69
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:22,960
Screw you

70
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,360
How dare you bully my Master

71
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,240
Slow-Motion Mode activated

72
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,919
What... what is going on?

73
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,159
Master

74
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,639
This is the AI system's Slow-Motion Mode

75
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,120
You can think of it as a superpower

76
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,159
Let's complete your mission together

77
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,240
I look forward to starting a new life for you

78
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,719
I want to start a new life

79
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,919
Master

80
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,199
They are bullying you too much

81
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,479
We must let them know

82
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,719
That they cannot bully the weak

83
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,080
Teach them a lesson

84
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,399
Master, you look so handsome.

85
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,199
I...

86
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,399
Can I go in now?

87
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,079
Thank you.

88
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,279
Security guards should keep the line orderly.

89
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,399
Xiao Cang, you are amazing.

90
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,879
Those people were like slow motion.

91
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,240
Yes, Master.

92
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,759
I am your super AI system, after all.

93
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,079
Then why are you inside me?

94
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,319
Because you lost part of your memory.

95
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,240
What memory?

96
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,759
Three years ago, the institute was attacked.

97
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,560
You didn't make it in time to save your father.

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,959
You forcibly activated the AI system.

99
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,199
Causing a system overload.

100
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,000
Damaging your nerves and brain.

101
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,240
And you turned into a fool.

102
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,160
I remember now.

103
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,759
Son, the most important research data...

104
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,079
I secretly transferred it all to Professor Yang.

105
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,680
You must find her.

106
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,160
And make all this public.

107
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,720
Dad.

108
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,600
I will definitely find her.

109
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,079
Why did you come out of this elevator?

110
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,759
Follow us, don't run off.

111
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,439
There's something wrong with these three.

112
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,720
Let's follow them and see.

113
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,360
President Du.

114
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,920
We have arrived at the archives room door.

115
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,879
But we need Lin Yun's iris recognition.

116
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,279
Lin Yun.

117
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,040
President Lin, what is the meaning of this?

118
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,160
You won't even shake my hand?

119
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,199
Master, analysis shows...

120
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,600
Professor Yang's information...

121
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,800
Is on Yunzhi Technology's smart server.

122
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,600
The archives room was just breached.

123
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,720
Watch out.

124
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,079
President Du, good trick.

125
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,399
Pretending to discuss cooperation...

126
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,399
When actually it was to steal my iris data...

127
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,600
To break into the archives room.

128
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,519
Lin Yun.

129
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,600
You can sell the company to me.

130
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,040
I only want Professor Yang's data.

131
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,560
Don't even think about getting the data.

132
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,639
I advise President Du to give up on that idea.

133
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,360
We have entered the archives room.

134
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,639
We'll have all their company data soon.

135
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,800
My people are transferring your server's data.

136
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,199
I'll have Professor Yang's information very soon.

137
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,600
President Lin, look.

138
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,160
Your people...

139
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Are these the three?

140
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,519
It seems it's unfortunate this time.

141
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,800
Let's cooperate next time.

142
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,439
President Du, aren't you going to drink your coffee?

143
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,879
Who exactly helped us?

144
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,079
Hello.

145
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,000
Your coffee has arrived.

146
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,600
Give it to me.

147
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:56,959
Okay.

148
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,199
Hello.

149
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:13,720
Delivery.

150
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,120
Master.

151
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,160
A strange code just flashed by.

152
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,600
Unable to analyze for now.

153
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,439
President Lin.

154
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,279
Professor Yang has been exposed.

155
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,319
Should we move...

156
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,439
Professor Yang?

157
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,519
Master.

158
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,199
Super Zoom Mode activated.

159
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,360
Move immediately.

160
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,080
Xiao Cang.

161
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,600
Help me plan the optimal route.

162
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,200
Planning route.

163
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,039
Arrived at Professor Yang's home.

164
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,639
The door is wide open.

165
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,559
There are signs of a struggle.

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,919
Master, be careful.

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,559
Professor Yang.

168
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,360
Professor Yang.

169
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,799
Professor Yang.

170
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,519
Super Macro activated.

171
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,000
Detecting pupil changes.

172
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:27,799
Vital signs are normal.

173
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,799
But unable to wake up.

174
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,960
Biologically known as a vegetative state.

175
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,279
Master.

176
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,200
Scanned a camera on the table.

177
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,360
Should be able to recover data from a few minutes ago.

178
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,360
President Lin, this is the place.

179
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:04,879
Xiao Cang

180
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,559
Restore the previous data

181
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,679
Three clips restored

182
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:09,639
Please take a look, Master

183
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,720
Professor Yang had his memory extracted

184
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:13,960
Had his memory extracted

185
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,879
It seems...

186
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,840
Mind-Bender did it again

187
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,320
People who have had their memories extracted...

188
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,559
...all end up in a vegetative state

189
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,919
This is already the fourth researcher

190
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,519
There were seven researchers back then

191
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:25,799
It seems...

192
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,360
...we don't have much time left to find The Firmament

193
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,519
