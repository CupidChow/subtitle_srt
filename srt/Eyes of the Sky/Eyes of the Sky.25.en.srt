1
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,479
Although it's not our first meeting

2
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,399
I can still introduce myself

3
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,119
I am a friend of your father's

4
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,600
Li Shan

5
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,159
It seems

6
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,040
the mastermind behind all this

7
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,280
is you

8
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,959
What are you saying, Huo Ming?

9
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,480
How could I be a bad person?

10
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,799
I am a researcher

11
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,000
I am your dad's good friend

12
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,519
A good colleague

13
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,640
Professor Ning

14
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:21,719
Oh no

15
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,799
Professor Li

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,280
Actually

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,799
I suspected you long ago

18
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,439
Since when?

19
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,519
If Chu Chen wasn't the mastermind

20
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,840
then everyone who became a vegetable

21
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,799
could be controlled from behind the scenes

22
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,920
An illusion created by the Brain-Burning Maniac

23
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,239
You used your technology

24
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,719
to control the Brain-Burning Maniac

25
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,280
to search for Cang Qiong

26
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,040
and plotted against those researchers

27
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,719
And Fu Xue by your side

28
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,319
her real name is Li Xue

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,359
Immediately

30
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,480
I thought of you

31
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,680
Mr. Li Shan

32
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:59,239
Worthy of being Huo Haiyang's son

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,239
You installed a remote control system in advance

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,239
and staged a sob story

35
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,799
removing the AI Eye

36
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,120
to lower our guard

37
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,280
Everything linked together

38
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,680
Meticulous thinking

39
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,039
As your dad's old friend

40
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,240
I feel gratified for him

41
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,719
Old friend

42
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,520
You're not worthy

43
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,800
I'm not worthy?

44
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,479
Saying that makes me so sad

45
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,800
It was you

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,680
who killed my father

47
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,280
and Uncle Lin

48
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,120
How could I do something illegal like murder?

49
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,280
I am a scientist

50
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
Don't talk nonsense

51
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,000
I can sue you

52
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,199
for slander

53
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,520
I will definitely find you

54
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,159
and send you to prison myself

55
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,520
I know

56
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,719
You're stalling for time

57
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,520
trying to find my location

58
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,919
I just wanted to thank you

59
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,800
for helping me get Cang Qiong

60
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,039
and the AI Eye

61
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,879
that's why I chatted with you

62
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,800
You don't really think

63
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,680
the AI can actually send my location

64
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,879
out, do you?

65
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,960
No matter how strong, it's just a tool

66
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,159
The AI Eye

67
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,080
is mine now

68
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,759
I just received countless locations

69
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,919
but I can't judge which is real

70
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,919
Are you okay?

71
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,159
Just one last step

72
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,199
and he still escaped

73
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,000
Your delivery has arrived

74
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,199
Enjoy your meal

75
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,759
Wait a minute

76
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,599
Come here, come here

77
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,520
Come, come over here

78
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,680
What is this?

79
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,840
I ordered a rice bowl

80
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,199
This is a burger

81
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,039
Are you blind?

82
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,439
If you're blind, don't deliver food

83
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,719
Delaying my meal

84
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,400
I'm sorry

85
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
I might have taken the wrong one

86
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,360
I'll change it for you right away

87
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,240
Please don't give me a bad review

88
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,360
What's with your attitude?

89
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,519
Sir, how about this?

90
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,079
I'll give this to you for free

91
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,399
Such bad luck meeting you

92
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,040
Get lost, get lost

93
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,480
I'll give you a bad review later

94
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,560
Huo Ming

95
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,319
The mastermind has been found

96
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,079
You shouldn't be like this

97
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,240
You need to pull yourself together

98
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,920
But I have nothing now

99
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
I am a waste

100
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,399
You still have me

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,800
The AI titan who vanished three years ago,

102
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,759
Professor Li Shan,

103
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,759
returns today with a major achievement.

104
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,519
The tragic truth buried for three years

105
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,639
will finally nail that

106
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,879
sanctimonious hypocrite

107
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,040
to the pillar of shame.

108
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,879
That's right, it's Huo Haiyang.

109
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,920
The famous Professor Huo Haiyang

110
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,600
was actually a parasite in a scientist's coat.

111
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,079
Three years ago,

112
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,079
a group of top domestic researchers

113
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,600
jointly developed a powerful AI technology,

114
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,839
Cang Qiong.

115
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,279
This core technology is worth trillions

116
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,240
and could let our tech lead the world.

117
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:03,279
But Huo Haiyang plotted to sell Cang Qiong technology

118
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,560
to foreign forces for a huge sum.

119
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,920
Professor Li,

120
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,920
what is your view on this matter?

121
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,079
Colluding with foreign forces

122
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,600
and taking billions in kickbacks...

123
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,879
This is not a rumor.

124
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,120
I have solid evidence

125
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,600
proving it was Huo Haiyang's doing.

126
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,120
We risked our lives to hide the backup data,

127
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,120
but were gravely injured by Huo Haiyang and foreign forces,

128
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,879
which also led to the destruction of the institute.

129
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,839
Huo Haiyang brought about his own doom.

130
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,480
He lost his own life as well.

131
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,160
Scum like Huo Haiyang can die,

132
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,920
but Cang Qiong cannot.

133
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,120
I hid for three years, barely alive,

134
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,600
piecing back the fragments he destroyed, bit by bit,

135
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,560
just to show everyone

136
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,839
that the true backbone of technology won't break.

137
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,839
I will open Cang Qiong to the tech world

138
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,279
and continue to use Cang Qiong to benefit society.

139
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,439
Recently, Professor Li Shan's return

140
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,600
has caused a huge sensation in society.

141
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,720
What exactly is the truth of the past?

142
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,519
Professor Huo Haiyang...

143
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,720
Behind a leading figure in technology,

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,120
what secrets are actually hidden?

145
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
This jerk.

146
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,399
He did all those bad things himself,

147
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,879
yet framed my father for everything.

148
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,879
We were still looking for him,

149
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,079
and he just appeared openly.

150
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,879
That's not even the scariest part.

151
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,240
I searched online

152
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,120
for all his information.

153
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,560
He used Cang Qiong's technology

154
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,920
to tamper with it all.

155
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,519
There's no trace left to check.

156
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,959
We are at a disadvantage now.

157
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,160
President Lin,

158
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,519
don't be nervous.

159
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,199
I'm calling

160
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,839
just to send you an invitation.

161
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,040
What invitation?

162
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,000
Tomorrow morning at eight,

163
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,480
there will be a grand tech livestream event.

164
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,519
We will be inviting

165
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,040
the seven top researchers from back then.

166
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:52,800
You've got to be kidding.

167
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,639
Of the seven, besides you, Lin Yun, and Shen Meng,

168
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,879
everyone else was turned into vegetables by you.

169
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,000
Little Huo,

170
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,879
you shouldn't speak so carelessly.

171
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,720
They are clearly all doing fine.

172
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,560
You don't believe me?

173
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,839
Turn on the TV

174
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,399
and watch the news channel.

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,759
Three years ago,

176
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,360
the four researchers whose memories were extracted

177
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,160
with the help of Professor Li Shan,

178
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,879
have successively recovered their memories

179
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,240
and expressed their gratitude to Professor Li Shan.

180
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,120
It is reported that tomorrow at 8 a.m.,

181
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,120
Professor Li and the six top researchers

182
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,959
will gather together

183
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,079
to reveal the truth of what happened back then.

184
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,639
Well?

185
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,159
Do you believe it now?

186
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,200
President Lin,

187
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
tomorrow morning at eight,

188
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,200
you simply must come.

189
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,399
Don't worry.

190
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,600
I will definitely be there tomorrow.

191
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,799
Huo Ming,

192
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,279
this is obviously a trap.

193
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,879
It's just to completely frame Uncle Huo.

194
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,559
Why did you agree to him so quickly?

195
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,879
I know.

196
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,759
But if I don't step into the trap,

197
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,960
how can I break it?

198
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,279
You have a plan?

199
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,080
Our final researcher,

200
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,639
President Lin Yun of Yunzhi Tech,

201
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,600
has also arrived at the scene.

202
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,600
Let's welcome her.

203
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,120
It's President Lin.

204
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,799
Everyone is here.

205
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,679
What's going on?

206
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,360
Li Shan must have used Cang Qiong technology

207
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,519
to restore them.

208
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,399
First of all,

209
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,679
I want to thank everyone for coming.

210
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,519
Actually, you may not know,

211
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,919
for the sake of secrecy,

212
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,440
the seven of us back then,

213
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,200
during our research,

214
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:50,120
didn't even know who else was involved.

215
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,320
We only slowly confirmed it after the incident.

216
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,000
Now,

217
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,679
we are finally all together.

218
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,120
I also want to ask you all,

219
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,519
do you have anything you want to say?

220
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,080
Professor Yang.

221
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,240
Professor Li.

222
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,320
First, on behalf of the four of us,

223
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,799
I want to express our gratitude to you.

224
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,080
Except for Dr. Shen Meng,

225
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,840
the four of us

226
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,039
had our memories extracted by that madman

227
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
and became vegetative.

228
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,039
Thanks to you,

229
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,399
we were able to wake up.

230
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,519
Thank you so much.

231
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,919
You are too kind.

232
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,120
Cang Qiong

233
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,240
was jointly developed by us, after all.

234
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:34,399
If Huo Haiyang hadn't interfered,

235
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,440
how would we have ended up

236
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,960
in this state today?

237
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,000
So he was the one who harmed us.

238
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,519
Yes.

239
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,320
How could this happen?

240
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,440
I never expected this.

241
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,279
I didn't think Huo Haiyang was that kind of person.

242
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,159
Professor Li,

243
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,200
before there is solid evidence,

244
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,480
you shouldn't arbitrarily say

245
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,679
that Professor Huo did it.

246
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,480
Isn't the current evidence obvious enough?

247
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,320
Who else but Huo Haiyang

248
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,279
could do such a thing?

249
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,320
Don't forget,

250
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,879
even you almost had your memory extracted.

251
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,759
We are all victims here.

252
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,320
Yes, we are all victims.

253
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,240
Yes, yes.

254
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,200
We are victims.

255
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
We are victims.

256
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,000
Lin Yun,

257
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,320
if it wasn't Huo Haiyang,

258
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,519
then the most suspicious person

259
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,879
would be your father, Lin Beishan.

260
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,360
Are you implying you suspect your father?

261
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,879
President Lin,

262
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,720
did your father

263
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,399
also participate in persecuting the researchers?

264
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,720
As for who the real mastermind is,

265
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,120
he knows it in his heart.

266
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,360
But I

267
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,399
only believe in evidence.

268
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,559
Evidence?

269
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,559
Of course I have it.

270
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:57,639
Quick!

271
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,600
Take a picture!

272
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,039
Snap it, quick!

273
00:11:59,039 --> 00:11:59,679
Snap, snap, snap!

274
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,799
Yeah.

275
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,559
Exactly.

276
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,559
So much...

277
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,360
Everyone,

278
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,519
Huo Haiyang received 10 billion dollars from them.

279
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,480
Are you surprised?

280
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,399
However,

281
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,720
this is just what was sent to Huo Haiyang from overseas,

282
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,600
a ten percent deposit.

283
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,840
It was to buy Cang Qiong.

284
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,039
The total amount was 100 billion dollars.

285
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,679
If I hadn't risked my life to stop it back then,

286
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,159
Cang Qiong would already be foreign technology.

287
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,440
A hundred billion dollars...

288
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,039
The valuation is over a trillion dollars.

289
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,759
That is outrageous.

290
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:37,679
Undoubtedly,

291
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,480
Huo Haiyang is the real culprit behind this.
