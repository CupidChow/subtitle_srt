00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,640
Dr. Shen

2
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,399
Dr. Shen

3
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:02,359
Here

4
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,120
I just hit my head and passed out

5
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:10,239
Why does my whole body hurt?

6
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,920
Dr. Shen, just stay here and rest easy

7
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,400
I'll have someone take care of your daily needs

8
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,560
No one will be able to find you

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,359
Once we catch Mind-Bender

10
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,439
you'll be safe

11
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,439
Thank you

12
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,319
Professor Huo and Professor Lin were my mentors

13
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,280
I also want to find out... three years ago...

14
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,840
who exactly killed them

15
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:27,599
Dr. Shen

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,560
Do you know who dismantled The Firmament back then?

17
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,280
I don't know who dismantled it

18
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,959
But I know where The Firmament was hidden

19
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:36,840
Where?

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,159
To hide a grain of sand

21
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,159
you must place it in the desert

22
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,480
To hide a drop of water

23
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,000
you must place it in the ocean

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
To hide data

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,920
you must place it in a flood of data

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,120
Some things seem far away but are right before your eyes

27
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:51,560
Could it be...

28
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,200
The Firmament is hidden in Cloud Intelligence Tech's servers?

29
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,599
That's right

30
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,640
It's hidden right in the servers

31
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,640
Then how do we find it?

32
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,400
I'm not exactly sure how to find it

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,159
But I can give you a signature

34
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,560
The needle-in-a-haystack work

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,759
will be up to you

36
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,280
I checked all the hard drives

37
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,599
I can't find it at all

38
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,680
Is Dr. Shen lying to us?

39
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,520
Or did she remember wrong?

40
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,759
Master, battery low

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,319
Let's fully charge before working

42
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,080
What's wrong with you?

43
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,159
Huo Ming, you need to charge

44
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,719
You... you guys...

45
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,599
What are you two doing?

46
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,439
Xiao Hui

47
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,240
I'm telling you, we were charging

48
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,240
Do you believe that?

49
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,960
Charging?

50
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:08,800
Charging

51
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,159
Then can I charge too?

52
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,000
Wait a minute

53
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,960
You call President Bai "Xiao Hui"?

54
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,839
Yeah, my Dad calls me Xiao Hui

55
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,800
And he can call me Xiao Hui too

56
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,639
Right, mainly because her Dad calls her Xiao Hui

57
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,720
So calling her Xiao Hui is just a form of address

58
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,639
Xiao Cang

59
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,560
Hurry and accept a takeout order for me

60
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,879
Received, Master

61
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,600
Order incoming, order incoming

62
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,240
I have to go deliver it, quick

63
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:37,480
Stop

64
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,959
I'll go with you

65
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,680
That's not a good idea

66
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,639
Where's my takeout?

67
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,199
It's overdue, you know?

68
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,160
Sorry, customer

69
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,079
Traffic jam, arriving soon

70
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,800
Traffic on an e-bike?

71
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,839
Who are you kidding?

72
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,480
Don't give me that crap

73
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,600
If you don't come soon, I'll give you a bad review

74
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,399
Traffic on an e-bike...

75
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,680
Who is that idiot trying to fool?

76
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:23,839
I'll help you deliver. I'll help you deliver.

77
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,360
Is it Mr. Li?

78
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,160
I'll help you deliver.

79
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,519
Excuse me, your delivery.

80
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,600
Sorry to keep you waiting.

81
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,759
So sorry.

82
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,399
There really was a traffic jam just now.

83
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,040
Hope you won't give him a bad review.

84
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,399
There's one more order.

85
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,759
Bai Wansan.

86
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:40,879
That name is so imposing.

87
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,639
That's my dad. I ordered the takeout.

88
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,759
Let's go, deliver to my dad.

89
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,000
President Bai.

90
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,319
I have a meeting in a bit.

91
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,279
We're not going the same way.

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,800
Not the same way.

93
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:51,839
I have a car too.

94
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,639
Butler.

95
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,480
Let's go. We're going home to deliver.

96
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,399
I... I'm about to be late, Lin Yun.

97
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:02,560
Let's go.

98
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:02,839
Huo Ming.

99
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,399
It's late. Hurry up.

100
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:03,600
You...

101
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
I'm going to be late.

102
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,360
Lin Yun, listen to me.

103
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,399
If it's late, I'll give you a bad review.

104
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,120
You're something else.

105
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,920
Are delivery guys this well-equipped now?

106
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,360
Are you guys still hiring?

107
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,160
I can do it.

108
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,040
I can too.

109
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm up for it.

110
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,240
I'll do it for free.

111
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,000
I can go.

112
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,519
Huo Ming, it's your first time meeting my dad.

113
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,639
Just relax and it'll be fine.

114
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,800
Dad, watch me.

115
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,000
Dad!

116
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,399
Dad!

117
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,720
What happened to my dad?

118
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,319
Why isn't he being taken to the hospital?

119
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,680
The old master is in this state because the pacemaker

120
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,480
malfunctioned,

121
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,399
causing the coma.

122
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,879
He cannot be moved right now.

123
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,399
How could it malfunction?

124
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,319
My dad uses the best smart pacemaker.

125
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,079
This has never happened before.

126
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,360
But this time we switched to a new model.

127
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,839
It uses a chip from Cloud Intelligence Tech.

128
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,079
I suspect the chip is the problem.

129
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:05,720
Impossible.

130
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,160
Cloud Intelligence Tech's chips

131
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,639
haven't been applied to medical devices yet.

132
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,240
It is indeed a Cloud Intelligence Tech chip.

133
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,600
It hasn't undergone enough clinical verification,

134
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,000
yet they dared to use it in a medical device.

135
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,759
This Cloud Intelligence Tech

136
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,079
doesn't care about human life at all.

137
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,759
Xiao Cang, did you find anything?

138
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,759
Scan complete.

139
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:28,759
Master, the chip is indeed from Cloud Intelligence Tech.

140
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,160
But it has been tampered with.

141
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,519
Bai Xinhui's old man has heart disease.

142
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,319
He recently switched to an AI-powered

143
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,600
pacemaker.

144
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,360
He was using another company's,

145
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,680
but I asked a friend for help

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,879
to switch to a chip from Lin Yun's company.

147
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,759
But her dad is alive and kicking right now.

148
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,079
Isn't that just free advertising for Cloud Intelligence Tech?

149
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,639
But if the major shareholder's dad

150
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,279
used a chip from his own company

151
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,759
and died suddenly from an accident instead,

152
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,759
tell me,

153
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,959
who would dare use Cloud Intelligence Tech's chips?

154
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,000
To save him, a precise surgery is required

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,439
to restart the pacemaker.

156
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,879
Why not operate immediately?

157
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,120
Operate?

158
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,759
How can I operate without medical equipment?

159
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,199
You are the family doctor.

160
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,680
You need to think of something, fast!

161
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
The equipment will arrive in half an hour.

162
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,920
But looking at the old master's current state,

163
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,720
I estimate he can only last a few minutes.

164
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,600
Dad!

165
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,519
Wake up, Dad!

166
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,079
How is Old Master Bai doing?

167
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:23,920
It's critical.

168
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,839
His heart has stopped; he could die at any moment.

169
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,000
If surgery isn't possible,

170
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,560
the pacemaker must be repaired.

171
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,639
Assessing repair success rate.

172
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,960
In this state, the success rate for anyone else is zero.

173
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,639
Even with my assistance,

174
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,120
the repair success rate

175
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,919
is only 32.7%.

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,919
If we don't do it,

177
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,279
the mortality rate is 100%.

178
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,159
A one-in-three success rate.

179
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,240
It's worth a shot.

180
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:51,639
You assist me.

181
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,320
I'll give it a try.

182
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,360
Wait a minute.

183
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,440
Whatever you're planning to do on your own,

184
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,639
sign the liability waiver.

185
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:04,200
If anything happens, it has nothing to do with me.

186
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,399
Master,

187
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,159
this Dr. Zhao is acting strange.

188
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,559
I suspect this is another trap set for you.

189
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,159
Saving him is the priority.

190
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,279
Xiao Hui,

191
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,240
even if a top expert were here,

192
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,600
they couldn't possibly do it.

193
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,840
Especially since he's a nobody.

194
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,919
Let him try.

195
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:54,360
Young Mistress, he's just a delivery guy.

196
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,480
In this situation,

197
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,360
people worldwide who can restart a pacemaker

198
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
number no more than three.

199
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,639
How can you entrust President Bai's life

200
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,679
to a piece of trash?

201
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,799
I said let him try!

202
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,120
Do you have a solution?

203
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:06,600
Xiao Cang.

204
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,600
Activate X-ray Vision Mode and Microscope mode.

205
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,919
Yes, Master.

206
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,039
Activated.

207
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,279
Initiate Super Stability Assist.

208
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,799
Stabilizing hand nerves.

209
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,399
Remotely disable the pacemaker.

210
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,000
Understood.

211
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,320
Great.

212
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,919
There was a glimmer of hope.

213
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,000
Now he's beyond saving.

214
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,200
You're the murderer who killed President Bai.

215
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,440
Didn't you say you could save my dad?

216
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,799
Dad!

217
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,399
Dad!

218
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:56,879
Go.

219
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,679
Contact the media and release the news.

220
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,120
Say Cloud Intelligence Tech's chip and a shareholder

221
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,919
conspired to kill Old Master Bai.
