00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,200
Hello, Amy.

2
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,880
Anran, we’re here.

3
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,240
We’re heading to the studio.

4
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,759
I'm done with the materials.

5
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,560
Do you have the key?

6
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,440
What key?

7
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,520
The studio.

8
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,840
I'm still here.

9
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,600
It's still here.

10
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,640
Come here.

11
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,880
Lin Hao.

12
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,039
Get up.

13
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:57,920
They're coming to work.

14
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,920
The fever is gone.

15
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,720
Great.

16
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,240
You started talking nonsense yesterday.

17
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,360
You...

18
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,199
Find...

19
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,520
What are you looking for?

20
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
You, come in.

21
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,000
Anran, where are you going with the cart?

22
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,200
I was packing some unnecessary garbage yesterday.

23
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll take care of it.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,600
Did you stay here all night?

25
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,160
The typhoon was too strong yesterday.

26
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,079
I slept on the sofa.

27
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,600
I've read the materials. No problem.

28
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Let's move on to the next step.

29
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,400
Okay.

30
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,360
I'm leaving.

31
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,000
Count to 50 before you come out.

32
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,000
Why are you acting like you're having an affair?

33
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,200
But it feels good

34
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,360
is good.

35
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,680
Besides passion and romance,

36
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,960
we added extreme.

37
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,400
Because Louis

38
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,800
of taste and lifestyle,

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,920
That’s why A&H

40
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,160
from all the dessert brands.

41
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,079
This also matches the characteristics

42
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:53,880
of Heart Q.

43
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,120
But...

44
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,200
Who did you learn it from?

45
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,000
You're hesitating.

46
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,640
Please look at the screen.

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,800
In the name of French dessert,

48
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,360
in the name of French dessert.

49
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,440
But these fancy snacks

50
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,680
are not

51
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,160
our Asian eating habits.

52
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,840
are marketing methods.

53
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,160
Sour taste.

54
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,920
Maybe it's the carefully formula of the merchants.

55
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,880
Maybe

56
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,279
the taste of imported ingredients.

57
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,160
Recently,

58
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,400
monitoring the public opinion of A&H.

59
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,280
It’s a good start.

60
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,720
Many Internet celebrities and bloggers

61
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,440
come and post posts.

62
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,000
But it's getting hotter recently.

63
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,280
The line is getting longer.

64
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,200
Until yesterday,

65
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,360
there was a key opinion leader

66
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,600
sent a bad review.

67
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,560
It exploded everyone’s mood.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,720
Has anyone been to A&H recently?

69
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
After work yesterday,

70
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,440
I went to buy Napoleon with my friends.

71
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,720
for about two hours.

72
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,200
Me too.

73
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
Many people lined up for a long time.

74
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,840
but came back empty-handed.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,840
I'm really dissatisfied.

76
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,560
Is it risky to fail?

77
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,000
There's still some time before we release the manuscript.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Everything is possible.

79
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,840
It's okay if it's a limited sale.

80
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,920
Once they find out it's hungry marketing,

81
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,800
I'm afraid our articles will get worse.

82
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,280
Should we stop for a while?

83
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,440
Stop.

84
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,440
How?

85
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,800
The world is ever-changing.

86
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,640
Should we stop the whole world?

87
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,280
The public opinion is the most despicable thing.

88
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,200
but also the most unreliable.

89
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,920
Focus on the media.

90
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,280
Get the keyword that the public hates.

91
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,560
to avoid lightning in advance.

92
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,920
Continue with your work as usual.

93
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,280
Dismissed.

94
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,200
Amy, stay here.

95
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,640
Choose one from the other brands.

96
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,200
In the name of preparing for the second episode,

97
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,159
in the name of the second draft.

98
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,600
Anran,

99
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,040
You want to change A&H?

100
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,880
There must be a backup plan for "Heart Q".

101
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,880
I never risk my life.

102
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,200
Let the driver wait for me downstairs.

103
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,600
I’ll go to A&H myself.

104
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:55,760
Okay.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,600
Hey.

106
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,720
You came here every Wednesday

107
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,480
every Wednesday noon.

108
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,080
Are you busy these days?

109
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,760
You pigeon me three times in a row.

110
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,600
My number is very expensive.

111
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,480
I have to thank Dr Ding for coming back to life.

112
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,600
Don't forget what you promised me.

113
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,880
Saturday.

114
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,880
See you on Saturday.

115
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,000
See you on Saturday.

116
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,760
Hello, Mom.

117
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,000
A blind date?

118
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,159
Can you send me

119
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,040
Can you send me more?

120
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,960
Don't even think about it.

121
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,720
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,720
I don't even want to drink such expensive Lanm wine.

123
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,880
You said no.

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,760
It won't happen again.

125
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,600
Don't even think about it.

126
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,040
Look at the customers lining up outside.

127
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,280
don't they deserve the best ingredients?

128
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,000
Most customers only look forward to Lanm Wine Cake.

129
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,159
As for the wine in the cake,

130
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,720
is a 20-year-old wine

131
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,200
or an old-fashioned wine?

132
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,600
Even sweet ginseng juice with steam water.

133
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,880
They won't care.

134
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
I care.

135
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,600
Use the healthiest and most suitable ingredients

136
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,600
to make customers taste the best.

137
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,040
This is not a high requirement.

138
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,600
On the contrary,

139
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,160
this is the basic bottom line.

140
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,440
All right.

141
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,320
I can't argue with you.

142
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,440
Anyway, let me remind you.

143
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,160
you can always be original.

144
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,880
but not your investor.

145
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,720
As the founder of the brand,

146
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,880
you must consider the cost

147
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,600
you must consider the cost.

148
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,280
I'm really worried

149
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,440
I'm really worried.

150
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,480
You two

151
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,159
have different opinions.

152
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,600
Why are you here?

153
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
I'm here to see what else needs to be adjusted.

154
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,440
Are there so many people in the restaurant?

155
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,720
It's sold out again today.

156
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,600
Didn't you consider to prepare more?

157
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,320
We don't have enough raw materials.

158
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,280
Only by ensure limited supply

159
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,000
can make every dessert perfect.

160
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,120
But it means limited edition.

161
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,160
it means many people can't buy it.

162
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,120
What about those who can't buy in line?

163
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,320
You saw the bad review.

164
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,600
To ensure the best raw materials,

165
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,280
to ensure the best ingredients.

166
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,000
Is this the reason you made desserts?

167
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,280
Why don't we change seats?

168
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,520
You'll lose.

169
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,600
Let's start!

170
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,280
I listened to you just now.

171
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,280
That's why I won.

172
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,000
Here.

173
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,280
Thank you.

174
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:13,880
It's pretty.

175
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,840
Right?

176
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,680
Are you under a lot of pressure recently?

177
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,480
Not bad.

178
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,840
Don't lie.

179
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,840
If it weren't for work,

180
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,800
I need exercise to relieve stress.

181
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,800
I'm sure you'll find a reason to not come again.

182
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,000
It's weird.

183
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,920
You should go to the psychology department.

184
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,080
Will you doubt yourself

185
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,520
when treating patients?

186
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,720
Of course.

187
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,680
no one can guarantee that they are always right.

188
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,160
There's something wrong with

189
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,280
with my new magazine.

190
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,600
I don't know if I should keep going

191
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,960
or the backup plan.

192
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,080
The new issue is important to me.

193
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,720
Nothing can go wrong.

194
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,280
You know?

195
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,960
The biggest thing that basketball taught me is

196
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
When the ball comes,

197
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,040
You just have to catch it before you go back.

198
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,600
As for the ending,

199
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
will come sooner or later.

200
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,280
Why are you so eager to predict it?

201
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,520
If you knew you'd lose,

202
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,400
you should do something before that.

203
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,400
The ending is like Seol Jung-ho's cat.

204
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,520
Before the end,

205
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,520
winning or losing will always coexist.

206
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,960
Before opening the box,

207
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,480
if you stick to your original intention,

208
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,480
we might be able to fight back.

209
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,520
But if you admit that it's a failure,

210
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,080
and start looking for a replacement plan,

211
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,400
you'll only lose.

212
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,440
You've been a Buddhist for so many years.

213
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,840
Don't you want anything?

214
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,400
Yes.

215
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,960
But I believe

216
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,800
I just need to do what I can.

217
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:49,960
Then...

218
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,760
what I want will come sooner or later.

219
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,480
Hello.

220
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,960
Excuse me,

221
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,440
where did you buy this dessert?

222
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,080
We bought it from the yellow cow.

223
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,400
Add dozens of yuan.

224
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,640
Can I add you on WeChat?

225
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,360
I love this dessert too.

226
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,320
Okay.

227
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,040
Please give me the contact information of Yellow Bull.

228
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,120
Okay.

229
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,400
What's that smell?

230
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,720
Fire! Fire!

231
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,040
Hao Hao.

232
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,520
Godmother.

233
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,600
Godmother.

234
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,640
Don't worry.

235
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,640
I've opened the windows.

236
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,520
Have some water.

237
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,360
Tell me.

238
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,400
I just want to cook some dishes for you.

239
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,600
Look what happened.

240
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,360
The stove at Anran's home is not good.

241
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,280
Godmother,

242
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,160
Have you forgotten

243
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,160
you almost blew up the kitchen after cooking an egg.

244
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,040
That night,

245
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,600
she came to my house for dinner.

246
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,720
You still remember that?

247
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
It's been so many years.

248
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,400
I have to improve my cooking skills.

249
00:11:59,400 --> 00:11:59,960
Godmother,

250
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
If you want to eat something,

251
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,400
I can cook for you.

252
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,760
Hao Hao

253
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,000
has grown up.

254
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,840
If I walk on the street,

255
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,560
I couldn't recognize you.

256
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,960
An'an didn't recognize me that day.

257
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,080
Aunt,

258
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,400
Besides genetic beauty,

259
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,680
do we have a little bit of eyes?

260
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,600
Not that good.

261
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,400
You're really naughty.

262
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,040
Godmother.

263
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,640
But you haven't changed at all.

264
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,760
You're still so young.

265
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,720
No.

266
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,960
Our Haohao

267
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,840
is a sweet talker.

268
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,600
Actually, I came here

269
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,520
to see

270
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,400
if you are used to living here.

271
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,280
By the way, I want to discuss something with Anran.

272
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,600
I think there should be a boy

273
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,840
take good care of her.

274
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,480
I'll be relieved.

275
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,400
Don't worry, godmother.

276
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,520
I'll take care of her from now on.

277
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,280
My Hao Hao.

278
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,400
Yes, I forgot.

279
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,320
My Hao Hao

280
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,280
has grown up, right?

281
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,480
Yes.

282
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,040
I really want to tell you something.

283
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:56,960
I think

284
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,560
we can go out

285
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,960
go out for dinner, okay?

286
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,360
You don't have to tell me that.

287
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,480
I think we are a family.

288
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,840
Do you really think so?

289
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,600
I was worried

290
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,080
you young people don't like this.

291
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,720
No.

292
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,160
I really like this set.

293
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
I'll book a restaurant now.

294
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,960
No, no, no.

295
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
I've taken care of everything.

296
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
Yes.

297
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,400
I think as long as we are together,

298
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,440
we can do anything.

299
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
You're such a good girl.

300
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,680
It seems that few people appear in your work.

301
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,400
Of course, they are more honest than humans.

302
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,120
Sometimes,

303
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,520
we can also

304
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,560
more information about us.

305
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,760
What material is this?

306
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,520
I made it myself.

307
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,520
There's a land mine for reporting.

308
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,720
insects,

309
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,880
and gems.

310
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,800
Everything.

311
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,760
As expected of the new artist I picked.

312
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Interesting.

313
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,920
What?

314
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,720
If you're interested, you can take a deep look.

315
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,200
It's enough to enjoy it

316
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,880
It's too tiring to know in depth.

317
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,200
I don't want to waste time.

318
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Actually,

319
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,360
there is a simpler and direct way

320
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,120
to get to know each other.

321
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,200
Come on. Help yourself.

322
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,600
We're family.

323
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,680
Mom.

324
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,000
Why is he here?

325
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,960
Gosh.

326
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,640
I need to take good care of Dr Ding.

327
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,600
Hao Hao.

328
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,520
Haohao.

329
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,600
Hao, time to eat.

330
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,360
Let's not go to find Anran today.

331
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,440
Let's go tomorrow, okay?

332
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,640
No.

333
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,360
Why?

334
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,440
We promised to see the stars.

335
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,640
What stars?

336
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,040
Hao Hao.

337
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,280
Hao.

338
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,960
Is this Xia Anran's home?

339
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,680
Kid, I'm Xia Anran's classmate.

340
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,400
She forgot her homework book.

341
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
This is my home.

342
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,200
What's wrong, Jefferson?

343
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,520
Here.

344
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,640
She forgot her homework book.

345
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,240
This is her homework book.

346
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,360
Thank you, Hao.

347
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,040
Hello.

348
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,800
Are you Anran's classmate?

349
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,080
Do you want to come in?

350
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,920
Godmother, it's too late.

351
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,920
My brother is in a hurry to go home.

352
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,840
Really?

353
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,760
Bye.

354
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,680
Let's go.

355
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,440
Let's go inside.
