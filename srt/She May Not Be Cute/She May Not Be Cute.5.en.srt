1
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,600
This way, please.

2
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,280
Okay.

3
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,200
This painting here.

4
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,280
this painting.

5
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,800
This is it.

6
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:28,840
Okay.

7
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,320
It looks nice at home.

8
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,160
It's nice.

9
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
I'll look at other things.

10
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,160
Please take a look.

11
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,800
Okay.

12
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,120
Tell me, how did you find me?

13
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Just for the other half's number?

14
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,880
Didn't Miss Tang invite me?

15
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,480
Take a look.

16
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,800
Are you avoiding me?

17
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,160
Of course not.

18
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,600
Please.

19
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,880
Do you think it's more charming

20
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,680
than "naked Maha"?

21
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,520
Because dressing can only be imagined

22
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,480
I can't be seen.

23
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,360
Can't I?

24
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,480
People always take off her clothes with their eyes.

25
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,200
But not everyone

26
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,480
want to see something real.

27
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,680
What a pity.

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
I don't want to mix relationships with work.

29
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,480
What a coincidence.

30
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,120
I don't like

31
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,680
mix relationships and work together.

32
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,680
Why don't we talk about love today?

33
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,440
Is this what you said?

34
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,960
A magical interview.

35
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,760
Turn around.

36
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,960
Okay.

37
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,040
You sell your soul every day for work.

38
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,120
Jia Jia.

39
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,120
Little kid becomes Party A.

40
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,920
How awkward is it?

41
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,640
How can I make him let go of the old grudge and create glory together?

42
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,760
It's urgent.

43
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,760
Why are all men like this?

44
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,480
Playing hard to get.

45
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,960
I don't deny that most men are like this.

46
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,640
But I'm not.

47
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,760
To deal with a man like that,

48
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,640
why don't we try to make them think

49
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,159
Let them think they can control the whole scene

50
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,920
and wait for the heart defense to collapse.

51
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,040
Remove your armor first.

52
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,360
and wait and see.

53
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,360
What does this have to do with making desserts?

54
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,640
Try it first.

55
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,520
Don't ask the purpose.

56
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,080
You're not doing your job again, are you?

57
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,960
Let go of your prejudice.

58
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,640
you'll gain something different.

59
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,080
I think you're playing tricks.

60
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,520
Lin Hao,

61
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,920
Don't delay our important date.

62
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
An An treats me as a colleague now.

63
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,240
The more I want her to know me,

64
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,400
the further she goes.

65
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,040
What should I do? It's urgent.

66
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,800
Excuse me.

67
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,200
He's my friend's crush.

68
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,840
I have no improper thoughts about him.

69
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,080
Physical distance is so close.

70
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,360
Psychological distance is far away from the galaxy.

71
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,480
Like this.

72
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,200
The more direct it is, the more exciting it gets.

73
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,200
Be direct.

74
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,800
You need to be fast and ruthless.

75
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,120
An'an.

76
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,800
Look.

77
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,840
Look what I found.

78
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,120
This is saliva.

79
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,680
Do you feel the taste buds were spinning last time?

80
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,240
It’s amazing.

81
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,280
I always want to add this

82
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,080
in my ingredients.

83
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,920
but I couldn't find it.

84
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,520
I didn't expect to find it this time.

85
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,120
An.

86
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,720
You really bring me luck every time.

87
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,200
Let's go.

88
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,800
Let's go.

89
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,520
Go.

90
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,200
What?

91
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,520
Exercise.

92
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,280
You've really grown up a lot.

93
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,080
I told you I'm already...

94
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,720
Maybe we'll be good partners.

95
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,800
Slow down.

96
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
You said you'd give me

97
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,040
you'll give me your other half's number.

98
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,680
Okay.

99
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,720
I'll give it to you from the second.

100
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,640
This is for you.

101
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,520
Mom, I want to see that.

102
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,600
I'll show you over there, okay?

103
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,960
Look.

104
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,159
Does this look like a pudding?

105
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,120
You must be full of desserts.

106
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,160
Let's start.

107
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,120
If you travel to a strange city,

108
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,360
would you

109
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,240
at the first time?

110
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,160
In fact, whenever I go to a city,

111
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,160
I would go to the aquarium first.

112
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,680
Can you tell us why?

113
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,520
Do you want to know?

114
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,840
Because I can see stars.

115
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,520
Why are there stars in the aquarium?

116
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,680
When I was young, someone told me

117
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,120
as long as you want to see the stars,

118
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,840
you can see it anywhere.

119
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
The change of the stars

120
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,680
You can't see it with your naked eyes.

121
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,280
It's the same with the aquarium.

122
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,360
But it's like a time tunnel.

123
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,400
It can bring people back to their childhood.

124
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,520
As you all know,

125
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,520
it's not easy to start a business in China.

126
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,280
Exposing yourself can attract more popularity.

127
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,360
Why didn't you choose to expose it?

128
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,480
Because I don't care.

129
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,840
Then what do you care about?

130
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,360
You...

131
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,720
I'm not going to France.

132
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,280
I promised to go to the aquarium with her.

133
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,120
I promised to accompany her forever.

134
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120
Hao Hao.

135
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,400
An'an.

136
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,520
Lin Hao.

137
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,520
I don't want to go to the aquarium.

138
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,160
The final exam is coming.

139
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,120
I have my own things to do.

140
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,720
You have yours too.

141
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,720
Uncle Lin.

142
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,600
Mrs. Tan.

143
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,120
Thank you for taking care of me these years.

144
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,840
Take care.

145
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,800
You too.

146
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,960
I'll visit you when I'm free.

147
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,920
An'an.

148
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,680
Hao Hao.

149
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,720
Hao, let's go.

150
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,480
An'an.

151
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,120
An'an.

152
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,240
An'an.

153
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
Mom, look.

154
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,280
All right.

155
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,280
I don't want to see it, mom.

156
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,520
There are so many fish, right?

157
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,680
So many fish. Look at this.

158
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,040
Do you think this looks like it?

159
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,520
Is it the same?

160
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,280
So beautiful

161
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,000
Let me take a picture for you Look here
