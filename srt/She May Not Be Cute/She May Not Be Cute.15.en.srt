1
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,400
Come on. Come on.

2
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,080
Don't always say you're in a rush to work.

3
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,720
How many times have you shaken me with this?

4
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,640
I was in a hurry today.

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,479
According to reliable sources,

6
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,080
the suspect, Mr. Xia, has escaped breakfast many times.

7
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,800
[has been escorted by a special person.]

8
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,360
You can be bailed after breakfast.

9
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,479
If you don't eat breakfast,

10
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
You might get indigestion.

11
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,960
I'm reading work information.

12
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,440
Work is more important than health.

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,160
You can support me if you don't work.

14
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,880
I'll support you.

15
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,400
An'an,

16
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,560
I'm serious.

17
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,720
Everything I have is yours.

18
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,360
Even if it's mine,

19
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,920
you have to be responsible for your life.

20
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,480
Thank you for the food.

21
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,160
Bye.

22
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,160
You're shaking me again.

23
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:30,560
Pay for the meal.

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,720
Keep the change.

25
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,079
According to the informant,

26
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,560
the photographer of the "Queen" magazine

27
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,400
is suspected of sexual harassment.

28
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,480
We will further follow up.

29
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,600
Hello, this is the "Queen" magazine.

30
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,520
Hello?

31
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,200
Give me a pen.

32
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,600
There are so many complaints this morning.

33
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,600
Okay, let me sort it out.

34
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,840
Why are the photographers

35
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,200
Why are there so many controversies?

36
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,720
What's wrong with you?

37
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,800
Anran didn't participate in the cover.

38
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,760
It's our fault.

39
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,080
How far has it gone?

40
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,520
Last night, a netizens reported

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,840
that this photographer

42
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,800
to sexually harass female models.

43
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,560
I'm still

44
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,040
the real identity of this matter.

45
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,480
On the other hand,

46
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,480
the statement we released last night

47
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,160
was too stiff

48
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,920
causing the virus.

49
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,440
It's not good for us.

50
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
The statement yesterday was Chief Editor Zhang.

51
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,720
What I want now is the solution.

52
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,160
My suggestion is to cut it directly.

53
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,520
to cut the loss in time.

54
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
It's just that this matter involves a lot of people.

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,520
I'm afraid I don't have the right to handle it.

56
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,720
From now on,

57
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,360
report to me directly.

58
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,720
I'll deal with it.

60
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,000
How's the platform?

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We've almost contacted the relevant platforms.

62
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,800
Once the statement is stamped, it will be released at the same time.

63
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,000
As soon as the time is up, we'll send it together.

64
00:03:59,440 --> 00:03:59,800
OK.

65
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,000
Keep an eye on the feedback of the platform.

66
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,160
Okay.

67
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,640
And the photographer...

68
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,240
contact the legal department to terminate the contract.

69
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,880
Remember to check the compensation plan

70
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,640
of intellectual property.

71
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,720
Don't let him take advantage of us.

72
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,800
The photographer is Editor-in-Chief Zhang.

73
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,000
He strongly recommended it.

74
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,520
It's business.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,440
Okay.

76
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,640
Also,

77
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,160
help me contact

78
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,160
the model in the case.

79
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,240
But remember to protect the client's privacy.

80
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,440
This...

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,520
Okay.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,240
I'd like to remind you

83
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
It's time for lunch.

84
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,440
I'm working as you say.

85
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,320
I've asked someone

86
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,440
to your desk.

87
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,440
Eat it while it's hot.

88
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,600
I don't usually touch things that don't indicate the price.

89
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,720
I'm afraid of being extorted.

90
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,360
I'll take interest.

91
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,159
A lot.

92
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,880
Have a seat.

93
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,520
Louis.

94
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,880
Let me put it simply.

95
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,240
the situation is not good for you.

96
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,080
Although you are actually a manager of A&H,

97
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,240
the person who applied was Xiao Jin.

98
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,640
Amanda.

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,160
So she can get the logo back anytime.

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,440
Can I solve this problem

101
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
through legal procedures?

102
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,640
If we enter the judicial committee,

103
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,800
it will be suspended.

104
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,240
You have to think about

105
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,600
you have to think it over.

106
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,880
The best way

107
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,520
the best way is negotiation.

108
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
and trademark transfer.

109
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,640
What if you pay for it?

110
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,640
Buy?

111
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,480
One million.

112
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,840
Ten million

113
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,640
This is ten times the original price.

114
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,760
Okay.

115
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,520
I'll think of another way.

116
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,760
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

117
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:52,920
OK.

118
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,040
Who is monitoring the situation now?

119
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,920
Show me the report.

120
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,200
Anran,

121
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,520
You are really risky.

122
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,200
After this conversation

123
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,760
and the harassment models,

124
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,040
the news online has started to spread.

125
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,040
The public opinion has started to change.

126
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,480
Keep an eye on the rest.

127
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
Good work, everyone.

128
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
What's wrong?

129
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,760
Why did you drink?

130
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,920
An'an,

131
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,200
You have your life.

132
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,760
I have my life.

133
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,800
Okay.

134
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,040
Would you like a glass of lemon water?

135
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
I'll read the report.

136
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,800
Thank you for your hard work.

137
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,920
After this is over,

138
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,200
after this is over.

139
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,920
Okay.

140
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,640
No problem.

141
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Go back to work.

142
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,640
Okay.

143
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,240
Look at the person you're looking for.

144
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,640
He's good in the industry.

145
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,800
to make a statement

146
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,480
could cause such a big trouble to the company.

147
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,640
Did you do a backtone before finding someone?

148
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,200
Is this person suitable or not?

149
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,320
Looks like someone thinks

150
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,920
after cleaning up the mess.

151
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,320
As you know,

152
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,040
what you've done is a mess.

153
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,320
But whoever is useful

154
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,920
will be pushed to the front.

155
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,080
Don't get too worked up.

156
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,760
Black can't be white.

157
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,040
The white won't be black either.

158
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,760
As long as you have a clear conscience.

159
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,320
Looks like Louis

160
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
from you.

161
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,920
What do you mean?

162
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,920
Didn't Louis tell you?

163
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,920
I guess there's a secret between you two.

164
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,640
People like us

165
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,640
can't trust others.

166
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,320
Right?

167
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,240
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,200
I fell asleep.

169
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
I happened to be downstairs.

170
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,920
It's restricted today.

171
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,919
Luckily I met you.

172
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,640
Otherwise, it wouldn't be easy to get a taxi at that time.

173
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,039
It's not a coincidence.

174
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,520
It's been too long.

175
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,480
I want to see you.

176
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,320
Are you busy recently?

177
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,240
Yes.

178
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,040
Thank you.

179
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,040
Safe.

180
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,520
You can come to me if you feel pressured.

181
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,920
Physiotherapy, basketball,

182
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,760
Anything.

183
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,640
Just like before.

184
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,320
Actually, I'm...

185
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,240
We're friends.

186
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,320
Right?

187
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,320
Of course.

188
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,760
We've always been friends.

189
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,320
It's just that everyone has to face the pressure.

190
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,480
Right?

191
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,760
I'm leaving.

192
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,520
Is your seat belt stuck?

193
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,920
Thank you.

194
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,000
Are you still angry?

195
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,640
Why did you ask Ding Zhiwei to pick you up?

196
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,320
He was just passing by.

197
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,760
Who would believe that?

198
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,880
He's waiting for you.

199
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,240
All right.

200
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,480
I won't do it again.

201
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,240
Why did you drink so much again?

202
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,800
You said you'd work hard.

203
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,640
Of course I have to

204
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,200
for my work.

205
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,200
I met Amanda today.

206
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,640
What happened between you and her?

207
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,000
What did she tell you?

208
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,320
She said you're going to die with her.

209
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,480
What do you mean?

210
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,520
Is there something you didn't tell me?

211
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,760
We have to be responsible for our lives.

212
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,680
Isn't that what you said?

213
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,440
There's another half of this sentence.

214
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
When you can't handle it alone,

215
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,760
you have to be honest with each other, not silence.

216
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,440
Then did you tell me the truth?

217
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,200
I told you.

218
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,640
I didn't know he was waiting for me.

219
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,880
Did you know later?

220
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,680
Why didn't you explain to me?

221
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,040
Lin Hao.

222
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,520
Why should I explain to you?

223
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
Because I got in a car

224
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,320
a car that likes my man,

225
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,840
Or I didn't tell you

226
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,200
tell you everything in the past.

227
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,640
Before I was with you,

228
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,440
my life wasn't empty.

229
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,320
But now that you're back,

230
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,760
I chose to be with you.

231
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,320
to respect each other's life.

232
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,440
This is how adults get along.

233
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,800
Just like your recent secret.

234
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,200
I didn't ask much.

235
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,440
Right?

236
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,680
I want to terminate the contract with Amanda.

237
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Why didn't you

238
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,600
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

239
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,720
With her personality,

240
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,160
she won't agree so easily.

241
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,600
You shouldn't have broken up with her.

242
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,600
She did make a condition.

243
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,640
to take A&H away.

244
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,080
She has the logo.

245
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,080
So it's hard.

246
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
But don’t worry.

247
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,200
I will buy A&H back.

248
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,520
Why did you terminate the contract with her?

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,880
Is it because of me?

250
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,520
Yes.

251
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,760
But not exactly.

252
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't like people who hurt you.

253
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,520
But she's not

254
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,680
a good partner.

255
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,680
Since we're going to terminate the contract,

256
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,680
why don't you

257
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
How much did she ask you?

258
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,640
Ten times the original price.

259
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,440
I made a new product.

260
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,440
Are you hungry?

261
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,560
Do you want to try it?

262
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,880
Let's go.

263
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,200
That’s just a shell.

264
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,320
If you can make the first brand well,

265
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,520
you can make the second one.

266
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,920
Different.

267
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,440
Do you know what A&H means?

268
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Our names.

269
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,640
So it's everything to me.

270
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,640
Lin Hao.

271
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,000
I can accept your love.

272
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,760
But it's not worth it.

273
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,400
It's worth it.

274
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,400
When you eat my dessert,

275
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,400
your face is overflowing with smiles.

276
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,840
I think everything is worth it.

277
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,400
Can you face problems

278
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,520
like an adult?

279
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,760
I don't need to be like an adult.

280
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,160
I'm an adult.

281
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
Trust me.

282
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,760
I'll take care of everything.

283
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,160
I'm not eating.

284
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,200
Try it.

285
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,400
I made this especially for you.

286
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,280
I'm really not eating.

287
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,400
Have a bite.

288
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,960
I stopped eating desserts ten years ago.

289
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,400
Try it.

290
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,920
Lin Hao, be serious.

291
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
I didn't mean it.

292
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,720
What did you just say?

293
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,720
Can you be serious?

294
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,200
You always said the cake

295
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,080
you said it was delicious.

296
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,760
I lied to you.

297
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,160
You lied to me.

298
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,760
Why did you lie to me?

299
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,160
Because you never listen to me.

300
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,840
You're like a child.

301
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,080
like a child.

302
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,280
You never care about what others want.

303
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,200
Your self-righteous things are too childish.

304
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,840
I'm childish?

305
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:37,960
Yes.

306
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,640
I'm childish.

307
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,160
But I did it for you.

308
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,600
For me?

309
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,520
For me again.

310
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,400
My mom left me to my dad for me.

311
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,760
My dad sent me to your home for me.

312
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,520
You just leave.

313
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,640
You just come back.

314
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
You just chased me.

315
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,400
Who asked about my feelings?

316
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,280
I really can't afford

317
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,160
I really can't afford it.

318
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,440
When I was young,

319
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,640
we had a deal.

320
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
Every time you come,

321
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,160
you eat this kind of cream cake.

322
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,280
Every bite you eat is carefully.

323
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,160
You told me it was the taste of happiness.

324
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,080
I went back to the old house

325
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,640
But this shop was long gone.

326
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,200
After you came back,

327
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,680
since you came back.

328
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,080
I thought

329
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,960
as long as I find

330
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,520
the taste of this cream cake,

331
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,960
If I make it,

332
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,080
you'll become like before.

333
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
the happy you.

334
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,080
Do you know why

335
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,520
I don't like you mentioning the past?

336
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,520
Because when I was little,

337
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,600
when I was little.

338
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,520
Everything you think is fake.

339
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,280
I don't want to go back to my old self.

340
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:55,760
So please

341
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,520
stop forcing me to recall the past.

342
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,280
An'an.

343
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,080
I'm sorry.

344
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,080
For all this time,

345
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,280
I was wrong.

346
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,000
I won't bother you anymore.

347
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,480
An'an,

348
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,320
You can only eat a small piece a day.

349
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,320
In that case,

350
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,840
I'll pick you up after you finish eating.

351
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,080
An'an,

352
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,160
Didn't Uncle Xia pick you up today?

353
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,400
The cake is so big this time.

354
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,400
Does Uncle Xia need a long trip this time?

355
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Dad said he'll be back in a few days.

356
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,400
If you only eat a small piece a day,

357
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,520
for about a week.

358
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
Really?

359
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,160
Great.

360
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,520
You can stay with me for another week.

361
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,760
I'll put it in the fridge.

362
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,920
So she can stay longer.
