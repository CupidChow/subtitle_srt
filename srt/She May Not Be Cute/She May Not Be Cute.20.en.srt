1
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,360
What else do you have to say?

2
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,640
Mom.

3
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,400
Godmother.

4
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,000
An An and I

5
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,200
take this relationship seriously.

6
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,760
We've been looking for the right opportunity

7
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,440
to tell you.

8
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,120
When I arranged a blind date for Anran,

9
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,520
you two were already like this, right?

10
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,680
Are you two acting for me?

11
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Mom. Godmother.

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,200
Don't blame An An for this.

13
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,160
I've been pestering her.

14
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,920
Just now,

15
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,759
confessed her love to you,

16
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,479
I heard everything.

17
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,920
I have a weak heart.

18
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,200
I'm not deaf.

19
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,840
It's not Lin Hao's wishful thinking.

20
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,680
Actually, I've liked him for a long time.

21
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,680
I just didn't admit it.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,920
Enough.

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,360
It makes me

24
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,480
an evil mother-in-law at 8 o'clock stall.

25
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,640
So,

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,480
when are you going to get the marriage certificate?

27
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,520
Marriage?

28
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,920
Aren't you going to get married?

29
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,760
You're just playing.

30
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,600
Mom.

31
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,760
Godmother.

32
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,160
Let her get up.

33
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,200
I can kneel alone.

34
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,200
We didn't ask you to kneel here.

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,440
Don't try to blackmail us.

36
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,120
You didn't ask us to get up.

37
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,200
That's because you two feel guilty.

38
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,400
You knelt down as soon as you came.

39
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,960
Isn't this our sincerity?

40
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,640
They have a tacit understanding.

41
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:50,520
Godmother.

42
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,640
This is our telepathy.

43
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,240
Then we'll get up.

44
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,160
Wait.

45
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,840
Help me.

46
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,640
My feet are numb.

47
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,520
Stop it.

48
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,560
Enough.

49
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,520
I have to

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,320
about you two.

51
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,760
What?

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,520
Your mom found out.

53
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,400
Now your godson becomes a son-in-law.

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,760
Can your mom bear it?

55
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,560
I think so.

56
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,040
She said to digest it.

57
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,120
What if she can't?

58
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,480
We have to talk.

59
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,200
When it comes to stray cats,

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,200
your silly smile never comes down from the corners of your mouth.

61
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,040
Really?

62
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,920
Yes.

63
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,200
When I think of the beginning,

64
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,200
I have a feeling.

65
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,760
He was still an unknown stray cat back then.

66
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,920
People can't escape the law of smell.

67
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,000
I have something to ask you.

68
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,120
What is it?

69
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,120
Here's the thing.

70
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,280
An'an.

71
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,400
I feel very happy these days.

72
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,840
This scene

73
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,760
only appeared in my dreams.

74
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,200
An'an.

75
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,480
I love you.

76
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,839
Okay.

77
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,760
We've been talking all night.

78
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,120
Have you thought about

79
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,920
Have you made up your mind?

80
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,280
What is it?

81
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,920
Get the marriage certificate.

82
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,200
Sorry.

83
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,680
My hand slipped.

84
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,280
It's okay.

85
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,920
Don't feel too burdened.

86
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,640
You know my mom.

87
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,920
She just speaks faster than her brain.

88
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,040
I know.

89
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,920
I didn't think too much.

90
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,560
Is he testing me?

91
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,560
Of course.

92
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,200
Lin Hao has a brain capacity, a room and a room.

93
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,560
except the dessert shop.

94
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,680
Is there anything else?

95
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
What should we do?

96
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,560
I think you should think it through.

97
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,280
Whether you want it or not,

98
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,840
It's his business.

99
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,280
If you really don't want to get married,

100
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,280
just tell him.

101
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,280
I'm afraid he'll think too much.

102
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,640
You know his personality.

103
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,280
If I say that,

104
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,560
he'll think I don't like him anymore.

105
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,840
Xia Anran.

106
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,120
You've changed.

107
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,040
You think about others now?

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,200
Are you purified

109
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,680
or your IQ?

110
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,000
Thinking about it gives me a headache.

111
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Congratulations.

112
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,960
This is probably the power of true love.

113
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,240
Do you want this luck?

114
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,480
No, no, no.

115
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,400
I have no luck to enjoy it.

116
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,240
Seriously,

117
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,960
Are you afraid of marriage

118
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,200
or Lin Hao?

119
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,200
These are two different things.

120
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,040
I really don't want to

121
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,800
I really don't want to experience it again.

122
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,280
And I don't believe

123
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,680
marriage can guarantee love.

124
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,240
Lin Hao,

125
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,080
I couldn't help you get rid of your worries.

126
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,080
Actually, I think

127
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,800
it's good for us to be like this.

128
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,640
We're free and happy.

129
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,680
It's just the rhythm of these two moms

130
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,640
It's like being pushed away.

131
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,080
Ms. Xia.

132
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,640
It's okay to be confused.

133
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,240
Don't fool yourself.

134
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,040
At this time,

135
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,960
you should be in the same period as me.

136
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,840
You drank so much ice.

137
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,280
He hasn't come this month.

138
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,280
It's hot lately.

139
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,640
I always want to drink something cold.

140
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,960
Are you...

141
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,640
Yes.

142
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,560
I'm pregnant.

143
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,360
What?

144
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,520
Did you quarrel with Chief Editor Xia?

145
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,680
No.

146
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,760
I guess

147
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,200
you wanted to try to

148
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,800
but you got rejected.

149
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,680
Although I'm a firm materialism,

150
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,080
but sometimes

151
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,120
It's really weird.

152
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,120
After all, your brother is experienced in love.

153
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,800
It's not difficult for me

154
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,800
can't beat me.

155
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,800
What?

156
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,960
Jia agreed to date you?

157
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,800
Doctors don't treat themselves, you know?

158
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,520
Tell me.

159
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,640
Let me analyze it for you.

160
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,800
I want to marry her.

161
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,640
So I sounded it out.

162
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,840
She almost strangled me.

163
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,680
Are you playing that big?

164
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,960
No.

165
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,400
I mean, have you officially proposed to her?

166
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,200
I was just testing her.

167
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,120
Then I took it as a joke

168
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,200
as a joke.

169
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,480
Just kidding.

170
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,960
Can you joke about this?

171
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,080
You can joke about anything.

172
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,240
Proposal is not a joke.

173
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,280
You don't even have a ring.

174
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,240
Then the girls will talk about you forever.

175
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,200
They will think

176
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,400
if you were testing me

177
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,240
Are you trying to leave yourself some space?

178
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,960
Do you not love me enough?

179
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,200
Let me tell you.

180
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,360
This is a major minus.

181
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,040
Your credit score is in danger.

182
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,400
It's lucky that Chief Editor Xia

183
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,360
without a slam dunk.

184
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,840
What should we do?

185
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,000
Anran,

186
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,280
This is our weekly newspapers.

187
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,040
Okay.

188
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,919
How's the progress

189
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,679
about the special issue?

190
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,039
Our proposal

191
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,799
is decided to be the city's Sweet Limited.

192
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,039
to invite four couples

193
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,799
for love and life.

194
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,039
and do some observation documents.

195
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,240
This theme is too common.

196
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,920
This is the theme

197
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,040
on the Double Seventh Festival.

198
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,800
I'll copy the manuscript from two years ago.

199
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,280
You can go home now.

200
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,800
We have a backup plan.

201
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,280
But it's not mature.

202
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,440
Tell us.

203
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,120
We plan to interview

204
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,600
in various industries.

205
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,560
Show the power of a sparkling woman.

206
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,560
What's the point of showing perfection?

207
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,240
The most popular

208
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,800
is some unrealistic female images.

209
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,040
causing unnecessary anxiety.

210
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,240
They say women

211
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,920
should balance home and work perfectly.

212
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,920
I can take care of my baby in the morning.

213
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,120
We can go to the T-station at night.

214
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,120
But are these really real?

215
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,040
Let's think about other projects.

216
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,680
I think we can do the opposite.

217
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,280
to expose their weaknesses.

218
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,680
The theme is

219
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,800
She's not cute.

220
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,360
She's not cute.

221
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,600
Isn't it to show the perfect side

222
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,560
to encourage the readers?

223
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,920
Exposing your weaknesses boldly

224
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,680
to encourage you.

225
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,000
What do you think?

226
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,800
The content of the interview

227
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,440
We can do some experience projects

228
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
and record them.

229
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,240
it'll be more interesting than an ordinary interview.

230
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,240
Okay.

231
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,000
We'll make up the plan as soon as possible.

232
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,000
But ordinary girls

233
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,440
care about being imperfect.

234
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,240
Who would want to expose their weaknesses?

235
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,920
I know a few people.

236
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,040
This one, right?

237
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,040
Not bad.

238
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,600
What time is it?

239
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,120
Why isn't Jefferson back yet?

240
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,920
This kid.

241
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
This is not bad.

242
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,240
He's been busy in the shop lately.

243
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,440
He should be on his way back.

244
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,920
Be safe.

245
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,480
Your mom and I

246
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,040
visited several wedding venues.

247
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,360
It's nice to have two.

248
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,680
Let me tell you now.

249
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,680
Like the beach.

250
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
I think you young people will like it.

251
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,560
Right?

252
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,680
The beach is nice.

253
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,360
Mom.

254
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,920
Didn't you say you need to digest it?

255
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,440
That's what I meant that day.

256
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,120
I was scared by you that day.

257
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,360
Think about Hao Hao.

258
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,040
I watched him grow up.

259
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,360
He has a good personality.

260
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,360
and handsome.

261
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,480
As long as you like him.

262
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,120
Why wouldn't I?

263
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,480
You digest so fast.

264
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,000
It's not about whether it's fast or not.

265
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,600
It's hard to book such a nice place now.

266
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,000
It's been half a year.

267
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
If you don't order now,

268
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,720
you won't be able to make it next year.

269
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,160
You don't have to do this kind of thing.

270
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,920
It's not about rolling it or not.

271
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,480
Marriage is a big deal.

272
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,360
A few months in advance.

273
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,240
Wait a few more months.

274
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,480
It's worth booking

275
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
It's worth it.

276
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,120
Yes.

277
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,040
Don't let us suffer in peace.

278
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,240
Why didn't you

279
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,800
discuss this with us?

280
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,360
About what?

281
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,880
Your mom and I will

282
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,800
in a few days.

283
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,720
Yes.

284
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,800
Listen to me.

285
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,120
I...

286
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,240
An Ran.

287
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,360
What's wrong?

288
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,720
This... Anran.

289
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,000
What's wrong, Anran?

290
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,040
Don't worry.

291
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,680
It's safe.

292
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,240
What's wrong with you, Anran?

293
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,480
I'm fine.

294
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Maybe I ate something bad in the afternoon.

295
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,600
Are you tired from work?

296
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,800
I'm safe.

297
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,000
Let me take you to the hospital.

298
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,600
Okay?

299
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,040
No, no, no.

300
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,120
It'll be done soon.

301
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,440
Probably.

302
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,360
I ate something bad. What happened?

303
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,800
Ask Lin Hao to buy

304
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,360
Well,

305
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,720
Sister.

306
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,800
I think we should hurry up for this wedding.

307
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
We can't delay any longer.

308
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,600
Yes.

309
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,600
Anran.

310
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,240
Are you feeling unwell recently?

311
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,560
No.

312
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,000
And Jefferson.

313
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,120
Anran

314
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,040
Don't eat greasy food.

315
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,920
You have to eat light food.

316
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,680
And nutrition should be very balanced.

317
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,280
Okay.

318
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,240
Yes.

319
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,440
And Anran.

320
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,560
Don't work too hard.

321
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,920
Give those work

322
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,800
to your colleagues.

323
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,600
Don't be too tired.

324
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,200
The result is out.

325
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,240
Drink some water, An'an.

326
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,040
Are you feeling better?

327
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,680
I told you.

328
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,120
I just ate too much. I'm not pregnant.

329
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,040
It's okay.

330
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,800
You're still young.

331
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,720
Young people still have a lot of chances.

332
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,480
Yes.

333
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,920
An'an,

334
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,000
You should take good care of yourself.

335
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,120
Don't be too tired.

336
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,720
Mom.

337
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,680
Auntie.

338
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,880
I have something to say.

339
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,920
You just had something to say.

340
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,880
What is it?

341
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,440
I...

342
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,440
I don't want to get married.
