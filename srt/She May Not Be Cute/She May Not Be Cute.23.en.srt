00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,000
Making wishes is a lie.

An'an.

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,000
An'an.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What's wrong?

5
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,400
My parents are divorced.

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,600
I really don't understand.

7
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,320
If we get married, we'll still be apart.

8
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,600
Why did you get married?

9
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,759
Forget it.

10
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,840
You won't understand.

11
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,680
An'an,

12
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,120
Don't be sad.

13
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,880
You still have me.

14
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,880
I'll always be with you.

15
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,560
Remember,

16
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,560
Don't say anything

17
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,920
Don't say it out loud.

18
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,200
or you'll hurt others.

19
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,320
I'm a man of my word.

20
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,960
I'll be with you forever.

21
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,680
I didn't understand

22
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,880
why those adults couldn't

23
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,600
Why can't those adults do it?

24
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,320
An'an.

25
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,200
Hao Hao.

26
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,680
I didn't expect...

27
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,079
Let's go, An'an.

28
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:21,480
The first time in my life

29
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,880
in my life.

30
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:23,880
Anan,

31
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,079
That's when I realized

32
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,120
when you can't be responsible,

33
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,880
don't give others hope easily.

34
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,000
Especially...

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,200
We'll be late if we don't hurry up.

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,760
Okay.

37
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,920
to the most important person.

38
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,840
Look here.

39
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,280
You come back to Korea every time.

40
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,840
You just watched her secretly.

41
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
Why don't you just

42
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,760
Say hello and confess to her?

[AYWTER]

46
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
It will hurt others.

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,000
If you are confident,

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,920
he'll run away.

49
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,920
Listen to me.

50
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,040
The most important thing is to seize the moment.

52
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,040

57
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,840
I'll go to her then.

59
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,720
Why are you working overtime on your birthday?

60
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,000
Mr. Wang.

61
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
I'm really sorry.

62
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,120
I'll do that again tomorrow.

63
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,240
I know it's not an excuse.

64
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,240
Okay, okay.

65
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,800
I'll...

66
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,440
Hello, Mum.

Jia Jia is here.

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,800
You guys eat first.

69
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,560
I have to work overtime.

70
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,440
I'm fine.

71
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,159
I'm fine.

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,720
My colleagues are nice to me.

73
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,520
They will celebrate my birthday later.

74
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,159
Okay.

You guys eat first.

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,920
What's up?

77
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,560
Are you trying to comfort me?

78
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,120
Thank you.

79
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,280
But comforting is the most useless thing

80
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,520
is the most useless thing.

81
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,400
Aren't you tired dressing like this every day?

82
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:39,159
You must like your work.

83
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,920
Are you asking me?

84
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,520
I like my work too.

85
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,840
But every time I work 100% hard,

86
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,000
to get the approval,

87
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,400
I thought I wasn't suitable to be a fashion editor.

88
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,000
You're asking me how I feel.

89
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,920
I actually love my job.

90
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,960
You have to cheer for me.

91
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,440
Then dance for me.

92
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,560
Thank you.

93
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,280
I'm much better.

94
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,720
I'm leaving.

95
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,000
Bye.

96
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,440
Wait.

97
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,520
For me?

98
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,520
I don't think it's a good idea.

99
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,960
Thank you.

100
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,720
Thank you.

Thank you so much.

If it weren't for you,

104
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,840
I would have given up.

105
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,880
Do you work nearby every day?

106
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,520
You have a strong sense of faith.

107
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,520
You don't talk at work.

108
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,400
Why don't you give me your number?

109
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,400
Later.

110
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,240
You can't bring your phone.

How about this?

112
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,000
How about this?

113
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,440
This is my number.

114
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,600
Text me after work.

115
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,560
I'll get going then.

116
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,360
Bye.

117

Don't be reluctant.

118
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,200
She's gone.

119
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,960
Can you return

120
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,560
can be returned to me, right?

121
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,960
Why didn't you text me?

122
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,440
Let me treat you to dinner today.

123
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,000
Auntie, it's okay.

124
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,960
Go ahead.

125
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,160
I'll wait for him here.

126
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,280
I remember when I left,

127
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,280
he was a little boy.

128
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,880
He's safe.

129
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,200
Can you play for a few more days this time?

130
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,760
I'll leave after work tomorrow.

131
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,200
Are you going back to prepare for the wedding?

132
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,080
How is it?

133
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,080
Have you set the date?

134
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,880
Which month?

135
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080
Not yet.

136
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,080
My mom will decide.

137
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,320
No hurry.

138
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,080
It's such a big day.

139
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,320
on such a big day.

140
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,560
What does he do?

141
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,320
He's running a company now.

142
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,360
One-sided love is a happy and cruel thing.

143
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
Because that's my love alone.

144
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,520
My heart flutters.

145
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
My heartache

146
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,680
my heartache.

147
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,760
How are you recently?

148
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
I'm fine.

149
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,760
What about you?

150
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm fine too.

151
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,440
But even if I knew,

152
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,880
you'll never know.

153
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,200
I still don't want to quit

154
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
my feelings for you.

155
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,320
I want to know

156
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,680
what kind of person

157
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,000
you want to marry?

158
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,560
Is he good to you?

159
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,680
Do you really love him?

160
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,120
But what I'm curious about the most

161
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,000
is the you in a wedding dress

162
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,120
in a wedding dress.

163
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
in a wedding dress?

164
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,880
An'an.

165
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,360
This time,

166
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,440
I should meet you with dignity.

167
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,000
It's time to say goodbye to this ten-year relationship.

168
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,200
Let's break up.

169
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,520
Gosh.

170
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,360
So exciting.

171
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,360
I really didn't want to come.

172
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,760
But this trip

173
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,000
is worth it.

174
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
What are you waiting for?

175
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,200
We must take advantage of her.

176
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,680
No.

177
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,800
She took advantage of it.

178
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
She doesn't want me

179
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,800
to see her most embarrassing face.

180
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,640
Even if I'm by her side now,

181
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,360
I can't rely on her now.

182
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,360
Let's go back to France.

183
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,960
In two years,

00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,200
in two years

185
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,520
and return to China.

187
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,640
This time,

188
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,960
please wait for me.

189
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,080
Sorry.

190
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,080
It's okay.

191
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,200
Are you ready?

192
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,520
Why hasn't Jia Jia come out yet?

193
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,200
When did you become clingy?

194
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,880
You're way worse than Louis.

195
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,200
Really?

196
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,800
Jia Jia.

197
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,240
Jia Jia.

198
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
No matter where you are,

199
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,760
I can always see you for the first time.

200
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,360
Your trick is too old.

201
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,560
You said you saw me before the first time we met.

202
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,760
I don't remember it now.

203
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,120
I've seen you before.

204
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,320
Are all men like this?

205
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,120
That's why good men are like this.

206
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
Are you Lin Hao's friend?

207
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,080
Boring.

208
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,880
I'm leaving.

209
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,440
The wedding hasn't started yet.

210
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,320
I can't bear to see

211
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,800
I can't bear to see it.

212
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,680
Why are you...

213
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,680
I don't think it suits me

214
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,200
doesn't suit me either.

215
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,240
You're that doctor.

216
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,440
I don't know what kind of famous you are.

217
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,520
Elsa.

218
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
Nice to meet you.

219
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,960
Ding Zhiwei.

220
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,520
This scene

221
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,440
It has been in my dreams countless times

222
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,880
When it really came,

223
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,200
It's so unbelievable.

224
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,800
I love you

225
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,560
I didn't have time to think.

226
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
But after thinking about it,

227
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,640
I still said that

228
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,760
I love you

229
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,520
At this moment

230
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,120
Every moment

231
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,320
I never thought I would be with you.

232
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,240
I never thought

233
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,560
being with someone other than you.

234
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,560
He's crazy.

235
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,440
He squatted all day on his birthday.

236
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,880
and smiled at night.

237
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,320
I don't know what happened.

238
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,440
All right.

239
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,760
I need a drink to calm down.

240
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,000
Please take care of the old man.

241
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,120
Thank you.

242
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,680
Bye.

243
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,200
Whisky.

244
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,080
Okay.

245
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,360
Can we get to know each other?

246
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:52,960
No.

247
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,560
Why?

248
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,480
We just broke up.

249
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,320
Then you should have a drink.

250
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,360
I hope you meet someone better.
