1
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,039
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

2
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,600
Why did you come back?

3
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,160
I did all this for you.

4
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,479
You like my dessert.

5
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,120
You're really different from what I remember.

6
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,000
I remember you were very naughty

7
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,000
You were always generous.

8
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,240
Where did you get the patience

9
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,320
to learn dessert these years?

10
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,200
You loved desserts when you were young.

11
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,280
And I've always been patient.

12
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
I like it.

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,960
Do you remember when you were young,

14
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,120
you had a nosebleed while studying?

15
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,120
just to eat an ice cream cake?

16
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,520
I don't remember what happened so long ago.

17
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,680
I remember

18
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,400
everything in my childhood

19
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
and every word

20
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,480
every word.

21
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,320
I didn't expect

22
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,760
you're still nostalgic.

23
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,680
You're still a pure boy.

24
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,760
Why are you looking at me like that?

25
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,520
I just think time is strange.

26
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,400
My impression of you

27
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,320
is still the year you went abroad when you were ten.

28
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,600
In a blink of an eye,

29
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,880
I'm 23 years old.

30
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,320
I'm not used to it.

31
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,480
Then take your time to get used to it.

32
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,040
So can you

33
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,960
stop looking at me like a child?

34
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,120
No.

35
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,760
I quit sugar.

36
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,520
The sweetness is very low.

37
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,680
Thousands of miles will be destroyed in an ant's den, you know?

38
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,960
Are you really not going to try?

39
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,160
I'm going back to work overtime.

40
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,160
Pack it for me.

41
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,960
I'll eat at the company.

42
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,040
Seeing how serious he was yesterday,

43
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,240
when he was serious yesterday.

44
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,680
He used to look like a kid

45
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,840
he was pretending to be an adult.

46
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,000
But it's different this time.

47
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,760
I feel something.

48
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,160
Why are you looking at me?

49
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,120
Your current state

50
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,160
I almost want to take a X-ray.

51
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,760
Are you back with emotions and desires?

52
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Not only that,

53
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
but also overflowing.

54
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,159
What are you talking about?

55
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,720
You’re wrong.

56
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,400
A&H is a small road.

57
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,440
Why do you have to give it to me?

58
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,400
I want to see

59
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,960
the male Bodhisattva Xia Anran mentioned.

60
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:45,680
He's alive.

61
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
What Bodhisattva?

62
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,120
We're just talking about work.

63
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,560
You...

64
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,560
There's no traffic jam. Let's go.

65
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,760
An'an.

66
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,760
You're here.

67
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,120
Bodhisattva.

68
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,520
This is my best friend, Tang Jiajia.

69
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,680
Hello, Sister Jia Jia.

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,840
Do you and An An

71
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,520
would you like to try my new dessert?

72
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,400
It's called Plut.

73
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,520
This name was named by Annan.

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
When?

75
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,120
No.

76
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,600
Why are you calling me sister?

77
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,159
She's not your sister.

78
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,159
Lin Hao, someone is calling you.

79
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,400
Go ahead.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,440
Okay.

81
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,520
Later,

82
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,040
I'll pack some for you in the kitchen.

83
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,159
This brother is a mandarin milk tea.

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,720
What does it mean?

85
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,440
It's milk tea and refreshing.

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,680
Not bad.

87
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,040
You can see it in a few words.

88
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,040
I...

89
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,520
15 seconds is too much.

90
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,000
Just like that.

91
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,240
I can tell from the back.

92
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,720
He's a little bad.

93
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,520
Isn't that your type?

94
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,560
What a pity.

95
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,400
I have something to do in the studio today.

96
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,320
I have to go.

97
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,280
It's all packed.

98
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,240
Thank you. I'll go back now.

99
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,840
Bye.

100
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,160
Okay.

101
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,240
Let's start.

102
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,320
Congratulations.

103
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,840
I have to read every word of the manuscript.

104
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,440
If

105
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
no one

106
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Don't you dare mess it up.

107
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,000
Happy opening.

108
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,880
When Xia Anran was there,

109
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,159
everything else became important to me.

110
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,000
Who is more important?

111
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,320
I can't use this one.

112
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,440
Louis didn't look at the camera. He can't send it.

113
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,040
An'an.

114
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,600
Come here.

115
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,440
But you can send it to me.

116
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,680
Okay.

117
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,080
Try these two.

118
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,960
It can interact with your dessert

119
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,280
and your attitude.

120
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,080
Go.

121
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,200
He's so handsome.

122
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,640
Gosh.

123
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,320
Who is talking about Louis?

124
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,840
I want to know too.

125
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,200
Look over there.

126
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,280
To the light. Yes.

127
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:37,960
Okay.

128
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,520
Let's call it a day.

129
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,400
The typhoon is coming.

130
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,400
Go home now.

131
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,159
OK.

132
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,040
See you, Anran. Aren't you leaving?

133
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,280
I'll finish up here.

134
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,200
You go first.

135
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,840
I'll wait for you.

136
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,400
You should go back too.

137
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,640
See if the door and windows are locked.

138
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,480
I'll be back soon.

139
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,480
Go ahead.

140
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,480
Thank you for earlier.

141
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,080
Why are you back?

142
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,880
I drove just now.

143
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,880
But it was raining heavily.

144
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,520
I'm worried about you.

145
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,960
The car was flooded halfway.

146
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,960
I can't drive.

147
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,280
There might be no other car on the road,

148
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,720
so you came back.

149
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,520
Why are you still as dull as when you were a kid?

150
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
Don't do this again.

151
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,320
Okay?

152
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,640
I can't promise you that.

153
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,720
Do you think you've grown up?

154
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,880
Why is it so hot?

155
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,080
You have a fever.

156
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,280
Wait a minute. I'll get you the medicine kit.

157
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,040
Here.

158
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,280
Take it.

159
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,720
An'an, it's all my fault.

160
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,040
I won't be playful anymore.

161
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,160
Please don't die.

162
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,120
OK?

163
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,000
An'an.

164
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,520
Does it still hurt?

165
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,160
It's been so long.

166
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
How can it still hurt?

167
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,280
I'm sorry, An.

168
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,840
I think of the river when I see this.

169
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
It's been so long.

170
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,280
Stop thinking about it.

171
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,480
39 degrees Celsius.

172
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,040
Here.

173
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,840
Take some medicine first.

174
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:14,840
Here.

175
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,840
It's cold.

176
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,520
I'll get you a blanket.

177
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,400
Take a nap.

178
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,040
Feeling better?

179
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,280
It's still cold.

180
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,480
I'll get you some clothes.

181
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,680
It's warmer now.

182
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Why are you still as rascal as when you were young?

183
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,800
An'an,

184
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,520
Do you remember when you were young,

185
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,680
as long as I make the cake you like,

186
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,840
you will grant me a wish.

187
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,680
You must have lost your mind.

188
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,920
You're talking nonsense.

189
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,360
Don't ask your brain.

190
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,480
Ask your heart.

191
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,280
An'an,

192
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,280
if I make your favorite cake,

193
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,160
can you be mine?

194
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,320
An'an.

195
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,760
Can you play with me for a while?

196
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,400
No, my dad told me

197
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,200
If I get the first place in this exam,

198
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,320
this year,

199
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,400
he took me to eat ice cream cake.

200
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,320
An'an,

201
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,080
why do you like cakes so much?

202
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,760
My mom said

203
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,880
you'll have cavities if you eat too much.

204
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,320
It's sweet.

205
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,640
It melts in your mouth.

206
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,040
It's delicious.

207
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,440
It makes people feel happy.

208
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,640
If only I could make

209
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,080
a cake that makes you happy.

210
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,840
In this way,

211
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,440
to study so hard.

212
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,640
Okay.

213
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,960
If you can make it,

214
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,720
I'll grant you a request.

215
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,760
Anything?

216
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,760
Of course.

217
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,840
When did I lie to you?
