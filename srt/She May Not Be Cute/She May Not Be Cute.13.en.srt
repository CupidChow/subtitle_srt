1
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,720
Anran is here

2
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Chef just went out

3
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,720
It's okay

4
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,840
I'm waiting for a friend.

5
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,080
Have a seat.

6
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,240
I'll get you a cup of coffee.

7
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,840
Louis.

8
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,160
Louis!

9
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,360
What brings you here?

10
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,840
Is there something urgent?

11
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,800
I've fulfilled the sales promise on Qixi Festival.

12
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,720
The store has also made profit in the past six months.

13
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,440
As my angel investor,

14
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,160
I'm grateful for your decision.

15
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,920
But...

16
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,120
Why does it sound like there's a but?

17
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,160
But after half a year,

18
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,040
I found that our brand concept

19
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,960
our brand concept.

20
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,280
Is it because of Xia Anran?

21
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,800
Does she know about this?

22
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,440
It's not because of her.

23
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,120
If you agree to terminate the contract,

24
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,080
I'll give you

25
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,040
of Qixi Festival this year.

26
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,160
Let me help you.

27
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,440
You don't lose anything.

28
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:18,800
Louis.

29
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,360
I'll pay you for the breach of the contract. Okay.

30
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,680
I think you know it well.

31
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,160
I'll give you five minutes to think about it.

32
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,880
If you change your mind,

33
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,640
I’ll pretend I didn’t hear anything.

34
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:35,880
Anran.

35
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,079
I just saw Louis.

36
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,440
Go to the meeting room and find Amanda.

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,800
Okay.

38
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,240
Chef, what's wrong?

39
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,360
Where is Xia Anran?

40
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,440
She's been sitting there for a long time.

41
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,600
She just left.

42
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,240
Isn't she here for me?

43
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,080
She came to see a man.

44
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,320
I'm quite familiar with the owner of this gallery.

45
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,120
If you see a suitable painting,

46
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,240
I'll ask her to give you a discount.

47
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:56,880
Okay.

48
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,720
I'll take a look.

49
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,880
You're working already?

50
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,720
Adults don't need to adapt

51
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,600
is to get used to it.

52
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,960
I think

53
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,000
you're looking for other clients.

54
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,360
The kid said

55
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,720
Think from another perspective.

56
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,160
There might be another way.

57
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,880
Did the kid contact you?

58
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,600
He just sent me a message.

59
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,520
saying, "Don't worry."

60
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,240
If he doesn't call you,

61
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,160
You should call him.

62
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,240
I...

63
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,080
You should worry about yourself.

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,040
I need to meet a client.

65
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,920
You two talk first.

66
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,920
I've calculated the portrait last time.

67
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,440
If you have time...

68
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,040
Miss Weng

69
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,040
Come here.

70
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,200
Let me introduce.

71
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,320
This is Mr. Shen Yu.

72
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,880
Miss Weng

73
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,040
your painting.

74
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,320
I bought two last time.

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,440
You guys talk.

76
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,680
I'll go greet other friends.

77
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,160
Miss Tang's art exhibition

78
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,640
is getting better.

79
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,760
Don't flatter me, big photographer.

80
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,040
I've heard a lot about you.

81
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,200
I wonder if I can make an appointment.

82
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,720
the next work of your series.

83
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,040
This group of paintings won't continue.

84
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Sorry to disappoint you

85
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,320
I'll go back to France right away.

86
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,200
There won't be any new works recently.

87
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Let the beauty in the painting stop in the painting.

88
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,600
Everything stays in the most beautiful moment.

89
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,720
Thank you.

90
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,640
I didn't expect Ms. Shen

91
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,760
is also a person who cares about money.

92
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,480
He actually came here to enjoy the scenery.

93
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,640
Do you believe

94
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,160
in this world?

95
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,760
I even believe that there are aliens in this world.

96
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,160
Love at first sight is believable.

97
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,480
Do you believe that I fell in love with you at first sight?

98
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,760
With my beauty,

99
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,040
That's normal.

100
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,320
Do you think I'm doing this because I want to?

101
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,040
There's nothing wrong with that.

102
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,200
The appearance is the most direct impact.

103
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,360
You can't expect others

104
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,040
at the first sight.

105
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,480
Besides,

106
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,040
and dopamine,

107
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
love at first sight only takes 0.3 seconds.

108
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,240
That's easy.

109
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,920
What if I want to extend

110
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,760
of 0.3 seconds?

111
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,880
What is your zodiac sign?

112
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,480
We've known each other for a long time.

113
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,760
It means we only know each other on the surface.

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,760
Twins.

115
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,320
You're a pair.

116
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,200
I'm a shooter.

117
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,920
Guess who will disappear

118
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,080
Who will disappear first?

119
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,000
How do you know without trying?

120
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,760
Aren't you going back to France before?

121
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,040
I want to wait.

122
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,880
The precious moment of fantasy

123
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,640
is fleeting.

124
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,160
I want to hold a New Year party.

125
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,480
Are you coming?

126
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,760
Okay.

127
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,039
Cheers.

128
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,919
Cheers.

129
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,480
Jia Jia.

130
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
Happy New Year.

131
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
There's a surprise.

132
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,760
Enough, stop looking.

133
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
I'll wait for him.

134
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,480
What?

135
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,720
This is the punishment for being disobedient to him.

136
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,600
Kids don't behave without training.

137
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,160
Don't look.

138
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,040
Happy New Year.

139
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,480
Come on, cheers.

140
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,760
If you want to go like this, why don't you go?

141
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,760
I've been busy these months.

142
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,040
for this moment.

143
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
I don't want to disturb her.

144
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,200
In the name of love,

145
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,640
It's all happiness

146
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,200
That's easy for you to say.

147
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,640
It's like you've got her.

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,080
She said

149
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,640
at midnight.

150
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,000
Why is Amanda here?

151
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,320
It's the festival.

152
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,440
Are they here for you?

153
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,200
I think this looks good.

154
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,680
I think so too.

155
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,440
It's really because of Xia Anran.

156
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
What's wrong with you?

157
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,520
Long time no see.

158
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,960
What's up?

159
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,960
I'm leaving.

160
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,280
Did you miss me?

161
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,080
No.

162
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,520
Hello?

163
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,760
Safe.

164
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,520
Happy New Year.

165
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,520
I was at a party near you.

166
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,080
What did you say?

167
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,520
It's too noisy here. I can't hear you.

168
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,200
I think

169
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,760
I'll come to you after you're done.

170
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,440
What are you doing?

171
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,520
Give it back!

172
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,480
You...

173
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,320
Safe.

174
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,760
The puppy has learned to play hard to get.

175
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,080
I don't know who did this to you.

176
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,760
What are you doing?

177
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,960
You have nothing to say to me?

178
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,200
I have something to tell you.

179
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,000
It's been a month.

180
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,080
What's there to talk about?

181
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,880
I told you

182
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,840
to become a man

183
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,520
to become a man who can protect you.

184
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,080
You have a long way to go.

185
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,520
I don't need your protection.

186
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,400
And you only said "Don't worry" for so long.

187
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
This is your protection.

188
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,640
So are you angry now?

189
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,520
Are you done?

190
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,520
You didn't know, did you?

191
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,080
When he was in France,

192
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,520
wherever he was,

193
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,080
he's always cold-hearted.

194
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
I didn't know.

195
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,320
He's totally different now.

196
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,640
Probably because

197
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,960
he's by her side now.

198
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,600
I won't contact you.

199
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,880
You didn't contact me either.

200
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,520
Don't contact me.

201
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:18,760
19, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4.

202
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,320
I said I have nothing to tell you.

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,880
Then stop.

204
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,280
Happy New Year.

205
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,520
Happy New Year!

206
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,200
This is our fantastic moment.

207
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,280
It's my last gift for you.

208
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,080
Jia Jia, I think

209
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,960
Let everything stay at the most beautiful moment

210
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,520
Goodbye, Leo.

211
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,840
[In a happy country of love,]

212
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,280
You're my only one

213
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,880
You're too active today.

214
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,320
I can't control myself.

215
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,760
It will appear tonight

216
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,640
in my life tonight.

217
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,400
I have a hunch.

218
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,520
A hunch?

219
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,000
I thought

220
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,080
you had interacted with her.

221
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,000
Don't be sour, baby.

222
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,440
I still love you.

223
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,080
Look at your wrinkles.

224
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
you must be thinking

225
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,960
I'll see her tonight.

226
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,520
What if she still ignores me?

227
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,400
Right?

228
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,640
I haven't seen her for a long time.

229
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,640
We're not kids anymore.

230
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,320
Be straightforward.

231
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
Who cares about

232
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,320
your complicated thoughts?

233
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,960
I don't know

234
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,880
I don't know how to tell her.

235
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,520
An'an.

236
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,080
Long time no see, An.

237
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,640
If it doesn't work,

238
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,080
say happy New Year.

239
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,640
An'an,

240
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,760
When you were young,

241
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,960
when you were young?

242
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,080
Isn't that what you're good at?

243
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,800
Don't sigh.
