1
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:36,880
What are you looking at?

2
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,880
What happened to your neck?

3
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,800
It's an old problem.

4
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,880
I slept on the sofa again these days.

5
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,039
Look at this.

6
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,400
Kids are very popular

7
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,560
They're very popular.

8
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,440
But isn't this a show to make cake?

9
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,280
It's like a romance show.

10
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,120
What did the kid do to you recently?

11
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,960
If you have time to vent your anger,

12
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,600
you should just beat him up.

13
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,280
Why are you sighing here?

14
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,079
Or because of this partner?

15
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,520
I have nothing to do with him.

16
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,560
It's been a month.

17
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,440
You really have nothing to do with each other.

18
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,480
Maybe I was too harsh.

19
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,040
High-end hunter

20
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,480
[usually appears in the way of prey.]

21
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,920
You didn't hang around in front of him.

22
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,440
The studio.

23
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,400
Dessert shop.

24
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,920
I've been wandering around everywhere.

25
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,760
What about him?

26
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,040
He said he won't disturb you.

27
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,720
You really keep your word.

28
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,200
I can see that you've been struggling.

29
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,560
One step forward and two steps back.

30
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,600
You think it's my problem too?

31
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,160
I know you well.

32
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,040
You're so stubborn.

33
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,280
Killing without blood.

34
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,400
I have a lot to tell him.

35
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,480
But I didn't even dare to send a message.

36
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,480
I'm too sober to say it.

37
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,240
Just drink

38
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,600
Modern people don't use alcohol

39
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,480
There are many things they can't say.

40
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,320
Alcohol is a shy cloth for urban men and women.

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,840
No.

42
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,480
I used to use alcohol

43
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,640
I could use alcohol as an excuse.

44
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,560
But I don't want to do this now.

45
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Maybe

46
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,640
it's time

47
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,920
our relationship.

48
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,280
Stop talking about me.

49
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,200
What about you?

50
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,760
Shen Yu has left for so long. Don't you miss him?

51
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,920
Why can he become a living person

52
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,400
when I say I miss him?

53
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,400
We're all adults

54
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,920
The peaches in your hands

55
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,640
is better than the moon in the water.

56
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,280
Right?

57
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,200
I almost forgot.

58
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,920
you were born in the Year of the Monkey too.

59
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,280
Okay, look at the camera.

60
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,480
Closer.

61
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,920
Okay.

62
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,120
Let's change another pose.

63
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,360
OK.

64
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,120
Okay, I won't move, Anran.

65
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,480
This group has finished filming.

66
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,120
There's only one pair left.

67
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,560
and Louis alone.

68
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,200
What do you think of them?

69
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,280
Their combination is so dazzling.

70
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,920
They can't leave their eyes.

71
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,640
I was thinking

72
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,120
who would date

73
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,560
Who's talking?

74
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,680
I saw Elsa's mixed blood today.

75
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,200
Beautiful and talented.

76
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,560
Okay, I'm impressed.

77
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:42,880
Fire.

78
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,560
Did you drink that coffee?

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,840
Not yet.

80
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,920
Anran,

81
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,640
They look so close.

82
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,560
Let's get ready for the next shoot.

83
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,920
Then don't forget our appointment this weekend.

84
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,920
You seem

85
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,840
you're back to your usual workaholic mode.

86
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,200
Okay.

87
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,200
I need to revise some documents when I get home.

88
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
You're still outside?

89
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,920
I was hungry from working overtime.

90
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,280
I went out to buy something.

91
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,400
Haven't you seen the news these days?

92
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,520
There are several girls

93
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,400
several girls were robbed at night.

94
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,240
Be careful and go home early.

95
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,080
Don't worry. I'll be at the door.

96
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,400
Senior.

97
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,960
Why are you here?

98
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,080
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,360
I saw you on the phone,

100
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,360
so I didn't call you.

101
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,360
I was worried when I saw the news.

102
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,360
I was just passing by.

103
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,520
So I came to see you.

104
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,360
Safe.

105
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,800
How's your neck?

106
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,480
Isn't it good?

107
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,120
Don't worry. I'm fine.

108
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,240
Go back and rest.

109
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:06,960
Anran.

110
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,280
Can we talk?

111
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,520
Come in.

112
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,200
Thank you.

113
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,800
I wanted to give you a cervical massage device.

114
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,240
I was afraid you wouldn't come to me if you took it.

115
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,680
Anran, I think...

116
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,760
Don't open it.

117
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,640
You can't take this.

118
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,800
Why?

119
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,080
I fell in love a while ago.

120
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
You should know.

121
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,480
But you are not happy.

122
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,080
Maybe you had a fight

123
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,840
or you broke up.

124
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,560
If you're not happy,

125
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,560
why don't you consider other choices?

126
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
What do you like about me?

127
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,400
Smart and independent.

128
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,560
Be strong.

129
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,240
You have good taste.

130
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,080
He knows what he wants.

131
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,080
It's fun to talk to you.

132
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,520
Also, we have great chemistry in badminton.

133
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,360
You can also find

134
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,520
can be found on others.

135
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,760
They may be more suitable than me.

136
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,920
But I think we are a good match.

137
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,240
If we don't try,

138
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,920
if I don't try?

139
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,080
You said I was strong and independent.

140
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,240
But I was afraid of getting hurt.

141
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,520
I can't trust others.

142
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,680
I also think that

143
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
I don't deserve to be loved.

144
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,640
So I've been avoiding it.

145
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,360
But now,

146
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,280
I'm sure I have someone I want to cherish.

147
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,240
Safe.

148
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,920
I know who you want to cherish.

149
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,200
But why is this person

150
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,280
not by your side now?

151
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,800
Hello, Shen Yu.

152
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,800
What?

153
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,400
I'm on my way.

154
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,960
Shen Yu.

155
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,800
What's going on?

156
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,520
Aren't you in France?

157
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,800
I came to the police station as soon as I got off the plane.

158
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,799
I don't blame the old lady for calling the police.

159
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
If I see someone...

160
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,080
wearing a mask and hat,

161
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,200
You wander around

162
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,799
in the middle of the night.

163
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,960
I'll call the police too.

164
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,799
Don't worry. They'll be out soon.

165
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,760
Don't wander around.

166
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,080
Who asked you to bring her here?

167
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,080
Why are you wandering around at night?

168
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,760
I'm worried about the news.

169
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,680
Are you worried about me?

170
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,360
She's safe.

171
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,680
Since he's out,

172
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,960
I'll take you home.

173
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,840
He sent you here?

174
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,960
We just...

175
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,040
Where are you going? My suitcase.

176
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,040
You really don't need a ride?

177
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,480
Are you on your way?

178
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,120
Leo.

179
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,520
This little brat.

180
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,200
Is your love rival's car hot?

181
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,520
You talk too much. Is it hot?

182
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,760
How can you get a taxi at the roadside?

183
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,560
Do you really want to walk home?

184
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,680
You can't. You can't.

185
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:35,960
You can't do it.

186
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
He's already in front of you.

187
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,800
You didn't say anything.

188
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,920
I have a lot to say to her.

189
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,200
But look, there's someone else beside her.

190
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,920
Then you got jealous.

191
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,240
and your brain crashed.

192
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,040
If she really has made up her mind,

193
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,600
she will come back and tell me.

194
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,240
You're still as stubborn as ever.

195
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,560
If you don't tell me, he'll run away.

196
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
Why are you walking so fast?

197
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,920
What's the use of long legs?

198
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
It's all for nothing.

199
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,800
Wait for me.

200
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,320
It seems that the person you want to cherish

201
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,680
who you want to cherish.

202
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,320
No matter he knows or not,

203
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,720
I hope

204
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,320
you can meet someone who cherishes you.

205
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,560
We're still friends, right?

206
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,920
Of course.

207
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,880
See you in the clinic.

208
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,680
in the clinic.

209
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
It's the best virtue

210
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,880
That's the first virtue of elites.

211
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,720
I'll get going then.

212
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,680
Bye.

213
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,480
Bye, senior.

214
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,360
Go back and rest early.

215
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,120
Bye.

216
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,680
Why did she add me?

217
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,480
See you here tomorrow.

218
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,680
I have something to tell you.

219
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,360
Relax.

220
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,800
Don't act like you're facing a big enemy.

221
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,560
She's just a little girl.

222
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,040
I know.

223
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,120
I'm not nervous.

224
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,880
I'm not nervous.

225
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,120
You just have to face yourself.

226
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,040
You care so much.

227
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,360
When she comes in,

228
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,680
just ask them what their relationship is.

229
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,120
An'an.

230
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,880
Have a seat.

231
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,920
An'an.

232
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,440
Little girl, if you call her here today

233
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,880
to swear to the sovereignty,

234
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,480
That's too childish.

235
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
My name is Elsa.

236
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,560
Not Little Girl.

237
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,920
Why are you looking for me?

238
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,120
Do you like Lin Hao?

239
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,120
So straightforward.

240
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,000
Why should I answer that?

241
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,240
Louis and I

242
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,000
grew up in France.

243
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,360
The domestic nickname is

244
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,120
two little friends.

245
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,000
childhood sweethearts.

246
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,720
That's what I mean.

247
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,920
If you like Lin Hao,

248
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
you should go to him.

249
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,560
I'm not interested in pure virgins.

250
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,480
Pure virgin?

251
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,240
Then why are you looking for me?

252
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,240
He likes you.

253
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,800
I've been looking forward to seeing you back.

254
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,120
But when I came back this time,

255
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,880
he didn't seem happier than before.

256
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,240
When we were shooting the magazine last time,

257
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,680
I don't think you saw him peeping at you.

258
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,680
But I saw you peeping at him.

259
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,040
I don't know what you're talking about.

260
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,920
I just want to ask you this time.

261
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,120
if you like him.

262
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,040
If you like him, I can help you.

263
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,680
She likes it.

264
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,880
She likes it so much.

265
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
I really don't understand them.

266
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,360
They care about each other,

267
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,440
It's like playing a riddle.

268
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,240
I'm so worried.

269
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,040
That's great.

270
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,480
I should've brought Louis home.

271
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,560
My brother is useless.

272
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,040
Your brother?

273
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,120
Yes.

274
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,560
My brother is Shen Yu.

275
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,680
The unreliable one.

276
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,120
You should know each other.

277
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,240
Do you know Shen Yu has a sister?

278
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,480
And this.

279
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,120
It's made in our show.

280
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,920
This dessert is very important to Louis.

281
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,560
I think it has something to do with you.

282
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,560
After all,

283
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,800
he only cares about you.

284
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
He doesn't like desserts.

285
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,360
Why don't you give him a chance

286
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,680
and give yourself a chance?

287
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,160
After all,

288
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,240
we can't always live in the shadow of the past.

289
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,360
Yes.

290
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,120
Whether you're in love or not,

291
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,480
is just like eating and sleeping.

292
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,360
Don't feel too burdened.

293
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,040
For food

294
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,360
Some food

295
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,680
shouldn't bear too much burden.

296
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,680
It's not fair to food.

297
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,560
What kind of ability is it to end it voluntarily?

298
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,720
Try is bravery.

299
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,560
I think this dessert

300
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,120
this dessert.

301
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,800
Plut.

302
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,560
This sweet taste

303
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,120
It's like the valve of emotions is opened

304
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,120
coming out of nowhere.

305
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,120
It can't be closed.

306
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,560
Are you

307
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,120
Tang Jiajia?

308
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,240
Great.

309
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,360
I finally met Rio's muse.

310
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,800
I didn't expect Rio and I

311
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,440
have been in love for more than 20 years.

312
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,560
It's not over yet.

313
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,560
You beat me in one blow.

314
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,560
Is he okay?

315
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,680
Yes.

316
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,480
He's not good at all.

317
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,800
You're killing the bad for the people.

318
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,120
He locked himself up as soon as he came home.

319
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,680
What did he say?

320
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,240
When he was serious,

321
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,920
he scared the girl away.

322
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,680
When he was not serious,

323
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,360
when he's not serious.

324
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,560
I've known him for more than 20 years.

325
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,680
I've never seen him so serious.

326
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,640
It's like he's evolved into a human.
