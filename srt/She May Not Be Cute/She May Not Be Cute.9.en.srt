1
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:19,880
An'an.

2
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:20,760
An'an.

3
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,039
Can you hear me?

4
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,800
An'an.

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,240
I just have a stomachache.

6
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,600
I'm not dead.

7
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,360
Okay?

8
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,320
Let me press here.

9
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,800
Tell me if it hurts.

10
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,720
No, no, no.

11
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,160
According to the test results,

12
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,320
this is acute appendicitis.

13
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,400
It's dangerous.

14
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,800
We'll do the surgery right away.

15
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,320
Surgery?

16
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,479
No.

17
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,640
I can't do it.

18
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,960
I have to work tomorrow.

19
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,120
Can you treat me conservative?

20
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,440
No, you're in danger of perforation.

21
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,400
You have to get surgery right away.

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,440
Why are you everywhere?

23
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,280
I'm a doctor here.

24
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,280
He's my classmate.

25
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
No surgery.

26
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Listen to the doctor.

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,120
You taught me that.

28
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,720
How did you two reach an agreement?

29
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,600
By the way,

30
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,200
don't tell my mom.

31
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,600
Don't let her worry.

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,440
Are you suspecting

33
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,079
the mastermind behind the excessive marketing?

34
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,079
It's Amanda.

35
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:31,840
Yes.

36
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,720
When I saw her reaction,

37
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,040
I knew it.

38
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,600
I rejected her

39
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,720
but I turned her down.

40
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,200
But I have to thank her.

41
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,160
If it weren't for her,

42
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,800
I wouldn't know how much she cares about me.

43
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,079
How?

44
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,120
For my younger brother,

45
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,120
For clients

46
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,720
or to men?

47
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,720
Louis, you're in danger.

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,960
Women are complicated.

49
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,720
How can I go back to France?

50
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,480
You never bring anyone back to your studio.

51
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,120
You didn't come back to France

52
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,240
not for me.

53
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,200
Don't be jealous.

54
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,240
Okay, I'm hanging up.

55
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,560
I didn't expect the elegant Leo

56
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
has this side.

57
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,760
What would you like to drink?

58
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,520
Coffee.

59
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,120
Wine.

60
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,000
It's me.

61
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,160
Coffee.

62
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,720
I'm here to talk about work.

63
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,880
I need to come to my senses.

64
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,320
Here.

65
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,960
I've seen it in a museum in Herrick.

66
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,360
This one is a little different from the one in the museum.

67
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,160
I know craftsmen.

68
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,600
I made it there.

69
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,880
This ancient vase

70
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,440
I have one at home too.

71
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,079
It's

72
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,720
Leon's Middle-Ancient Store.

73
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,600
Yes

74
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,640
There was a pair in the shop.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,720
I bought one because it was too neat.

76
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,240
But you bought the other one.

77
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,160
It seems that the whole world is your market.

78
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,520
The conclusion is wrong.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,720
You should say

80
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,000
It seems

81
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,440
we passed by each other's lives.

82
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,600
Coffee.

83
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
I'm just passing by.

84
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,720
Right?

85
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,720
The paintings you gave me last time

86
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,800
has been sold.

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,360
I'm here to sign a long contract with you.

88
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,520
I'm not greedy.

89
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
As long as Huadong exclusive,

90
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,600
the commission can be reduced.

91
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,880
Name your price.

92
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,600
Just passing by is enough, right?

93
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,440
You can pick any three over there.

94
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,720
You have three choices

95
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,000
to choose first.

96
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,240
But as usual,

97
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,880
The price is up to me.

98
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,520
Deal.

99
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,240
Don't move.

100
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,720
Turn your right shoulder a little more.

101
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,440
You've seen it, haven't you?

102
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,160
I know you don't care about it.

103
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,360
I don't care, but I don't really like it.

104
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,440
Do you remember the first time we met?

105
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,440
Why? You want to bargain?

106
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,800
You know your charm.

107
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,360
You enjoy unleashing wild and desire.

108
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,480
and your eyes are free.

109
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,640
You are

110
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,159
very charming.

111
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,000
Done.

112
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,760
I'm very satisfied

113
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,320
I'm very satisfied.

114
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,480
You said you wanted to stay sober.

115
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,600
I'm out of willpower.

116
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,600
Now,

117
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,760
Let's do something crazy.

118
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,880
I want to be discharged.

119
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,040
No.

120
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,000
This is my best friend.

121
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,040
and my guardian.

122
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,200
She picked me up from the hospital.

123
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,040
Anran.

124
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,480
Your wound is not healed yet.

125
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,760
You'd better not leave the hospital.

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,760
Dr Ding is right.

127
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,480
Who can tell me

128
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,320
when

129
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,200
start wearing the same pants?

130
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,320
Your friend is my friend.

131
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,320
Your brother is my brother.

132
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,040
I haven't seen you for days.

133
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,480
Not only are you blossoming,

134
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,640
but also blooms everywhere.

135
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,200
Sister, I'm here to ask you for help.

136
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,040
not to make fun of me.

137
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,200
You want juice? Fresh.

138
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,320
Gosh.

139
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,480
Are you a doctor?

140
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,480
Keep it here.

141
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,200
You are her brother.

142
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,159
Keep it.

143
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,000
No.

144
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,040
Nurse, can I take a shower today?

145
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,200
Not today.

146
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,760
If you don't feel well,

147
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,320
let your family

148
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,480
wipe it with a towel.

149
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,320
Let me do it.

150
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,760
Anan, don't you feel lonely

151
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,920
when you're alone?

152
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,320
Are they not lonely when they're together?

153
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,000
Dating

154
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,480
or get married,

155
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,080
no matter how passionate the beginning is,

156
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,200
it's just a game

157
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,320
in the valid period.

158
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,320
Once the passion dissipates,

159
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,000
one will be betrayed.

160
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
No, An.

161
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,320
You will meet someone

162
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,280
who loves you wholeheartedly.

163
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,640
No, I don't want to.

164
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,200
And I can't.

165
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,880
If I can't escape betrayal in the end,

166
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,920
why should I

167
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,040
make a bet

168
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,480
that is destined to fail.

169
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,040
Lin Hao.

170
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,320
I'll do the rest myself.

171
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,880
Okay.

172
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,440
How can I

173
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,760
to make you believe again?

174
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,480
A broken bird

175
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,760
can fly?

176
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,600
I'll get you a basin of water.

177
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,880
I'll wipe your hair later.

178
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,040
Don't catch a cold.

179
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,520
Louis's pages are so dazzling.

180
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,960
The interview and dessert.

181
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,080
I can't wait to buy all of them at his shop.

182
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,520
I'm so hungry.

183
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,640
Louis Lin?

184
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,880
The popularity will rise soon, right?

185
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,560
Yes.

186
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,640
Who would refuse a handsome dessert chef?

187
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,760
It has to be Anran.

188
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,000
proposed to design

189
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,960
to design the French version and Chinese version double cover.

190
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,520
Great.

191
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
It combines French romance

192
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,080
and explained to foreigners

193
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,640
the romantic story of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl.

194
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,440
and the new product effect of Louis

195
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,000
is more than 100.

196
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,200
I wonder

197
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,320
has recovered.

198
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
Wait for her.

199
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,840
After this episode,

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,280
our new editor-in-chief

201
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,400
must have run away.

202
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,080
Yes. Great. Yeah.

203
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,080
Looks like Mr. Lin doesn't need me anymore.

204
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,280
The rise in the short term is just the influence of marketing.

205
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,520
What I need to do is to seize this opportunity

206
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,840
and let French sweets grow into every customer's heart.

207
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,080
Can't you plant me in your heart?

208
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,640
Can't you say you don't want to leave me?

209
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,880
I can consider not going back to France.

210
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,640
No, no, no.

211
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,640
I'll call a taxi for you if you want to leave.

212
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,200
I'm serious.

213
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,320
What do you think

214
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,080
I don't go back to France?

215
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,200
It's good.

216
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,440
Your master and your sister

217
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,880
and your sister.

218
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,840
I met my muse.

219
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,400
The girl you brought back to the studio that day.

220
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,280
Why didn't you

221
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,560
with her today?

222
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,960
She said she would never date on holidays.

223
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
That's her principle.

224
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,880
She's really special.

225
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,880
You don't understand.

226
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,080
Fine.

227
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,280
For the sake of your help,

228
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,080
if you promise me ten more requests,

229
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,080
I'll consider talking to them for you.

230
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,280
Ten.

231
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,760
Are you taking advantage of me?

232
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,960
Have you forgotten how I helped you?

233
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,880
You'll be back in France soon.

234
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,640
You have to work hard.

235
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,680
I really have something urgent to do today.

236
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,920
She's at home alone.

237
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,760
I'll go back now.

238
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,400
Bye.

239
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,200
I'm alone too.

240
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,520
You just finished work?

241
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,080
Business is good today.

242
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,400
An'an,

243
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,840
I have something important to tell you.

244
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,320
What is it?

245
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,000
One year, I went to the Seine River

246
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,400
I saw the rose emergency box.

247
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,440
It says on the box that if you meet love,

248
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,200
please tear the protective film down.

249
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,640
Say love bravely.

250
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,000
Then I saw passersby.

251
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,400
They hugged each other tightly.

252
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,200
It was cold that winter.

253
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,640
But their love seemed to melt everything.

254
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,080
Are you going to

255
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,200
take out a rose now?

256
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,000
Please don't.

257
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,840
I'm allergic to romance.

258
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,320
An,

259
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,520
I'm really grateful

260
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,280
for everything you've done for me.

261
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,400
If possible,

262
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
You don't have to thank me.

263
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
I'm not doing this for you.

264
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,440
You need juice. Fresh juice.

265
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,440
Gosh.

266
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,440
This sweet and tea little stray cat.

267
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,840
Why have you been slack lately?

268
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,080
I was defeated by the doctor brother.

269
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,640
The situation is a bit chaotic.

270
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,840
I really don't understand.

271
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,640
but I'm excited.

272
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,200
I'm worried about you.

273
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,440
Worried about what?

274
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,000
How can you choose

275
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What will you choose?

276
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,480
What choice?

277
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,960
Dr Ding and I are just friends.

278
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,000
Look.

279
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,320
You've already chosen.

280
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,200
Yes.

281
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,520
You know the most.

282
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,520
If a stray cat

283
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,520
If I confess to you now,

284
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,440
what would you do?

285
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,520
Never.

286
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,400
The way you are now

287
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,080
reminds me of a line.

288
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,520
A liar should swallow 1,000 needles.

289
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,880
If I hadn't seen you

290
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,000
you were moving,

291
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,320
I almost believed it.

292
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,440
Do you want some?

293
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,640
Look.

294
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,520
Even if everything is ready

295
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,640
as long as you don't reach out,

296
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,440
it's hard for you to get an apple.

297
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,240
Right?
