1
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,920
People say love is like tofu

2
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,360
is like tofu.

3
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,920
Some say love is like preservatives

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,039
forever reserved.

5
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,560
Who are you?

6
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,240
Last night, we were...

7
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:21,960
We...

8
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,640
Have you forgotten?

9
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,480
I...

10
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,920
You're the one at the cocktail party last night?

11
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,400
How did you get in?

12
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,079
You didn't have to drag me last night.

13
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm going back now.

14
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,000
Take it off.

15
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,040
Sleep in wet clothes

16
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,960
You'll catch a cold.

17
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,440
How could I pull you?

18
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,240
Maybe I should introduce myself.

19
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
No, you don't have to.

20
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,040
I don't want to know you.

21
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,320
Get dressed and leave now.

22
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,480
Wait.

23
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,600
Hello.

24
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,240
Xia Anran, you've grown up.

25
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,120
How dare you hang up on me?

26
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,880
Open the door!

27
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,520
Which door should I open?

28
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,680
Which door?

29
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,880
Is the door of your heart...

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,520
I...

31
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,760
You go to the toilet.

32
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,320
Now?

33
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,520
Okay, don't come out.

34
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,640
Clothes.

35
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,320
It's safe.

36
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,320
What took you so long?

37
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,600
Hey.

38
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,520
Aren't you going to sleep?

39
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,399
Where are my slippers?

40
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,880
I washed them.

41
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Did you eat cake?

42
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,120
I thought you don't eat cake.

43
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,320
It was my birthday yesterday.

44
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,320
My colleague gave it to me.

45
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,520
You marinated the wine jar last night.

46
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
You reek of alcohol more than me.

47
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,120
I'm sleepy.

48
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,240
I'll lie down on your bed.

49
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,960
Don't mind me.

50
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,800
Jia Jia.

51
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,240
Jia Jia.

52
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,840
Let's have breakfast.

53
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,680
You never eat breakfast.

54
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,440
I really want to have breakfast today.

55
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,120
Let's go.

56
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,360
Let's go.

57
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,000
I washed my slippers.

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,920
I got it wrong.

59
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,360
Something's wrong with you.

60
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
No.

61
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,560
I drank too much yesterday.

62
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,200
180 shirt.

63
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,200
This isn't yours, right?

64
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
It's mine.

65
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,000
Boyfriend style is popular these days.

66
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,080
Let's have breakfast.

67
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,200
No wonder you were so slow.

68
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,720
The balcony.

69
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,840
Under the bed.

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,560
Wardrobe.

71
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,120
Toilet.

72
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,360
Jia Jia.

73
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,159
Why isn't there anyone?

74
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,200
I told you no one is here.

75
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,040
Where did you hide it?

76
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,480
Wash your hands first.

77
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,720
I'll treat you to a spa later.

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,159
Let me see.

79
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,159
Is he a doctor?

80
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,160
No.

81
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,000
I think I took in a stray cat last night.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,440
I don't know where it is now.

83
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,040
It's wild.

84
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,640
Is the stray cat handsome?

85
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Get out.

86
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,280
Let me see.

87
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,040
Right away.

88
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,480
Open the door!

89
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Open the door!

90
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,640
You said you wanted to treat me to a spa.

91
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,480
I had fun last night.

92
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,600
I look forward to seeing you again.

93
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,520
Anran,

94
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,280
Our new magazine, Heart Q.

95
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,400
I want to invite Louis.

96
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,080
Louis Lin is the best French dessert chef.

97
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,560
The only Chinese disciple.

98
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,400
has just won

99
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,800
for the dessert festival.

100
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,040
There are no photos of him online.

101
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,520
characteristics.

102
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:38,760
A man.

103
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:39,920
It's alive.

104
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:40,720
No.

105
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,000
Anran, thanks to you for the cover last time.

106
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,159
Please come to the movie premiere.

107
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,760
Louis.

108
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,840
It's almost ready.

109
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,240
I'll leave first.

110
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,360
Keep an eye on it for me.

111
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,640
In return,

112
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,520
I'll make you a drink.

113
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,520
It must be strong.

114
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,360
You must like it.

115
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
I've waited for ten years.

116
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,120
Can't you wait for this night?

117
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,120
If you hadn't said the cocktail party was important,

118
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,560
I would have met her now.

119
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,080
Are you ready?

120
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,400
I prepared this for her myself.

121
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,520
She will like it.

122
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,800
I'm asking

123
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,840
Are you ready to...

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,560
Can you stop being so mean?

125
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,560
No, no, no.

126
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,440
Being a playboy

127
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,480
is my bottom line.

128
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,480
The birthday gift I bought for you is in the car.

129
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,440
I'll pick it up in the car.

130
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,040
I'll be right back.

131
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,160
Lu...

132
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,159
Safe.

133
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,480
It's really you.

134
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,040
At least let me explain what happened at the wedding.

135
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
Actually, it's been so long.

136
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,800
No need to explain.

137
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:40,920
It's safe.

138
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,680
I really regret it.

139
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,680
If I wasn't working now,

140
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,000
you would regret it more.

141
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,040
Safe.

142
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,480
We're married after all.

143
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,680
We didn't get the marriage certificate.

144
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,440
Don't flatter yourself.

145
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,000
Safe.

146
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,040
Are you okay?

147
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,360
Who are you?

148
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,040
It's none of your business.

149
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,680
Let go of me.

150
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,600
Safe.

151
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,480
After this,

152
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,360
I'll wait for you at the door.

153
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,320
Thanks.

154
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,240
Drink it. Drink it.

155
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,480
Drink.

156
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,200
To be honest, if I hadn't not known you,

157
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,640
I wouldn't have gone with you.

158
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,960
What do you mean?

159
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,200
I won't let anyone I know

160
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,640
see my embarrassment.

161
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,880
Then

162
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,840
be strangers for one night.

163
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,800
Have you ever heard

164
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Don't drink more than six minutes drunk.

165
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,920
Don't eat more than 70% full.

166
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,720
Don't love someone more than eight points.

167
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,280
What if it exceeds 8?

168
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,720
Then you'll lose yourself.

169
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,400
That person became your whole world.

170
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,520
If you get betrayed,

171
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,520
your whole world will collapse.

172
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,960
Trust me.

173
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,640
You will meet someone who loves you and understands you.

174
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,400
Is there really someone like that?

175
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,640
Look.

176
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,720
Meteor.

177
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,040
Make a wish.

178
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,960
Aren't you going to make a wish?

179
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,360
I stopped doing this ten years ago.

180
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,160
Why didn't you ask

181
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,160
what my wish is?

182
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,200
I'm not interested in other people's privacy.

183
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,320
I have only one wish

184
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,480
since ten years ago.

185
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,480
An'an.

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,040
Jiajia, wait for me at the spa.

187
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,560
An'an.

188
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,480
Wait.

189
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,840
Be careful next time.

190
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,440
My foot is cramping.

191
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,160
Are you okay?

192
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,440
My leg is cramping.

193
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,320
Are you okay?

194
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,440
My foot is cramping.

195
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,000
You have to stretch well before going into the water.

196
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,440
Adjust to the water temperature a little bit more.

197
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,160
Don't be so anxious in the future.

198
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,160
If you don't explain,

199
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,560
I'll suspect that you've been peeping at me.

200
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,000
I learned some massage before.

201
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,760
Can I?

202
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,720
I won't pay.

203
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Hello?

204
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,680
Hello.

205
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,600
Hello.

206
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,760
It's you.

207
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,280
An'an.

208
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,520
Why did you climb so high?

209
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,080
Because the top is closest to the stars.

210
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,400
There's a meteor shower today.

211
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,600
Make a wish to the meteor shower.

212
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,960
It works. It works.

213
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,760
Wish Lin Hao

214
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,320
May Xia be safe.

215
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,640
Happy birthday.

216
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,400
Coming.

217
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,040
Make a wish.
