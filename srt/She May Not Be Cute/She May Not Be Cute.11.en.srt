1
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,320
Hello. Hello.

2
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,120
Why are you here?

3
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,440
How can I be absent?

4
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,800
Where are you going?

5
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,360
You'll know when we get there.

6
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,920
Let's go.

7
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,000
Wait.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,920
I have a friend who hasn't come yet.

9
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:39,640
Hello.

10
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,479
What took you so long, Leo?

11
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,960
We've been waiting for you.

12
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,720
What a coincidence.

13
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,280
What coincidence?

14
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,440
I mean on the day off,

15
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,759
we can have such a car.

16
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,720
What a coincidence.

17
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,440
Let's go while there are not many people on the road.

18
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,400
Let's go.

19
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,280
Jia.

20
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,880
Let me introduce.

21
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,200
This is my best friend Leo

22
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,240
in France.

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,400
Leo, what's wrong?

24
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,520
You're so quiet today.

25
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,440
This is not your style.

26
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,200
Jia.

27
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,480
Last night,

28
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
I wanted to invite Leo

29
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,760
to our party.

30
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,360
I think you two will be friends at first sight.

31
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,480
You will meet each other eventually, right?

32
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,760
By the way, Tang Jiajia is also my best friend.

33
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,440
She runs a private gallery.

34
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,680
Leo is also a painter and a designer.

35
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,079
Then you two must have a common language.

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,800
We're just private galleries.

37
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,480
The popular teacher

38
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,440
doesn't match us.

39
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,000
How did you know

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,360
I'm popular?

41
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,080
I can tell.

42
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,800
It seems that you are interested in me.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,480
I have a wide interest,

44
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,400
but my passion is limited.

45
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,120
I won't touch

46
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,000
I won't touch it.

47
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,600
Take a nap.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,600
I'll call you when we arrive.

49
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,160
Hello?

50
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,520
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,079
I forgot to reply to your messages these days.

52
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,280
What did my mom do to you?

53
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,079
Not at all.

54
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,680
You're so cute.

55
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,000
Right.

56
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,960
They have a meeting today.

57
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,240
Let's play basketball tonight.

58
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't think I can go home today.

59
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,720
Next time.

60
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,000
My friends who are playing today

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
are headhunters.

62
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,800
I wanted to introduce you to each other.

63
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,360
Later.

64
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,800
I want to take a break recently.

65
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,600
An'an.

66
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,800
Catch it.

67
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,120
What is it, Lin Hao?

68
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,600
I'll talk to you later.

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,240
Bye.

70
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,520
What?

71
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,440
Try it.

72
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,960
Try it.

73
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,000
Try it.

74
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,159
Try it.

75
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,800
You...

76
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,159
Come here.

77
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,080
You eat.

78
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,320
It's a trick of a couple.

79
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,000
Aren't you on a business trip?

80
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,360
Just kidding.

81
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,240
You don't even have an excuse now.

82
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,000
It's boring to be too honest.

83
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,600
My legs are cramping.

84
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,160
What's wrong?

85
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,000
What's wrong?

86
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,159
Jia Jia.

87
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,200
Listen to me.

88
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,480
That was just a friend.

89
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,360
Go in.

90
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,000
What are you doing? Give it back.

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,480
Hurry up.

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,640
I didn't know you were so childish.

93
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,880
What's wrong?

94
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,200
Someone suddenly ignored me

95
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,320
and pretend not to know each other,

96
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,200
That's not childish.

97
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,760
I'm sad.

98
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,160
Shen Yu.

99
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,760
I thought we were the same kind.

100
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,320
As long as you're happy, there's no result.

101
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,200
If you like to play love,

102
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,480
You can find another girl.

103
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,640
I'm tired of this style.

104
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,000
You're not.

105
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,640
You're afraid.

106
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,720
I was afraid

107
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,320
I ran away.

108
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,480
Yes.

109
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,760
I'm scared.

110
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,640
I'm scared of you.

111
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Let me take responsibility.

112
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,320
Don't push.

113
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,320
Good for you.

114
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,200
You can graduate now.

115
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,480
It's you, Tang Jiajia.

116
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
You two

117
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,920
you two haven't met for the first time.

118
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
We met at work.

119
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,600
I'm sad when you say that.

120
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,160
I thought we had deep communication.

121
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,480
You...

122
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,320
Yes.

123
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,600
After deep communication,

124
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,760
they are not the same kind.

125
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,760
I think they still have a hard time.

126
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,480
They almost kissed just now.

127
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,760
We're adults.

128
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,159
It's just a kiss.

129
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,320
Kiss me now.

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,600
I'll prove your innocence.

131
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,040
What are you doing?

132
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,200
Wash yourself first.

133
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,200
Did we kiss in the car?

134
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
No way.

135
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,600
It's over if I kiss you.

136
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,880
I know you well.

137
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,720
Just kidding.

138
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,240
Do you feel better now?

139
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,480
Today

140
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,920
for the whole day.

141
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,480
When I was fooling around with you,

142
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,480
I thought it's good not to think about work.

143
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,040
Did you think

144
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,640
the world can't turn without you?

145
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,000
Am I too self-righteous?

146
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,640
Look at me.

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,120
You should be unreasonable.

148
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,200
The earth won't

149
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,600
It explodes because I'm picky.

150
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,760
It's better to go crazy than internal consumption.

151
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:19,920
Okay.

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,880
Let me understand.

153
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,040
During this period,

154
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,040
take a good rest and don't think about anything.

155
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,320
What's the use of hiding for a while?

156
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,640
I can't disappear completely.

157
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,039
You're an adult. Don't make dangerous remarks.

158
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,159
Cheers.

159
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,039
Cheers.

160
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,600
Cheers.

161
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,159
Cheers.

162
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,039
Cheers.

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,760
What are you guys?

164
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,160
10:30.

165
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:49,920
Drink it.

166
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,920
Awesome.

167
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,200
Half

168
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,480
A little.

169
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,320
One bite.

170
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,760
Two bites.

171
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,640
Three bites.

172
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,200
Four.

173
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,320
Five.

174
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,320
Six.

175
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,760
Seven.

176
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,880
Ten.

177
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,000
Fifteen.

178
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,800
Stop dawdling.

179
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,040
Fifteen bites.

180
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,760
Finished.

181
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,480
10:30.

182
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,480
A bottle of beer.

183
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,040
If you don't want to drink,

184
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Truth or Dare.

185
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:31,920
OK.

186
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,880
OK.

187
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,200
Dare.

188
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
Why don't you two kiss?

189
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,080
I'll drink.

190
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,760
Boring.

191
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,520
Banana.

192
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,520
Here.

193
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,000
It hurts.

194
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,880
What did I say?

195
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,640
You're slow, aren't you?

196
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,320
I'll get you an ice bag.

197
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,320
I'll go with him.

198
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,520
Where are we going?

199
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,440
We should be able to get the ice pack when we go back to the guesthouse.

200
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,000
What ice pack?

201
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,440
The atmosphere just now

202
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,320
I didn't see it.

203
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,960
They're acting weird all day.

204
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
Leo has always been weird.

205
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
You'll get used to it.

206
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,880
You're right.

207
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,400
It’s Jia Jia’s style

208
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,440
is also Jiajia's style.

209
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:03,880
An'an,

210
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,640
Why don't you take an ice bag?

211
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,680
He's gone.

212
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,480
I can't reach her.

213
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,160
What did she say today?

214
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,280
What's the use of hiding?

215
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,600
She can't disappear completely.

216
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,680
Is she thinking too much?

217
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,000
An'an.

218
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,920
Xia Anran.

219
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,840
Lin Hao.

220
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,360
Are you okay?

221
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,600
What are you doing?

222
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,920
Aren't you afraid of water?

223
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,040
Why are you still in the water?

224
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,160
But I'm more worried about you.

225
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,040
Next time when you want to escape from the world,

226
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
can you take me with you?

227
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,840
Don't leave me alone.

228
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,840
What are you talking about?

229
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,720
Sister Jia Jia told me that you wanted to disappear.

230
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,280
How can I not be scared?

231
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,600
Listen to her nonsense.

232
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,680
If I hadn't come back for my phone,

233
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,600
you would have rushed into the lake.

234
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,360
Look.

235
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,920
What is this?

236
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,840
Fireflies.

237
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,840
You used to pester me to catch fireflies.

238
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,040
But your fatty hands can never catch it.

239
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,880
Yes.

240
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,000
I remember every time I catch fireflies,

241
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,160
every time I catch fireflies.

242
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,600
to attract the mosquito's fire.

243
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,280
But the firefly caught it.

244
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,400
My head was stung like a pig's head.

245
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,600
I was scolded by my parents when I went back.

246
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,720
An'an,

247
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Are you happy today?

248
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,920
I used to

249
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,160
on others.

250
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,240
and even at work.

251
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,120
I always lost everything

252
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,480
for this so-called sense of security.

253
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,800
But today, when I let go of my worries

254
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,720
and played with you,

255
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,040
I found that I was happy.

256
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,040
I should have treated myself better.

257
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,840
Be honest to yourself.

258
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,280
Lin Hao.

259
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,480
I'm very happy today. Thank you.

260
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,040
Then...

261
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,520
I want to be honest too.

262
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,720
An'an,

263
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,600
I like you.

264
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
When I was ten,

265
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,240
I made a wish.

266
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
When I grow up,

267
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,040
I'll marry the bride of An An Pawnshop.

268
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,360
Making a wish is a lie.

269
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,720
I don't want to be a bride.

270
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,160
I'll never get married.

271
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,280
An'an.

272
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,920
As expected,

273
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,840
My wish is like a candle.

274
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,480
Blow it out
