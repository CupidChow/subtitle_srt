1
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,640
Good morning.

2
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,520
It's time to eat. It's time to eat. It's time to eat.

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,080
It's been days.

4
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,920
It's been a long time.

5
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,440
You've searched all the breakfast restaurants in the city.

6
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,080
Are you that afraid of being rejected by me?

7
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,440
Anyway,

8
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,520
you promised me for a month.

9
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,960
People say it takes 21 days

10
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,800
it takes 21 days.

11
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,800
I'll work hard until the last hour.

12
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,440
Good luck.

13
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,960
By the way,

14
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,000
I haven't seen you play the piano

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,840
but you never played it.

16
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,200
Can you play it?

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,800
No.

18
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
I haven't played it for a long time.

19
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,880
Why are you here?

20
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,079
Don't move.

21
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,800
Let me hold you for a while.

22
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,600
I haven't slept well for two days.

23
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,600
No, they'll be dead if they see us.

24
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Don't worry.

25
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
Two moms went to the market to buy groceries.

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,840
They won't be back soon.

27
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,840
Good for you.

28
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,200
You're brave and resourceful now.

29
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,200
Do you like me?

30
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,520
Do you like me?

31
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,560
What do you think?

32
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,520
Why don't we just tell them?

33
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,000
Why don't we keep a low profile?

34
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,560
They're always sneaky.

35
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,080
They will know sooner or later.

36
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,200
They can't accept it.

37
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,160
And my mom has high blood pressure.

38
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,600
What if she gets scared?

39
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,920
Besides,

40
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
we're in a relationship.

41
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,240
It's good that we know each other.

42
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,800
Some things only count when you tell them.

43
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,040
It's raining.

44
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,079
They're closed.

45
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,320
Come on.

46
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,400
Yeah, let's go another day.

47
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,240
Okay.

48
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,079
They're back.

49
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,240
I'll go get breakfast.

50
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,159
Have you watched enough?

51
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,440
The movie just started half an hour ago.

52
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,080
I mean, are you watching me or the movie?

53
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,400
You...

54
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,600
An'an,

55
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,520
Do you have any inspiration

56
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,720
Do you have any inspiration?

57
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,720
What inspiration?

58
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,320
We've been together for so long.

59
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,080
you haven't told me that you like me.

60
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,240
Is that important?

61
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,520
Can't you feel it?

62
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,080
But I want to hear it from you.

63
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,400
How about this?

64
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,440
You said you'd welcome me.

65
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,080
How long have I been back?

66
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,440
You still want me to eat this?

67
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,080
That's good enough.

68
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,960
Cut the crap.

69
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,440
Leo, are you looking for an excuse

70
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
to ask Tang Jiajia out?

71
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,720
Your progress is not good.

72
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,240
Look at Louis.

73
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,440
They grew up together.

74
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,320
It's perfectly justifiable.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,440
I'm from the west.

76
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,280
It's hard.

77
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,800
What justifiable?

78
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,320
What justification do I have now?

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,320
What's wrong?

80
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,240
Is there a problem?

81
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,560
It's because I've been troubled

82
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,240
you need me to help you.

83
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,080
Are moms here

84
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,120
because the moms are here?

85
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,680
You're always hiding.

86
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't know

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,440
if we are dating now.

88
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,880
What’s wrong, Lin?

89
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,280
This is typical love syndrome.

90
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,560
Worried about gains and losses.

91
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,680
Cheers.

92
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,800
Let me tell you a secret.

93
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,680
My brother can do anything in life.

94
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,560
When it comes to painting,

95
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,800
he has strong principles.

96
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,159
He said he never drew a woman's portrait.

97
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,680
Not even me.

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,800
Do you remember

99
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,960
the portrait I gave you last time?

100
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,240
I gave you.

101
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,240
I promised to do chores for half a month,

102
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,320
That's why he agreed to help me.

103
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,280
He hasn't signed it yet.

104
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,000
Since he was a professional painter,

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,280
he has this rule.

106
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,720
He said the portrait he drew in his life

107
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,240
must be the woman he loves the most.

108
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,840
He said that after he died,

109
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,120
after he died.

110
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,240
as a legacy, right?

111
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,000
I laughed at him for a long time because of this.

112
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,680
You think you're Monet?

113
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,440
Why Mona?

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,280
Because all his portraits

115
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,880
is his wife, Kamil.

116
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,600
He doesn't even have a heart.

117
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,320
What muse is a lie?

118
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,600
I remember.

119
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,800
He drew a woman.

120
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,240
There's a butterfly on his neck.

121
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,080
Don't talk nonsense if you don't understand.

122
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,080
Muse.

123
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,080
Where are you?

124
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,240
In a dream, right?

125
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,560
Look at him.

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,960
if there was such a person,

127
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,159
the painting would have been sent out long ago.

128
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,560
Why put it in the studio?

129
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,680
for so long?

130
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,720
as a treasure?

131
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,240
I see.

132
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,320
Did she reject you?

133
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,240
You've never been in a relationship.

134
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,400
Do you know what true love is?

135
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,600
Fine.

136
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,960
I don't understand you people.

137
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,080
are not afraid of exposing your true feelings.

138
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,560
I'm just afraid that if I take it out,

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,120
I don't know what disease it is.

140
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,600
There's a table tennis next to it.

141
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,520
Who wants to play a game with me?

142
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,320
I'll go.

143
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,960
I didn't expect you to be so good.

144
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,320
I didn't expect you

145
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,960
to give me a chance.

146
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,520
Playing billiard is quite similar to dating.

147
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,720
The more you care about it,

148
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,560
The harder you try,

149
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,720
the more you can't win.

150
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,160
It seems

151
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,200
Louis is telling the truth.

152
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,600
If you love someone too much,

153
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,080
you won't be confident enough.

154
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,360
You don't know me at all.

155
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,920
I want to know you.

156
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,320
I want to know what breakfast you like.

157
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,920
Take your time.

158
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,560
You don't need my permission to like me.

159
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,760
You can't make it, but you're hiding my ball.

160
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,640
You're cheating.

161
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,200
Don't you like games?

162
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,640
Before the game is over,

163
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,480
I still have a chance to make you fall in love with me.

164
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
What's the use of delaying?

165
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,400
There's always a next round after this.

166
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,760
A momentary impulse stimulating desire.

167
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,040
How do you know?

168
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,320
After the end,

169
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,600
It's just the beginning.

170
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,320
Passing up the mess with passion?

171
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,520
I'm not interested.

172
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,880
You're double-faced.

173
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,320
You can't fool someone who really loves you.

174
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,280
Am I that special to you?

175
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,280
You don't even know

176
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,480
Was it impulsive?

177
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,520
What are you looking at?

178
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,080
I have some work to do.

179
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,600
Enjoy yourselves.

180
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,640
I'll give you a ride.

181
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,520
Did you drink?

182
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,320
Who's giving you a ride?

183
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,640
I didn't drink. Let me give you a ride.

184
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,640
She will.

185
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
Okay, let's go.

186
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,200
Let's go.

187
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,160
Drive slowly.

188
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,080
Be careful.

189
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,880
Okay.

190
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,520
Tell me when you arrive.

191
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:33,840
Okay.

192
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
I'm leaving. Bye.

193
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,640
Let's go.

194
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,040
Don't worry.

195
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,600
Thank you.

196
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,400
It's okay.

197
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,760
Look.

198
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,160
Lin Hao

199
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,200
sent me more than 100 messages

200
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,480
and asked me to drive slowly.

201
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,880
I'm afraid something might happen to you.

202
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,160
Look.

203
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
He's making a fuss.

204
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Did you tell him that you like him?

205
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,040
Since I was young,

206
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,880
since I was a kid.

207
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,880
We get to know each other again.

208
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,360
Is it so hard to say that?

209
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,440
These three words

210
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,040
to me.

211
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
Once you say it,

212
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,440
you have to be responsible for that.

213
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,360
Or don't say it so easily.

214
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,160
It's not that serious.

215
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,000
No one can guarantee that I love you forever.

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,880
I like you.

217
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,880
It's just how I feel right now.

218
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,720
I'm not asking you to sign a contract.

219
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,040
To accept someone passively

220
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,480
and love someone.

221
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,880
to love someone.

222
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,040
If you really care about him,

223
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,360
you should tell him your feelings.

224
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,040
right?

225
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,000
Don't open the door.

226
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,120
I have something to tell you.

227
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,360
An'an,

228
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,920
Why don't you come in first?

229
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,800
Don't interrupt me.

230
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
I'm afraid I can't say it if I see you.

231
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,920
It's about the question you asked me before.

232
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,480
I didn't dare to say those words before.

233
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,120
I think

234
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,440
is a very important promise.

235
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,480
At first, I was afraid

236
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,480
you had unrealistic fantasies.

237
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,720
That's why I'm being harsh.

238
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,000
and pushed you away.

239
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,440
but it's all because I'm scared.

240
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,880
An,

241
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,440
I'm afraid you'll regret it.

242
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,320
I don't regret it.

243
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,240
Now I know

244
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,440
I'm really happy to be with you.

245
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,560
I just want to tell you

246
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,320
An'an.

247
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,480
Stop it. I understand you.

248
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,040
Lin Hao.

249
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,040
I like you.

250
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,120
I worked one night last night. Illusion.

251
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,240
Illusion?

252
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,240
Mom.

253
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,240
Have some water.

254
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,000
Tap.

255
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,360
How do you feel?

256
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,680
Still dizzy.

257
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,040
Mom.

258
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,320
Godmother, why are you back?

259
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,560
Your godmother is not feeling well.

260
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
so she came back early.

261
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,720
Godmother.

262
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
Are you okay?

263
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
Let me take you to the hospital, okay?

264
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,800
It's okay.

265
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,600
My blood sugar is low.

266
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,560
I feel a little dizzy.

267
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,320
Jefferson, why did you buy

268
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,440
I bought a bouquet of flowers.

269
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,880
An An asked me to buy this

270
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,880
to decorate the house.

271
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,920
You bought so many vegetables.

272
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,120
I bought these by the way.

273
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:27,880
Alright.

274
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,800
You all go to rest today.

275
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,880
I'll cook dinner.

276
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,720
Okay.

277
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,480
Mom.

278
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,720
Safe.

279
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,040
What did you say?

280
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,240
I said...

281
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,800
I like you guys.

282
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
I like you too.

283
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,400
Guys.
