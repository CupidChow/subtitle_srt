1
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,280
I read a sentence in a book

2
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,960
If I can avoid the strong joy,

3
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,000
there won't be any sadness coming.

4
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,080
But

5
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,120
Even though I avoided the strong joy

6
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,920
Sometimes sadness comes uninvited

7
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,520
I can't even drive her away

8
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,520
I can't even avoid it.

9
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:38,759
Safe

10
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,200
until you show up.

11
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,360
you show up

12
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
A boy

13
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,200
wants to grow up

14
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,520
who can protect you.

15
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,080
You have a long way to go.

16
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,680
Fortunately, at the end of every nightmare,

17
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,440
at the end of every nightmare.

18
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,720
Lin Hao.

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,520
An'an, I saw you sleep soundly. I didn't wake you up.

20
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,480
Remember to finish the milk when you wake up.

21
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,720
See you later.

22
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,840
Are you okay?

23
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,480
Aren't you shooting?

24
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,240
What are you doing?

25
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,480
We're done.

26
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,600
Playing pillow battle.

27
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,480
What are you doing here?

28
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,240
I miss you. I want to take you somewhere.

29
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Stop showing affection.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,480
An.

31
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,440
Do you want to play together?

32
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,040
Do you dare?

33
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
Why did you come here?

34
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,520
What are you looking for?

35
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,720
Look.

36
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,720
I checked it before.

37
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,800
It's called Manta.

38
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,320
I've lived in the sea since the Jurassic era.

39
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,720
It's been over 100 million years, but his body shape hasn't changed.

40
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,800
It's amazing.

41
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,600
Although it looks fierce,

42
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,080
but actually,

43
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,520
it's one of

44
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,800
in the world.

45
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
No wonder you said it was cute.

46
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,520
There's another reason why I like it.

47
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,240
What is it?

48
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,080
Because they are always in pairs.

49
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,800
And they love each other all their lives.

50
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,600
Mom, look at these two fish kissing.

51
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,360
Where are you going?

52
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,440
What did you want to tell me last time?

53
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,160
When we were interviewing at the jellyfish restaurant,

54
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,240
you covered my ears.

55
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,320
What did you say?

56
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,600
I asked you first.

57
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,160
Our interview was six months ago.

58
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,200
I'm the one who asked first.

59
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,520
You're cheating.

60
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,320
You're lying.

61
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,720
After you came back,

62
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,640
I always think of the past.

63
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,440
An'an.

64
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,159
I didn't come back to bring you back.

65
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,800
That doesn't matter.

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,880
I don't want to recall the past,

67
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,920
but when I was young,

68
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
you were naughty.

69
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,040
but you always make me happy.

70
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,360
I never asked.

71
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,760
Have you been happy these years?

72
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:03,920
An'an.

73
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,080
The most important moment

74
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,920
right now.

75
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Although I've walked a long way,

76
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,040
Anan,

77
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,159
I finally become

78
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,040
who can protect you.

79
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,480
An, wait.

80
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,000
A promotion gift.

81
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,720
You drew it?

82
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,200
I didn't draw it,

83
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,920
but to get it,

84
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,760
to get it.

85
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
How much is this painting?

86
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,760
I didn't spend money.

87
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:44,920
Trust me.

88
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,480
Why don't you go home?

89
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,000
Forget it. I have something to do tomorrow.

90
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,240
Besides,

91
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,320
I'm afraid I can't leave if I go home.

92
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,240
Fine.

93
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,200
Let's go. Let's go.

94
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,760
Painting.

95
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,600
Should I send it to you?

96
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,320
No.

97
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,200
Don't you have something to do tomorrow?

98
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,040
I'm afraid you won't be able to leave if you go upstairs.

99
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,760
Good night.

100
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,760
Thanks.

101
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,760
I've signed

102
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
I've signed it.

103
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,919
Take a look.

104
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,320
Why do you agree?

105
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,480
Things have changed.

106
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
You can confirm

107
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,040
No problem.

108
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,480
Let's go through the payment procedure.

109
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,480
I'm in a hurry.

110
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,760
Armanda, no matter what,

111
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,440
thank you for your recognition.

112
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,000
You're very talented. I'm sure.

113
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,760
But it doesn't matter to me.

114
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,600
I'm not professional in dessert.

115
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,440
Do you know why I chose you?

116
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,920
Why?

117
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,920
I like your determination.

118
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,920
You won't change once you're certain.

119
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,640
Of course, you even terminated the contract with me.

120
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
Do you like Xia Anran?

121
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,320
I'm sure.

122
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,600
In an uncertain world,

123
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,720
I'm most certain about loving her.

124
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,640
This city

125
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,480
I don't know since when

126
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,760
become so romantic.

127
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,040
It doesn't suit me.

128
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,480
I'm really leaving.

129
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,760
Good luck.

130
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,440
I heard you made up.

131
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,760
It's just a small gift.

132
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,880
Delivery.

133
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,520
You're welcome.

134
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,080
Jiajia, what is this?

135
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,520
How do I wear this?

136
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,760
An'an.

137
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,680
An'an.

138
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,520
Just come in.

139
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,440
I didn't change the password.

140
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,400
The password.

141
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,200
I should change it.

142
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,000
What if the bad guy comes in?

143
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,960
What should I do?

144
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,760
Of course you're not a bad person.

145
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,400
I am.

146
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,840
Someone is knocking.

147
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,760
No one.

148
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,880
Are you hallucinating?

149
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,680
Why is nobody here?

150
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,640
This child is safe.

151
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,840
Anran.

152
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,760
My mom.

153
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,000
Haohao is not picking up.

154
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,440
My mom.

155
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,080
Here.

156
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:03,880
Here.

157
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,080
Be careful.

158
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,400
Why is the tie still here?

159
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,640
It's safe.

160
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,000
What are you doing?

161
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,640
He was looking for something.

162
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,440
Go.

163
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,440
Mom.

164
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,640
Why didn't you tell me you were back?

165
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,200
I'll tell you what else is fun.

166
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,200
I want surprise.

167
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,200
Yeah.

168
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,760
By the way, Anran,

169
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,520
Aunt Tan is back.

170
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,200
Let her stay here for now, okay?

171
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,440
Mom,

172
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,760
Don't bother her.

173
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
I'll book a hotel for you.

174
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,880
What hotel?

175
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,520
I’ll stay here.

176
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,880
Okay, auntie.

177
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,280
Well, Lin Hao and Shen Yu are staying there.

178
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,760
His room is available.

179
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,880
You can stay here.

180
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,080
Okay.

181
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,640
Let me show you the room.

182
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,960
Let's go. Okay.

183
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:05,880
Let's go.

184
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,080
This way.

185
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,640
What do you think?

186
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Great.

187
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,960
I won't beat around the bush.

188
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,760
Give A&H back to Louis.

189
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,200
He'll compensate you for the compensation within a reasonable range.

190
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,400
In exchange,

191
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,880
I won't expose

192
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,080
to the president.

193
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,520
Why do you think you can defeat me

194
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,080
you can defeat me?

195
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,200
Zhang Ran doesn't want to cut the table with the photographer.

196
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,400
out of friendship or interests.

197
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,280
we both know it.

198
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,080
Didn't you

199
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,520
because

200
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,640
Is that why you're under his control now?

201
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,960
You can eat whatever you want.

202
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,280
Don't talk nonsense.

203
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,640
Do you have evidence?

204
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
This is a photographer.

205
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,120
When I was filming the cover for V magazine,

206
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,320
the side photographer took a photo

207
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,680
that he reached out to molest me.

208
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,520
The editor-in-chief of V magazine was Zhang Ran.

209
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Someone reported him for personal gains.

210
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,320
There are some words in my phone

211
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,760
in my phone.

212
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,000
Some of them included you.
