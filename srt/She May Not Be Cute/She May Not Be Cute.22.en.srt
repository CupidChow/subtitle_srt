1
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,360
I saw a diamond ring in the kitchen

2
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,680
What?

3
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,280
Lin Hao proposed to you?

4
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,520
No.

5
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,360
I saw him by the pool.

6
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,840
When he asked me,

7
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,120
when he asked me.

8
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,200
I saw him put it away.

9
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,440
I found that you are decisive

10
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,200
in work.

11
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,440
Why are you like an ostrich when it comes to love?

12
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,280
Do you think marriage

13
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,600
can only be impulsive?

14
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,200
But marriage is a big project.

15
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,560
to make a decision on impulse,

16
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,440
Isn't that unreasonable?

17
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,080
Marriage is illogical.

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,080
Haven't you heard of a saying?

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,200
Newbies get married.

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,040
shouldn't have sworn

21
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,240
no matter it's poor or rich,

22
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,280
and health,

23
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,560
love you forever.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,680
You should put your hands on the theory of evolution

25
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,760
and "Selfish Genes".

26
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,360
I will go against my nature

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,520
and defy my instinct.

28
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,800
Love you forever

29
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,000
Anyway,

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,280
whether you want or not,

31
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,079
I think you should make it clear.

32
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,040
If you really don't want to get married,

33
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,079
why don't you tell Lin Hao directly?

34
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,040
I don't know how to say it.

35
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,120
Have you forgotten my motto?

36
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,480
Instead of internal consumption,

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
rather than to waste time.

38
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,000
Fine.

39
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,680
You go crazy first.

40
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,560
I'll take a rest.

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
It's more like a main dish.

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,560
This is the crepe paste we made.

43
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,600
You can make it now.

44
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:04,760
Nikson.

45
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,560
About work and life,

46
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,760
about work and life.

47
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,400
Now let's talk about your relationship.

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
We see that you have great teamwork.

49
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,040
Did this relationship

50
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,320
bring you any trouble?

51
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,120
Right?

52
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,480
Will you two fight?

53
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,040
She asked me to sleep on the sofa yesterday.

54
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,880
How dare you say that?

55
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,760
You turned off the air conditioner.

56
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,040
I'm so hot.

57
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,560
I'm afraid of catching a cold.

58
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,840
You don't understand.

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,760
You two have been keeping a low profile since your relationship was announced.

60
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,400
Ms. Ji has changed a lot.

61
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,120
May I ask

62
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,320
how he confessed to you?

63
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,040
I pursued her.

64
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,040
I confessed my feelings first.

65
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,400
Am I not obvious enough?

66
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,600
You did.

67
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
Are you trying to piss me off?

68
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,600
I'm angry because I want your attention.

69
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,480
Thank you.

70
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,240
Even elementary school kids don't do this anymore.

71
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,160
I think the relationship between people

72
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,160
is fair.

73
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,720
There's no reason for men to confess first.

74
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,440
One goes to another person.

75
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,560
The other

76
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,040
also approaches that person.

77
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,280
He has his mouth anyway.

78
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,760
Just say what you want.

79
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,680
Look.

80
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,680
dessert can be salty.

81
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,280
So what is impossible?

82
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,720
Men give up when they can't catch up.

83
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,480
They're all bad.

84
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,240
Today is the last day of the bet.

85
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,480
Elsa's flight to France tonight.

86
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,160
I only have an hour

87
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,000
to come here.

88
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,400
You still have an hour.

89
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,240
Didn't you say you can't play?

90
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,600
I learned a song for you.

91
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,560
I haven't slept for three days.

92
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,000
Are you excited?

93
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,000
What's the name of this song?

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,880
She's not cute.

95
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,040
How about this?

96
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,000
the truth?

97
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,280
Sort of.

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,720
Shen Yu.

99
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,280
You know me.

100
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,400
I'm selfish.

101
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,000
I love myself.

102
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Even if I promised to be with you today,

103
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,400
I might regret it tomorrow.

104
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,160
I know.

105
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,960
I don't expect you to promise me tomorrow.

106
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,000
I just hope we can feel the moment

107
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,560
and be with you.

108
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,880
I didn't expect you to leave so soon.

109
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,040
Something urgent came up at the French shop.

110
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,280
I have to go back.

111
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,440
But it's okay.

112
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,680
You can go to France

113
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,160
with Louis.

114
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,240
Like this.

115
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,000
to see what his nest looks like.

116
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Actually, Lin Hao

117
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,480
rarely told me about him in France.

118
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,040
So every time you talk,

119
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,160
I think it's quite interesting.

120
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,040
It's great.

121
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,560
You have so many

122
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,920
so many memories together.

123
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,280
In fact, in all these memories,

124
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,440
in all these memories.

125
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,680
We haven't met much,

126
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,720
but I think we've known each other for a long time.

127
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,600
Sometimes Leo and I would joke

128
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,280
the four of us grew up together.

129
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,159
Because over the past decade,

130
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,600
for over ten sentences and three sentences.

131
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,160
We played house together when we were kids.

132
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,240
As long as he pretended to be the groom,

133
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,720
no one

134
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,600
to be the bride.

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,720
He said

136
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,600
he could only marry you.

137
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,720
What happened next?

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,360
We couldn't do anything about him.

139
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,360
So I had to be the groom.

140
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
He'll be the bride.

141
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,240
Don't tell him

142
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,840
I told you this.

143
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,120
Or he'll kill me.

144
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,120
Okay.

145
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,920
To be honest,

146
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,680
in his heart.

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,160
He only has you.

148
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,680
Sometimes we laugh at him.

149
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,480
He's like a fool

150
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,040
like a fool.

151
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,680
just to come back to you.

152
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,360
So...

153
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,600
At that time,

154
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,120
when he knew you were going to get married,

155
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,360
the first time I saw

156
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,840
on his face.

157
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,680
Lin Hao.

158
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,840
I didn't expect

159
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,280
these years.

160
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,800
How did you feel

161
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,360
when I treated you like this?

162
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,600
An'an.

163
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,160
So you are here.

164
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,160
When did I start caring about you?

165
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,840
You firmly looked at me and said,

166
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,840
What you met this time

167
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
is the love you love wholeheartedly,

168
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,040
or did you reach out to me?

169
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,920
and told me that you would always be with me,

170
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,480
An'an.

171
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,800
Let's go home.

172
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,280
These moments

173
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
lingering in my memory.

174
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,600
Hold me tightly.

175
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,160
What's wrong?

176
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,040
Are you worried that they might bother you?

177
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,560
Let's elope.

178
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,800
Lin Hao,

179
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,360
What do you like about me?

180
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,000
I don't think I need a reason to like you.

181
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,000
Why didn't you tell me?

182
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,240
You did so much for me.

183
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,920
You know everything?

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,480
Actually, I think

185
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,720
think about the past

186
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,040
or the future.

187
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,680
As long as we love each other,

188
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,920
is enough.

189
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,800
You asked me

190
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,160
if I was with you.

191
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,240
when I'm with you?

192
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,280
I...

193
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,360
I didn't ask.

194
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,040
Yes.

195
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,040
Facing the unknown future,

196
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,680
when facing the unknown future.

197
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,240
After all, everything that happened between us

198
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,480
is illogical.

199
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,920
But even so,

200
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,800
you still took 99 steps towards me.

201
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,600
So this time,

202
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,600
I want to be with you.

203
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
Let's get married.

204
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,160
Did I hear something wrong?

205
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,560
Marry me.

206
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,560
Lin Hao.
