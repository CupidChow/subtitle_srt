1
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,640
Don't move.

2
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,240
You slept so late last night.

3
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,240
Aren't you tired?

4
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,320
What time is it?

5
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,800
What's going on?

6
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,280
Do you want me to help you recall it?

7
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,720
Do you know

8
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,600
I've been missing you lately.

9
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,600
Close your eyes, okay?

10
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,920
I got you.

11
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,040
You won't run away anymore.

12
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,960
I never run away.

13
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
I won't run away again.

14
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,800
Where is the key?

15
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,440
Did you see yesterday?

16
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,400
The key.

17
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,480
I swear I won't drink anymore.

18
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,320
I'll never drink again.

19
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,160
I'm crazy

20
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,160
This is crazy.

21
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,960
I won't drink anymore.

22
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,640
Hello, Amy.

23
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,400
You asked me to confirm

24
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,280
that you asked me to confirm.

25
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,120
Do you have the key?

26
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,600
The fun handcuffs you mentioned?

27
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,880
That key...

28
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,079
is not with me.

29
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,480
Okay, got it.

30
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,840
It's okay.

31
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,280
Do you have fluid compression at home?

32
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,360
I'll cut it.

33
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,200
Who has that?

34
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,640
Is there a gold store nearby?

35
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,120
What about the materials market?

36
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,120
I have no choice.

37
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,360
I have a meeting this afternoon.

38
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,120
I can't wear this. Come with me.

39
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,480
There's another place.

40
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,200
Come with me.

41
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,560
Let's go. It hurts.

42
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,200
Slow down.

43
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,840
Do you need anything?

44
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,840
Do you have the key?

45
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,840
I understand.

46
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,640
This is your favorite.

47
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,480
Young man,

48
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,040
Would you like to take a look at our new design?

49
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,760
This is our new product.

50
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,399
It will make your girlfriend happy.

51
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
My boyfriend doesn't need it.

52
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,360
Thank you.

53
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
Please come again.

54
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,040
What did you just say?

55
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,200
What?

56
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,000
Boyfriend?

57
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,760
I'm your boyfriend.

58
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,560
But on one condition.

59
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,200
First,

60
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,480
keep it a secret from your family.

61
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,480
Why?

62
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,280
Second,

63
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,200
In the company,

64
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,560
in the company.

65
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,480
You have a problem?

66
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,400
Forget it.

67
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,360
No, no problem.

68
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,400
No.

69
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,640
I'll listen to you.

70
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,200
I've read the termination contract.

71
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,840
I disagree.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,840
The compensation

73
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,320
is written in the contract.

74
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,160
But your brand value

75
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,440
is different from before.

76
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,440
It's not because of your publicity.

77
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,560
I'm the director of "Queen".

78
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,720
Which is more important?

79
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,200
or the deputy editor?

80
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,320
I knew it.

81
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,320
It's all because of Xia Anran.

82
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,040
I said

83
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,480
It's not because of her.

84
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,320
It's my own decision.

85
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,320
I hope you won't get her involved.

86
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,640
That depends on

87
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,480
your sincerity and price.

88
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,920
Don’t forget

89
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,480
who actually has A&H.

90
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,920
Look at you.

91
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,640
everything went well last night.

92
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,120
Don't mention it.

93
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,400
I won't drink anymore.

94
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,120
Why are you still looking at this painting?

95
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,040
I used to only see the scale in her hand.

96
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,440
I was afraid my balance would be broken.

97
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,280
What about now?

98
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,320
Today,

99
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,440
I suddenly saw the expression on her face.

100
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,160
I think she doesn't care

101
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,640
which side is light or heavy.

102
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,400
Because the jewelry belongs to her.

103
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,000
I used to worry that my feelings

104
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,920
won't be rewarded.

105
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:40,880
But the feelings I gave are mine.

106
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,040
The experience I got is also mine.

107
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,600
There's no need to worry.

108
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,280
Is the puppy in Truth Training Class?

109
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,440
Your sense of love has improved a lot.

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,840
I didn't realize it before.

111
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,400
The state changes at will.

112
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,880
The painting is still the same.

113
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,480
Your heart is different.

114
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,400
what you see will be different.

115
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,480
What I like is the possibility of changing instantly.

116
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Why don't you try

117
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,720
look at the same person for a long time?

118
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,440
Maybe there's a different possibility.

119
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,040
It's impossible.

120
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,320
He's going back to France.

121
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,880
You know me.

122
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
I never have long-distance relationship.

123
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,760
What's the difference between 100 kilometers away and Mars?

124
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,880
The difference is you seem a little sad this time.

125
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,440
To be honest,

126
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,200
I couldn't sleep last night.

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,160
I didn't expect

128
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,880
you can still lose sleep.

129
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,120
So I'm going to get drunk tonight

130
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,320
Double happiness.

131
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,720
A cup of coffee can relieve your sorrows.

132
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,560
You won't stay for your muse anymore?

133
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,640
She said goodbye to the most beautiful moment.

134
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,840
How's the talk about the termination?

135
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,520
It's not that easy.

136
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,640
Armanda offered a high price.

137
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,960
I was worried.

138
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,240
By the way,

139
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
do you remember

140
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
I told you last time?

141
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,240
VTV wants to invite you

142
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,200
to participate in their dessert variety show.

143
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,120
No.

144
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
I said I don't want to.

145
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,800
That was before you went to the magazine.

146
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,360
They've doubled their contract deposit.

147
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,800
That much?

148
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,000
It can’t be helped.

149
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,840
You're the youngest MOF

150
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,520
You not only attract dessert,

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,280
When you're in the magazine,

152
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,400
they found

153
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
you look more attractive than your dessert.

154
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:38,840
You...

155
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,280
I think you should go.

156
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,520
I'm just selling my face.

157
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,120
It's all for your soul shop.

158
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,280
Are you afraid Xia Anran will be jealous

159
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,120
Xia Anran will be jealous?

160
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,240
I did.

161
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,120
I didn't want to go.

162
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
Besides,

163
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,040
doesn't want others to know about our relationship.

164
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,240
Don't jinx me.

165
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,920
Other people are free

166
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,920
love and life can be abandoned.

167
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,120
But for love,

168
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
for love.

169
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,480
I won't abandon this place.

170
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,040
Because this place

171
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,040
as important as An'an.

172
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,480
I know.

173
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,920
Even if I burn you to ashes,

174
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,880
I'll leave you behind.

175
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,360
24K pure.

176
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,600
This is your urn.

177
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll draw one for you next time.

178
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,000
Are you leaving or not?

179
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,360
If you don't leave, I'll tell Master.

180
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,480
You've been doing nothing.

181
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,800
Fine, I'll leave.

182
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
I'm really leaving.

183
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,920
The flight is tomorrow morning.

184
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,920
Well...

185
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,480
Call me when you miss me.

186
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,040
There's no time difference in our love

187
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm leaving.

188
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,920
Didn't we agree

189
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,360
not to let the company know?

190
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,240
Why are you here?

191
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,440
That's why I was waiting for you in the car.

192
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,920
How did you get in the car?

193
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,600
I have a spare key.

194
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,680
I want you to get off work.

195
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,000
when you get off work.

196
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,560
Okay.

197
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,240
Please take me home.

198
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,480
Don't you see what's in that bag?

199
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,800
For me?

200
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,920
Didn't you say you'll do me a favor?

201
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
That's my request.

202
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,800
All right.

203
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,360
Miss Xia.

204
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,560
Please fasten your seat belt.

205
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,120
We're leaving.

206
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,760
Where did you buy this?

207
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,040
I knew it.

208
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,480
you would look good in this.

209
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,920
Do I look good?

210
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,920
Hello, Amy.

211
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,040
Let's go with the plan.

212
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,440
If the photographer is delayed tomorrow,

213
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,920
you can communicate with them.

214
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,760
Tell them.

215
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,160
Don't worry about me.

216
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,560
Go on with your work.

217
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,800
Wait for me.

218
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,360
It'll be ready soon.

219
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,560
Put your hands down. Don't move.

220
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,480
Do you hear me?

221
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,680
Okay. Okay.

222
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,120
You and the artist team

223
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,160
confirm the change of the photographer.

224
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,240
Send the poster and cover

225
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,120
and cover.

226
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,120
We can go together

227
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,000
we can go together.

228
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,680
Talk to me on WeChat.

229
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,680
Didn't we agree not to move?

230
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,320
Chief Editor Xia.

231
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,240
I didn't move my hand.

232
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm good.

233
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,120
It's getting late.

234
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,560
Let's go to bed early.

235
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,480
You have no idea

236
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,000
The owner

237
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,480
looked at me like a minor who went astray.

238
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,120
No way.

239
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,600
Now the whole world knows

240
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,000
you're a love captive.

241
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
The key is I don't want my whole world

242
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
including Xia Anran.

243
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,600
Is that important?

244
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,000
How much dignity is worth?

245
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,000
Do you want to take the initiative?

246
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,000
Let me teach you.

247
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,640
That's it.
