1
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,960
How did you get in?

2
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,320
Xia Anran's Jiugong.

3
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,200
Amazing, right?

4
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,120
Xia Anran's Jiugong Ge.

5
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,800
Awesome, right?

6
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,920
Why didn't you tell me earlier that you're Lin Hao?

7
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,759
You didn't recognize me either.

8
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,479
It's been so many years.

9
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,080
How could I recognize you?

10
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,120
How did I recognize you

11
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,120
the first time I saw you?

12
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,960
Is that why you're making fun of me?

13
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,360
Why are you at my house?

14
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,160
Didn't I tell you?

15
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,680
I just came back.

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,560
I lost all my certificates.

17
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,200
I can only stay at your place for a while.

18
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:15,840
No.

19
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,760
Why?

20
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,040
It's inconvenient.

21
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,240
Why not?

22
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:20,960
I...

23
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,440
I...

24
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,400
I have a friend coming.

25
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,040
What friend?

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,000
Have I seen him before?

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,000
It's okay.

28
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,920
I can avoid suspicion when he comes.

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,560
Brother.

30
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,640
I'm used to living alone.

31
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,360
I don't like others staying at home.

32
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,160
Can you move to another place?

33
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,800
Didn't you feel happy

34
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,320
you were happy too.

35
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,680
Lin Hao, I'm warning you.

36
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,000
Forget

37
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,480
Forget it right now.

38
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,640
Understand?

39
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,000
What happened before

40
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,480
Including what?

41
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:06,920
I...

42
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,160
Hello?

43
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,360
Hao Hao.

44
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,079
Godmother.

45
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
Have you arrived?

46
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm at An'an's house.

47
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,640
Thank you for taking me in.

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,600
Otherwise, I can only sleep on the street.

49
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,640
What are you talking about?

50
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,079
When she was young,

51
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,800
your parents took care of her.

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
You are my godson.

53
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,640
She is your sister.

54
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,240
Her house is your home, Mom.

55
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,640
I...

56
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,160
But, godmother,

57
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,520
An'an said she has a friend coming.

58
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,160
Is it inconvenient?

59
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,240
What friend would come to our house?

60
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,000
She doesn't even have a boyfriend.

61
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,520
Show her if you dare.

62
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,640
With your words,

63
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,720
I can live here without worries.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You can stay as long as you want.

65
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,160
Xia Anran, go clean up the second bedroom.

66
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,520
Hao Hao,

67
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,800
Ask your sister to buy anything you need.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,520
By the way, your sister doesn't know how to cook.

69
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,000
Order food if you want.

70
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,640
Aunt, don't worry. I'll cook for her.

71
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,880
Hao Hao can cook now.

72
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,160
You've grown up.

73
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,600
It's getting late.

74
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,720
Godmother, rest early.

75
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,520
We're going to bed.

76
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,440
Okay.

77
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,240
Rest early.

78
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,959
Bye, Godmother.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,160
Who said

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,240
say something wrong?

81
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,600
No.

82
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,680
What the hell!

83
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,040
He is Lin Hao.

84
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,760
Take it off.

85
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,520
How could he be Lin Hao?

86
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,480
It's so awkward.

87
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,600
It's early in the morning. Are you tearing down the house?

88
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
Morning, An.

89
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,080
Why didn't you lock the door?

90
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,480
You've seen me before.

91
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,360
Remember to lock the door next time.

92
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,080
An'an, let's have breakfast.

93
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,080
I never eat breakfast.

94
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,800
I've made it.

95
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,640
Aren't you wasting food if you don't eat?

96
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,360
Even if you get struck by lightning, it's your fault.

97
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,760
No, it's not good for your health.

98
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,080
If you move out of my place earlier,

99
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,600
I'll be fine.

100
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,360
Godmother.

101
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,760
Hao Hao.

102
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,640
Are you having breakfast?

103
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,240
Well, I...

104
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,960
I made breakfast for her too.

105
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,920
Show me what you have eaten.

106
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,040
So much food.

107
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,240
Where is Xia Anran?

108
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,200
She's here.

109
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,400
Mom.

110
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,520
Xia Anran.

111
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,240
The meal is on the table.

112
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,360
What are you doing at the door?

113
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,360
Mom, I'm going to work.

114
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,520
It'll be too late for the morning peak.

115
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,480
Enough.

116
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,920
Don't tell me this.

117
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,480
If you don't know,

118
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,200
take care of yourself,

119
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,240
Move back as soon as possible.

120
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,520
I'll move them for you, okay?

121
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,480
Don't.

122
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,600
Don't come.

123
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,360
I'll eat it.

124
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,920
I'll eat it now.

125
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,920
Don't hang up your phone.

126
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,320
I'll watch you eat.

127
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,640
Mom, do you think you're having a video meeting?

128
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,080
Don't.

129
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,520
Hurry up.

130
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,240
I'll eat.

131
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,760
Hurry up and eat. Look.

132
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,200
Take a big bite.

133
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,200
Eat

134
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,600
It's delicious.

135
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,840
That's more like it.

136
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,640
Hey, I can't have dinner with you tonight.

137
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,200
I think I have to work overtime tonight.

138
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,640
I haven't reached the office yet.

139
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,840
No way.

140
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,920
You're a working machine. How can you be late?

141
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,760
It's all that kid's fault.

142
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,640
He even dragged my mom to eat breakfast.

143
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,920
Did you recruit a handsome brother

144
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,040
or a housemaid?

145
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,760
You'll know how troublesome it is if you combine them.

146
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,800
You're happy now.

147
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,800
I'm hanging up.

148
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,480
An'an, this is coffee.

149
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,360
Drink it on the way.

150
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,799
What a jinx.

151
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,360
My dream has come true. How do you live?

152
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,840
I'm about to be kicked out.

153
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,640
Her boyfriend is at home.

154
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
It's inconvenient for you to stay here.

155
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,240
According to my observation,

156
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,600
she doesn't have a boyfriend in her life.

157
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,920
So far, I'm not.

158
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't look at you either.

159
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,120
She said I messed up her life.

160
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,560
I did it for her sake.

161
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,120
Stop.

162
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,040
All girls hate men

163
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,000
is a man who speaks for her own good.

164
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,040
Unless this man is her father.

165
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,000
The smell of a father makes people lose their head.

166
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,160
Do you understand?

167
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,880
What should we do?

168
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,680
The key of the game

169
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,160
is to know what your core value is.

170
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,160
My core value?

171
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,920
Think about it.

172
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,920
If you can't do it, use your original instinct.

173
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,120
Which one is better?

174
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,120
Left.

175
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,920
Which one is better?

176
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,440
Left.

177
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,240
Are you so stubborn?

178
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
You can't change the side.

179
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,560
I'm a Leo.

180
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,120
Louis.

181
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
You don't love me anymore.

182
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,600
Your painting

183
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,680
was sold out before the exhibition.

184
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,280
Do we have to choose?

185
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,000
It's different this time.

186
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,720
You don't understand at all.

187
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,560
I don't understand.

188
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,040
Opera theater.

189
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,240
When I want her to eat it,

190
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,480
when she eats it.

191
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,360
Then she can take me in for a few more days.

192
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,000
Have you ever thought that she wants you to leave so badly?

193
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,360
Is there really someone else?

194
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,240
Be gentle.

195
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,360
Be gentle.

196
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,720
What are you doing?

197
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,400
Forever FON

198
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,800
Lin Hao.

199
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,240
Fore?

200
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,240
R FON

201
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,040
What are you doing?

202
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,120
I...

203
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,360
Sorry, senior.

204
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,600
This is my cousin.

205
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,600
He's just a kid.

206
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,680
Please don't mind.

207
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,920
Sit down. Don't move.

208
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,240
An'an, what's wrong?

209
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,040
Are you okay?

210
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,120
I'm fine. My spine hurts.

211
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,920
I won't die.

212
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
It's an old problem.

213
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,680
You didn't even pay attention.

214
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,120
Such a disobedient patient.

215
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,240
I won't treat him anymore.

216
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,720
No.

217
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,480
I'm counting on you for the rest of my life.

218
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
Do you have any plasters at home?

219
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,720
I think so.

220
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,240
Lin Hao, hold this for me.

221
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,360
That drawer.

222
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,480
I'll do it.

223
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,800
It's the last piece.

224
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,000
I'll bring some next time.

225
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,120
I'll do it.

226
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
I'm professional.

227
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,680
How do you know I'm not professional?

228
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,920
I'm a doctor. Are you?

229
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,360
I...

230
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,800
I'll do it myself.

231
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,240
You have to be careful in the future.

232
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,240
Don't sit too long.

233
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,040
Don't mention heavy things.

234
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,680
Okay.

235
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,560
Do doctors always nag like that?

236
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,360
It's okay.

237
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,880
I'll do the dirty work.

238
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,040
None of your business.

239
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,800
Thank you, cousin.

240
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,680
By the way, the time to wear high heels should be shortened.

241
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,120
Especially when you drive.

242
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,360
Let's go to and from work.

243
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,120
Let me give you a ride.

244
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,360
It's okay. Don't worry.

245
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,360
I can give her a ride.

246
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,480
I'm on my way.

247
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,480
Me?

248
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480
I have a car. Do you have one?

249
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,440
Who doesn't have a car?

250
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,360
I don't need it.

251
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,800
I'm fine.

252
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,040
Are you used to

253
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,120
when you're working?

254
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,800
What do you mean by that?

255
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,600
Teach me.

256
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,600
I'll massage her later.

257
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:30,880
Okay.

258
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,040
I'll make an appointment for your rehabilitation on Wednesday.

259
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,800
Remember to go on time.

260
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,480
Okay.

261
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Did you bring that?

262
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,360
I made it.

263
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,240
Senior, I remember you like sweet food.

264
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,560
Take this.

265
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,120
This...

266
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,040
Thank you.

267
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,720
See you on Wednesday.

268
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,120
I made it for you.

269
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,240
Enough, Lin Hao. Stop it.

270
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,480
It's just a cake.

271
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,360
I'm not kidding.

272
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,560
Can you stop treating me like a child?

273
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,720
You were happy before.

274
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,120
How dare you say that?

275
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,360
That was before you told me who you were.

276
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,360
You're just a child to me now.

277
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
I've grown up.

278
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,920
I'll prove it to you.

279
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,720
If you really grow up,

280
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,640
you should understand what I mean.

281
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,240
I'm tired right now.

282
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,000
Can you disappear and leave me alone?

283
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,600
Hello, Amy.

284
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,280
Good news, Anran.

285
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,040
The interview invitation we sent

286
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,920
One of you is just in time.

287
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,720
I've emailed you the specific plan.

288
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
Okay, I'll read it now.

289
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,600
Lin Hao.

290
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,840
You called me?

291
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,800
Amy said you agreed to the interview.

292
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,360
She cried and begged but refused.

293
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,560
Why did you suddenly agree?

294
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
We are all adults.

295
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,360
I believe in your life,

296
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,840
in your life.

297
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
Equivalent exchange, understand?

298
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,360
Tell me your condition.

299
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,280
First, I want to live here.

300
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,720
Okay.

301
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,560
I have a lot of meat here.

302
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,160
If there's a first, there's a second.

303
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,600
But there can only be two.

304
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,720
I agree.

305
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,480
But the interview must be done tomorrow.

306
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,680
Aren't you going to ask me what my request is?

307
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,360
Since you agreed, I'm fine with anything.

308
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,280
Anything is fine.

309
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,280
You can stay in my house, but you have to make three rules.

310
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,920
First, don't touch my stuff.

311
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,920
Second, wear your clothes well.

312
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,040
Wear it when you take a shower

313
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,600
Do I have to wear it when I sleep

314
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,400
You can wear it in your room.

315
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,840
But you have to wear it when you step out of your room.

316
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,160
Third, don't enter my bedroom.

317
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,800
Is there a secret in your bedroom?

318
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,720
Didn't I already go in?

319
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
Most importantly,

320
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,040
what happened that day.

321
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,840
to the coffin.

322
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,240
The agreement

323
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,920
the agreement will be valid from now on.

324
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,840
Wait, An'an.

325
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Let me make it clear.

326
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,640
Nothing happened

327
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,920
Nothing happened.

328
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,000
I...
