1
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,360
I don't want to get married.

2
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:22,800
Xia Anran.

3
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,080
What are you talking about?

4
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,520
It's safe.

5
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,400
Are you satisfied with

6
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,680
the venue we watched recently?

7
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,720
You can tell us if you have any ideas.

8
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,880
I mean

9
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,560
I'm not ready to get married yet.

10
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,640
But I'm serious about this relationship.

11
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:52,840
Nail.

12
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:56,840
Here.

13
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,480
Why is it so cold?

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,160
How time flies.

15
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,360
Yeah.

16
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,800
In the blink of an eye, I've been working

17
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,199
for more than half a month.

18
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,680
What?

19
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,320
Are you happy working here?

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,680
This is the first time in our gallery.

21
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,360
to be displayed by the artist.

22
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,200
You saved me a lot of money.

23
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,680
At this point,

24
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,480
our friendship is still measured with money.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,160
I should work harder.

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,440
How about

27
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,640
I do something else?

28
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,440
I'm going to shoot with Anran in two days.

29
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,040
Finish this as soon as possible.

30
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,160
Do you know when you're the most charming?

31
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,120
When I reject you,

32
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,120
let me remind you.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,840
There are only a few days left.

34
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,680
Why are you squatting here?

35
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,400
An'an.

36
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,000
Are you too busy with work?

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,280
Shall we sleep in the room?

38
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,560
No.

39
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,560
I have work to do.

40
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,400
The coffee is overdosed today.

41
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,840
Do you want to eat something?

42
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,280
Okay.

43
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,120
This is a new product developed by my company.

44
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,840
I need a picky customer

45
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,120
to evaluate for me.

46
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,040
Not sweet.

47
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
A high evaluation.

48
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,560
What are you busy with?

49
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,040
I'm busy with the proposal.

50
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,960
You're so considerate.

51
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,320
Why don't you have any shortcomings?

52
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,959
Actually, I have shortcomings.

53
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,200
But I dare not tell you.

54
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,760
I'm afraid if I tell you,

55
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
if I tell you.

56
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,680
Every dessert I made

57
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,560
is not perfect.

58
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,480
No way.

59
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,680
But

60
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,920
it's good to have flaws.

61
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,960
That's everyone's personality.

62
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,880
An'an.

63
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,760
An'an.

64
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,960
Have you seen a movie?

65
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
What movie?

66
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,320
In movies, it's hard work,

67
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,480
When are you free?

68
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,480
You can joke about everything.

69
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
Proposal is not a joke.

70
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,560
You don't even have a ring.

71
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,120
That way, girls will talk about you forever.

72
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,520
What do you want to do?

73
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,040
Let's go to a movie sometime.

74
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,400
Sure.

75
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,480
When I have time.

76
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,920
The ring is not measured. Mission failed.

77
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,840
You can take a close-up.

78
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,880
Yes.

79
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,720
OK.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,600
Anran,

81
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,159
We’re almost ready.

82
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,280
Arrange guests to make bazaar cakes.

83
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,440
That's a great idea.

84
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,440
We can interact in their stage.

85
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,159
They have both feelings and space to dig deep.

86
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,560
What's more,

87
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,720
Mr. Louis agreed to attend the class himself.

88
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,440
Ms. Zhao finished the last scene.

89
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,440
He didn't even have time to change his costume.

90
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,040
Okay.

91
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,440
I'm here.

92
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,600
Starlet Chan, long time no see.

93
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,280
Let me introduce.

94
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,000
This is the supervisor of A&H,

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
dessert chef, Louis.

96
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,600
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

97
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
I watched your show.

98
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,840
You look even better in person than on TV.

99
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,000
You can call me Astronom.

100
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay.

101
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,880
Later,

102
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,280
if you have any questions later.

103
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,000
Miss Star-Chan.

104
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Let's start now.

105
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,720
Wait.

106
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,680
Put this on for me.

107
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,120
What's wrong?

108
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,280
Nothing.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,720
Let's start.

110
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:44,720
Okay.

111
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,080
Wipe it for me.

112
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,240
My hands are occupied too.

113
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,240
Look.

114
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,360
It's okay.

115
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,080
Let's continue.

116
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,520
Is Louis shy?

117
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,680
So cute.

118
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,200
Put the protein into warm bubbles.

119
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,040
What is warm bubbles?

120
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,760
What are you doing?

121
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,640
Like this.

122
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,080
It won't fall.

123
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Just warm bubbles.

124
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Don't mix

125
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,360
mix the protein with the yolk.

126
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,360
Because the milk is very hot.

127
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,200
If you mix it too fast,

128
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,320
it will destroy the bubbles in protein.

129
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,360
So Shelley won't get up.

130
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,200
That means...

131
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,800
Don't mix relationships with marriage.

132
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,920
[Or Romantic cell will be killed.]

133
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
Love is gone.

134
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,480
Handsome and pretty girls in the same frame are so eye-catching.

135
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:32,799
Here.

136
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,440
Let me teach you.

137
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,240
Amy.

138
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,240
Anran.

139
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,600
Where's Louis?

140
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,799
I just saw him.

141
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,360
He said he went to see Mr. Zhao.

142
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,120
Over there.

143
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,360
I've never seen Louis

144
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,000
look so bright.

145
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,560
No one

146
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,240
can refuse the attraction of a beauty.

147
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,160
I still don't have Louis's WeChat.

148
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,800
Let's call it a day.

149
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,240
OK.

150
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,200
An'an.

151
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,840
Didn't we agree to come back together?

152
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,480
Are you angry?

153
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,680
What did you say to Starlet?

154
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,000
Wait.

155
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,240
Mr. Zhao.

156
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,600
I have a question.

157
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,600
what’s your ring size?

158
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,480
Okay.

159
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,280
Yes.

160
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,480
I'm leaving.

161
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,920
Bye.

162
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,320
We just added each other on WeChat

163
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,560
and talked about work.

164
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,320
Nothing else.

165
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,320
Are you jealous?

166
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,880
Who's jealous?

167
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,120
Kids are jealous.

168
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,000
No no

169
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,120
Women usually say no

170
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,760
she must be

171
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,000
must be very sad and jealous.

172
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,120
You know a lot now, right?

173
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,680
No, no, no.

174
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,000
Leo taught me that.

175
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,680
It has nothing to do with me.

176
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,320
You don't learn well from him every day.

177
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,440
You are jealous.

178
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,560
I'm not jealous.

179
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,640
I'm not jealous.

180
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,760
Jealous. Jealous.

181
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,680
Jealous?

182
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,760
I'm not jealous.

183
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,760
Are you ready?

184
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,760
Yes.

185
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,560
I put the ring in the dessert.

186
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,160
Okay.

187
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,480
After her shoot,

188
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,040
we'll find an excuse to lure her to the rooftop

189
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,120
and prepare a big surprise.

190
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,800
I'm counting on you.

191
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,360
Brother.

192
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,040
What are you two doing?

193
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,800
Are you having an affair?

194
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,240
Who said that?

195
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,240
Okay.

196
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,800
So what you like is to play unnormally.

197
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,360
Most importantly,

198
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,680
I want to be a charming villain.

199
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,360
We have gathered

200
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,560
some questions from netizens.

201
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,360
I want to ask you some questions.

202
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,440
Some netizens said

203
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,160
he dated his boyfriend for a year.

204
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,680
My family urged me to get married.

205
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,800
I don't know how to say no.

206
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,000
What do you think about this question?

207
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,160
I don't think

208
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,920
is not

209
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,240
that I'm willing to.

210
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,120
When I started dating,

211
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,240
it's like a high-speed slide is locked.

212
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,120
Falling rapidly.

213
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,160
When will you get married after you fall in love?

214
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,160
When will you have a baby after you get married?

215
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,440
I have one.

216
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,800
Do we need another one?

217
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,800
When you realize it,

218
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,000
you'll find the brake is out of order.

219
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,920
If you want to get off, you'll get scratched.

220
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,680
or smashed into pieces.

221
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,480
What kind of relationship do you want?

222
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,040
Like a train.

223
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,360
We will meet different people

224
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
in different cars.

225
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,560
We may meet at any time.

226
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
and the freedom to leave.

227
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,920
If your destination is the same,

228
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,800
can you join us?

229
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,360
That's boring.

230
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,680
If the answer is confirmed,

231
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,680
then all we have to do is endure it.

232
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,680
I wish the destination was a secret.

233
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,600
The most important thing is the present.

234
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,440
We care about each other

235
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,240
but we don't.

236
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,440
We have the right to regret.

237
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,920
We want to keep and don't want to take responsibility.

238
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,800
Isn't that too selfish?

239
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,800
I admit that I'm a little selfish in this aspect.

240
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,480
But I'm definitely not perfect.

241
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,600
You can't accept my bad side.

242
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,160
you won't be able to enjoy my good side.

243
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,680
Tang Jiajia.

244
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,680
I finally found you.

245
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,160
Stop.

246
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,800
This is my workplace.

247
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,800
You crossed the line.

248
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,240
Why did you disappear in the last two months?

249
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,360
We were happy before.

250
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,000
We just ate and drank.

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,120
We didn't sign a contract.

252
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,800
We're all free, aren't we?

253
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,800
Jia Jia.

254
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,800
I...

255
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,680
I'm serious about you.

256
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,000
No matter what you do,

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,920
I advise you not to...

258
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,040
Jia Jia.

259
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,680
I officially propose to you today.

260
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,360
Will you marry me?

261
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,160
Can I officially reject you?

262
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,480
If you don't, I won't stand up.

263
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,440
Keep kneeling if you like.

264
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,160
How about I draw a safety line

265
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,800
to surround you.

266
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,680
as a performance art.

267
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,360
Since it's not convenient here,

268
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,560
let's go upstairs and record.

269
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,680
Yes, let's go upstairs.

270
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,800
Is it because of him?

271
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,480
Is he your new boyfriend?

272
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,800
Why are you guys so close?

273
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,680
Wait.

274
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,000
First of all, you're not my boyfriend.

275
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
Second, he's not my boyfriend.

276
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,240
I don't believe it.

277
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,360
You're working together to lie to me.

278
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,680
I know.

279
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,600
You went missing to cheat on me, right?

280
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,360
Think whatever you want.

281
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,040
Aren't you afraid I'll expose you?

282
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,560
You evil woman.

283
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,480
What?

284
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,560
You want to post a slide

285
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,160
and expose my crime online?

286
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,040
Please pick a good one

287
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,800
when you pick the photos.

288
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,920
If you don't have enough materials,

289
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,920
go to my Moments.

290
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,480
Look more.

291
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,920
You're shameless, aren't you?

292
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
I gave you my face.

293
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,480
First of all, you need this face

294
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,040
to be humiliated.

295
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,120
I thought your face

296
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,360
look handsome.

297
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,560
But you came here without saying goodbye.

298
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,240
That means

299
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,920
is the last five minutes you see me.

300
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,600
Go out and turn left.

301
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,680
Four minutes.

302
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,560
The security will be here in one minute.

303
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,600
Okay.

304
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
How dare you!

305
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,800
bully me.

306
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,440
I have to say

307
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,800
Miss Tang Jiajia

308
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,800
is the best.

309
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,480
I was so awkward that I was sweating.

310
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,360
What else?

311
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,160
I'll show you how touched I am.

312
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,440
But I think he dares to do this in public.

313
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,240
Actually, this boy is brave.

314
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,600
He's not brave.

315
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,240
That's called hatred.

316
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,160
What would you do

317
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:24,920
what would you do?

318
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,120
I'll kill him first

319
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,920
and then kill myself.

320
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,680
In the end, our graves

321
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,440
from each other.

322
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,680
So serious?

323
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,440
Luckily, I didn't listen to you.

324
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,800
Fortunately, we have a backup plan.

325
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,680
Death is not scary.

326
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,240
The scariest thing is social death.

327
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,680
I was shocked. Come and eat.

328
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,920
I made it for her.

329
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,040
It's not sweet at all.

330
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,200
She doesn't like sweet food.

331
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,440
Doesn't that girl like the sense of ritual?

332
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,200
It's better not to have an inappropriate sense of ritual.

333
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,560
It's tacky and killing.

334
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,440
There's a kind of thing

335
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,560
in everything

336
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,720
waiting for girls to find it.

337
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,200
Like cake.

338
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Okay, stop it.

339
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,800
My sweat is up again.

340
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,560
I can't make it.

341
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,080
An'an, it doesn't taste good.

342
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,720
I'll get a new one.

343
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,720
Yes.

344
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,840
This is not good.

345
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,000
Lin Hao.

346
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,080
What are you doing?

347
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,600
Nothing. Nothing.

348
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,200
Come and get something for me.

349
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,400
Okay, right away.
