1
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,400
How did you find me?

2
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,200
I'm not here for you.

3
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,400
Then it's fate.

4
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,080
Do you want macarons?

5
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,800
I made it.

6
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,120
You made it?

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,320
You work here.

8
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,800
I'm looking for your manager.

9
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,240
What?

10
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,680
I don't look like Mr. Choi.

11
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,520
Stop it.

12
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,880
Louis Lin, the dessert chef.

13
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,120
Kid.

14
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,640
Do you think you look like Louis?

15
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,920
What do you think

16
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,520
Louis Lin looks like?

17
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,600
I saw him at the party.

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,680
He's much more mature than you.

19
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,079
So that's what you like.

20
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,920
I want to work with him.

21
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:38,920
It's not that I like him.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,720
Let me introduce.

23
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,640
I'm the deputy editor of "Queen",

24
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,520
Xia Anran.

25
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,520
You were much cuter last night.

26
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,320
I...

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,320
I'm not a cute person.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,320
and I've never been loved.

29
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,560
But you...

30
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,160
very cute.

31
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,640
I don't remember last night.

32
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,480
I hope you don't remember.

33
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:26,680
What?

34
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,120
Don't move.

35
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,120
Hello.

36
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,840
Anran,

37
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,840
I'm already at the venue of the hearts Q dinner.

38
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,400
I'll check the details

39
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,800
according to the results later.

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,360
Okay.

41
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,600
Talk to me if you need anything.

42
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,520
You're usually quite busy at work.

43
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,480
Are you close to Louis?

44
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
Give me his number.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,200
Louis

46
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,160
never actively add other people's contact information,

47
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,480
or interviews.

48
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,920
I want to invite him to my dinner.

49
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,000
Give me his number.

50
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,680
I owe you one.

51
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:08,920
Okay.

52
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,760
If you want to see Louis, come with me.

53
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,560
Where are you going?

54
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,560
Your stuff.

55
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,399
I've asked the waiter to put it in the door.

56
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,240
You're good at it.

57
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,680
You smell familiar.

58
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,600
Christian 1.

59
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,480
I should change my perfume.

60
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,040
I don't like to be like others.

61
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,120
Excuse me.

62
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,560
Can I use your phone to make a phone call?

63
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,480
I can't find my phone.

64
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,120
No way.

65
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,040
Is this your trick?

66
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
What do you mean?

67
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
It's all true.

68
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,480
Rebound with sincerity.

69
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,240
Please put it back.

70
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,160
Are you that afraid of taking responsibility?

71
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,560
Do you want to be that responsible?

72
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,680
What?

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,880
You want to chase me?

74
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
will you accept it?

75
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,480
Why is there only half?

76
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,560
I'll give you the other half next time.

77
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,040
If we meet again,

78
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,960
Do you have anything to do or not?

79
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,800
It's my business to relieve stress.

80
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,240
I didn't know you had any stress.

81
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,000
Louis.

82
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,520
You only have eyes for him.

83
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
I'm under a lot of pressure.

84
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,600
Anyway,

85
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,600
I need Louis's contact information

86
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,160
I need Louis's number.

87
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,720
I'll give it to you if you win.

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,800
It's too hot here.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It affects my performance.

90
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,720
Let me do it.

91
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,840
Let me teach you.

92
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,200
Hold it.

93
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
Hold your breath.

94
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,040
Aim at the bullseye.

95
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,760
Three, two, one.

96
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,680
Shoot.

97
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Okay, I got it.

98
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,040
Let's do it again.

99
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:11,920
Come on.

100
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,600
You were having fun just now.

101
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,320
I wanted to beat you.

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,040
Didn't you win?

103
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,320
It's almost time.

104
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,640
This is my name card.

105
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,200
If you can't let me contact Louis,

106
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,320
ask him to contact me.

107
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,880
Aren't you going to ask who I am?

108
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,640
There's no need.

109
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,280
I don't want to know.

110
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,880
Wait for me.

111
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,000
I'll ask Louis to add you.

112
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,440
Here, take it.

113
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,760
Thank you.

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,640
This is yours.

115
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,200
Thank you.

116
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,080
He's quite reliable.

117
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,600
Hello, Louis.

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,040
I'm the deputy editor of "Queen",

119
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,600
Xia Anran.

120
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,320
We sincerely want to invite you

121
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,600
to attend our theme dinner.

122
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,760
I hope we can cooperate in other ways.

123
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,280
I'll send you the details of cooperation and planning.

124
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,320
Kid,

125
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,360
You can't bully her.

126
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,000
You can bully me.

127
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,360
I hope this time

128
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,320
you will remember

129
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,360
Anran.

130
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,360
Anran.

131
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,040
Although dessert is not a new concept,

132
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,920
But the interview of A&H

133
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,800
we care more about young mystery.

134
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,720
And the famous Louis Lin

135
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,280
But if we don't invite Louis Lin

136
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,480
Louis Lin,

137
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,880
I'm afraid it's too late.

138
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,040
Send me the other list after you confirm it.

139
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,880
Okay.

140
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,800
Okay, I'll read it.

141
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,000
Louis.

142
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,240
Can we talk?

143
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,520
I think our voice introduction

144
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,400
our voice introduction.

145
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,640
I can't right now.

146
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,680
It's really hard to talk about.

147
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,240
Let me help you.

148
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
Turn around.

149
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:07,800
Okay.

150
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,000
Why do you work so hard?

151
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,840
Do it yourself.

152
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,080
I need to control every detail of this shop.

153
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,640
How's the preparation for the opening?

154
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,080
I prepared a hidden menu.

155
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,080
Metal and Meizi Pudding.

156
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,040
Why don't you pick one for me?

157
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,840
Wait.

158
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,280
These plums...

159
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,520
from France?

160
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,520
Yes.

161
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,080
Can you consider

162
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,400
your mental capacity?

163
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,600
You can live in the forest in your heart.

164
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,640
I believe you can do it.

165
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,080
You don't have a heart.

166
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:37,840
Forget it.

167
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,640
I'm not in your heart anyway.

168
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,760
It's all about someone.

169
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,120
You're really a kid.

170
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,920
Nonsense.

171
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,480
He's nowhere to be seen.

172
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,680
Louis.

173
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,560
I'm near A&H right now.

174
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,280
If you can, Sung-jin.

175
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,600
If you can,

176
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,280
I’ll go to A&H and explain it to you.

177
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,840
We are really sincere.

178
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,240
Aren't you busy today, Chief Editor Xia?

179
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,600
What brings you here?

180
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,920
Your gallery

181
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,040
is a hot recommendation for our new section.

182
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,560
Sure.

183
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,480
You're one step closer to the position of chief editor.

184
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,920
To be honest, I've been open for so long.

185
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,000
you've been here many times.

186
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
Your colleagues and girls

187
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,040
come to work and take photos more than you.

188
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,440
The number of times doesn't mean anything.

189
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
But quantity changes can cause quality changes.

190
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,000
In a short time,

191
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,360
in a short time,

192
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,120
Is it fate?

193
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,360
Who is it?

194
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,440
Little stray cat.

195
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,840
We meet again.

196
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,880
Right now, you only have the bullseye in your eyes.

197
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,080
Don't hesitate.

198
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,640
That's not right.

199
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,760
Your imagination

200
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,640
is the first sign of Hong Luan Star's movement.

201
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,120
Are you tempted?

202
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,680
I don't even know his name.

203
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,880
I don't really care,

204
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,560
but with your personality,

205
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,960
you didn't recite 8,000 words.

206
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,200
What does he do?

207
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,680
He seems to be

208
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,240
a part-timer.

209
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,880
Little kid.

210
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,880
I didn't mean to hide it from her.

211
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,080
Will she be angry about this?

212
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
Let me tell you.

213
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,440
If you don't seize the chance to show up,

214
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,840
she might not treat you as a man.

215
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,440
You're just a kid, you know?

216
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,080
What should I do?

217
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,240
The contrast can lead to continuous attraction.

218
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,080
Look.

219
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,560
If you were unemployed,

220
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,400
homeless,

221
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,520
Is it attractive?

222
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,440
But if you are a domineering CEO,

223
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,440
and homeless,

224
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,760
I'm curious

225
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,840
if something happened to you.

226
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,080
I feel so sorry for you.

227
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:04,680
A&H.

228
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,080
[A&H]

229
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,000
The domineering president is homeless.

230
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,200
Although you're usually very greasy,

231
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,000
you have a point this time.

232
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,840
Not bad, Xia Anran.

233
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,080
I don't eat tender grass.

234
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,120
I support you.

235
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,200
Forget it.

236
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,640
I don't even have his contact information.

237
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,440
How do you contact him?

238
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,760
Use brain waves.

239
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
I'm at the store now.

240
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,080
It's good not to contact.

241
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,880
Work first.

242
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,640
It's not easy for the old tree to bloom.

243
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
Seize the chance.

244
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,760
Old Tree, you should cherish your work.

245
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,960
Remember to come to the dinner party.

246
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,520
Chef

247
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,000
The dough is ready

248
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,080
Take a look

249
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:58,960
Chef.

250
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,560
The supplier just called to send the raw materials.

251
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,240
I need you to check.

252
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,080
Wait for me.

253
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,440
Chef

254
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,600
A&H

255
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,400
You're here.

256
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,760
You are really Louis.

257
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,080
You're amazing.

258
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
So, stop messing around.

259
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,000
Those who miss us

260
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,640
will be with us like the stars.

261
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,280
You are so nice to me.

262
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,200
I will show up if you miss me.

263
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,400
Then keep your promise.
