1
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,240
Don't! Don't! Don't!

2
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,200
I said no!

3
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,240
I don't want it.

4
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,160
Tang Jiajia.

5
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,360
Just date me.

6
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,080
I promise this time,

7
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,560
there is no package or trick.

8
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,240
No.

9
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,320
Why?

10
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,160
Give me a reason.

11
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,000
You don't look honest.

12
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,240
It's not suitable to stay at home.

13
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,400
Is it my fault that I'm handsome?

14
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,720
You're not humble at all.

15
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,560
Admit your strength bravely.

16
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,680
Don't you like my strength?

17
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,840
It's fun.

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
Just have fun.

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,320
Are you done?

20
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,039
I'm leaving.

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,840
You're going home early to sleep?

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,360
Who told you I'm going home to sleep?

23
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,000
No, you can't leave.

24
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,840
Just give me a chance

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,200
to prove myself.

26
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,960
If it doesn't work,

27
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,919
I'll stay in your gallery.

28
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,000
What do you mean?

29
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,840
I can do it.

30
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,040
One month.

31
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,520
I'll give you one month.

32
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,280
Follow me.

33
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,760
Okay.

34
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,840
Not today.

35
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,960
I'm really

36
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,320
I'm so sleepy that I'm going home to sleep.

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,720
I'm leaving.

38
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,440
Not today.

39
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,960
One more day.

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,160
so nice to me.

41
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,200
Wait for me.

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,600
When a man works hard,

43
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,560
is really handsome.

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,960
How about I set up a stall in front of their gallery

45
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,160
and do some street writing?

46
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,960
Looks like you're serious this time.

47
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
No wonder Elsa said you've evolved.

48
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,320
Have you ever fallen in love at first sight?

49
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,560
Just once.

50
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,680
Her face

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,800
in my mind.

52
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,240
That's so cheesy.

53
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,280
You'd better tell Sister Jia Jia.

54
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,880
Screw you.

55
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,480
By the way, I've been wanting to ask you a question.

56
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,240
Go ahead.

57
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,240
Is it worth giving up

58
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,120
Is it worth it to go back to China for her?

59
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,040
Yes.

60
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,760
Because it's her.

61
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,120
Because it's me.

62
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,400
Why don't you go to her now?

63
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,120
I've been suppressing myself

64
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,560
over 30 times every day.

65
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,120
But I said I won't disturb her.

66
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,600
I'll look for her again.

67
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,000
Isn't that a slap in my face?

68
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,720
And if she misses me,

69
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,440
she will come to me.

70
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,800
Are you sure?

71
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,640
The netizens

72
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,000
are arguing whether you are a puppy

73
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,160
or a puppy.

74
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,800
I think you are a big tail wolf.

75
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,079
No matter what type I am,

76
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,320
she won't think about me at all.

77
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,000
Look.

78
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,360
You're so popular outside.

79
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
But why are you always afraid of her?

80
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,159
When you like someone enough,

81
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,360
you will feel

82
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:36,800
not good enough.

83
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,800
Chief Editor Zhang Ran has been fired.

84
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,080
This incident can stop the loss in time

85
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,800
and restore the reputation of the group.

86
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,520
Xia Anran deserves the credit.

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This incident

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,600
we need our colleagues to work together.

89
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
The new chief editor

90
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,000
will be officially notified soon.

91
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,240
Safe.

92
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
Congratulations in advance.

93
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,360
Thank you for your support, Mr. Zhou.

94
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
I will keep working hard.

95
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,960
From now on,

96
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,120
if anyone dares to abuse power for personal gains,

97
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,560
I won't show mercy.

98
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,800
Okay.

99
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,560
Dismissed.

100
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,480
It's a done deal.

101
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Congratulations, Chief Editor Xia.

102
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,200
All right.

103
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,720
Get back to work.

104
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,480
Okay.

105
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,280
ABC.

106
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,720
Hello?

107
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,120
[Hello?]

108
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,000
I want to ask you out.

109
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,520
I know you're still angry.

110
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,560
I'm not...

111
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,360
No.

112
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,280
But I'm afraid if I don't say it today,

113
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,920
I won't have the courage tomorrow.

114
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,200
Are you drunk?

115
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,520
No, I'm sober.

116
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,680
I'm actually quite timid.

117
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,200
I'm afraid of everything that will expire.

118
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,720
I'm afraid it'll expire if I wait.

119
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,680
So I want to ask you out.

120
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,480
I don't have time.

121
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
I'm always here.

122
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,200
It won't expire.

123
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,560
You miss me?

124
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,480
Let's meet and talk.

125
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,000
I told you.

126
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,120
I only show up

127
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,720
when you miss me the most.

128
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,040
I'll wait for you at the aquarium.

129
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,320
Come if you want.

130
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
I'll send you the location.

131
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,040
Good night.

132
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,480
Hello?

133
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,000
Mom, look, that's huge.

134
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,920
Slow down.

135
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,000
Isn't it pretty? Look at that.

136
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,960
Look at that.

137
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,800
Look at this.

138
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,680
It's pretty.

139
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,800
Hey.

140
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,800
What?

141
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,600
An Ran.

142
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,680
This is the last letter your father left you.

143
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,800
And this cake.

144
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,560
He told me

145
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,480
to meet him

146
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,799
for you

147
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,559
I'll give you the cake for him.

148
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,919
You're still like this.

149
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,799
You're irresponsible.

150
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,440
Will you make up for me

151
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,680
Can you make it up to me?

152
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Don't eat if you don't want to.

153
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,760
Just say no.

154
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,760
Why do you

155
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,000
push yourself?

156
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,200
When I was young,

157
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,000
every time my dad sent me to your house,

158
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,880
I was afraid that he would pick me up.

159
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,560
Every time I'm at your house,

160
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,440
I'm afraid that my parents won't like me

161
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,760
your parents won't like me.

162
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,000
Now,

163
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,320
I'm afraid

164
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,320
I can't eat the cake anymore.

165
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,320
Are you really going to ignore me?

166
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,760
An'an,

167
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,000
I really don't know

168
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,680
what you've been through.

169
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,000
I blamed you for not eating desserts.

170
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,560
I was angry and ignored you.

171
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,560
Sorry, An.

172
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,560
I'm really sorry.

173
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,240
An'an,

174
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,120
If you don't see it now,

175
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,560
What if you regret it later?

176
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,120
That's not important.

177
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,120
When my dad bought me a cake,

178
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,560
I thought it was the sweetest reward.

179
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,360
Later I found out

180
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,440
cake was just a tool for him to dissuade me.

181
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,560
Every time my dad bought me a cake,

182
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,240
and sent me to your home,

183
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,640
to get me far enough

184
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,920
he could bring another woman home.

185
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,120
Then I stopped eating cake.

186
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,240
When I see the cake,

187
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,880
I feel disgusted

188
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,120
because of that feeling.

189
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,920
I'm going to say this today.

190
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,360
I can let it go in the future.

191
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,920
But this time,

192
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,920
my home

193
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,040
It's really gone.

194
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,040
Why don't you have a home?

195
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,360
You still have me.

196
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,920
An, I'll always be with you.

197
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,240
An.

198
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,360
Let's go home.

199
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,240
Can you promise me

200
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,240
promise me

201
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,920
Be happy or not,

202
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,720
tell me.

203
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,160
Now I'm sure

204
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,360
love is sweet.

205
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,160
I like this taste.

206
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,640
I thought I left the abyss of misfortune

207
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,320
I finally met a perfect love.

208
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,040
step by step to my happiness.

209
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,040
Love is like a cream cake in summer.

210
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,840
The first second I took it out of the window

211
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,920
started to melt.

212
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,080
It's like love bumps into each other in the real world.

213
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,440
in the real world.

214
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,560
Let's break up.

215
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,800
Xia Anran, are you crazy?

216
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,040
You have to give me a reason.

217
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,560
That's the reason.

218
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,040
No matter how thick the sugar coat is,

219
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,640
When the knife pierced into the heart,

220
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,440
the pain will not fade.

221
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,920
The beginning of every beautiful story

222
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,960
The tragedy is counting down.

223
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,040
I'd rather

224
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,000
never start.
