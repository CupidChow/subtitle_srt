1
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,960
Aren't you a motorcycle driver?

2
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,520
Don't worry.

3
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,440
I didn't steal this car.

4
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,520
What do you think?

5
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,760
Do you believe that I'm Louis now?

6
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,440
What are you doing?

7
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,200
The shoes are broken.

8
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,039
I'm done.

9
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,120
Xia Anran.

10
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,560
Did you miss me?

11
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,200
This time,

12
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,000
Don't say you don't remember.

13
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,520
Louis.

14
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,560
Let's talk about work first.

15
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,120
Can we only talk about work?

16
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,160
I want to invite you

17
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,680
to attend our hearts Q dinner.

18
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,440
Why me?

19
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,680
Because our magazine

20
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,120
created a new electronic magazine.

21
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,320
It matches your brand concept very well.

22
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,040
Simply put,

23
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,680
your new media has good data.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,960
We also need

25
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
that no one has ever done.

26
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,920
So straightforward.

27
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:48,440
Yes.

28
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
What if I disagree?

29
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,160
I hope you know

30
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,640
we are very sincere to cooperate with you.

31
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,520
Is it you or you?

32
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,600
Can we talk about work first?

33
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,520
Our store is busy preparing for the opening.

34
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,440
And my investor and I

35
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,200
with my investor.

36
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,400
I need to think about it.

37
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,720
Okay.

38
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,280
No problem.

39
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,520
I'll leave you ten minutes in the process.

40
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
in the process.

41
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,160
Think about the moment before the party starts.

42
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,920
Are you done?

43
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,960
Let's go eat. Okay.

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,680
Louis.

45
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,840
Thank you for your time.

46
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,720
Nice to meet you.

47
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,680
But I have to work overtime. I have to go.

48
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,360
Let me give you a ride.

49
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,360
No.

50
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,600
I look forward to your answer.

51
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,520
Leo was right.

52
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Women are so quick-tempered.

53
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,440
Now the domineering president's image is stable.

54
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,440
Now we have nowhere to go.

55
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,240
Okay, we've finished our three targets.

56
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
Next, let's talk about the interview.

57
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,680
In the past year,

58
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,520
in the past year.

59
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,600
Louis.

60
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,680
I don't know what you're thinking.

61
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,680
You can talk to me if you need anything.

62
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,760
Anytime.

63
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,880
I will send some desserts tomorrow.

64
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,760
As A&H and hearts Q,

65
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,080
the first round of official cooperation.

66
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:27,960
Okay.

67
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,760
I'll send you the contract right away.

68
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,120
Will you come?

69
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,680
Did you miss me?

70
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,800
When you miss me enough,

71
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,880
I'll show up.

72
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,880
What the hell?

73
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,880
It's okay. Go on.

74
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,960
We'll try to

75
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,440
we'll discuss our opinions

76
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,440
Let the host review the process.

77
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,400
and confirm the number of guests.

78
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,680
Louis won't come.

79
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,400
I'll stall him

80
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
as much time as I can.

81
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,080
Before I get off,

82
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,760
Go to Plan B before he arrives.

83
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,960
Okay.

84
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,320
Welcome to

85
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,680
to the host of

86
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,960
the theme night of hearts.

87
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,080
Let's welcome our deputy editor,

88
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,760
the initiator of this event,

89
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,240
to give a speech.

90
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,600
Welcome.

91
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,320
Tonight our theme is "Q of hearts".

92
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,240
Why is it called this theme?

93
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,880
As you all know,

94
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,880
In order to cater to the new media era,

95
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,080
our magazine created

96
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,520
an electronic magazine about fashion lifestyle.

97
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,240
It's called "Heart Q".

98
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,320
Heart Q is a female trump card in cards.

99
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,200
It represents passionate romance and warmth.

100
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,080
It also represents

101
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,880
the pursuit of life quality and lifestyle.

102
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,160
is the incarnation of hope and persistence.

103
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,680
Now, let’s welcome our final performance.

104
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,200
Hello, I’m the supervisor of A&H.

105
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,760
Louis Lin.

106
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,600
It's an honor to receive the invitation

107
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,040
Ms. Xia Anran.

108
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,360
Tonight's theme is hearts Q.

109
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,360
The starting point of life is love.

110
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,640
This is the reason I chose French dessert.

111
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,680
I chose French dessert.

112
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,440
because of a love for someone important.

113
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,040
I hope this sweet surprise

114
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,360
can make you enjoy

115
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,480
this beautiful night.

116
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,920
Okay.

117
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,200
After eating this dessert,

118
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,159
I dare say

119
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,560
the women who pursue him can line up from here to the triumphant gate.

120
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,880
How can you say so much without seeing him?

121
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,160
What a imagination.

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,320
I don't like it.

123
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,000
You've seen it before?

124
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,000
You almost saw it.

125
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,680
In my house.

126
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,600
A stray cat.

127
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,440
A stray cat becomes a client.

128
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,880
Interesting.

129
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,480
I'm digesting it too.

130
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,720
This woman really likes to steal.

131
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,840
Why don't you rush to reincarnate?

132
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,680
With her worldly bottom line,

133
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,120
She's really something.

134
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,440
We both don't have one.

135
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,159
Can't you see the name on the name tag?

136
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,600
If you don't take someone else's place,

137
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,760
if you don't take someone else's position?

138
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,160
The last project Amanda invested

139
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,440
was Mr. Hua's.

140
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,400
Really?

141
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:02,920
Yeah.

142
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,120
This is going to be interesting.

143
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,840
They're going to match.

144
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,200
Lower your voice.

145
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,160
Mr. Hua, you are here.

146
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,440
Please come with me.

147
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,200
I don't need your help.

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,560
Ms. Jiang from the film group.

149
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,600
wants to know you.

150
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,760
Let me introduce.

151
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,280
Mr. Hua.

152
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,280
It seems that you don't know what's going on.

153
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,720
I'm the Honorary Director of "Queen".

154
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,880
Can't you be more casual at your own dinner?

155
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm ignorant.

156
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,280
Your grading is too fast.

157
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,880
The connection network is too complicated.

158
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,559
I can't remember.

159
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,600
Amanda.

160
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,880
That is the seat arranged by the board of directors.

161
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,760
Could you please move a bit?

162
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,400
Which seat?

163
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,720
is decided by people,

164
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,720
not you, right?

165
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,280
Deputy Editor Xia.

166
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,640
Mr. Hua, have a seat.

167
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,040
I'll invite Ms. Jiang over for you.

168
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,200
By the way,

169
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,960
I’m an investor of A&H.

170
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,000
Whether there is A&H in this activity

171
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,880
is also up to me.

172
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,120
not you.

173
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,320
You're an investor.

174
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,160
Hello, Chief Editor Xia.

175
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,320
Nice to meet you again.

176
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,680
Why don't we find a quiet place

177
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,160
and talk about our collaboration?

178
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,880
Okay.

179
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,320
Things are getting more interesting.

180
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,640
Safe.

181
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,000
Shelley.

182
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,440
A warm bed with a comfortable tongue.

183
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,240
Try it.

184
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,440
You know I don't eat desserts.

185
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,000
Chief Editor Xia has made a good arrangement.

186
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,080
It's delicious.

187
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,200
How many did you eat?

188
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,120
The second one.

189
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,200
I have to get it later.

190
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,760
Where is he?

191
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,440
Who are you looking for?

192
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,320
No one.

193
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,080
I've talked to the director.

194
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,680
He'll fly back next month

195
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,000
to shoot a theme video.

196
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,680
I may not be there then.

197
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,200
Prepare the translation in advance.

198
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,320
Okay, let me know if you need anything.

199
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,080
Louis.

200
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,200
Hey.

201
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
[Why are you at my house?]

202
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,320
The person I miss

203
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,080
will be with you like a star.

204
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,200
Like this.

205
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,320
Do you remember?

206
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,200
An'an.

207
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,000
Louis Lin.

208
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,120
Those who miss us

209
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,560
will be with us like the stars.

210
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,560
I'll show up if you miss me.

211
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,120
I told you.

212
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,880
when you miss me enough,

213
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I will appear.

214
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,600
Are you Lin Hao?

215
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,480
Hello, mom. What's wrong?

216
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,040
Xia Anran.

217
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,240
Are you going to heaven if you don't answer my call?

218
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,080
I just got home. I'm working overtime.

219
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,200
Aren't you on a trip?

220
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,480
Why do you have time to contact me?

221
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,240
Do you remember

222
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,720
there was a little boy named Hao Hao next door?

223
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,520
Do you remember?

224
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,720
What's wrong with that snot bug?

225
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,080
Right, snot bug.

226
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,600
You were so cute back then.

227
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,280
Mom, get to the point.

228
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,400
Here's the thing.

229
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,520
He has returned to China

230
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,600
and has no place to stay.

231
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,840
I was thinking about staying at your house.

232
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,480
There are so many houses. He has nowhere to live.

233
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,960
It's not the same living outside.

234
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,040
Let me tell you.

235
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,400
He's my godson.

236
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,720
That's your brother.

237
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,480
Do you want your brother to be homeless?

238
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,920
It's a deal.

239
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,920
Let him stay at your house.

240
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,600
Why did you decide without discussing with me?

241
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,040
You didn't answer my calls.

242
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,400
Where can I discuss with you?

243
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,480
I...

244
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,080
Mom, wait a minute.

245
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,600
I have a work call. Talk to you later.
