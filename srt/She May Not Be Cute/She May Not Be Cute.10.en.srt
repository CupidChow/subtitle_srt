00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,000
Li Wenhan: Hello. Hello. Hello.

2
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,880
I really appreciate

3
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,440
for everything you've done for me.

4
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,480
If it's possible,

5
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,680
you don't have to thank me.

6
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,080
I'm not doing this for you.

7
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,479
I'm doing this to become the chief editor.

8
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,400
You know me well.

9
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,400
Now it seems

10
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,880
It's nice to have a little brother

11
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:46,800
I'm sleepy.

12
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
I'm going to bed.

13
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,800
You too.

14
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,759
The way I look now

15
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
I used to

16
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,759
I hated the most.

17
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,520
I know it's not a flutter.

18
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,400
but fear.

19
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,880
Because his eyes were too serious.

20
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,640
Because

21
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,800
I don't know how to love anymore.

22
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,960
Did you sleep well?

23
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,560
Yes, I got up late.

24
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,840
Let's eat.

25
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,840
No, I'm late.

26
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,480
Why are you wearing high shoes again?

27
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,240
There's an important meeting today.

28
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,120
I'll announce the new editor.

29
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,480
Can't I be the queen without high heels?

30
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,120
Have you ever seen anyone without a knife on the battlefield?

31
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,040
Here.

32
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,880
By the way,

33
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,400
Jia Jia has a party tonight.

34
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,560
Come together if you're free.

35
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,560
Okay, I'll take Shen Yu with me.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,120
Okay, see you tonight.

37
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,200
Wait.

38
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,560
Bye.

39
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,480
See you tonight.

40
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,840
The paintings in the warehouse

41
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,760
Sort them out first.

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,400
Then look at tomorrow.

43
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll deliver it myself.

44
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,680
Personal customized service.

45
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,400
Thank you so much.

46
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,360
I thought

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
you wanted to invite me to dinner.

48
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,680
I'm sure Ms. Shim has a full schedule.

49
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,760
You can't make an appointment on that day.

50
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,000
Nice drawing.

51
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,560
Don't get me wrong.

52
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
I didn't.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,480
It has nothing to do with me

54
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
has nothing to do with me.

55
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,680
But...

56
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,000
I thought about it.

57
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,680
I won't go back to France.

58
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,240
Are you going to say it's because of me?

59
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,600
If I have to say

60
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
because of you?

61
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,960
We're just acting partners.

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,159
We don't have the right to criticize him.

63
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,600
Don't scare me.

64
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,520
I haven't finished your portrait.

65
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,440
Are you coming to my studio tonight?

66
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,600
Leave it.

67
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,600
I'm going on a business trip.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,159
When your paintings are sold,

69
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,240
I'll ask someone to contact you.

70
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,360
When are you leaving?

71
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,159
Tonight.

72
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,720
Hey, Louis.

73
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,440
Send me the address tonight.

74
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,960
Yes.

75
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,800
That night,

76
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,880
you two reunited after a long time.

77
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,600
Louis, let me tell you.

78
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,880
Not many people can draw my portrait.

79
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,160
Your Xia Anran

80
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,440
should not be one of them.

81
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
Think about how to make it up to me.

82
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,920
What kind of love is this?

83
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,360
It's scary.

84
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,520
I can't see him anymore.

85
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,000
Hello, Anran.

86
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,200
Tonight,

87
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,040
ask your little Lin Hao to bring more friends.

88
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,040
The more the better.

89
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,360
Got it. I've arranged everything for you.

90
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,360
It's not announced yet.

91
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,080
Almost.

92
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,360
Did you wear the high heels I gave you?

93
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,240
Let me see.

94
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,920
Not bad.

95
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,720
Put on another lipstick.

96
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,640
You're the fashion devil

97
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,240
in the movie.

98
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,480
Tonight's party

99
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,920
as your celebration party.

100
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,520
It's not announced yet.

101
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,600
Isn't the atmosphere team going up too early?

102
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,600
You went back to the front line

103
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,520
after the surgery.

104
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,320
Also,

105
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,040
have you taken annual leave in the past few years?

106
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,360
If it weren't for you,

107
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,240
your boss was blinded by oil.

108
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,520
The Queen will go bankrupt tomorrow.

109
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
I have to go.

110
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,240
See you tonight.

111
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,800
Anran.

112
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,160
The chairman is coming.

113
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,240
We'll start in ten minutes.

114
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,440
Which meeting room?

115
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,520
Armanda said he's not in the meeting room this time.

116
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,360
He will announce the good news

117
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
in the construction area.

118
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,360
Okay.

119
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,600
Anything else?

120
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,159
Anran, I know you don’t like flowers,

121
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,520
I still want to congratulate you first.

122
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,800
Thank you.

123
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
Congratulations in advance.

124
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,160
Congratulations, Editor-in-Chief.

125
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,600
It must be you, Anran.

126
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,040
Yes. Who else could it be?

127
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,880
The president is here.

128
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,200
The launch of the Heart Q

129
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,360
is very successful.

130
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,760
In the field of traditional paper media,

131
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,520
in traditional paper media.

132
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,000
Here,

133
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,920
I'd like to express my gratitude

134
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,240
for your hard work.

135
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,800
As we all know,

136
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,360
The Queen has been in the industry

137
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,640
has always been leading the industry.

138
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,600
But the media is in a new era.

139
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,320
We need a young

140
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,080
and more energetic navigator.

141
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,040
to lead "Queen" to the next 20 years

142
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,040
30 or even longer,

143
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,320
I'll always be in the front of the industry.

144
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,720
On behalf of the board,

145
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
on behalf of the board.

146
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,320
the new chief editor of "Queen" is

147
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,200
Mr. Zhang Ran.

148
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,720
Congratulations.

149
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,360
I believe

150
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,720
everyone is familiar with Mr. Zhang.

151
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,320
He worked so hard

152
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,200
from V.

153
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,240
He's also the best in the industry.

154
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,000
I believe he will lead you

155
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,000
to lead "Queen" to the front of the industry.

156
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,760
Okay. First of all, it's an honor

157
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,320
to come to our "Queen" family.

158
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,080
I hope we can work together in the future.

159
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,159
Cheers.

160
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,480
Brother, sit here.

161
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,000
One more.

162
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,360
Where is the kid I asked you to bring?

163
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,640
He'll be here soon.

164
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,360
There should be a traffic jam.

165
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,720
By the way, did she contact you?

166
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
I can't reach her.

167
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,200
He must be driving.

168
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,720
Just wait.

169
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,160
Handsome.

170
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Let's have a drink.

171
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,360
No, no.

172
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,760
Your friend won't be as obedient as you, right?

173
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,160
That's boring.

174
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,800
Anyway, I think you two

175
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,040
like old friends at first sight.

176
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,240
Really?

177
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,920
I'm looking forward to it.

178
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,640
[The number you have dialled...]

179
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,880
Why isn't she picking up?

180
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,960
Did he go straight to the celebration party?

181
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,840
No way.

182
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,960
She should've told us.

183
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,440
Something's wrong.

184
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,960
I announced the selection of editor-in-chief this morning.

185
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,760
You haven't posted it on Moments yet?

186
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,720
Or is there an emergency in the company?

187
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,840
Amy.

188
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,960
Hello, I'm Louis.

189
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,640
Is Chief Editor Xia here?

190
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,960
I want to share some new ideas with her.

191
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,880
Can you let her answer the phone?

192
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,440
Anran applied for leave.

193
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,720
Vacation?

194
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,320
Didn't you just announce

195
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,400
the new chief editor?

196
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,840
Why is the afternoon off?

197
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,440
Armanda and the boss

198
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,840
announced the new editor-in-chief.

199
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,400
But it's not Anran.

200
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,280
What?

201
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,520
Are you crazy?

202
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,720
Is the boss blind?

203
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,000
An'an.

204
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
Are you home?

205
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,840
An'an.

206
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,520
An'an.

207
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,280
Are you okay?

208
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,440
I'm fine.

209
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
We're not kids anymore.

210
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,880
You didn't eat?

211
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,000
I'll do it.

212
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,160
Let me do it.

213
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,560
No, I'll do it.

214
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,160
I need someone to teach me

215
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,720
to cook noodles now?

216
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,400
I'm sorry.

217
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,560
No matter what happens,

218
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll be with you.

219
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,160
If you want to cry,

220
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,560
just cry.

221
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,200
I won't look.

222
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,400
I used to tell myself

223
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,280
if I stop for a second,

224
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm wasting time.

225
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,400
So I worked hard.

226
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,080
I can't roll it up again.

227
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,440
to prove that I'm worth it.

228
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,520
But they always have other choices.

229
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,000
When I was young, my dad bought me a cake.

230
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,440
I lied to myself.

231
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,200
That's love.

232
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,440
When it comes to work,

233
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,760
Every time my boss acknowledges me,

234
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,760
I lied to myself. That was a promise.

235
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,200
I always believe the pastries that others drew for me.

236
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,200
Today I realized

237
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,160
it wasn't anyone else's fault.

238
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,400
I always lie to myself.

239
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,720
Did you see the flowers?

240
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,000
My colleague

241
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,520
to congratulate me.

242
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,720
They didn't want me to be sad,

243
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,720
so they threw it away.

244
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,000
But I still picked it up.

245
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,840
Do you know why?

246
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,320
Because it reminded me

247
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,200
I live like a joke.

248
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:09,960
An'an,

249
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,280
When you can't stand it,

250
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,200
run away.

251
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,280
Escaping is shameful.

252
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,520
but it works.

253
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,320
An'an,

254
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,080
Let's elope.

255
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,760
Now!

256
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
I'm in trouble.

257
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,640
Mom will scold me to death.

258
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,880
Okay.

259
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,160
Stop crying.

260
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,160
I'll take you to elope.

261
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,280
Then you won't be scolded by your aunt.

262
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,160
elope.

263
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,320
What is elope?

264
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,680
It means we run away.
