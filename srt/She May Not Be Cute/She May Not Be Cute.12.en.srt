1
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,320
Bye.

2
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,080
I didn't hit you hard last night.

3
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,960
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,880
It's okay if you don't forgive me.

5
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
I'm not mad at you.

6
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,720
I owe you a favor.

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,400
Just let me know if you need help.

8
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,640
You know.

9
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,400
I won't be mad at you.

10
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,320
That's good. I...

11
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,080
Bye.

12
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,240
Well...

13
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,080
Don't you have anything else to say to me?

14
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,800
It's nice to meet you.

15
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,039
Have a safe trip back to France.

16
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,840
Bye.

17
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,680
Let me help you.

18
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,360
No need.

19
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,200
Bye.

20
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
Lin Hao.

21
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,720
Don't put so much

22
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,360
don't put it so high.

23
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,720
An'an,

24
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,880
do you have something important

25
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,680
something important?

26
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,480
I'll wash the cup first.

27
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,079
Are you rejecting me?

28
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,440
No.

29
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,480
I...

30
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,560
You didn't reject me.

31
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,400
You really like me.

32
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,680
I need to take this call.

33
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,720
Hello, senior.

34
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,160
Are you back?

35
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,440
I'm back.

36
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,760
I'm downstairs.

37
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,800
I was just passing by.

38
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,400
I want to get you something.

39
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,320
Sure.

40
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,480
I'll get it now.

41
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:17,960
I'll go.

42
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
Thank you for your concern.

43
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,840
I went out with her for a walk.

44
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,760
She's much happier now.

45
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,040
Having a younger brother

46
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,200
who cares so much about her.

47
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,320
Anran must be very happy.

48
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,840
She's really happy.

49
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,200
But when it comes to

50
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,400
can only be done occasionally.

51
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,640
I can't do this every day.

52
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,400
We still have reality

53
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
waiting for us to face.

54
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,040
None of your business.

55
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,920
Did she say she likes you?

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,400
That's our tacit understanding.

57
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,120
Have you ever thought

58
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,120
that she didn't promise you clearly?

59
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,400
is a kind of rejection.

60
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,000
She's still hesitating

61
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,760
because you're her brother.

62
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,480
She's afraid of hurting you.

63
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,000
You know her so well.

64
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,920
You should know her straightforwardness.

65
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,200
This is also a tacit understanding.

66
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,400
right?

67
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,560
If you really like her,

68
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,960
you should think about

69
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,640
what is the best for her.

70
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Then you will know

71
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,040
what is the best for her?

72
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,560
There are some soups to calm her nerves.

73
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
She has something on her mind recently.

74
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,640
No matter what happens during the day,

75
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,480
I won't be able to rest well at night.

76
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,280
And some information.

77
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,400
If you want to resign,

78
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,640
or continue to study,

79
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,360
you can have a better choice.

80
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Don't you know?

81
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:07,880
Coca.

82
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,280
No matter what choice she makes,

83
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,360
I will be with her.

84
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,480
Can you really get a girlfriend first?

85
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,120
I wish you

86
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,560
Good luck.

87
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,000
or N.

88
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,360
An.

89
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
I have something to tell you.

90
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,680
I...

91
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,960
I'm sleepy.

92
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,800
Maybe another day.

93
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,520
Are you afraid of hurting me?

94
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,480
Why are you running away from your heart?

95
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,680
Lin Hao, can you be realistic?

96
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,960
Stop messing around.

97
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,520
We're not kids anymore.

98
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,680
I know what you care about the most.

99
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,080
An'an,

100
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,040
I'll give you some space.

101
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,240
Give us some time.

102
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,760
Okay?

103
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,240
I'm leaving.

104
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,040
When?

105
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,800
Leo is waiting for me in the underground parking lot.

106
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
Take care of yourself.

107
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,400
Lin Hao.

108
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,760
Wait.

109
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,080
You...

110
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,960
Tell me when you settle down.

111
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,360
Why are you working so hard lately?

112
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,520
You look for investors, lawyers and sales.

113
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,800
as busy as a top.

114
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,360
I have new plans and ideas about the store.

115
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,520
For Xia Anran,

116
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,960
for our independence.

117
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
Your daily necessities.

118
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,080
What about the previous ones?

119
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,840
at her home.

120
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,040
In her house.

121
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,880
[I miss you.]

122
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,040
Louis.

123
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,760
Just admit it.

124
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,760
You're so evil.

125
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,960
How long has Lin Hao been gone?

126
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,080
More than half a month.

127
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,080
How can you just move out?

128
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,080
It's yours.

129
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,080
No way.

130
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,200
He's my brother.

131
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,520
He almost writes his feelings for you on his face.

132
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,720
What are you thinking?

133
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,280
It's fake to say you don't feel anything.

134
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,640
Does he know?

135
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,400
I never wanted to be with him.

136
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,280
And he has been abroad for so many years.

137
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,520
his dependence on me

138
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,960
is just

139
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,840
on the basis of childhood memories.

140
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,640
We're not siblings.

141
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,400
It's not illegal.

142
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,640
Why can't you

143
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,280
as a man?

144
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,400
You said many things in this world are strange.

145
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,840
For example, the wine in the glass

146
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,040
It's safe in the glass.

147
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,640
But when it spills,

148
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,280
it will become a trouble.

149
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,840
I think that's how I feel.

150
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,840
I'm afraid if I say it out,

151
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,840
everything will go out of control.

152
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,840
Don't think too much.

153
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,520
How do you know if you don't try?

154
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,400
I refuse to start.

155
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,520
I'm afraid it'll end.

156
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,200
Come on.

157
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
If you don't make a decision,

158
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
May I ask you about astronomy?

159
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,960
You carry this with you?

160
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,760
Take one.

161
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,760
Eight Holy Grail.

162
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,200
The key word for this card is separation, change,

163
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,640
Reason and emotions.

164
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,520
I can see

165
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,600
Here is

166
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,520
the sun and the moon.

167
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Which side will take the lead?

168
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,280
Is it your mind

169
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,280
or your instincts?

170
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,280
Under the moonlight,

171
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,600
heroes will leave his familiar environment

172
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,520
He needs to follow his instinct.

173
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,400
You're looking for a new route.

174
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,280
You can see

175
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,040
this card is reverse.

176
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
It means

177
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,760
logic can't be solved.

178
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,400
A rational choice

179
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,960
may make you feel

180
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,400
you can control the situation.

181
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,520
But the only thing

182
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,840
is your instinct.

183
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Really?

184
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Then count yourself.

185
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,280
You don't understand.

186
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,200
Master never helps himself.

187
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,720
It's all about

188
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,280
who are lost.

189
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
You're in love, aren't you?

190
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,720
Master.

191
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
Am I crazy?

192
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,760
Why did I have this dream?

193
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,320
Anran,

194
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,080
You are back from your vacation.

195
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,200
Good morning, Anran.

196
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,840
Good morning, Annie. Good morning.

197
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,560
Annie.

198
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,520
We are not allowed to participate in the review,

199
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,000
the hot sections

200
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,200
the hot sections

201
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,320
were taken away by the new editor-in-chief.

202
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,200
Welcome back, Deputy Editor.

203
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,440
My vacation was sudden.

204
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
I thought

205
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,080
you weren't going to come back.

206
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,840
We didn't find time

207
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,080
to get to know each other.

208
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,520
We still have a lot of time to spend together.

209
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,200
We have a second trial.

210
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,320
Goodbye.

211
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,880
By the way,

212
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,080
I'm here.

213
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,120
I don't think you need to attend

214
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,560
I don't think you need to attend.

215
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,640
I'll get going.

216
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,520
It's just a piece of work.

217
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,320
Just do your job well.

218
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,200
Okay.

219
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,560
Everything is fine. Don't worry.

220
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,680
Don't worry.

221
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,080
Change careers

222
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,080
No.

223
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,840
You said you didn't miss me.

224
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,440
Ronghao.

225
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,960
Why don't you go home?

226
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,080
You never go home.

227
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,760
You're a man.

228
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,000
doing here every day?

229
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,000
Peeping.

230
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,560
There are so many stalkers these days.

231
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,320
I don't know why.

232
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,200
Let's go.

233
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,200
Stalker.

234
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,720
Me?
