1
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,160
Hao Hao.

2
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,560
Come here.

3
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,039
Have a seat.

4
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,080
Everyone is here.

5
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,480
Godmother.

6
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,840
Didn't we agree

7
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
to have a happy meal together?

8
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
Why are there outsiders?

9
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,200
Don't say that.

10
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,200
If we communicate more during dinner,

11
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,520
we might become a family.

12
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,200
Right?

13
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,360
Ding.

14
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
Let me introduce.

15
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,759
This is my godson, Hao Hao.

16
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,160
Hello.

17
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,960
We meet again.

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,160
Dr Ding.

19
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,800
You're usually quite free.

20
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
You're everywhere.

21
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,479
Auntie.

22
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,640
I met my brother once at Anran's house.

23
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,280
I thought he was Anran's cousin.

24
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,320
I'm not related to her.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,640
Have you been to Anran's house?

26
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,479
Yes.

27
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,160
Yes.

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,280
Mom.

29
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,640
He only cures his cervical spine.

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,160
so that he won't curse me?

31
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,600
It can not only cure your neck.

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,560
Let's play basketball.

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,240
Take a walk.

34
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,920
Fixing the pipe.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm always here for you.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,840
If you need me,

37
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,920
I don't need you to say that.

38
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,120
Hao Hao.

39
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,440
I know you are very capable.

40
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,480
But you can't

41
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,000
you can't be so capable.

42
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,360
Aunt.

43
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,560
Call me if you feel unwell.

44
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,440
I'll arrange it.

45
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,120
My taste is really...

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,440
You're right.

47
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,480
A reliable doctor like you

48
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,000
is hard to find.

49
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,880
Didn't you text me

50
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,520
that there would be a surprise?

51
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,240
This is...

52
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,520
He is not. I am.

53
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,600
You're all scared.

54
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,400
By the way,

55
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,400
Cousin.

56
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,240
I ate the cake from the opera theater.

57
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,880
It's as good as what I ate in France.

58
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,880
Thanks.

59
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,560
It's not for you.

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,320
Am I stealing her love?

61
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,960
I made it for her.

62
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,880
She can give it to anyone.

63
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,800
I can make it for her when she wants it.

64
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,320
Really?

65
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,400
Why do I remember it's safe?

66
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,680
doesn't seem to eat sweets.

67
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,040
That's because you don't know

68
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,880
when she was young.

69
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,320
It's safe.

70
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,079
You're blushing when you see Dr Ding.

71
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,520
I...

72
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,680
It's hot.

73
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,160
Okay.

74
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,240
Yes.

75
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,520
She doesn't like hot food.

76
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,520
Have some celery.

77
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,960
Lin Hao.

78
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,440
I forgot to close the window.

79
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,440
Close it for me.

80
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,240
Come with me.

81
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,520
No, no, no.

82
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,320
I'll go with you.

83
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,320
Hurry up.

84
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:13,960
Come on.

85
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,440
No, I...

86
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,120
Come on.

87
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,839
Let's go.

88
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,640
You two

89
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,040
communicate more.

90
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:20,920
Let's go.

91
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,240
Communicate more.

92
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,920
Hurry up.

93
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,480
My mom seems to like you.

94
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,520
Isn't that my honor?

95
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,080
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,240
for making you come here.

97
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,240
Then don't waste this trip.

98
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,240
Let's get to know each other again, Miss Xia.

99
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,600
No wonder aunts like you so much.

100
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,400
You really are an auntie killer.

101
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,880
Why do I feel that

102
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,080
not complimenting me?

103
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,240
What's wrong?

104
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:58,920
Stomachache.

105
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,440
I'm fine. Maybe I ate too fast.

106
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Waiter, a glass of water.

107
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,720
You walk fast, brother.

108
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,520
Uncle, you have good legs.

109
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,240
Our doctors usually walk like this.

110
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,960
And Anran and I often play basketball together.

111
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,160
This amount of exercise is nothing.

112
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,440
You should walk slowly.

113
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,680
I'm slow enough.

114
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,680
Don't you know that tall people

115
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,960
have long legs?

116
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,160
Mom

117
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,960
You're really something.

118
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,400
You even set of equipment.

119
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,400
Is this what you put in Lin Hao's car?

120
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes, it's beautiful.

121
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,640
You and Dr Ding are a perfect match.

122
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,560
No, I can't walk anymore.

123
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,440
Take a break.

124
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,280
I can't do it either.

125
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,400
You two are getting along quite quickly.

126
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,720
Excuse me.

127
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
Excuse me.

128
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,560
Hao Hao.

129
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,280
Do you think Dr Ding

130
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,120
is obviously interested in your sister?

131
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,400
Is it obvious?

132
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,560
Why do I feel like he's looking at you?

133
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,840
What do you mean?

134
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,320
Ma'am.

135
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,360
You must be tired.

136
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,800
Have some water.

137
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,920
Thank you.

138
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,720
Dr Ding, you're so sweet.

139
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,920
It's nice.

140
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,400
It's safe.

141
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,480
The company decided to hold

142
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,640
a group meeting.

143
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,640
I have to go.

144
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,520
You're working overtime on weekends?

145
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,640
An unreasonable request.

146
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,800
You have to learn to refuse, you know?

147
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,640
Be safe. Work is more important.

148
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,400
Let me give you a ride.

149
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,760
No need.

150
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,920
I can give her a ride.

151
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
I know how to get to the magazine.

152
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,800
I'll see her off.

153
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,240
Okay.

154
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,240
Thank you.

155
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,920
Take your hands away.

156
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,159
What's wrong with you?

157
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,120
I'm not wrong.

158
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,920
Can't I be jealous?

159
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,360
What's wrong?

160
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,760
Nothing.

161
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,520
I have a stitch.

162
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,240
First of all,

163
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,640
Put me down when you get to the company.

164
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,080
Don't talk nonsense when you meet your colleagues.

165
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
or call me An.

166
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,040
Don't worry.

167
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,800
You've said it many times.

168
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,080
You have to act like you don't know me when you get there.

169
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,840
I understand.

170
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,520
Looks like we've disturbed Chief Editor Xia's vacation.

171
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,000
Everyone is waiting for you.

172
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,800
Sorry to keep you waiting.

173
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,920
Let's get started.

174
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,080
The first issue of the Heart Q should be released in advance.

175
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,240
We must catch up with the popularity before the Double Seventh Festival.

176
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,680
I've been in charge of this section.

177
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,360
If we want to release it in advance,

178
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,200
all departments need to be adjusted.

179
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,800
The whole process will be troublesome.

180
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,080
I paid you

181
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,080
to make you coordinate with them.

182
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,640
It will only distract the fans

183
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,800
will only distract the fans' attention on the new section.

184
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,400
And the lifestyle

185
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,000
don't need to mix with festivals.

186
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,520
We had a deal.

187
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,440
Do you think you are more professional than the boss?

188
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,200
And this is the Chairman's idea.

189
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,680
Other employees have agreed.

190
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,920
Armanda is too special.

191
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,360
I don't know how Anran offended her.

192
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,360
Isn't this giving her a hard time?

193
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,520
That's right.

194
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,799
We dare not object.

195
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,360
Work overtime.

196
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,679
Louis.

197
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,520
Why are you here?

198
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,920
Where's Chief Editor Xia?

199
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
Are you here to see Chief Editor Xia

200
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
for the manuscript?

201
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,360
They're still in a meeting.

202
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
We'll get back to work.

203
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,320
Make desserts that make people feel happy.

204
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,360
What do you think?

205
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,480
Who can tell me what happiness is like?

206
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,840
Have you eaten it?

207
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Or have you eaten

208
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,520
What udon tea?

209
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,760
What local ingredients?

210
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,600
It's so ordinary.

211
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,360
What I want is the value that it can see and touch.

212
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,920
Add a rare potential.

213
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,600
Understand?

214
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,720
Now outside the door of A&H,

215
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,280
there is indeed an illusion.

216
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,000
But these are all fried by yellow cows.

217
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,600
If the consumers know

218
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,280
we're marketing on hunger,

219
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,120
for a new brand,

220
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,680
the effect may not go as you wish.

221
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,720
It's a skill to manipulate public opinion.

222
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,360
What can a coward do?

223
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,040
The point is

224
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,160
Louis's growth and experience in France

225
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,360
to create the image of a talented dessert chef.

226
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,920
Being a prince charming is close to the topic of Qixi Festival.

227
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,480
The package is the key to the traffic.

228
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,920
Do you need me to teach you?

229
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,080
Amanda.

230
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,800
A character's manuscript.

231
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,720
You should respect Louis Lin's will.

232
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,720
Don't forget that I'm the investor of A&H.

233
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,480
I'm in charge of Louis.

234
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,680
Change it in three days.

235
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,880
Dismissed.

236
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,920
Anran.

237
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,120
What should I do?

238
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,680
I'll handle it.

239
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,280
Do your work well.

240
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,720
Okay.

241
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,880
Amanda.

242
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,040
Anything else?

243
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,480
I won't change Louis's manuscript.

244
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,600
He has the final say on the content.

245
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,440
This is the condition we agreed to interview him.

246
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,680
Xia Anran.

247
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,040
Don't tell me

248
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,880
you've never written an unrealistic manuscript.

249
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,040
You always stand at the moral point.

250
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,240
Aren't you cold?

251
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,600
All your views

252
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,120
are exploiting his commercial value.

253
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,480
This is disrespectful to the brand supervisors.

254
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,480
Respect?

255
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,040
When I see the money,

256
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,480
when I see the money.

257
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,720
Louis is not mature in business.

258
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
But as an investor,

259
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,360
you didn't see the courage

260
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,800
to come back and start his own business.

261
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,240
You don't know why he made desserts.

262
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,680
Why did he make desserts?

263
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,680
What does he want to express by making those desserts?

264
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,680
His expression

265
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,480
shouldn't be erased by you so easily.

266
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,600
Chief Editor Xia.

267
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,680
I agree with Chief Editor Xia.

268
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,600
The cooperation between the Queen and A&H

269
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,240
from concepts to writing filming,

270
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,480
Chief Editor Xia has put a lot of effort into it.

271
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,600
I've read the manuscript.

272
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,600
I like it.

273
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,600
No wonder you never show your emotions.

274
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,040
is so rude today.

275
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,040
Xia Anran.

276
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,560
I thought you could finally

277
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,360
see through the world.

278
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,120
So you're still the same you.

279
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,120
I wanted to be there

280
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,240
on the first issue,

281
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,360
Publish my new product.

282
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,720
It's the Double Seventh Festival.

283
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,000
Don't worry. I'll be responsible for the result.

284
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,040
You will be satisfied.

285
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,600
Okay.

286
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,880
You'd better

287
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,480
for your persistence.

288
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,880
I’m waiting to see

289
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,480
of the queen and A&H next month.

290
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:54,720
By the way,

291
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,240
she's not the chief editor yet.

292
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,040
Am I right, Deputy Editor Xia?

293
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,480
An'an.

294
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,360
What's wrong?

295
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,680
I told you not to talk nonsense.

296
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,040
An'an,

297
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,680
Are you doing this for me?

298
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,360
For the dog?

299
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,240
Why are you laughing?

300
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,360
I'm so good in your eyes.

301
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,680
She's your investor.

302
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,920
You broke up with her.

303
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,160
Have you thought about the consequences?

304
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,600
Yes.

305
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
But I only stick to what I think is right.

306
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,600
And I think it's worth it.

307
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,040
Childish.

308
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,480
An'an.

309
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,120
What's wrong?

310
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,160
An'an.

311
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,240
Anran is still so young.

312
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,240
Must we get divorced?

313
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,560
I want to give her a complete home.

314
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,240
But look at her father.

315
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,360
He has been cheating on others all these years.

316
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,480
He said he wanted to apologize.

317
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,120
But he made the mistake again.

318
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,120
But you gave up

319
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,800
your previous job.

320
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,680
I was too busy at work

321
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,240
and neglected my care for her.

322
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,240
I won't do it again.

323
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,680
I'm just afraid that I can't accept it.

324
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,240
You should know

325
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,040
every time I bring a cake,

326
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,040
he smiles like a flower.

327
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,600
You're so happy.

328
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
I thought

329
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Anran's dad would be nice to her.

330
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,480
But every time he went out,

331
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,760
he would leave his safety with you

332
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,960
and fooling around.

333
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,880
He wanted the custody to be safe.

334
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,720
He was just selfish.

335
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,600
What's wrong with you?

336
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,040
Ran.

337
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,240
Hao Hao.

338
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,440
Mom.

339
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,080
Mrs. Tan.

340
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,040
Don't have secrets behind her.

341
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,320
Don't make her cry.

342
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,680
Hao,

343
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,800
Let's go back to our room.

344
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:22,920
Let's go.

345
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,040
Mom.

346
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,720
I agree with your divorce.
