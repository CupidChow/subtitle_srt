One day, Fei Ke suddenly added me
on WeChat.

10
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,120
I think he found me
through my phone number.

11
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,560
We just sent good wishes
for festivals and holidays.

12

And through his Moments,

13
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,920
I saw that his life
was getting better and better.

14
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,350

to his wedding.

15

I thought the wedding would be the end.

I received your email,

22
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,840
but what you said was very vague.

23
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,320
So I might be too direct.

When you say ''inside information'',

25
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,510

to charge for it?

27
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,400

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,670
Mr. Chen,

189
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,550
about last night...

190
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,470
Don't mention that.

191
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,320
Jiajia must have forced you

192
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,440
to fool me, right?

193
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,280
Here's the thing.

194
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,280
A friend of mine is also in business.

195
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,230
He needs an assistant

196
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,590
to run errands,

197
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,230
check emails,

198
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,880
and organize contracts.

199
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,230
I thought you'd be a good fit,

200
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,320
so I introduced you to him.

201
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,400
I'm afraid I'm not qualified.

202
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,000
I'd rather drive.

203
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,790
Don't underestimate him.

204
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,470
He's very powerful.

205
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,000
You're not too young.

206
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,080
Office work is nice. You'll get ahead.

207
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,640
You can't drive forever, right?

208
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,520
You have to make money and get married.

209
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
It's settled.

210
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,710
Here's his business card.

211
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,030
Tell him I introduced you.

212
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,760
Go.

213
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,590
Mr. Chen, I don't want to go.

214
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,550
I must be honest with you.

215
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,910
I like Chen Jiajia.

216
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,400
I asked you to watch and protect her.

217
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,030
What did you do?

218
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,030
She was drunk.

219
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,520
How many times have I told you?

220
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,550
I told you to keep an eye on her
and keep her from drinking.

221
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,590
But you fooled me
and took advantage of her.

222
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,760
How did I treat you?

223
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,350
You heartless scoundrel!

224
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:22,910
Mr. Chen,

225
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,000
give me a chance.

226
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,910
I've been working for you
for five years.

227
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,280
You've always taken care of me

228
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,550
and treated me like your family.

229
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,760
I think you know my character.

230
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,640
I thought about it all night yesterday.

231
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,200
I really like Jiajia.

232
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,550
Take a piss and look at yourself.

233
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,550
Do you deserve her?

234
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,080
Get out of here.
Don't ever let me see you again.

235
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,590
The farther, the better.

236
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,350
I've never bowed down,

237
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,200
but I apologize to you today.

238
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,880
Think it over. You're not well-matched.

239
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,470
You two won't get anywhere.

240
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,440
If you really care about Jiajia,

241
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,200
give up.

242
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,960
Take whatever you want.

243
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:41,910
Mr. Chen,

244
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,790
I don't want money.

245
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,840
Don't worry.

246
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,840
I'll never see Jiajia again.

247
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,080
Thank you for taking care of me
for the past five years.

248
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Mr. Chen,

249
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,320
take care.

250
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,080
Where's Liu Mo?

251
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,960
Resigned.

252
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,590
You call him.

253
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,150
He's not answering my calls.

254
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,350
He's probably driving.

255
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:34,440
In a job like this,
it's common not to answer calls.

256
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,550
You get him back.

257
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,030
He's already left Chengjiang.

258
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,440
I've arranged for Luo to be your driver.

259
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,960
You'll never see him again.

260
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,880
Whose blood is this?

261
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,950
It's easy to forget someone.

262
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,160
You're not young anymore.

263
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,470
I'll find you someone suitable
for you to marry.

264
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:26,920
Liu Mo.

265
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,830
Liu Mo.

266
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,830
Liu Mo, get out.

267
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,280
Liu Mo.

268
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,760
Liu Mo.

269
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,470
Liu Mo.

270
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,430
Liu Mo, answer my call.

271
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,190
What are you doing? Answer my call.

272
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,760
The pain of choosing him must

273
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,800
be far greater than the pain
of marrying Fei Ke.

274
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,640
- Dad, I'm begging you.
- It's settled.

275
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,000
Listen, you'll thank me later.

276
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,400
You can't forget him

277
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,760
because you're out of your mind.

278
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,070
He's got you under his spell.

279
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,070
I'm doing this for your own good.

280
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,000
A few months later,

281
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,830
Jiajia got engaged.

282
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,950
I heard her fiancé is a wonderful man.

283
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,110
I was jealous

284
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,070
and curious.

285
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,520
I used to be Mr. Chen's driver.

286
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,190
If Ms. Chen wants to eat Long's,

287
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,190
add more Hainan chili sauce

288
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,590
and squeeze two small limes.

289
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,520
I see.

290
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,470
In summer,

291
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,400
she'd turn down the air-conditioning.

292
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,430
You quietly turn it up.

293
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,280
Anything else?

294
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,520
Nothing.

295
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,560
I wish you happiness.

296
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,160
Thank you.

297
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,070
Right.

298
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,760
Don't tell her I was here.

299
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,070
Thank you.

300
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,800
Actually,

301
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,520
Fei Ke and I have been putting on an act.

302
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,310
I never allowed him to touch me at all.

303
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,110
You forced me to do this, you know?

304
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,830
Where are you going?

305
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,280
I'm going to find Liu Mo.

306
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,950
He works in Shaling
as a ride-hailing driver.

307
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,950
I have his new number.

308
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,110
Don't go.

309
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,590
Get back.

310
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,460
[Chen Jiajia]

311
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:14,980
[Chen Jiajia]

312
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,310
Jiajia.

313
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,160
Jiajia, stop the car.

314
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,560
Do you want to die?

315
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,560
This evening,

316
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,800
a woman driving a Porsche

317
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,200
was involved in a car accident
near the S21 exit

318
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,150
of the Chengsha Freeway.

319
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,960
Relevant departments quickly rushed
to the site

320
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,800
for rescue and emergency treatment.

321
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,990
According to rescue workers,

322
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,560
the driver, Ms. Chen,

323
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,510
has been transferred
to the hospital for rescue.

324
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,350
The preliminary opinion

325
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,840
is that the accident
was caused by speeding.

326
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,960
The exact cause of the accident

327
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,270
is under further investigation.

328
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,350
- Quiet, please.
- Make a move...

329
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,440
Calm down.

330
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,390
- How's Jiajia?
- Are you her family member?

331
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:12,990
How's she?

332
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:13,840
Are you her family member?

333
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,920
How's Jiajia?

334
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:16,990
Let me see her.

335
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,470
Mr. Chen, let me see Ms. Chen.

336
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,630
Jiajia is gone.

337
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,960
It's Fei Ke's fault.

338
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,820
He has ruined my family.

339
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,040
Where's Fei Ke?

340
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,750
He's missing.

341
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,470
It's impossible.

342
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,190
It's impossible.

343
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,710
I'm sure I'll find him.

344
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,400
I have to find him.

345
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,680
I must find him and avenge Jiajia.

346
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,070
I'll find him.

347
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,830
I'll find him.

348
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,920
I'll find him.

349
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,990
You go to find him.

350
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,990
I'll dig him up.

351
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,280
This room is for you.

352
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,350
I'll give you cars, money, labor,

353
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,470
whatever you want.

354
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,640
Even if you turn over every rock,

355
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,000
you need

356
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,880
to dig Fei Ke up for me.

357
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,070
I want to know who he is,

358
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,160
why he did it,

359
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,070
and if he has any accomplices.

360
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,760
You won't let him go, right?

361
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,160
I'll find him.

362
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,310
[Li Zerui]
Fei Ke's real name is Li Zerui.

363
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,070
He's from Huishan.

364
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,880
He has nothing to do with Mr. Li,
the Deputy Director-General.

365
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,190
He did win a gold medal
in the Olympiad in high school.

366
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,470
Then he helped his half-brother
take the exam

367
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,830
and was banned from the exam
for five years.

368
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,280
He used a total of seven phone numbers.

369
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,280
In 2015,

370
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,880
Fei Ke frequently contacted a woman
named Su Qian.

371
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,800
She's Wylon Medical's financial director,

372
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,040
also Zhao Xiaoyang's wife.

373
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,430
Also, in 2015,

374
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,160
Fei Ke stayed at the home of a man
named Cheng Hao.

375
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,800
He had a girlfriend, Zhang Xuan,

376
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,400
who now works as a relationship manager
at a medical aesthetics clinic.

377
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,160
[He Shan]
There is another suspicious person.

378
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,430
They haven't contacted each other

379
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,470
since 2007,

380
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,920
but she was the only classmate

381
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,230
who showed up at Fei Ke's wedding.

382
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,140
[He Shan]

383
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,560
They can call the police.

384
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,760
They didn't.

385
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,520
Why?

386
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,040
I want to know, too.

387
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,710
Chen Shufa doesn't want Fei Ke
to get punished by law.

388
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,000
He wants Fei Ke to die.

389
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,040
Why did he choose me?

390
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,520
Because I hate Fei Ke, too.

391
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,950
So what are you going to do?

392
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:10,800
Help him?

393
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,040
We have to find Fei Ke

394
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,000
before Chen Shufa does.

395
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,800
Like what He Shan said,

396
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,160
no matter how big a crime
Fei Ke has committed,

397
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,950
no matter how bad you all hate him,

398
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,590
it should be the law that punishes him,

399
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,680
not lynching.

400
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,110
I've been working for Mr. Chen
for about five years.

401
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,880
He's always treated me well,

402
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,070
like his own family.

403
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,000
So I'm not saving Fei Ke.

404
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,520
I'm saving you,

405
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,190
Mr. Chen.

406
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:49,000
I visited many of Fei Ke's
friends and classmates.

407
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,560
I went through the social accounts
of each of you,

408
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,040
downloaded every photo,

409
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,430
and compared it to Fei Ke's Moments
to make a timeline.

410
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,310
Then, I figured out how he had
been cheating for the past few years.

411
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,920
What does that have to do with me?

412
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,470
I'm not like the rest of them.

413
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,190
It's my idea.

414
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,190
You probably don't remember.

415
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,430
We had dinner once.

416
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,310
Wish you wealth and prosperity...

417
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:29,800
Long time no see.

418
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,520
I'm sorry...

419
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,310
Come... Take a seat.

420
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,310
Xuan'er is a top-school student.

421
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,520
Which college did you graduate from?

422
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,000
From Chengjiang University.

423
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,470
Chengjiang University.

424
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,070
So you know a guy named Fei Ke?

425
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,760
We're buddies.

426
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,430
We used to hang out in college,

427
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,520
but we haven't kept in touch in years.

428
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,710
What's he like?

429
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,590
I don't know.

430
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,950
You said you used to hang out together.

431
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,310
Why don't you know him anymore?

432
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,190
I don't remember.

433
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,710
Let's drink.

434
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,590
Come...

435
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,430
One drink for being late.

436
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,470
One for being late...

437
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,640
There you go.

438
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,430
Why did he call you?

439
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,000
Why did he call you?

440
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,310
I want to hear your voice.

441
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,310
Only when I hear your voice,

442
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,000
I feel like I'm back

443
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,070
to my 18-year-old
at Huishan No.1 High School,

444
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,520
to my clean,

445
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,520
carefree self.

446
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,310
Only when I see you

447
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,350
can I be me.

448
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,190
Can you come?

449
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,310
I have something I'd like to give you.

450
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,300
[Yuewan to Suvarna]

451
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,350
Help, somebody, help!

452
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,800
Call an ambulance, please.

453
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,920
From the USB Fei Ke slipped me,

454
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,880
I found his diary.

455
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,520
In it, he recorded

456
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,350
what happened
between him and each of you.

457
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,430
Fei Ke has been kidnapped.

458
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,190
Are you sure?

459
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,470
I saw him being pulled away in that car.

460
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,280
Industrial salt poisoning.
His stomach was pumped.

461
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,520
He was saved.

462
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,160
So where is he now?

463
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,760
Chen Shufa hid him

464
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,430
and didn't reveal any information to me.

465
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,760
He just told me

466
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,710
to ask these people to go
to Chong'an Island at the same time

467
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,680
and release the news that Fei Ke is dead

468
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,430
so they'll show up.

469
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
No, we have to stop him.

470
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,310
I can't believe the last step
of our mission

471
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,560
is to save Fei Ke's life

472
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,920
from Mr. Chen's hands.

473
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,350
We want to save everyone, too.

474
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,880
We don't want to let Fei Ke go.

475
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,760
We want to hand him over to the law.

476
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,230
I have one last question.

477
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,830
12 years ago,

478
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,160
was it you who reported me?

479
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,230
On the 6th and 7th of this month,

480
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,350
did you see Li Zerui

481
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,350
at the exam site

482
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,430
of Huishan No.10 High School?

483
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,310
What happened to him?

484
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,680
We suspect he's a surrogate exam-taker.

485
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
Recall your memories.

486
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,070
Yes.

487
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,520
He went with his brother, Li Zetian.

488
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,430
If it was my honesty that hurt you,

489
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,830
then I won't apologize.

490
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,280
But over the years,

491
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,400
I often blame myself.

492
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,160
If I had come forward ten years ago

493
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,710
and said your name wasn't Fei Ke,

494
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,680
and you weren't a student
at Chengjiang University,

495
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,070
would you still be like this?

496
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,680
You probably wouldn't
have gotten caught up in the lies.

497
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,560
You don't love money.

498
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,230
You're not even vain.

499
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,230
You just don't trust anyone anymore.

500
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,190
You're proving yourself in your own way,

501
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,310
fighting off your imaginary enemies.

502
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,880
You're afraid of being lied to,

503
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,190
of being let down.

504
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,920
You hate being used and manipulated.

505
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,470
Once someone wants
to take advantage of you,

506
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,830
you'll use your way

507
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,110
to retaliate hundreds
or thousands of times over.

508
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,470
You've never spent any of this money.

509
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,950
And these numbers are just your scores.

510
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,880
Without college, a career,

511
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,590
and worldly success,

512
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,880
you can't prove yourself

513
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,280
and feel a real sense of being.

514
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,680
But Li Zerui,

515
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,520
life isn't a race.

516
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,070
Life has no gold medals.

517
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,760
I often feel guilty.

518
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,800
I believed you.

519
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,310
I believed you when you said you wanted

520
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,760
to study hard and sneak back

521
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,760
to Chengjiang University
to finish college once,

522
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,430
so I took pity on you.

523
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,000
I actually harmed everyone on board.

524
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,710
That's why I have to do something

525
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,760
to remedy the situation
as much as possible.

526
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,070
I must find out the truth.

527
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,230
I must find you.

528
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,400
I wish you were the one who reported me.

529
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,520
He Shan,

530
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,080
thank you.

531
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,630
I've not only lied to you,

532
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,950
I've let myself down.

533
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:39,390
But it's too late for that now.

534
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,230
I'm not asking you to let me go.

535
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,120
I've been living in fear
for the past ten years.

536
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,430
I've pursued fame,

537
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,000
status,

538
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,630
money, and dignity.

539
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,470
It's exhausting.

540
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,230
Aren't you exhausted?

541
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,120
Let's go back.

542
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,280
Let's go back together

543
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,360
to where I belong.

544
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,430
At least do one thing right in our lives.

545
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,630
Don't make any more mistakes.

546
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,040
I've been diagnosed
with terminal liver cancer.

547
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,150
I won't live for six months.

548
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,150
Before I die,

549
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,080
I must take you with me.

550
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,120
I've already adjusted
the cruising direction.

551
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,870
The boat is heading back.

552
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,120
Yacht ahead, dock immediately.

553
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,520
Here...

554
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,630
Over here.
