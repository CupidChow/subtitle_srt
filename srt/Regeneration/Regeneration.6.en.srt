4
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,120
Whose watch is this?

5
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,280
Speak up.

6
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,400
Whose watch is this?

7
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,040
Put it down.

8
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,840
Keep it safe.

9
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,480
I can't afford it.

10
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,040
Whose watch is this anyway?

11
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:31,840
It's Jin's.

12
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,230
Why is Jin's watch in the room?

13
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
Yesterday, he was drunk, too.

14
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,480
He was so friendly
and called me brother,

15
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,120
insisting on giving me this watch.

16
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,430
The watch costs hundreds of thousands.

17
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,430
How could I take it?

18
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,430
After you get settled in,

19
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,320
I have to give it back.

20
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,590
Right,

21
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,760
I have good news.

22
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,760
What good news?

23
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,280
My mom also came

24
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,150
to yesterday's performance.

25
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,320
The one sitting next to you?

26
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,150
She complimented your performance,

27
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,590
so I told her everything

28
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,480
about us.

29
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,230
Including where you're from,

30
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,070
what your parents are like,

31
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,960
and your family background.

32
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,630
I told her everything.

33
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,630
Really?

34
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,920
Then what did she say?

35
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,350
She didn't show a clear attitude.

36
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,120
You know my family background.

37
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,040
She always wants me to find someone...

38
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,350
They want you to find someone
who's a good match.

39
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,120
I know. I understand.

40
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,870
I'm from a small city.

41
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:50,990
I'm not good enough for you.

42
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,510
My parents didn't go to school.

43
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,400
They're poorly educated.

44
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,350
What good news is this?

45
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,710
It's lucky
that she didn't explicitly object to it.

46
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,630
Why did I wait until I was 20
to start a relationship?

47
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,320
She doesn't like anyone

48
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,630
and won't let me meet girls.

49
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,790
But for you,

50
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,600
I don't care about the rules.

51
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,720
I act first and report later.

52
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,630
You can impress her.

53
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,560
Trust me.

54
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,630
I'll set up a formal meeting right away.

55
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:38,790
Be confident.

56
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,600
You're the best.

57
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,510
Am I?

58
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,070
I always felt like

59
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,600
being with you was like a dream.

60
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,030
I couldn't even think about the future.

61
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,510
Too dowdy.

62
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,620
Dowdy?

63
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,490
It's Japanese style.

64
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,370
It's frivolous and outdated.

65
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,420
My mom won't like it.

66
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,050
Frivolous.

67
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,370
How about this one?

68
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,420
A bit old-fashioned.

69
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,460
I'm from a small city.

70
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,020
I've improved a lot
since I got to Chengjiang.

71
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,780
I was even more dowdy in high school.

72
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,460
Actually, you look good in anything.

73
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,060
It's just that these clothes

74
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,550
don't really suit today's occasion.

75
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,620
Honey,

76
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,150
look.

77
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,500
You actually look cute

78
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:18,990
with a good figure.

79
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,060
It's just a matter of taste.

80
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,340
Just a little improvement in taste,

81
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,670
you'll impress everyone.

82
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,740
But taste can't be acquired

83
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,220
in a day or two.

84
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,620
I'm still learning.

85
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,900
Through what?

86
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,740
Magazines.

87
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,620
No wonder.

88
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,150
What's wrong?

89
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,150
It's okay.

90
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,670
Who sent it to you?

91
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,020
No one.

92
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,020
Just do your makeup.

93
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,060
We have to go now.

94
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,990
You look like something goes wrong.

95
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,900
What can't you tell me?

96
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,430
Really, it's okay.

97
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,270
Your makeup's so heavy.

98
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:14,870
Heavy?

99
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,180
I don't get it.

100
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,340
You dancers always doll yourselves up

101
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,900
like you're about to perform.

102
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,870
We're going to Yunding Pavilion,

103
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,990
a Western restaurant,

104
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,870
not to the Spring Festival Gala

105
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,270
of your town's TV station.

106
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,500
Remove it.

107
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,500
Blush, eye shadow, eyeliner,

108
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,620
everything.

109
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,110
My mom doesn't like heavy makeup.

110
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,900
Give it back to me.

111
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,500
Now.

112
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,900
No wonder you keep picking on me.

113
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,180
It's not you who thinks I'm dowdy.

114
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,340
It's your mom.

115
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,900
That's not what she meant.

116
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,460
That's what she meant.

117
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,590
She said Zhang Xuan is a very nice girl.

118
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,670
A dancer

119
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,950
from a prestigious university
with a good figure.

120
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,220
They're not too happy

121
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,300
about her family background
and her parents,

122
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,220
but as long as you like her,

123
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,180
go ahead and date her.

124
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,620
I'm warning you.

125
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,230
Stop checking my phone. Give it to me.

126
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,620
What's wrong with me
checking your phone?

127
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,590
I'm your girlfriend.

128
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,590
Don't you know how to show some respect?

129
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,740
This is Chengjiang,

130
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,910
not your hometown.

131
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,620
Living here requires

132
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,300
a minimum of courtesy and respect.

133
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,830
If I hadn't seen it,

134
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,150
I'd still be in the dark.

135
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,100
Today, my friends are here.

136
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,180
Zhang Xuan

137
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,590
doesn't seem to be a good match for you.

138
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,390
She lacks grace

139
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,830
and comes off a bit uncouth.

140
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,150
I don't want your uncles and aunts

141
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,830
to gossip about our family.

142
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,350
So let's ask her to rest in her dorm.

143
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,030
Come here by yourself.

144
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,150
Let's do it alone next time.

145
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,740
Give it to me.

146
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,790
Give it to me.

147
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:23,980
I'll handle it.

148
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,100
I don't need you to tell me what to do.

149
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,100
Do you want me to translate for you?

150
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,350
I don't.

151
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,230
What your mom means is

152
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,180
that I'm not pretty enough.

153
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,470
I'm a disgrace to your family.

154
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,420
You misunderstood.

155
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,710
I didn't misunderstand.

156
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,270
Isn't that what she meant?

157
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,060
Yes,

158
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,860
I'm not a campus belle.

159
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,350
I don't have a capable father.

160
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,910
I'm not good enough for you.

161
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,350
She's one-sided.

162
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,390
Don't get mad.

163
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,620
So you agree that she thinks I'm ugly?

164
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,950
I don't think you're ugly.

165
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,740
I think you have
a special kind of beauty.

166
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,270
What do you mean by special beauty?

167
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,590
You're different from
all the girls I've met.

168
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,540
I like you
because you're simple and pure.

169
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,950
Simple and pure?

170
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,230
It's just dowdy, right?

171
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,030
Yes,

172
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,060
I don't know how to dress

173
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,660
or put on make-up well.

174
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,030
I'm also an art student
that you despise.

175
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,030
I don't know how to study.

176
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,270
And I don't talk posh.

177
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,830
Since so many girls surround you,

178
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,740
why don't you go and be with them?

179
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,860
I really don't understand

180
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,590
why you want to be with me.

181
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,270
What do you want?

182
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,470
What do you mean?

183
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:41,980
Let's break up.

184
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,860
Calm down...

185
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,830
I am calm.

186
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,510
We're not a good match.

187
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,270
He doesn't have an official father.

188
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,870
Also, he must've made up the whole story
about his mom.

189
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,510
Why do I need to tell you all this?

190
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,540
It's all about me.

191
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,540
What's it got to do with you?

192
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,870
It's pretty boring.

193
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,390
Let's change the subject.

194
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,830
I'll tell you a detail
that's not boring.

195
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,310
There's something wrong with that drink.

196
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,900
I wasn't drunk.

197
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,070
I was drugged

198
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,340
and passed out.

199
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,220
Why didn't you call the police?

200
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,510
Did I have evidence?

201
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,020
Have I no shame?

202
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,990
My life started to fall apart

203
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,140
after I broke up with him.

204
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,430
Zhang Xuan,

205
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,390
what are you doing?

206
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:11,750
You're insane.

207
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,720
[Send to Fei Ke:
Where are you? I miss you.]

208
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,360
[Where are you?
Why are you ignoring me?]

209
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,020
[I'm having a hard time.
I want to see you.]

210
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,580
Don't move.

211
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,870
Call Fei Ke.

212
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,660
I don't have his number.

213
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,990
You can't do this anymore.

214
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,870
You have to live a normal life.

215
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,870
Since we're already torn apart,

216
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,390
you can tell me.

217
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,340
Where is he?

218
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,750
I've said it many times.

219
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,270
I really don't know.

220
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,700
Even you lied to me.

221
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,540
Zhang Xuan,

222
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,900
it's normal for relationships
to break up and fall apart.

223
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,660
First love doesn't always end well,

224
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:38,780
so take it easy.

225
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,540
Besides,

226
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,310
I'm here to help you through this.

227
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:46,660
I can't.

228
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,750
I really can't.

229
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,070
Come to your senses.

230
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,270
Fei Ke doesn't deserve you.

231
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,390
I know you're prejudiced against him.

232
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,310
That's because you don't even know
how good he is.

233
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,070
Is that he?

234
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,100
Yes.

235
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,700
[Fei Ke: Gold Club KTV, come here.]

236
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,540
Fei Ke agreed to see me.

237
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,340
It's all here. Have fun today.

238
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,270
Of course.

239
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,950
Nobody can leave until we're all drunk.

240
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,700
Absolutely.

241
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,870
Drink with Mr. Jin.

242
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,310
Let's sing a song.

243
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,540
What's she doing?

244
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,630
Nothing.

245
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:11,580
Be with Mr. Jin.

246
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,220
Let's drink.

247
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,190
Let's keep drinking.

248
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:16,990
Have a drink.

249
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,580
Come...

250
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,660
They're just Fei Ke's friends

251
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,630
like you once were.

252
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,430
Friend?

253
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,630
I've been with Fei Ke for four months.

254
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,950
You said we were friends?

255
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,540
Maybe in Fei Ke's eyes,

256
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,900
you're not that important.

257
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,460
If I wasn't that important,

258
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,070
then why did he help me
play the Black Swan

259
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,100
and introduce me to his mom?

260
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,070
Zhang Xuan,

261
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,900
you can't give yourself up for a man.

262
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,020
Is it worth it?

263
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,460
Look at him.

264
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,860
Does he look like he wants
to get back together with you?

265
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,100
Come to your senses.

266
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,420
Leave me alone.

267
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,100
No one will be here for you except me.

268
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,660
If I leave,
what if something happens to you?

269
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,730
Something has already happened to me.

270
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,300
What happened?

271
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,170
Tell me.

272
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,020
Nothing.

273
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,810
Why don't you go back first?

274
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,180
It's too messy here.

275
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,820
I want to talk to him alone.

276
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:31,610
Hit me.

277
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,660
One, two, three.

278
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,450
Come.

279
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,250
They all look beautiful.

280
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,580
By plastic surgery.

281
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,020
Then I can do it, too.

282
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,210
Don't be ridiculous.

283
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,220
They can do it.

284
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,020
Why can't I?

285
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,180
Xuan'er,

286
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,660
if you just sit here,

287
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,460
don't come here again.

288
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,700
You're tired, and so am I.

289
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,330
Come.

290
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,250
Let's play games.

291
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:06,900
Good.

292
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,490
Make a move.

293
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,730
Let's play Telling a Lie.

294
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:18,700
Fine.

295
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,620
[Nose]

296
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,780
[Weige Medical Aesthetics]
If only the nose is changed,

297
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,060
the philtrum will look longer

298
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,940
and the whole face will look weird.

299
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:51,940
However, if you follow the plan

300
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,420
that the doctor has just made for you,

301
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,940
the surgery will be a little bit bigger,

302
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,220
but it will look more natural.

303
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,580
How long does it take?

304
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,940
It's a quick surgery.

305
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,180
But you'll be hospitalized for a week.

306
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,060
Then you'll have
to wear a facial bandage for a month.

307
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,180
A month?

308
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,990
But I'm still in college.

309
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,340
Why don't you come
during the summer vacation?

310
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,420
We have a lot of student customers.

311
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,700
How much is the surgery?

312
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,340
Including three follow-ups,

313
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,870
it's 178,000 yuan.

314
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,670
It's okay. You can do it step by step.

315
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,100
It'll just take a little longer.

316
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,420
Do it for me as soon as possible.

317
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,790
Can I use a credit card?

318
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,630
Yes.

319
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:43,670
Hello,

320
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,940
phone number 0905.

321
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,340
Miss,

322
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,750
you have booked one double room online.

323
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,910
We provide you
with cleaning and laundry services.

324
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,420
Just call us if you need anything.

325
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,460
Here's your room key.

326
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:57,870
Thank you.

327
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,870
The elevator is over there.

328
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,820
Sorry,

329
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,180
the number you dialed is out of service.

330
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,820
Sorry,

331
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,870
the number you dialed is out of service.

332
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,270
Sorry, the number you dialed
is out of service.

333
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,060
Sorry.

334
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:02,700
Sorry,

335
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,990
the number you dialed...

336
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,670
Do I look good?

337
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,460
Why you've changed?

338
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,940
Except that people must die,

339
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,820
what can't change in this world?

340
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,220
There's no need for this between us.

341
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,580
Where are you having fun?

342
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,580
Upstairs, booth six.

343
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,420
I thought you didn't like places
like this.

344
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,420
I didn't like it before.

345
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,550
Now I do.

346
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,870
Just like you used to like me.

347
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,990
Now, you suddenly don't like me.

348
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,940
I don't dislike you.

349
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,460
It's your mom who doesn't like me.

350
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,910
Look for me upstairs.

351
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,870
There's no one you know.

352
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,340
Come.

353
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,460
Hello.

354
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,670
Hello.

355
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,630
I'm Fei Ke's friend.

356
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,180
Come.

357
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,030
Come. Let's have a drink.

358
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,100
Good.

359
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:02,670
Awesome.

360
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,790
Come. Drink.

361
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,420
You alone?

362
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:13,420
What?

363
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,580
You alone?

364
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,300
Take a guess.

365
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,030
Where are we going?

366
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,460
Send you back.

367
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,790
I don't live in the dorm anymore.

368
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,060
Where are you living?

369
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,030
In hotel.

370
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:55,870
Let's go.

371
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,910
What's our relationship now?

372
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,460
Friends.

373
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,750
In the future?

374
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,030
We can continue to be friends.

375
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:20,750
Pretty good.

376
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,750
Thank you.

377
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,510
Thank you for what?

378
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,550
Thank you

379
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,060
for making me feel so confident.

380
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,550
If you hadn't spurred me on,

381
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,630
I might never have taken this step.

382
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,460
So thank you.

383
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,550
Congratulations.

384
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:47,990
From now on, I hope

385
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,940
I can keep playing with you as a friend.

386
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,100
The way you were before, no.

387
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,030
The way you're today is fine.

388
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,910
Don't worry.

389
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,750
I'll never be like that again.

390
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,750
I'm starving in class today.

391
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,420
Let's get something to eat later.

392
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,420
What's wrong with her?

393
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:51,670
Zhang Xuan,

394
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,340
don't abuse yourself.

395
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,030
Leave me alone.

396
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,790
We're all here.

397
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,580
We can help you.

398
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,630
Fine.

399
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,300
Lend me some money.

400
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:08,990
How much?

401
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,340
Three to five thousand.

402
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,870
I need to have skin boosters.

403
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,100
None of you can help me.

404
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:21,790
It's fine.

405
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,270
I can do it on my own.

406
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,060
You can't do surgery that often.

407
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,180
After the last surgery,

408
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,390
the outside is healed,

409
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,340
but not the inside.

410
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,750
You have to stop smoking and drinking.

411
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:34,820
And avoid spicy food.

412
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,780
I have four fives.

413
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,820
Four fives.

414
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,300
Right.

415
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,030
Have a seat.

416
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,420
Sit...

417
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,220
Mr. Chen,

418
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,550
this is my friend.

419
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,300
Well...

420
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,270
Just call me Xuan'er.

421
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,700
Fine, Xuan'er. Okay.

422
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,150
Drink it.

423
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:47,700
Come...

424
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,940
I really can't sing.

425
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:52,220
How can such a pretty beauty not sing?

426
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,100
It's so cool.

427
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,340
Come...

428
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,220
Come on.

429
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,340
Please arrange it for me
as soon as possible.

430
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,180
It's not a minor surgery.

431
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,510
The cost is also...

432
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,030
No problem.

433
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:02,940
No problem at all.

434
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,700
Hello.

435
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,670
Thank you, Sir.

436
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:23,870
Good.

437
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,820
This is a picture of me
before plastic surgery.

438
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,820
Such a natural beauty.

439
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,300
A pretty girl at first sight.

440
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,100
And you're from
a prestigious university.

441
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,030
Why did you have to get plastic surgery?

442
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,820
Because I wanted Fei Ke
to come back to me.

443
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,300
Because all the girls around him
were so pretty.

444
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,100
He had been in this circle
for a long time.

445
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,220
He'd definitely look less and less

446
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,100
at ordinary girls like us.

447
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,550
Then why did you go to see him

448
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,100
when you knew it was impossible?

449
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,340
Because I wanted him to regret it.

450
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,340
I wanted him to see

451
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,790
I could be better
than all the girls around him.

452
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,790
Much better.

453
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,060
So

454
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,270
Fei Ke doesn't regret it.

455
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,990
You do.

456
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,060
Yes.

457
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,790
Everyone said I looked better
before plastic surgery.

458
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,750
The more they said,
the more I felt inferior.

459
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,390
I thought I looked better before,

460
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,670
but I can't go back.

461
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,550
Well, what did Fei Ke lie to you about?

462
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,740
Innocence.

463
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,710
Is that funny?

464
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,460
In my eyes,

465
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,830
innocence is more important than money.

466
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,670
It's something that money can't buy back.

467
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:02,830
So

468
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,340
are you married?

469
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,190
With a face like mine,

470
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,550
what serious man

471
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,620
would want to marry me?

472
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,220
What about the money you owe?

473
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,980
I don't owe you any money.

474
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,380
That's not what I meant.

475
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,190
I mean,

476
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,830
what have you been living on
for the past years?

477
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,910
I work in sales
at a medical aesthetics clinic.

478
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,140
I paid off all my debts
the year before last.

479
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,980
You can look down on me
and not trust me,

480
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,460
but everything I did before

481
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,980
was just revenge on Fei Ke.

482
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,220
People like you won't understand.

483
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,590
Are you okay?

484
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,460
Give her some water.

485
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,380
Have some water.

486
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:53,740
Ms. He,

487
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,500
it's your turn.

488
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,460
What?

489
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:01,740
Tell us.

490
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,830
What happened

491
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,860
between you and Fei Ke?

492
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,620
I was in the Journalism School,
Chengjiang University, class of 2005.

493
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,550
I was in college at the same time
as Fei Ke for a while.

494
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,710
He was close to my boyfriend
at the time.

495
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,740
All of us have been deceived and hurt

496
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,380
by Fei Ke.

497
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,340
If it's like you said,

498
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,430
why were you invited?

499
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,710
Maybe Fei Ke didn't invite her.

500
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,950
She came uninvited.

501
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,140
Have you noticed?

502
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,340
It's like she knows everything
about all of us.

503
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,220
She kept reminding us

504
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,220
of the parts we couldn't explain.

505
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,380
She kept asking questions

506
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,140
about the details we couldn't remember.

507
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:44,860
I'm a journalist.

508
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,500
It's my job and my instinct.

509
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:50,590
What are you doing?

510
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,460
Don't touch my stuff.

511
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,380
You're going too far.

512
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,430
Don't you want to hear it?

513
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,430
It's just some interview.

514
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,500
Give it to me.

515
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,100
12 January,

516
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,220
Fei Ke's colleague,

517
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,030
Mr. Jiang.

518
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,340
23 March,

519
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,830
Fei Ke's college classmate,

520
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:07,740
Mr. Wu.

521
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,380
9 June,

522
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,550
Fei Ke's college instructor,

523
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,620
Mr. Lu.

524
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,500
13 June,

525
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,430
Fei Ke's friend,

526
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,310
Ms. Shu.

527
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,950
Did you hear everything?

528
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,220
She's been investigating Fei Ke.

529
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,140
Who on earth are you?

530
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,380
Who put you up to this?

531
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,740
What's your relationship with Fei Ke?

532
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,220
Why did you take us on the boat?

533
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,340
It's that driver.

534
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:34,790
Open the door.

535
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,860
Open the door.

536
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,500
Open the door.

537
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,590
Stop yelling.

538
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,670
The boat won't come to shore.

539
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,460
What do you mean?

540
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,100
I mean,

541
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,460
the boat won't come to shore.

542
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,790
Everyone,

543
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,140
don't make it difficult for her.

544
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,260
I hired her.

545
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,620
She and Fei Ke went to the same college,

546
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,590
and have mutual friends.

547
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,030
She's also a journalist.

548
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,670
So she's the perfect person
to investigate Fei Ke.

549
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,710
And of course,

550
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,500
you guys too.

551
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,860
Why investigate us?

552
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,950
Actually, it's not Fei Ke

553
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,190
who invited you here today.

554
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,260
It's me.

555
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,460
Me.
