190
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:52,940
Open the door.

191
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,900
Do what I say

192
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,660
and you'll see him.

193
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,940
He's gone.

194
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,580
Fei Ke tricked us again.

195
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,780
What do you mean "again"?

196
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,700
You've been tricked by Fei Ke, too?

197
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,700
I don't know if I count.

198
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,420
I'm sure I count.

199
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,700
So you're not Fei Ke's friends.

200
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,180
You're his dupes.

201
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,540
Stop looking for it.

202
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,580
Since he tricked us into coming here,

203
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,420
he wouldn't leave us any way out.

204
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,940
Can your phones find a signal?

205
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,820
Half a bar.

206
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,460
It's gone now.

207
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,540
None.

208
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,700
I don't think

209
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,340
Fei Ke wants to harm us.

210
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,940
He just wants to get information
out of us.

211
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,420
Let's think of a way

212
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,340
and find some clues

213
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,580
as to why he's locking us up here.

214
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,460
Well, we can't escape anyway,

215
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,100
so let's play the game all the way.

216
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,180
When was the last time any
of you contacted him?

217
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,300
March 2016.

218
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,580
2014.

219
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,420
November 2015.

220
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,060
Is this Fei Ke's WeChat account?

221
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:42,940
What?

222
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,420
I'm not interested in your privacy,

223
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,460
but his avatar on your phone

224
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,580
is different from that on mine.

225
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,900
Look!

226
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,420
Is the person we know the same?

227
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,700
Check your phones

228
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,900
and see which account you added.

229
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,100
This one.

230
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,420
They are completely different.

231
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,300
They are different at first glance

232
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,180
but if you look closely,
they are the same person.

233
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,900
So the Fei Ke we know

234
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,780
are five different persons.

235
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,780
It's too freaky.

236
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,340
Come on,

237
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,180
can you let us out of here?

238
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,300
What's the point of keeping us here?

239
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,460
It's annoying.

240
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,900
Stop yelling.

241
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,580
Fei Ke,

242
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,780
we'll do as you say.

243
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,940
Each of us will tell the stories
that went down with you.

244
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,300
We hope that you'll keep your promise.

245
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,420
Either read the will

246
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,420
or let us go.

247
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,420
Given the circumstances,

248
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,820
let's treat it as a memorial ceremony.

249
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,580
But he's not dead.

250
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,180
He wants us to piece together
a complete picture of him

251
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,700
from our individual perspectives.

252
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,580
What's the purpose of that?

253
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,420
It's pretty clear.

254
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,340
He wants us to understand the real him.

255
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,460
Right,

256
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,420
since we all have blind spots
in our knowledge of him,

257
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,020
maybe piecing the story together

258
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,060
will lead us to the answer.

259
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,820
So...

260
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,700
Who's first?

261
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,580
I will.

262
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,020
I thought you were not that close to him.

263
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,900
Fei Ke called me Dad.

264
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,340
He was my son-in-law.

265
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,300
This way, please.

266
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,300
Thank you...

267
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,780
Mr. Chen, hello...

268
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,420
What a great joy.

269
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,900
Congratulations...

270
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,420
[Groom Fei Ke, Bride Chen Jiajia]

271
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,820
Hello, may I see your invitation, please?

272
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,060
I'm the groom's classmate.

273
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,300
[He Shan]
Ms. He Shan, right?

274
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,300
Your seat is at table ten.

275
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,820
May I have your cell phone, please?

276
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,660
What's wrong?

277
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,340
We don't allow photos or videos
at the wedding.

278
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,060
Why?

279
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,300
It's because the newlyweds value
their privacy.

280
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,420
We ask for your understanding.

281
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,420
That's it.

282
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,020
[No photos or videos. Do not unseal.]

283
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,780
Hurry...

284
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,060
I'm coming...

285
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,700
Hello,

286
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,060
are you also friends with Fei Ke?

287
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:24,940
Yes.

288
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,540
Hello.

289
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,820
You're also a friend of the groom?

290
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,900
Did it ever occur to you

291
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,820
that maybe we've known each other before?

292
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,020
No way.

293
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,700
We've never even met.

294
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,700
I mean,

295
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,780
maybe there's

296
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,820
a connection between us

297
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,540
that we don't even know about.

298
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,940
Maybe Fei Ke's intention

299
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,180
is to make us find those connections

300
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,420
and then find the answer.

301
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:04,940
What answer?

302
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,020
The real purpose behind bringing us here.

303
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,580
Did he have to make it so mysterious

304
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,420
and complicated?

305
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,340
He's a liar.

306
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,700
No one trusts his words.

307
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,420
He's not just a liar

308
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,300
but a murderer.

309
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,700
He killed my daughter.

310
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,420
At the end of 2014,

311
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,900
my daughter returned after studying
in England.

312
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,100
In the spring of 2015,

313
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,820
she met Fei Ke.

314
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,340
Hello, please sign in here.

315
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,060
This way, please.

316
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,220
Thank you for being here

317
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,820
at the Haiteng Charity Race Night

318
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,300
for Caring Star Children.

319
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,300
Tonight,

320
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,060
all the money we raise

321
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,420
will support our star children.

322
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,500
[Caring Star Children,
Haiteng Charity Gala]

323
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,660
What's wrong...

324
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,580
What's wrong?

325
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,180
Sweetie...

326
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,180
Don't be scared...

327
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,300
Look.

328
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:37,740
Look.

329
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,380
Is it magical?

330
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,380
Want to know how?

331
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:45,660
Good boy.

332
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,140
No more crying.

333
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,020
Let's finish the performance

334
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,300
as planned.

335
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,180
And then I'll reveal the secret
to you, okay?

336
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,220
Thank you.

337
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,060
Tell everyone not to crowd,

338
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,060
not to stare,

339
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,020
not to applaud.

340
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,820
Everyone, please don't crowd,

341
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,700
stare,

342
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,660
or applaud.

343
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,540
And let the boy perform quietly.

344
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,300
Thank you.

345
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,180
You're his brother?

346
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,220
No,

347
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,820
I'm here for the event, too.

348
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,540
You have a way with children.

349
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,340
Autistic children are children
from the stars.

350
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,540
They're particularly focused on one area,

351
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,380
but they'll overreact

352
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,260
to external stimuli,

353
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,980
such as applause and spectators,

354
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,180
leading to nervousness and mania.

355
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,300
Do you have siblings?

356
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,260
I have a little brother.

357
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:51,900
No wonder.

358
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,300
You were also invited by An?

359
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,820
No,

360
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,180
he invited my dad.

361
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:02,940
My dad wasn't available,

362
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,580
so I came in his place.

363
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,020
So did I.

364
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,300
Did you study abroad?

365
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,460
How do you know?

366
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,100
Just a guess.

367
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,940
Seems like it.

368
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,940
I just came back.

369
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,700
My dad wants me to socialize more

370
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,940
and make some friends.

371
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,020
Where did you study?

372
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:21,940
New York.

373
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,180
New York.

374
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,780
I liked the area
around East Village and Tribeca.

375
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,460
I also like downtown,

376
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,820
but my school is in Harlem...

377
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,700
Harlem Village.

378
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,820
You went to Columbia University?

379
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,060
Business School.

380
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,020
I've been there,

381
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,420
but there's not much to eat.

382
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,020
Only the Chinese restaurant
across the street

383
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,940
from the main gate is okay.

384
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,540
Oris.

385
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,180
Cowpea and shredded pork rice.

386
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,940
I came back from England.

387
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,580
I studied design at Saint Martins.

388
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,900
May I have your name?

389
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,020
My name is Chen Jiajia.

390
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,060
I'm Fei Ke.

391
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,180
After getting to know each other
for less than six months,

392
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,340
they were considering tying the knot.

393
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,420
[Dad]

394
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,020
Hello?

395
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,260
I'm watching a movie with my friends.

396
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,060
I'm hanging up.

397
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,300
Why are you lying?

398
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,620
I can't be bothered to explain to him.

399
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,540
Explain?

400
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,260
Can't you just say I'm your boyfriend?

401
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,300
He'll definitely pick on you

402
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,020
and say we're moving too fast.

403
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,380
I don't know

404
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,660
what kind of boyfriend I should find
to satisfy him.

405
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,020
If he's not happy with me,

406
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,780
I can break up with you.

407
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,260
Fei Ke, what are you talking about?

408
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,420
Your dad's so successful.

409
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,660
It's only natural
that he looks down on me.

410
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,260
I'm not good enough for you.

411
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,740
How come?

412
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,900
I love you very much,

413
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,620
but I don't want to cause you any trouble.

414
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,620
I also don't want

415
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,900
to affect your relationship with your dad.

416
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,300
You've just returned to China.

417
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,420
You're just starting out.

418
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,740
I'm sure you'll be great in the future.

419
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,140
Sir, wait for me.

420
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:28,900
Sure.

421
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,020
He's asleep.

422
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,660
Well, then introduce me another time.

423
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,300
It's my fault for living so far away.

424
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,300
Blame me...

425
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,780
I'll work hard to buy a villa
in this neighborhood

426
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,740
so that it's easy for you
to come home to see Dad.

427
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,140
And for Dad to come home
to see his grandchildren in the future.

428
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:06,780
Sir.

429
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,180
You can go.

430
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,180
Sure.

431
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:18,780
Dad.

432
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,780
You scared me.

433
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:22,980
What time is it?

434
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,780
12 o'clock.

435
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,060
What day is tomorrow?

436
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,060
The anniversary of Mom's death.

437
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,700
We're going to visit your mom's grave
tomorrow morning.

438
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,180
Can you get up?

439
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,460
I can.

440
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,420
Who are you out late with?

441
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,580
A friend.

442
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,660
A man or a woman?

443
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,340
It's none of your business.

444
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,220
Who's this guy?

445
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,100
Are you spying on me?

446
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,780
What's his name?

447
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,220
What's his relationship with you?

448
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,980
He's Fei Ke,

449
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,260
my boyfriend for now

450
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,500
and husband for the future.

451
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,820
We're getting married.

452
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,220
Bah.

453
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,780
Getting married?
How long have you known each other?

454
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,940
Do you know him?

455
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,060
Do you?

456
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,380
I know.

457
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,620
We've known each other for six months.

458
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,980
He was in a fund management company,

459
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,020
but now he's starting his own business.

460
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,260
We're very much in love.

461
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,380
The threshold for a gold card
at Chengjiang Bank is half a million yuan.

462
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,300
He's a man who's almost 30.

463
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,260
Still can't get into the VIP lounge.

464
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,220
I don't get it.

465
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,020
You think such a guy will succeed?

466
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,220
You're playing with your life,

467
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,020
you know?

468
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,420
He has a master's degree
from Columbia University,

469
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,100
very capable.

470
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,980
I don't know what Columbia or Colombia is.

471
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,420
Columbia University,

472
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,340
an Ivy League school, don't you know?

473
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,460
I don't know that.

474
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:07,860
I only know,

475
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,900
your degree from St. Martin's,

476
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,340
I paid for it, right?

477
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,420
The clothes you wear,

478
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,340
the sports car you drive,

479
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,620
I bought them for you, right?

480
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,660
Money isn't just for spending.

481
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,540
It's also a yardstick
to measure one's ability,

482
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,420
you know?

483
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,180
My yardstick is up here

484
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,500
and you're marrying someone
whose yardstick is down here.

485
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,660
He's been having a rough time
since returning to China.

486
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,820
He'll get used to it soon.

487
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,260
Just wait.

488
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,660
How about waiting
until he ends up a loser?

489
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,460
You're the only daughter I have.

490
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,740
I've been building this business.

491
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,820
And you want me to give it to this guy?

492
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,740
Who cares about your business?

493
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,940
We can earn our own money.

494
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,900
Still talking tough.

495
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,500
I'll freeze your credit card tomorrow,

496
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,540
so you'll know how hard it is
to make money.

497
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,260
Don't bother.

498
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,260
I'll do it myself.

499
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,820
You...

500
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,700
If Mom were here,

501
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,460
she'd definitely support me.

502
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,220
Scientific psychological research

503
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,700
can give you a greater understanding

504
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,140
of the real world as it relates

505
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,620
to the real problems we face daily.

506
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,900
And when those problems arise...

507
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,020
[Chen Jiajia]

508
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,100
Hi, Jiajia.

509
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,100
Fought with your dad again?

510
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,620
What happened?

511
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,780
Don't let his emotions control you.

512
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,420
Fei Ke,

513
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,940
I want you to be my side.

514
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:05,900
Really?

515
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,180
Then open the curtains and see.

516
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,500
Where did you buy the flowers?

517
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,100
Found them by the roadside.

518
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,860
Fei Ke...

519
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,820
Be good. Go to bed now.

520
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,300
I'm right here.

521
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,100
You can see me anytime.

522
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,420
Hello?

523
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,380
Get up.

524
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,500
Ready to go.

525
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,420
I'm not going.

526
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,540
Don't be so headstrong.

527
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,260
I admit I was wrong, okay?

528
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,860
I shouldn't have sent anyone
to spy on you.

529
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,300
I apologize.

530
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,260
I'm really not going.

531
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,380
If you want to go, go yourself.

532
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,020
I've apologized to you.

533
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,100
What more do you want?

534
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,740
Get down on my knees and beg you?

535
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,380
Every year, we go
to see your mom together.

536
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,700
If you don't go this time,

537
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,580
how can I explain to your mom?

538
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,380
Unless...

539
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,780
Give you a new card.

540
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,940
Raise your credit limit.

541
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,980
I don't want money.

542
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,540
What do you want?

543
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,540
Unless you promise to meet Fei Ke.

544
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,220
Your father agreed to meet me?

545
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,620
Let's do it here.

546
00:35:59,100 --> 00:35:59,740
Whatever you say.

547
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,580
Take it easy.

548
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,500
I know the manager and can get a discount.

549
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,420
This place serves Western food.

550
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,540
Will your dad be okay with it?

551
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,940
Who cares?

552
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,580
As long as I'm okay with it.

553
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:14,700
Come on,

554
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,540
our goal is to get him to accept me.

555
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,900
You have to make him comfortable.

556
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,660
I saw an interview with him earlier.

557
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,660
He likes spicy food, right?

558
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:25,820
Yeah,

559
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,380
that's why he's so grumpy.

560
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,500
Then this place doesn't suit his taste.

561
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,780
How about this?

562
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,700
Come to my place on Thursday night.

563
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,940
I'll cook.

564
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,140
Would you mind?

565
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,620
To your place?

566
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,140
Not a good idea.

567
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,340
It's more relaxed

568
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,540
and less formal at home.

569
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,460
I'm just worried about your cooking.

570
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,460
Well, you'll have to try it then.

571
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,980
Jiajia never worried about money.

572
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,340
What she needed
was a considerate, gentle man

573
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,340
who could tolerate her tantrums.

574
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,140
You actually didn't care

575
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,620
about whether the guy's loaded or not,

576
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,420
but if he's reliable, right?

577
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,940
Then, he seemed reliable, didn't he?

578
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,180
Having dinner at his place?

579
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,780
The house Fei Ke rented
was only 30 square meters.

580
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,020
It couldn't even set a table.

581
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,020
We went to another house.

582
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,940
Luo,

583
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,220
I send you an address.
Let's go to another place.

584
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,780
Where's this place?

585
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,300
Fei Ke said he has another house

586
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,220
on Songshan Road,

587
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,180
by Outer Ringway.

588
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,100
Wait,

589
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,940
do you remember the exact location?

590
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,780
Songshan Road.

591
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,700
Zhang...

592
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,580
Zhanghua Road.

593
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,220
What's the name of that community?

594
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,700
It's...

595
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,060
Something Haoting.

596
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,020
Yujin Haoting.

597
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,540
Right.

598
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,460
Right...

599
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,580
That's the place!

600
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,020
Room 701, Building Six.

601
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,820
How do you know?

602
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,580
That's not his home.

603
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,660
