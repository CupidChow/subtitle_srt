Hello?

You have high-speed train tickets, right?

10
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,630

107
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,800

You won't find me.

113

I've got all your secrets.

114
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,200
My U-Key is not working.

115
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
Is it broken?

116
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,520
Your ID.

117
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,440
If you don't provide your ID,

118
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
I can't process it.

119
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,280
The U-Key is not mine.

120
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,760
I got it for a friend.

121
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,560
Then you need a copy of his ID

122
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,640
and a letter of authorization.

123
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,840
What if I don't have it?

124
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,000
Isn't he your friend?

125
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,080
Ask him for it.

126
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:36,880
How about this?

127
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,680
Can you check
if this U-Key works for me?

128
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,600
Okay?

129
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,160
It's not recognized.

130
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,480
Did you drop it?

131
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,880
No.

132
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
Then it's broken.

133
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,240
If it's broken, you need a replacement.

134
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,120
Replacement also requires the ID.

135
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,320
You don't have a chip in it.

136
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,480
The U-Key I had on my business trip

137
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,720
was still the real one.

138
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,680
Fei Ke knew I'd find out soon enough
that Kimmy was a fake.

139
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,120
Please enter it again.

140
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,080
So after I went back to Chengjiang,

141
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,880
he switched the real U-Key
with a fake one.

142
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,400
Then he took the ID

143
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,660
[Li Zerui]
and changed the password.

144
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,080
[Li Zerui]
Here you are.

145
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,080
Thank you.

146
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,520
He paid all the expenses

147
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,880
for the wedding.

148
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,440
So it was your money.

149
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,320
Also the deposit for Tianyuan Mansion.

150
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,980
No wonder.

151
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,060
No wonder what?

152
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,180
He didn't make any requests.

153
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,980
He only asked our family one thing.

154
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,500
All the wedding arrangements
are up to Jiajia.

155
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,100
I only have one small request.

156
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:58,820
Say it.

157
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,420
My father's identity is sensitive.

158
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,180
The supervision up there is also strict.

159
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,540
So about the news

160
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,740
of my wedding with Jiajia...

161
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,980
Don't worry.

162
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,500
No photos or videos are allowed
at the wedding.

163
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,420
No posts on Moments.

164
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,100
Keep all in low key.

165
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,300
Jiajia,

166
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,460
I'm sorry.

167
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,780
I was searching for him every day,

168
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,060
searching the internet

169
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,300
for any hint of him.

170
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,700
But I found nothing.

171
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,900
Every time I took a flight,
I checked every face,

172
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,780
but I never saw him again.

173
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,340
Who are you?

174
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,100
I'm sorry. Wrong person.

175
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:07,900
It's fine.

176
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,220
So Mr. Cheng,

177
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,100
because of the rat trading,

178
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,540
you also couldn't call the police, right?

179
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,220
It's the same as the card he had.

180
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,460
But

181
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,140
my name is on it.

182
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,080
You're right.

183
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,880
He's really paying back the money.

184
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,120
Is this his way of redeeming himself?

185
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,800
The power's out.

186
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,920
The power's out down there.

187
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,440
Hello? Can you hear me?

188
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,280
It's okay. It'll be over soon.

189
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,440
It's a typhoon.

190
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,440
A typhoon will last for days.

191
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,880
I remember it very well.

192
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,920
I met Fei Ke on a day

193
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
like this.

194
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,040
What happened between you two?

195
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,560
If my memory is correct,

196
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,120
I believe you work at Wylon Medical.

197
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,720
Right.

198
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,480
But I didn't know Fei Ke was married

199
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,320
until today.

200
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,240
How did you two meet?

201
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,320
Online.

202
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,080
You like online dating?

203
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,640
You're making a big deal out of it.

204
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,880
Online dating is all
about loneliness and excitement.

205
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,320
It has nothing to do with age or status.

206
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,120
Yes.

207
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,760
Sometimes,

208
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,440
strangers are even more reliable
than coworkers and friends.

209
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,080
In early 2014,

210
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,640
Fei Ke liked a post
on my Green Island page.

211
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,320
What's Green Island?

212
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,760
Green Island
is a photo-sharing social networking app.

213
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,200
You can have offline parties as well.

214
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,680
I never went to offline parties.

215
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,440
What I posted was just

216
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,880
a few pieces of my life.

217
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,880
All back photos, no faces.

218
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,200
Actually, I got a few followers.

219
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,280
Someone suddenly liked my post.

220
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,760
I was curious and followed him back.

221
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,680
I saw Fei Ke posting

222
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,320
the home he decorated,

223
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
his car,

224
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,160
his cooking

225
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,320
and kitty on it.

226
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,400
Sunny and warm.

227
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,160
Mostly good taste.

228
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,560
Thank you.

229
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,680
For the following months,

230
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
we just sometimes liked each other's posts

231
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,040
and left short comments.

232
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,560
Until one day,

233
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,840
it was raining hard.

234
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,940
[Rush hour,
waiting for the next available driver]

235
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,260
[It's raining so hard!]

236
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,220
[Yeah, it's hard to get a taxi.]

237
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,260
[You've read all the recent posts.]

238
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,340
[Rush hour,
waiting for the next available driver]

239
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,900
[Stuck because of the rain?
No one picks you up?]

240
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,060
[No, are you picking me up?]

241
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,540
[I can, I'm driving.]

242
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,060
[I'm kidding. I don't meet strangers.]

243
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,040
Here you are.

244
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,000
Thank you.

245
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,320
How did you recognize me?

246
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,080
You posted your photo before.

247
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,200
But only back photos.

248
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,360
You sent one front photo.

249
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,720
I slipped but deleted it right away.

250
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,080
But I remembered.

251
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,360
Disappointing, right?

252
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
Unlike what you imagined.

253
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,720
Younger than I thought.

254
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,600
How old did you think I was?

255
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
It's not your look

256
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
but your state of mind.

257
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,840
Judging from your posts,

258
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,560
you're quite sentimental.

259
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,600
That's my life.

260
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
Go to work, come home, go to bed.

261
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,600
The cycle went on.

262
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,720
It's always the same.

263
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,840
Are we waiting to carpool with someone?

264
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,840
No, we're not.

265
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,320
Where do you live?

266
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,240
Building Ten in Yuling,

267
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,240
please.

268
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
Thank you.

269
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,600
Your destination has been reached.

270
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,560
Please take your belongings with you

271
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,680
and get off on the right side.

272
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,440
Thank you for today.

273
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,320
Wait.

274
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:29,960
What?

275
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,800
You're really going to charge me?

276
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,840
Take a good look.

277
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,920
Add me as a friend.

278
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:35,840
Okay.

279
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,680
Fei Ke.

280
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,320
I'll remember you.

281
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,440
Bye.

282
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,440
What kind of character did he play
in front of you?

283
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,080
A sunny boy

284
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,080
who loves life and sports.

285
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,840
Young,

286
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
funny

287
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,840
and full of energy.

288
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,080
I had the illusion that I had known him
for a long time.

289
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,240
He looked a little younger than me.

290
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,840
But for such a young age,

291
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,480
how could he afford such a nice car

292
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,360
[Fei Ke's Moments]
and live in such a nice house?

293
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,320
There was nothing special
in his Moments,

294
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,680
so I got curious about him.

295
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,320
You know now.

296
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,200
You can't trust people online.

297
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,560
He gave me a ride home on a typhoon day.

298
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,080
I didn't think he meant any harm.

299
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,680
He liked your post unintentionally

300
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,680
or approached you on purpose?

301
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,800
After listening to
what Mr. Chen has said,

302
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,440
I think he did it on purpose.

303
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,840
You think the photos you sent
are just pieces of life,

304
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,120
but in Fei Ke's eyes,

305
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,720
they've already sketched out
a profile of you.

306
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,680
Your personality, hobbies,
and occupation.

307
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,040
All at a glance.

308
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,840
Have you ever posted anything

309
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,960
related to Wylon Medical?

310
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,480
The day I started,

311
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,600
I posted a picture of my workstation.

312
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,120
Let me see.

313
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,460
[Su Qian]

314
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,320
I don't care how you two met.

315
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,080
I just have one question.

316
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,480
It was before or after

317
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,920
April 2015?

318
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,840
Before.

319
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,320
I'm absolutely sure.

320
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,080
However...

321
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,040
However what?

322
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,080
The second time he contacted me

323
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,200
was a few months later.

324
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,440
This is for you,

325
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,960
Darjeeling black tea.

326
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,960
How did you know I like it?

327
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,360
You posted before.

328
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,480
That's right.

329
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,480
Are you here for business?

330
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,200
A small startup.

331
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,440
The partners are meeting

332
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,920
to see if we can work together.

333
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,440
The recent market may not

334
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,720
be suitable for early-stage projects.

335
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,320
There are too many entrepreneurs now.

336
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,720
Kids who graduated
from college a few years ago

337
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,000
started a garage company
with a couple of friends

338
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,760
and then called themselves a startup.

339
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,680
I'm the kid you're talking about.

340
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,200
I'm the one being invested.

341
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,960
I'm sorry.

342
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,080
It's fine.

343
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,360
From the way you act,

344
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,440
I thought you were an investor.

345
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,040
How do I usually act?

346
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,400
You graduated
from Chengjiang University.

347
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,920
How do you know?

348
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,720
I saw your Moments.

349
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,720
You posted an article
about the university's anniversary.

350
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,600
It's from two years ago.

351
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,080
Seems like you read a lot of my posts.

352
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,120
So interested in me?

353
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,280
Yeah.

354
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,320
I'm just curious what your major is

355
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,320
and when you graduated.

356
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,920
Mathematics, class of 2007.

357
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,080
We're alumni.

358
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,760
No,

359
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,000
I was one point short
of getting into Chengjiang University.

360
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,280
It still haunts me.

361
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,680
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have to study abroad.

362
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,640
It was so nice to study abroad.

363
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,400
All we have is each other's regrets.

364
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,760
Then guess

365
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,040
what game we played

366
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,880
at our year-end party?

367
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,280
No idea.

368
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,040
Say the Chinese names
of other coworkers.

369
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,680
Say it or drink.

370
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,560
Then, the whole company got drunk.

371
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,160
Aren't all foreign companies like that?

372
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,800
Five Susans, eight Katies.

373
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,800
All the female leaders

374
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,560
are either Fiona or Amanda.

375
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,040
Then what's your English name?

376
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,520
Susan.

377
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,160
I'm sorry...

378
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,280
We're even.

379
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,760
You guys from a foreign company
need to drink, too?

380
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,200
What can I do?

381
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,520
Clients want to drink.

382
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,800
If you don't want to drink,
you don't have to.

383
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,040
I'm afraid of offending people.

384
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,680
I'm just a hired hand,

385
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,200
unlike you.

386
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,400
Do you know why I chose
to start my own business?

387
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,600
Because I can

388
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,720
control my own life and destiny.

389
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,720
No one can control me.

390
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,160
I also don't have to please anyone.

391
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,080
A job is stable and safe,

392
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,440
but it's also dull.

393
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,920
I don't want my life to get stuck

394
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,800
in a predictable state.

395
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,480
Living a routine is really scary,

396
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,720
so I want to take a risk.

397
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,960
What if I win?

398
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,200
What if you lose?

399
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
I'm still young.

400
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,960
I can afford to lose.

401
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,080
Hello, please sign here.

402
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,080
Okay, please take these things with you.

403
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,720
Dürer studied painting with his father
at the age of 13.

404
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,600
By the age of 19, it was said

405
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,920
that his sketches were comparable
to those of Leonardo da Vinci.

406
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,800
Dürer studied painting
with his father at the age of 13.

407
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,480
By the age of 19, it was said

408
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,440
that his sketches were comparable
to those of Leonardo da Vinci.

409
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,960
In 1490,

410
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,840
Dürer began traveling in Europe.

411
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,320
In 1490,

412
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,200
Dürer traveled through Europe

413
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,920
and visited Bellini.

414
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,800
Do you know who Bellini was?

415
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,920
I don't know.

416
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,360
Dürer's family...

417
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,200
Dürer's family had eight children.

418
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,600
He and his brother

419
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,960
were both talented in art,

420
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,960
but the family could only afford one
to study painting.

421
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,320
So Dürer's big brother
gave him the opportunity.

422
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,440
Dürer was so moved

423
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,920
that he painted his brother's hand

424
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,520
and named it Hands.

425
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,360
Later renamed it

426
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,480
Praying Hands.

427
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,000
Why aren't you driving today?

428
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,280
Driving is too fast.

429
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,720
I wanted to spend more time with you.

430
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,200
In fact, when I was in Europe,

431
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,960
I loved to visit museums.

432
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,600
So did I.

433
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,200
So where do you like it?

434
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,320
First time in Europe as a backpacker.

435
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,200
A backpacker?

436
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,840
Italy, Austria,

437
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,560
Germany, Spain, France, Holland,

438
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,120
France.

439
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,200
I traveled for more than two months.

440
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
No smartphone at the time.

441
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,040
I stayed in a nine-euro hostel.

442
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,440
Men and women stayed together.

443
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,240
Can you imagine?

444
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,600
I miss those days.

445
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,920
I was carefree.

446
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,200
Don't be sentimental.

447
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,240
I didn't expect a science student like you

448
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,640
to know so much

449
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,760
about Dürer's work and life.

450
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,280
Because I think art is the most vital

451
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,520
and powerful thing.

452
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,120
It can break through geography, history,

453
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,520
time, and space.

454
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,120
Well, I think

455
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,760
you're in the art of language now.

456
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,000
Have I said too much today?

457
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,240
No.

458
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,360
I'm just curious

459
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,880
why you're so eloquent

460
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,240
as a science student.

461
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,160
Let's go.

462
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,880
Let me show you a place.

463
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,120
Back then, the key was passed around.

464
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,880
It was inconvenient.

465
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,000
So I secretly made one

466
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,160
and put it here.

467
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,520
Welcome to the Finance Club
of Chengjiang University.

468
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,080
What's the Finance Club?

469
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,160
A student club.

470
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,520
We commented on international news

471
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,880
and simulated economic summits.

472
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,720
Although we were quite naive
at that time,

473
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,480
we used to talk till late at night.

474
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,720
Sometimes, we'd get
into a heated argument.

475
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,360
That's when I practiced my eloquence.

476
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,000
Oh, I see.

477
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,360
This year,

478
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,240
the world's economic situation
is complex and volatile.

479
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,600
The financial crisis triggered
by the subprime mortgage crisis

480
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,000
swept across the world.

481
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,360
China's fiscal policy
has gradually changed

482
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,600
from prudent to active

483
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,880
and moderately loose.

484
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,000
Madam,

485
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,880
let me assess your risk level.

486
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,400
Well,

487
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,240
do it.

488
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,000
Comprehensive assessment, R4,

489
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,400
medium-high risk.

490
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,720
Anyone there?

491
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,760
My feet.

492
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,480
Quick.

493
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,880
Go...

494
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,160
He left.

495
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,360
I like you.

496
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,640
Who likes me?

497
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,880
I like you.

498
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,400
I love you.

499
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,080
It all happened a little too fast.

500
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:13,880
We're just

501
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,000
strangers who met online.

502
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,640
And we're seven years apart.

503
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,360
But

504
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,120
if you're really just playing,

505
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,120
I can pretend that today didn't happen.

506
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,720
Be confident.

507
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,000
You're very attractive.

508
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,960
I'll drop here.

509
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,840
Don't you invite me up?

510
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,120
Next time.

511
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,680
Actually, I lied to you.

512
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,720
Lied to me about what?

513
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,720
I know nothing about art.

514
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,440
I went to the exhibition last Friday,

515
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,640
rented a docent

516
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,360
and memorized everything in it.

517
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,440
So I could talk to you like that today.

518
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,280
Then

519
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,600
why did you do it?

520
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,680
Good night.

521
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,520
On that day,

522
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,280
where did you do that?

523
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,960
Fei Ke's home.

524
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,160
Which home?

525
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,600
Judging by now,

526
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,880
it should be your home.

527
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,840
I'm sorry.

528
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,920
I really didn't know.

529
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,000
I was completely led by him.

530
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,600
Shame on you.

531
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I swear, I really didn't know.

532
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,160
I was tricked, too.

533
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,160
Your words are too harsh.

534
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,840
Ms. Su Qian is a victim,

535
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,120
just like your daughter.

536
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,080
Let's hear her out.

537
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,080
The day he gave you a tour of the company,

538
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,120
I was on a business trip.

539
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,160
Wylon Medical

540
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,120
has its head office in Ottawa.

541
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,840
Our Asia workplace is in Chengjiang.

542
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,400
We have over 100 employees.

543
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,680
Our patented technology

544
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,640
is to use a needle to extract tissue

545
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,680
from the medulla oblongata

546
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,640
to predict the probability
of getting cancer.

547
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,320
Combined with genetic technology,

548
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,880
we can accurately provide

549
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,720
prevention programs and measures.

550
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,360
This is my workstation.

551
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,800
Why

552
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,640
do you suddenly want to visit my office?

553
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,040
To get to know you better.

554
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,800
Do you have an English version
of this project proposal?

555
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,640
Yes, I have.

556
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,480
Why do you need it?

557
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,560
I've been working
on a project proposal in English.

558
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,640
It can be my reference
for the translation details.

559
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,600
You mean you're going
to translate it yourself?

560
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,080
To save costs.

561
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,240
Here you are.

562
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,720
Thank you.

563
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,360
With the floor-to-ceiling windows

564
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,560
and the proximity to the boss's office,

565
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,440
you're highly regarded by the company.

566
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,840
You must have never been
in a big company.

567
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,160
That's the worst seat

568
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,640
in the company.

569
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,960
Being highly regarded means being on call,

570
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,720
being bossed around
and being pissed off.

571
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,200
No wonder you brought me here so late.

572
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,480
The daytime view is not

573
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,680
as beautiful as the night now.

574
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,760
Besides,

575
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,440
there are coworkers here in the daytime.

576
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,720
What's wrong with coworkers?

577
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,720
Just introduce me to them.

578
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,000
If I were 20 years old,

579
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,840
I'd introduce you to everyone.

580
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,200
But I'm almost 40 years old now.

581
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,320
I don't want people

582
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,840
to gossip behind my back.

583
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,840
Why don't you get married?

584
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,040
I don't want kids.

585
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,240
I can't find a reason
to get married, either.

586
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,200
Being unfettered like what I am now.

587
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,080
Isn't it nice?

588
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,960
Maybe that's why you don't want
to go home.

589
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,040
It's too lonely there.

590
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,680
Why don't you ever take me home?

591
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,400
My home is too small,

592
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,320
too messy.

593
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,400
Building Ten in Yuling.

594
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,840
A luxury mansion, right?

595
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,600
Rented.

596
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,400
I'm afraid

597
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,360
we'll never get a result.

598
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,640
Marriage is the only result?

599
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,600
I don't think so.

600
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,400
Just enjoy the moment.

601
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,360
I have to go on a business trip.

602
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,720
How long?

603
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
Maybe a week.

604
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,160
Will you miss me?

605
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,920
I miss you already.

606
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,080
Really?

607
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,320
Dad,

608
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,640
their boss is out of town today.

609
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,600
He asked me to greet you.

610
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:08,920
No need to be polite.

611
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,880
I'm counting on them to make me money.

612
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,100
[Su Qian]

613
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,480
This is
the Canadian cancer screening equipment

614
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,320
I told you about before.

615
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,640
It's the only company in China

616
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,360
[WYLON]
that has this technology.

617
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,120
This project proposal

618
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,800
has no Chinese version?

619
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,800
Yes, there is.

620
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,800
I'll translate it and bring it to you.

621
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,040
I'm Susan's friend.

622
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,320
She's on a business trip.

623
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,640
She told me.

624
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,840
She's already arranged it for me.

625
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,560
This is Mr. Chen from Nanlin Mining.

626
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,880
He wants to know more about our company.

627
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,680
Fei Ke waltzed into Wylon
with Su Qian's staff ID

628
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,640
and took a tour.

629
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,880
Mr. Chen was convinced

630
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,400
and handed over the money to him.

631
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,120
Bye.

632
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,640
However, at the time,
Su Qian was out on a business trip.

633
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,960
Susan's. Help me give it back to her.

634
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,380
[Su Qian]
She didn't know Fei Ke brought someone

635
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,200
to the company.

636
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,200
A visit from a man like Mr. Chen.

637
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,120
Who would ask?

638
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,480
When was the last time you saw him?

639
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,080
After I came back from my business trip,

640
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,400
I suddenly couldn't reach him.

641
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,660
[Honey, I'm taking off.]

642
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,940
[I landed.]

643
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,380
[Fei Ke]

644
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,840
Sorry, the number you dialed
is out of service.

645
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,680
I'm sorry.

646
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,920
Honey, you're also on a business trip?

647
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,200
Are you on a plane?

648
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,120
If you land,

649
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,120
message me to let me know
you're alright, okay?

650
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,480
Sorry, the number you dialed
is out of service.

651
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,720
Sorry, the number you dialed
is out of service.

652
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,640
I'm sorry.

653
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,600
Did you go to look for him?

654
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,440
I did.

655
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,800
Whenever he took me to his home,

656
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,440
we always entered from the basement.

657
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,040
I couldn't remember
which unit or building it was.

658
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,880
I just remember it was
on the seventh floor.

659
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,360
It was on the seventh floor. Right.

660
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,760
So I had to use my memory

661
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,200
to look from door to door.

662
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,880
But it was all so well-decorated,

663
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,520
I couldn't tell the difference.

664
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,760
I remember now.

665
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,360
I've seen you before.

666
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,440
Who are you looking for?

667
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,480
Who...who are you?

668
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,640
I'm the owner.

669
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,640
What's wrong?

670
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,320
Well, you've been living here all along?

671
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:52,920
Yeah.

672
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,960
Have you rented this house out before?

673
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,840
No.

674
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,120
I've lived here alone all along.

675
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,880
Who on earth are you looking for?

676
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,120
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

677
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,120
That day, I asked you
who you were looking for.

678
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,440
Why didn't you tell me?

679
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,680
I didn't want anyone
to know about my relationship with him.

680
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,920
Why not?

681
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,920
Do you know he's married?

682
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,200
I really didn't know.

683
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,640
I was trying very hard to find him.

684
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,640
If that day I asked you

685
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,880
and you said his name,

686
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,480
then maybe we'd be on the same page.

687
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,080
Then we could have caught him together.

688
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,200
Did you see him again?

689
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,640
Yes.

690
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,440
What did he lie to you about again?

691
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,360
No way.

692
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,880
What's wrong with you?

693
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,680
I'm fine.

694
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:08,920
What's going on?

695
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,400
You shouldn't have disappeared.

696
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,960
What's going on?

697
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,640
Something happened to me.

698
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,920
What happened?

699
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,720
Say something.

700
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,160
Well.

701
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,360
You won't say anything?

702
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,960
Then never say it.

703
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,720
And don't contact me again.

704
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,280
What's going on? Tell me.

705
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,440
I didn't contact you

706
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,680
because I feared I'd get you into trouble.

707
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,080
What do you mean?

708
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,560
What kind of trouble?

709
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,040
The Series A investor of my project,

710
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,720
we had a good deal.

711
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,880
We've signed the agreement.

712
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:19,920
I started the project

713
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,840
with my own money.

714
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,920
But he reneged on the deal

715
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,680
and refused to pay.

716
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,440
I don't get it.

717
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,400
Where did you get the money?

718
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,160
I wanted to hold on
until they paid the money,

719
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,640
so I mortgaged all the company's assets

720
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,440
and took out a bridge loan.

721
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,960
But they disappeared completely.

722
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,160
Uh, no, what do you mean?

723
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,160
I don't understand.

724
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:51,880
Su Qian,

725
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,560
I'm broke.

726
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,600
I'm out of money.

727
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:01,940
Such a big deal.

728
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,240
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

729
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,400
I'm here today to tell you I'm okay.

730
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,600
Trust me,

731
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,680
I can handle it.

732
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,480
How much do you need?

733
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,920
Never mind.

734
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,120
It's none of your business.

735
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,920
Say something. How much do you need?

736
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,280
Maybe millions.

737
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,440
It has nothing to do with you.

738
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,720
Su Qian,

739
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,880
I may have caused you
a lot of grief lately.

740
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,600
I can't meet you anymore.

741
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,400
Take care of yourself.

742
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:39,880
Fei Ke.

743
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,600
I'm just here to reassure you today.

744
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,160
I don't want to get you into this.

745
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:05,820
[Certificate of Property Rights]

746
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,700
[Your account has received
a deposit of 3,000,000 yuan.]

747
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,820
[Su Qian]

748
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,520
I told you this has nothing
to do with you.

749
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,820
Give me your account number.

750
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,880
I'll give it back to you.

751
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:46,960
Don't worry about it.

752
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,920
Take the money now

753
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,680
and get it fixed.

754
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,280
We'll get through this together, okay?

755
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,600
Where did you get that kind of money?

756
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,000
Fei Ke,

757
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,520
this is the first trouble
that's happened to us

758
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,960
since we've been together.

759
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,160
I want to be there for you.

760
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,840
I want to help you get through this.

761
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,280
Understand?

762
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,160
Okay.

763
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,920
I'll pay you back in a week.

764
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,880
No rush about the money,

765
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,920
but promise me

766
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,480
you'll keep in touch with me,
don't disappear again,

767
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,880
and don't let me worry about you, okay?

768
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,800
I know.

769
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,280
I understand.

770
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,240
Now that I think about it,

771
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,120
it's not so much that he lied to me

772
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,400
but I threw myself into the trap.

773
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,640
Where are you? I want to see you.

774
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,900
Not now, it's too dangerous.

775
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,100
Wait a few days.

776
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,320
I'll send you a location.
