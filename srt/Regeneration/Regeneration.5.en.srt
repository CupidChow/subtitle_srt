189
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,630
And also,

190
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,840
I have nothing to do
with your daughter's death.

191
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,160
They caused her death.

192
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,800
I haven't talked to Fei Ke for years.

193
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,040
Don't blame me.

194
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,160
You were a dance specialty student

195
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,190
at CUST in the class of 2009,

196
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,670
majoring in Environmental Design.

197
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,630
After more than half a year with Fei Ke,
you took a break from your studies.

198
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,920
Why?

199
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,040
You worked so hard to get
into your dream college

200
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,430
but didn't finish it.

201
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,840
Six years ago,

202
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,760
what happened between you two?

203
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,070
Yes.

204
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,390
I am a dance specialty student.

205
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,520
I got admitted to CUST
with my specialty.

206
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:27,960
Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday,

207
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,600
I had to go to dance team rehearsals.

208
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,480
Releve, demi pointe.

209
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,430
Up.

210
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,030
An 8-count.

211
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,150
Down and go.

212
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,670
One, two, three, four,

213
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,840
five, six, seven, eight.

214
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,760
Third port de bras, down, turn.

215
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,520
Good.

216
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,480
You come to lead the practice.

217
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,070
Okay.

218
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,270
Come on, everyone.

219
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,520
Hold tight.

220
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,310
Five, six, seven, go.

221
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,310
One, two, three, four,

222
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,310
five, six, seven, eight.

223
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,430
Two, two, three, four,

224
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,550
five, six, seven, eight.

225
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,390
Up.

226
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:07,960
Down.

227
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,070
Come, up.

228
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,270
Down.

229
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,550
Zhang Xuan,

230
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,550
where are you looking?

231
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,640
Keep your hands higher.

232
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,880
Watch your expression.

233
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,760
Come on, let's all do it again.

234
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,150
Five, six, seven, go.

235
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,270
One, two, three, four,

236
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,520
five, six, seven, eight.

237
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,520
Two, two, three, four,

238
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,120
five, six, seven, eight.

239
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,430
That's all for today.

240
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,360
We'll rehearse as usual
on Saturday at 7:00 PM.

241
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,240
You're free to go.

242
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,910
Thank you, Ms. Wei.

243
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,240
Goodbye, Ms. Wei.

244
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,150
Good job.

245
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,070
Milk tea,

246
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,880
with red beans and pudding.

247
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,670
Thank you.

248
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,030
Zhang Xuan,

249
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,880
do you want to be
in the final show or not?

250
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,790
Control your weight.

251
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,270
I know.

252
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,150
It's sugar-free.

253
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,240
Not good either.

254
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,120
- Who is this?
- Who?

255
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,360
If my boyfriend brought me milk tea,

256
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,270
I'd be willing to put on 15 kilos.

257
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,120
Let me introduce.

258
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,720
This is my boyfriend, Fei Ke.

259
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,270
He is from the School
of Information and Computing Science,

260
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,480
Chengjiang University, class of 2006.

261
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,390
A big mouthful.

262
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,240
A top student.

263
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:22,880
So elegant.

264
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,430
Hello, nice to meet everyone.

265
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,520
I hope you'll take care of Zhang Xuan.

266
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,390
- No problem.
- No problem at all.

267
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,720
My cousin is also
from the School of Computing Science,

268
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,360
Chengjiang University, class of 2006.

269
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,640
What's his name?

270
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,480
Lu Yang.

271
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,240
I know him.

272
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,430
Well, I asked him to introduce me
to some cute guys.

273
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,910
Why haven't I heard him mention you?

274
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,720
He's in class three. I'm in class one.

275
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,240
Actually, I was in the class of 2005.

276
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,600
I took a year off due to illness
in my senior year.

277
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,150
I came back and graduated
with the class of 2006.

278
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,960
That's why I don't know
any of my classmates well.

279
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,520
That's why I haven't seen
you around on campus.

280
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,070
If I'd known you earlier,

281
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,670
Zhang Xuan wouldn't
have gotten the chance.

282
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,520
Stop it.

283
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,120
Zhang Xuan,

284
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,390
come up here and clean up.

285
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,520
Coming.

286
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,360
- We're leaving first.
- Bye.

287
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,390
Why wouldn't she do it herself?

288
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,640
It's the freshmen's job.

289
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,390
Rules of the team.

290
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,550
With her dancing skills,

291
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,000
she should be your backup dancer.

292
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,390
She's a senior student.

293
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,390
Seniority matters.
I'm not even on the list.

294
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,120
Just a university dance team.
Too dogmatic.

295
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,670
I'll tell Ms. Wei

296
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,720
to let you dance the lead.

297
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,070
Cut it off.

298
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,240
But you know,

299
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,360
I've been dreaming

300
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,600
of dancing the lead in Swan Lake
since childhood.

301
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,000
Why Swan Lake?

302
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,430
Because one person
can dance two roles then.

303
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,880
Especially the part of the Black Swan,

304
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
which is much more difficult.

305
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,880
Not only her movements and expressions

306
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,000
but also her psychological activities

307
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,550
can better reflect my level.

308
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,480
Although I'm only a freshman now,

309
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,550
I hope I can dance the lead role

310
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,840
in the graduation show in the future.

311
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,940
[Chengjiang Theater]

312
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,030
Bolshoi Ballet?

313
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,190
Where did you get it?

314
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,310
I saved money by eating instant noodles
for a month

315
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,840
and working on a construction site
for a few days.

316
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,360
Then I can't bear to watch it.

317
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,880
I lied to you.

318
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,360
My mom's friend gave it to me.

319
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,190
This is expensive.

320
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,150
Want to go?

321
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,120
When did you two get together?

322
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:34,150
Just a month or so.

323
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,720
You've done a good job of hiding it,

324
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,910
even from us.

325
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,880
Exactly.

326
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,670
No,

327
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,310
I just wanted to wait
until we are more settled

328
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,310
before I told you.

329
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,960
You don't think of us as friends.

330
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,790
No,

331
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,940
it's not true.

332
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,340
It's because his family background
is quite complicated.

333
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,100
How complicated?

334
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,820
I don't know exactly.

335
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,700
But I heard he was admitted

336
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,300
to Chengjiang University
with a gold medal in the Olympics.

337
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,510
So amazing.

338
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,510
I told you.

339
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,180
- So awesome.
- Right.

340
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,580
And he's also in the Finance Club.

341
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,390
How far along are you two?

342
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,460
I can't tell you that.

343
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,820
- Come on.
- You don't think we're friends.

344
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,870
Come on, it's just the three of us.

345
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,940
- Come on, tell me.
- Come on.

346
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,910
We're roommates.

347
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,670
Tell us...

348
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,670
Did you two...

349
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,100
Anyway, we agreed to keep it low key.

350
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,940
We don't care if you keep it low key.

351
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,580
- Tell us.
- Right.

352
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,460
Not yet.

353
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,790
Look how shy she is.

354
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,100
I was a bit of an introvert,

355
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,420
not as active as a big-city kid

356
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,550
like Fei Ke.

357
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,060
He had a lot of friends inside
and outside of the university.

358
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,300
So knowledgeable with broad horizons.

359
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,580
And could talk about anything.

360
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,990
I was only 18 at the time.

361
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,060
For a senior from Chengjiang University
like him,

362
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,150
I was a big admirer.

363
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,300
This sounds like

364
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,340
a childish campus romance.

365
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,550
You had no money.

366
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,460
Nothing to get ripped off for.

367
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,630
He ripped me off for something
more important than money.

368
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,030
Mr. Jin.

369
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,340
This is Mr. Jin.

370
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,750
He organized the performance.

371
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,790
He gave me the tickets.

372
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:36,910
Glad to meet you.

373
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,750
This is my friend.

374
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,390
The leading dancer
of the CUST dance team,

375
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,100
Zhang Xuan.

376
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:43,790
Awesome.

377
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,700
Thank you so much

378
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,030
for bringing a top dance troupe
to Chengjiang.

379
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:48,940
It's very impressive.

380
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,700
I'm having a celebration party later.

381
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,670
I have to go.

382
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:54,750
I'll leave now.

383
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,150
Zhang, we'll see what you can do.

384
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,060
Okay, fine.

385
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,270
Yes, bye.

386
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,870
See what I can do?

387
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,390
We'll see in a few days.

388
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:18,550
Let's go.

389
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,180
A rented house.

390
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,150
You really clean it as your own.

391
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,510
I'm just rehearsing.

392
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,340
When we graduate and get married,

393
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,390
we'll have our own house.

394
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,820
Then I'll be ready for it.

395
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,300
Why don't you keep silence?

396
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,670
Don't you want to be with me forever?

397
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,390
No.

398
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,870
I just don't like making promises

399
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,420
such as "forever" and "never change."

400
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,990
It's unrealistic.

401
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,700
You can just lie to me
and make fun of me.

402
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:14,910
Okay, fine.

403
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,180
As long as I come
to watch you every day,

404
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,300
you won't run away.

405
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,300
If you have

406
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,750
so much energy,

407
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,820
you should focus more
on your studies and career.

408
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,150
You art students

409
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,910
always have a hard time
with academic studies.

410
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,630
Tell me how many courses you failed.

411
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,940
I know I'm stupid,

412
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,630
but I'll try to catch up with you.

413
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,910
How?

414
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,100
I'm studying now.

415
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,820
What are you reading?

416
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,100
The courses I failed.

417
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,150
College English.

418
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,580
Introduction to Chinese Culture.

419
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,940
History of Western Philosophy.

420
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,390
The bags have names on the outside.

421
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,060
Find your costume and get dressed.

422
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,180
We're rehearsing with makeup tonight.

423
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,300
Where did you get these costumes?

424
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,420
It's sponsored
by the performance company.

425
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,030
Not only that

426
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,390
but for our future performances.

427
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,790
The lighting, the sound,

428
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,940
and even the make-up

429
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,550
are all of the first-class standards.

430
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,030
Girls,

431
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,270
seize the opportunity
to show off yourselves.

432
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,510
From today,

433
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,270
you're the Black Swan,
the principal player.

434
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,550
Hurry up and change your clothes.

435
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,790
Thank you, Ms. Wei.

436
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:49,820
Hurry up.

437
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,820
We'll rehearse in ten minutes.

438
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,790
Awesome.

439
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,300
That's a good one.

440
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,300
You're not good on stage.

441
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,220
So you've been working hard off the stage.

442
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,150
Not at all.

443
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,390
I'll try my best.

444
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,270
Good luck.

445
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,420
Okay.

446
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,270
Great job.

447
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,630
Girls, you were incredible tonight.

448
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:05,750
Thank you, Ms. Wei.

449
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,940
Thank you very much.

450
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,820
Really not bad.

451
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,580
Let's pack up.

452
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,220
I'll take you all out for a late supper

453
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,460
to celebrate and send off our graduates.

454
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,390
Quick. Go.

455
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,790
Go... Pack up.

456
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,790
Zhang Xuan.

457
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,460
When I switched to you,

458
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,300
I wasn't sure what to expect.

459
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,030
I didn't think you'd do such a good job.

460
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,580
Thank you, Ms. Wei.

461
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,940
In fact, I've always
wanted to play this role.

462
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,180
I've been consulting with my seniors
and studying the video.

463
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,180
I have to thank you

464
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,510
for raising the bar of our performance.

465
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,750
You

466
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,060
have good skills

467
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,510
and good resources.

468
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,630
Give my regards to Jin Hai.

469
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,940
Send our CUST dance team's thanks.

470
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:54,940
For next semester's Carmen,

471
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,580
you've been cast as the principal player.

472
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,100
Keep up the good work.

473
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,750
Let's go to the celebration party.

474
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,460
Okay.

475
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,940
Let me pack up. I'll be right there.

476
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,870
- I'm back.
- Thank you, my husband.

477
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,340
You called me what?

478
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,030
Future husband.

479
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,910
Don't call me that.

480
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,150
It's kind of weird.

481
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,870
What's wrong?

482
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,580
Why don't you feel happy for me?

483
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:29,820
Right,

484
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,340
get dressed.

485
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,300
We'll go out later.

486
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,300
Jin has organized a celebration party
for you today.

487
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:39,580
But...

488
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,820
But what?

489
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,870
Our dance team also
has a celebration party.

490
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,940
Ms. Wei would like
to invite all of us to join.

491
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,390
It's okay.

492
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,390
If you don't want to go, don't.

493
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,150
I'll explain to Jin.

494
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:58,030
It's not that I don't want to go.

495
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,820
It's fine.

496
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,820
Just go to your team's celebration.

497
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,150
I'll talk to Jin.

498
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,700
Tell him to cancel the private room.

499
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,670
I'll go with you.

500
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,670

That's why I did you a favor

521
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,140
and paid for your performance.

522
