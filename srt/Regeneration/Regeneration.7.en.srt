[Episode 7]

4
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,680
Don't be nervous.

5
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,870
This is just a little scammer.

6
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,870
This scumbag should be grateful to you

7
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,960
for being able to live some extra hours.

8
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,150
So he can know why he has to die.

9
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,680
You hear me?

10
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,150
It's all your fault.

11
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,960
It's your sin.

12
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,920
He tried to run out of the country,

13
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,790
but my people stopped him.

14
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,960
Before killing him,

15
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,560
I just want to know one thing.

16
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,070
Exactly how many people has he scammed?

17
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,870
What kind of a man is he?

18
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,590
As smart as I am,

19
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,560
I just can't believe

20
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,070
that I got tricked by this scumbag.

21
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,760
Luckily, I'm a curious person,

22
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,350
which spared you

23
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,990
a few more hours to live.

24
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,510
Today,

25
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,630
I invited all you victims here,

26
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,840
to settle all the debts.

27
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,960
To clear out

28
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,630
everything

29
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,760
he owed you.

30
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,920
Mr. Chen, calm down.

31
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,630
He... He doesn't deserve to die.

32
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,150
Drop the knife.

33
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,150
You're not dragging us all
into murder, are you?

34
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,990
Are you crazy?

35
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,280
Relax.

36
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,710
Fei Ke doesn't exist anymore.

37
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,560
If we keep our mouths shut,

38
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,840
no one will know.

39
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,590
That driver's one of my own.

40
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,230
He'll get rid of the boat.

41
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,960
If you don't do it,

42
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,070
you're not getting out of here.

43
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,470
Do what?

44
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,910
You each stab him once,

45
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,840
and make him feel our pain.

46
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,720
And then,

47
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,030
we drop him into the sea.

48
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,600
You can call the police, or sue him,

49
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,790
but you can't kill him!

50
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,790
Sue him?

51
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,400
Sue him?

52
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,070
How many years would he serve?

53
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,680
You people!

54
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,190
You hated his guts
when you talked about him.

55
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,030
Now that I have him here

56
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,630
so you'll take vengeance.

57
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,070
And you're now

58
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,840
playing noble?

59
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
You think

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,840
you'll get your money back?

61
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,280
No!

62
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,070
Those transfer records,
bank account and keys,

63
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,510
were all faked by me!

64
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,230
I did all that to make you

65
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,440
speak out about
all the dirty things he did!

66
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,470
You.

67
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,560
Can you get your face back?

68
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,230
Can you get your innocence back?

69
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,280
Can I get my daughter back?

70
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,120
This is for Jiajia.

71
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,560
Kill him if you want,

72
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,280
but leave us out of it!

73
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,910
This is for me.

74
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,600
Stop it!

75
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,120
Why are you smiling?

76
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:15,960
Liu Mo,

77
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,280
pick up the knife and kill him!

78
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,510
Do it!

79
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,880
You hear me?

80
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,070
Give him a chance to explain.

81
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,560
Have you lost your mind?

82
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,510
He's a fraud!

83
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,400
You can't let him talk!

84
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,680
Give me the key.

85
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,840
I'm the only one that can drive a boat.

86
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,790
If you want to go home,

87
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,470
you'll have to listen to him.

88
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,910
You!

89
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,880
If you won't let him talk,

90
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,350
then I'll talk.

91
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,680
You asked me to look into Fei Ke,

92
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,070
but during the investigation,

93
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,990
I found some suspicious clues.

94
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,360
Fei Ke did scam you,

95
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,550
and he did deserve to be punished,

96
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,280
but the details I found
are quite different

97
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,070
from what you told me.

98
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,600
Which side are you on?

99
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,240
Mr. Chen,

100
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,870
between you and Jiajia,

101
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,070
who met Fei Ke first?

102
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,870
In 2015,

103
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,670
at the Bailu Golf Club,

104
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,510
Fei Ke paid
for a hundred hours of training.

105
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,800
He signed in for the first 32 hours,

106
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,670
but the rest

107
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,720
were all signed by you.

108
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,990
Gao.

109
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,550
Hi.

110
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,870
Dad, why are you taking me here?

111
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,630
I can't play golf.

112
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,400
I can't, either,

113
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,720
but that's how you do business.

114
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,510
Watch and learn.

115
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,400
What brings you here today?

116
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,430
Long time no see.

117
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:25,990
Yeah.

118
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,800
My daughter.

119
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,630
Lovely.

120
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,040
Uncle Gao,

121
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,960
how many goals have you hit?

122
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,430
About 90.

123
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,160
Qi,

124
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,990
how's your son?

125
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,240
His son was just born.

126
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,240
I'm a grandpa now.

127
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,160
Look at you!

128
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,070
Why didn't you tell me
about the wedding?

129
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,430
Congratulations!

130
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,510
What about your daughter?

131
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,280
Is she married?

132
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,240
Not even close.

133
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,360
Come on.

134
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,870
Who's that young fellow?

135
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,240
I hear he's a shareholder of this place.

136
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,750
The son of some chief.

137
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,750
Okay.

138
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,720
Go on and have fun.

139
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,990
Young man, nice hit.

140
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,240
Thanks, Mr. Chen.

141
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,480
I'm an amateur.

142
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,800
You know me?

143
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,990
We haven't met,

144
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,550
but I've heard about you a lot.

145
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,360
You flatter me.

146
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,800
Please teach me.

147
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,040
I can't seem

148
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,400
to get the right swing.

149
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,480
It never hits hard enough.

150
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,750
I'm also kind of new in this,

151
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,670
but I have a good coach.

152
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,870
I can introduce him to you.

153
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,110
That'll be great.

154
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,040
I bought a hundred hours of his.

155
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,310
Next time you're here,

156
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,510
just use my account

157
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,510
and put it on my tab.

158
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,800
That's not necessary.

159
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,840
Don't be polite to me.

160
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,990
I won't need so many.

161
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,480
You can just use my hours.

162
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,240
Well, thank you then.

163
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,480
Come on! Yeah!

164
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,310
Let's

165
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,600
befriend each other.

166
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,070
Okay.

167
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,990
Take a note.

168
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,990
My name's Fei Ke.

169
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,920
If you need to book time or service,

170
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,070
just give me a heads-up.

171
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,400
Okay.

172
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,430
Are you here alone?

173
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,110
With my daughter.

174
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,800
Jiajia!

175
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,310
Was Fei Ke and Jiajia's marriage

176
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,160
solely arranged by you?

177
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,670
Why, all of a sudden?

178
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,800
Well, I was just curious.

179
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,280
Are you married?

180
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,600
No.

181
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Girlfriend?

182
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,430
No.

183
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,310
And your parents weren't anxious?

184
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,960
Actually, they want me
to be cautious instead.

185
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,630
Why?

186
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,480
Wait,

187
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,920
what do your parents do?

188
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,800
My father's in Beijing.

189
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,360
He's just an ordinary public servant.

190
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,040
My mother is a college teacher.

191
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,920
Which department is your father in?

192
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,430
Just tell me.

Okay.

196
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,960
Then we must have met each other before.

197
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,480
Is his first name Fei too?

198
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,280
I took after my mom.

199
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,190
Oh, I see.

200
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,870
I get it.

201
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,310
Why won't you get a girlfriend?

202
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,920
I just got back from abroad.

203
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,160
I don't know a lot of people yet.

204
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,190
And I haven't met the right girl.

205
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,720
What do you know?

206
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,510
You see, my daughter studied abroad too.

207
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,720

210
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,430
Right! Master degree.

211
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,240
See, I may not look good,

212
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,750
but my daughter's pretty.
She took after her mom.

213
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,900
She's almost as tall as me

214
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,310
wearing high heels.

215
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,660

216
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,900
do you have time?

217
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,190
I wanna set you up on a date.

218
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,580
You both studied abroad,

219
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,460
I bet you'll have some common language.

220
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,370
You should get to know each other,

Mr. Chen,

223
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,340
I did some background check.

224
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,070
There is indeed a Deputy Director General
surnamed Li.

225
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,870
Born in 1960.

226
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,100
I found some photos for you.

227
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,870
Okay.

228
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,270
There's one more thing.

229
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,540
The legal staff told me

230
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,630
that we still have problems
with the procedures

231
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,460
of the mines we purchased in Luanchong.

232
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,660
I suggest we wait.

233
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,700
Why wait?

234
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,020
Just get them first.

235
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:47,950

00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,140
Mr. Chen,

239
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,390
this Saturday at the Huxin Club,

240
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,950
there's a charity auction

for autistic kids.

242
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,700
A lot of artists
and entrepreneurs will be there.

243
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,430
I'll go too.

244
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,510
I'd like to invite Jiajia

245
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,510
if she has time.

246
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,270
Okay.

247
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,140
She does!

248
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,830
Then I'll send you the invitation.

Why didn't you tell me you're back?

251
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,190
Look.

252
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,700
Isn't that incredible?

253
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,580
You do the chase and I'll do the talk.

254
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,830
She'll change her mind eventually.

255
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,340

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,950
Fei Ke

257
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,270
has been waiting for you downstairs
for over an hour.

258
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,270
He's such a nice young man,

259
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,430
and he's crazy about you.

260
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,140
Why don't you... Why don't you
just make friends first?

261
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,630
I have enough friends!

262
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,870
I just want to you settle down,

263
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,750
Why can't you just give me that?

264

This is my life!

00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,100
Why do I have to do what you want?

266
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,140
Why?

267
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,950
Because I'm your father!

268
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,830
You can have what you want

269
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,900

Why won't you go home?

272
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,950
I have to pretend to be with you

273
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,270
so my dad would shut up.

274
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,580
Why pretend?

275
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,750
I have someone I love,

276
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,390
but my dad doesn't like him.

277
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,750
Where is he?

278
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,990
My dad drove him away.

279

Can't you guys sit down and talk?

281
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,830
No use.

282
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,270
All my dad knows is verbal abuse

283
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,460
and guilt-tripping.

284
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,390
I'm so sick of him now!

285
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,390
If he forces me any further,

286
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,900
I'll kill myself!

287
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,390
Don't say that.

288
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,750

289
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,140
why not stay at a hotel?

291
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,990
Then you'll take the bed

292

on getting married?

297

Isn't that too hasty?

298

Come on.

299
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,700
You're not getting any younger.

300
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,510
I want to save up first.

301
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,510
Right now,
I can't even afford a decent wedding.

302
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,180
Money cannot buy time, can it?

303
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,510
How much longer do you want Jiajia
to wait?

304
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,270
I'm eager to have a grandson, okay?

305
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,030
That's not what I meant.

306
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,630
I was just hoping

307
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,700
that I'd give Jiajia a better life.

308
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,750
Jiajia's life is good enough already.

309
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,150
Don't worry about money.

310
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,180
Just treat her well

311
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,940
and be faithful.

312
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,390
That's all I'm asking.

313
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,390
Can you do it?

314
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,420
Yes.

shall we meet here, or at my club?

321
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,180

322
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,270

This marriage between our kids

325

Yes. The quota is limited.

It's a star project.

336
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,670
Count me in.

What's the estimated return?

341

I'm just a tiny project manager.

342

I don't wanna get married.

351
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,990
Why?

352
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,510
I don't love him.

353
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,940
Forget love.

354
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,390
Fei Ke will be a good husband.

355
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,700
He's perfect for you.

356
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,030
I'm happy with him.

357
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,180
Why does it matter
if you're happy with him?

358
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,990
I'm the one who's marrying him.

359
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,910
Well, love can be cultivated.

360
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,990
He's a great guy.

361
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,220
You'll regret it

362
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,580
if you miss him.

363
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,670
You just want his family background!

364
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,940
Well, marriage

365
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,390
is between two families, you know.

366
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:28,990
Dad,

367
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,270
I still can't get over him.

368
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,460
You will.

369
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,990
Time will wash out everything.

370
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,630
Dad!

371
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,990
Enough.

372
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,750
You see.

373
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,870
Now that the parents have met,

374
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,300
the wedding has been set,

375
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,300
if you back out,

376
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,180
you'd really embarrass me, okay?

377
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,750
Dad, please!

378
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,340
It's settled.

379
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,630
Listen, you'll thank me later.

380
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,420
I'm only doing this for your own good!

381
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,030
Don't force me to do this, dad!

382
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,750
Let's eat.

383
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,180
Go pick your wedding dress later.

384
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,550
Dad,

385
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,030
Organization Code.

386
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,810
[Business License]

387
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,910
Look.

388
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,910
This is the official website
of the Ministry of Lands and Mines.

389
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,990
All the mining certificates are required

390
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,670
to be filed and publicized.

391
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,940
Your Luanchong projects are here.

392
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:34,910
Good.

393
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,220
Very good.

394
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,670
Although,
I can only give you the backup copy.

395
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,630
The official paper certificate

396
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,150
has to be kept in the ministry.

397
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,990
It's mainly for your protection.

398
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,550
Oh, I see.

399
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,580
Do protect your father too, okay?

400
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,180
I heard that there are several mines

401
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,870
with rented accounts in Zhifeng Group

402
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,300
looking for buyers.

403
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,460
If I buy them,

404
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,820
can you help me

405
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,790
get them approved?

406
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,030
Will that work?

407
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,030
You'll need to hurry.

408
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,100
Things are getting stricter now.

409
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,670
I see.

410
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,030
Let's cooperate.

411
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,580
Whatever you need, just tell me.

412
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,700
Writing a web page like that

413
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,220
is a piece of cake for Fei Ke.

414
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,670
I've visited all of Nanlin's providers

415
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,060
and clients

416
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,750
between 2014 and 2016,

417
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,300
there was no problem with your business,

418
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,180
while you insisted on expanding.

419
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,550
That's why you became reckless

420
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,580
and purchased many illegal mines.

421
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,030
Dad!

422
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,510
You knew Zhifeng's mines are illegal!

423
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,340
How could you buy them!

424
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,790
Did you ask Fei Ke
to get you the permission?

425
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,300
Stop asking.

426
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,750
Stay out of this.

427
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,580
Just live your simple life.

428
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,990
Don't you care what I want?

429
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,180
Am I just a tool to you?

430
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,790
I'm only doing this for your own good!

431
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,990
Getting married and having kids
is every woman's duty.

432
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,100
Having kids early

433
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,820
helps you recover fast, okay?

434
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,670
And it's good for the kid too.

435
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,510
You're just trying to gain favor
from Fei Ke's family!

436
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,510
Shush!

437
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,220
Is that right, dad?

438
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,510
Is he upstairs?

439
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,300
Yes.

440
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,340
Come here!

441
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,390
Do you honestly think

442
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,750
that I need to gain favor from anyone?

443
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,670
I'm old. I'll die before you.

444
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,550
I have to find someone suitable

445
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,340
to take care of you.

446
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,820
I want to find him myself.

447
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,300
I don't love him
and he doesn't love me either.

448
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,180
There's no way we'll be happy together.

449
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:43,750
You!

450
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,510
You haven't been married.
You don't get it.

451
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,180
The truth is,

452
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,300
love is overrated.

453
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,990
l know better.

454
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,270
Fei Ke

455
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,100
has got high IQ and EQ.

456
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,390
And he's got the best outside

457
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,030
and inside.

458
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,390
He'll treat your kids well.

459
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,100
I don't care!

460
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,510
I'm an adult.

461
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,100
I have my own judgment.

462
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,990
Yes, you're an adult,

463
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,460
but I'm your father.

464
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,700
I will do everything in my power

465
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,750
for your happiness.

466
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,220
I'd rather

467
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,340
every disaster

468
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:21,580
and pain

469
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,750
fall on me,

470
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,300
so that you'll never have to suffer.

471
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,270
Understand?

472
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,270
But I'm suffering right now!

473
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,990
How come you're suffering?

474
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,270
You're living in a big house.

475
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,220
You have more money you can spend.

476
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,940
And you have a great fiance!

477
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,870
You're just being picky!

478
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,550
Dad,

479
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,550
Fei Ke is not as powerful as you think.

480
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,340
Be careful.

481
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,420
I don't know what water of oblivion

482
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,700
you gave to my father,

483
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,910
but I'll just never gonna marry you,

484
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,910
and don't you ever touch me!

485
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,460
I won't touch you.

486
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,670
Good.

487
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,940
I heard what you just said.

488
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,670
I said it out loud on purpose.

489
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,790
Actually, I was forced
into this by my parents too.

490
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,820
People like us

491
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,300
can never have the freedom to choose.

492
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,790
Even if they don't control us,

493
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,460
we're not capable enough

494
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,700
to control our own lives.

495
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,270
Say that for yourself.

496
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,630
I am.

497
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,670
Then why don't you go look for him?

498
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,940
I can't find him.

499
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,460
You will if you try.

500
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:45,990
You're just afraid.

501
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,750
You don't want to piss out your dad.

502
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,870
You complain about him,

503
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,150
but you also love him.

504
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,510
Because he brought you up all by himself.

505
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,750
Indeed, he did a lot.

506
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,580
That's why I don't want to disappoint him.

507
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,670
Actually, we don't have
to really get married.

508
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,180
What do you mean?

509
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,580
We could have the wedding,

510
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,340
but we could skip the legal procedures.

511
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,270
We could act before our parents

512
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,790
and get what we want.

513
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:36,980
Chen Jiajia,

514
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,070
we might not love each other,

515
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,500
but you're a good girl.

516
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,220
What do you mean?

517
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:55,980
Dad,

518
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,950
[Prenuptial Agreement]

519
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,860
I know that Jiajia's also
a shareholder of Nanlin.

520
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,380
A lot of your cars, estates,

521
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,860
and other assets are under her name.

522
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:07,030
That's why I hired a lawyer
and got a prenup

523
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,830
to protect Jiajia's property.

524
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,030
That's nonsense!

525
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,070
That's absolutely unnecessary.

526
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,030
This way, you'll have
nothing to worry about,

527
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,910
and I get to show you my sincerity.

528
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,220
I know that this marriage

529
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,260
has brought you rumors.

530
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,220
I want

531
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,830
to show my earnestness to Jiajia,

532
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,340
which has nothing to do
with money or background.

533
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,190
Enough.

534
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,980
I won't let her sign it.

535
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,310
If this gets out, I'd be embarrassed.

536
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,620
Everyone will think that I'm stingy!

537
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,910
Then we'll get married after the purchase

538
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,980
of Luanchong and Zhifeng.

539
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,340
In that case,

540
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,030
the profit of the purchases

541
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,740
will become Jiajia's premarital property.

542
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,710
Are you kidding?

543
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:59,030
It'll take years
before the deals are sealed.

544
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,340
I'm eager to have a grandson, okay?

545
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:08,620
How about this, dad?

546
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,620
I've got a compromise solution.

547
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,070
We do the wedding,

548
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,310
but not the legal procedures.

549
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,590
We're not getting the marriage certificate

550
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,950
until the two deals

551
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,140
are settled.

552
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:22,950
That way,

553
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,740
your face is saved

554
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,590
and my dad's protected.

555
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:29,710
Well,

556
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,740
okay. Go ahead.

557
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,980
Okay.

558
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,340
Thanks, Dad.

559
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,500
Mr. Chen, hello!

560
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,950
Congratulations!

561
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,620
[Groom: Fei Ke, bride: Chen Jiajia]
Congratulations!

562
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,260
You have my daughter now.

563
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,550
Don't worry, dad.

564
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,710
As a father,

565
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,140
you've been controlling Jiajia's life,

566
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,310
forcing her,

567
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,220
using her as a bargaining chip.

568
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,620
That's why she's so depressed.

569
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,620
And also,

570
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,190
you lied about the crucial fact too.

571
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,460
Did Jiajia really kill herself?

572
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,950
The son of some chief.

573
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,460
Ten million.

574
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,500
As estimated, within three years...

575
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,590
I'm a shareholder!

576
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,550
Fei Ke!

577
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,710
Fei Ke!

578
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,740
Dad,

579
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,950
why do you hate him so much?

580
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,100
I kind of like him, you know.

581
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,500
He knows me better than you do.

582
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,980
Look how professional
the actors he hired are.

583
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,790
Shut up!

584
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,950
We don't love each other,

585
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,140
however,

586
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,070
he cared about me.

587
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,910
Nonsense!

588
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,910
He's just a big fat liar!

589
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,070
I thought you had a good eye for people.

590
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,950
I guess you can be wrong.

591
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,260
The one I love,

592
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,380
you despise.

593
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,220
And now look,

594
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,860
you brought home a scammer,

595
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,830
forced me to marry him,

596
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,070
and claimed to be doing it for me.

597
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,220
Let me tell you something else.

598
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,670
The truth is,

599
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,260
Fei Ke and I
have been putting on an act.

600
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,310
The marriage

601
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,860
is fake.

602
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,460
Being in love

603
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,220
is fake.

604
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,550
I never allowed him to touch me at all.

605
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,460
Happy?

606
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,790
You forced me to do this, you know?

607
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,670
It's your own arrogance

608
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,790
that got you to fall into Fei Ke's trap.

609
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,310
I wanna thank him.

610
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,430
He showed you

611
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,670
how ridiculous,

612
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,950
how arrogant and stupid you are.

613
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,830
You don't deserve to be a father.

614
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,190
Get back!

615
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,070
Jiajia!

616
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,140
Jiajia, stop the car!

617
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,140
Are you trying to kill yourself?

618
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,950
The surveillance camera got everything.

619
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:57,030
You tried repeatedly to stop her car,

620
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,310
which led to her car crash.

621
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,110
Cheng Hao,

622
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,830
you've only been on one business trip
in the September of 2014.

623
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,110
It was Flight AR1519.

624
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,110
Seat 5L.

625
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,180
First-class seats are mostly empty.

626
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,550
I checked the seating record.

627
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,180
Your next seat 5J was not taken.

628
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,350
So I wonder,

629
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,980
how did Fei Ke sit next to you

630
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,980
and chat with you?

631
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,700
Excuse me.

632
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,500
I noticed that you were reading CFA.

633
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,500
Are you a finance student?

634
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,420
Sort of.

635
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,630
Freshly graduated?

636
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,350
Just graduated from grad school.

637
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,980
I majored in technology
at Chengjiang University.

638
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,830
And I recently switched
to the financial industry.

639
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,870
Everyone in the company is some hotshot.

640
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,940
I have to try catching up
in my spare time.

641
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:21,980
You're being modest.

642
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:23,940
You're reading a level three,

643
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,420
which means you've passed level two.

644
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,260
That's something.

645
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,550
Beats most finance students already.

646
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,630
May I know your name?

647
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,900
My name's Fei Ke.

648
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,590
But I thought your first name is Li.

649
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,630
How do you know?

650
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,460
I was right behind you
at the security check.

651
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,500
I saw your ID card.

652
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,030
My parents got divorced
when I was little.

653
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,350
I used my mum's first name.

654
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,660
I'm Cheng Hao.

655
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,830
A pleasure to meet you.

656
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:51,980
Likewise.

657
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,460
Cheers.

658
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,630
Come on, again!

659
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:03,940
Here!

660
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,180
Cheers!

661
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,180
My good buddy, Fei Ke.

662
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,180
He's also in the financial industry.

663
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,980
Song is also from your university.

664
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,070
I'm from the Materials School,
Class of 2002.

665
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,350
A true senior of mine!

666
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,660
Which class are you from?

667
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,390
I took a year off due to illness
in my freshman year.

668
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,460
I'm actually from Class 2005,

669
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,700
but I learned with Class 2006.

670
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,150
You should've graduated by then.

671
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,500
Who supervised you?

672
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,110
Professor Lu.

673
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,460
Do you know Kong Xiangzhe then?

674
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,390
He's also from Class 2006.

675
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:34,940
Who?

676
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,830
Kong Xiangzhe.

677
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,220
No.

678
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,550
I probably remembered it wrong.

679
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,310
Nice.

680
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,630
Fast reaction.

681
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,550
Is he really from Chengjiang University?

682
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,630
We didn't have anyone
by the name of Kong Xiangzhe.

683
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,350
He lied.

684
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,390
To test me?

685
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,460
A lot of people are imposing
as Chengjiang graduates now.

686
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,220
There are too many scammers out there.

687
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,420
Our circle doesn't just accept anyone.

688
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,900
Everyone lies.

689
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,590
Fei Ke memorized

690
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,500
thousands of names within those classes.

691
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,110
He's difficult to be exposed.

692
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,500
Shall I drive you home?

693
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:39,870
No need.

694
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,460
I live in a hotel room nearby.

695
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:43,870
Why live in a hotel?

696
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,660
See you!

697
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,900
Bye!

698
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,700
The apartment I rented

699
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,180
has been leaking.

700
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,110
Then...

701
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,980
I haven't cleaned the guest room
for a while.

702
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,830
I'll have the cleaning lady
clean it tomorrow.

703
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,550
No need, brother.

704
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,350
I'll just sleep on the couch.

705
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,110
We have similar sizes.

706
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,660
I'll get you some of my clothes.

707
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,180
They're brand new.

708
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,030
You and Fei Ke
share similar backgrounds,

709
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,350
and you're even similarly risk-driven,

710
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,460
that's why you appreciated each other.

711
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,150
He knew your sense of insecurity
coming from a small town

712
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,390
and he knew what you crave underneath.

713
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,940
He also knew what he needed to do

714
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,390
to make you find him

715
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,870
useful.

716
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,870
A hundred and seventy-seven square meters.

717
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,350
Twenty-year loan.

718
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,870
Monthly payment of 24 thousand.

719
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:24,660
In our town, you're the first one

720
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,900
to buy a place in Chengjiang.

721
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,500
Good for you!

722
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,310
Son, you're so great!

723
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,460
You live alone in such a huge apartment?

724
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,980
That's wasteful.

725
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,590
You need to get a wife.

726
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,150
Have a few kids.

727
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,220
Yeah, okay.

728
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,030
I've checked.

729
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,630
On the day Fei Ke opened his account,

730
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,740
he put in three million yuan all at once.

731
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:50,180
More came afterwards.

732
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,940
Where did he get the money?

733
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,740
Rat trading with my account?

734
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,110
We're not family.

735
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,700
The supervision won't find out.

736
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:02,870
Maybe not, Hao.

737
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,030
If we get caught,

738
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,870
we're both going to jail.

739
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,310
If we don't tell anyone,

740
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,830
no one will find out.

741
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,150
Besides,

742
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,590
we use our money to invest

743
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,310
and the earnings go to your account.

744
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,590
What do you have to be worried about?

745
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:24,900
Alright.

746
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:28,790
Fei Ke.

747
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:30,980
Be bold.

748
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,660
Remember.

749
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,870
If we can succeed,

750
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,550
the means won't matter.

751
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,830
The wind's getting heavy! Turn around!

752
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,420
If we go any deeper, the boat will flip!

No one can get home alive!

754
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,660
Su Qian,

755
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,180
the money you lent to Fei Ke,

756
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,630
was it your own?

757
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,700
Let me be more straight.

758
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,030
When you first met Fei Ke,

759
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,740
were you single?

760
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,500
Apart from being professional,

761
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,180
I believe I'm also a detail-oriented,

762
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,550
meticulous person.

763
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,150
Actually, I think to be an accountant,

764
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,150
you don't need smartness or strategy.

765
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,790
All you need is earnestness.

766
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,790
treating every number with sincerity.

767
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,030
Mr. Zhao.

768
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:54,700
Please sit.

769
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,220
Dan.

770
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,350
Come see me after the interview.

771
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,150
Okay.

772
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,030
Actually, this is my first
job application

773
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,070
after I came back home.

774
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,350
This girl's kind of nice.

775
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:18,630
That's right.

776
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,260
Get Susan a table by the window.

777
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,870
Susan, we got you a new table.

778
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:35,590
Here.

779
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,350
Okay. Thanks.

783
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,250
What brings you here today?

784
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,290
Long time no see.

785
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,730
Yeah. This is my daughter.

786
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,100
Lovely.

787
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,140
I'm on my way home.

788
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,100
No need.

789
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:20,620
My phone's dying. Talk to you later.

790
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:25,290
Boyfriend?

791
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,060
No.

792
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,620
A company leader.

793
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:30,820
Chasing you?

794
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,100
No.

795

In 1490,

Dürer traveled through Europe.

797
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:22,530
Don't you invite me up?

798
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,580
Next time.

799
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,450
You're home. Why so late?

800
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,010
I met a high school classmate.
We haven't seen each other for long,

801
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,180
so we chat for a while.

802
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:34,900
Really?

803
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,930
Right. I cooked you soup.

804
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,380
Try it.

805
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,420
Thank you.

806
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:43,250
A friend of mine saw you today.

807
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:44,820
You went to Dürer's art show?

808
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,340
What art show?

809
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,060
Your friend must have got it wrong.

810
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,140
Let me be straight.

811
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:55,100
You went out on a date?

812
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:57,140
No.

813
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,530
What are you trying to say?

814
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,690
That classmate of yours

815
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:08,930
seems much younger than you.

816
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,690
Can you stop sounding so jealous?

817
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:20,450
I told you I didn't.

818
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:22,770
If you won't believe me, fine.

819
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,580
That's not what I meant.

820
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:28,380
Why don't you ever take me home?

821
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,530
My home is too small, too messy.

822
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:35,690
Building Ten in Yuling.

823
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:38,690
Each apartment is
about 220 to 370 square meters.

824
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,060
There's no month rent below 20 thousand.

825
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:42,660
Small?

826
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,580
You looked into me?

827
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:06,420
Why so nervous?

828
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:09,860
Are you married?

829
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:11,970
Yes.

830
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,730
Why are you looking like that?

831
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:24,290
I don't love him.

832
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,450
He's 17 years older than me.

833
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,490
He brought me a job and residence

834
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,900
so I could settle down in the city.

835
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:35,490
Do you know how important that is

836
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:36,930
for a thirty-something woman?

837
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:40,340
But I'm not young anymore.

838
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:43,100
Those are not what I want right now.

839
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,820
I wanna respect my body and my heart.

840
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,420
I don't want to keep lying
to myself anymore.

841
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:49,620
Why did you lie to me then?

842
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,180
He doesn't mind.

843
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,010
What are you afraid of?

844
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,010
I'm not afraid,

845
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,010
but there's not gonna be any result.

846
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:03,660
What result?

847
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,580
Why can't we just enjoy the process?

848
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,490
If your husband wasn't Wylon's CEO,

849
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:14,930
would you dare do that?

850
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:24,100

851
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:26,930

852
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:28,290
With who?

853
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,290
I'm just here to say goodbye.

854
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,140
I don't get it.

855
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,380
I thought we were in love.

856
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,490
Fine. If it's me

857
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,250
and him that's bothering you,

858
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:47,930
I can get a divorce.

859
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,140
- Forget it.
- If that's the problem,

860
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:51,060
I'd really...

861
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,010
Just give me time, okay?

862
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:53,100
Stop lying to me!

863
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:53,770
I'm not lying to you.

864
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,060
Stop lying to me!

865
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,380
What's the point?

866
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:00,210
I'm not lying to you.

867
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,250
I don't love him at all

868
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,210
and he doesn't love me either.

869
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,250
He doesn't care about me.

870
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,450
Apart from money,

871
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,250
he can't give me anything.

872
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,450
With him,

873
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,930
I feel like a dead person.

874
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,530
But with you,

875
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:23,770
I feel alive.

876
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:25,060
But you need money.

877
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,060
You need the social status he gives you.

878
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:27,930
You enjoy it.

879
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:28,620
I don't need it!

880
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:29,820

881
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,580
I'll tell you again.

882
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,380
I don't need it!

883
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,250

You can't help me.

She can.

888
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:49,930
I can too.

00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:50,860
Do you have money?

890
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:56,530
I do.

891
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:58,580
Never mind.

892
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,970

did you go see him?

932
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:12,900
did you actually sign those?

933

00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,380
Also,

941
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:35,820
please leave others

942
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,860
out of this.

943
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:39,490
Okay?

944
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:53,450
I admit.

945
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:54,620
I lied too.

946
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,820
No one drugged me.

947
00:52:56,970 --> 00:52:58,210
And I wasn't drunk that night.

948
00:52:58,820 --> 00:52:59,860
On the contrary,

949
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:01,580
I can drink a lot.

950
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:03,580
I've been dreaming

951
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,690
of dancing the lead in Swan Lake
since childhood.

952
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,380
Why Swan Lake?

953
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,450
Because one person
can dance two roles then.

954
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:13,140
Especially the part of the Black Swan,

955
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:14,140
which is much more difficult.

956
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,580
Not only her movement and expression

957
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,060
but also her psychological activities

958
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:19,900
can better reflect my level.

959
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:22,340
When you're in your fourth year,

960
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,900
you'll be able to dance the lead
at your graduation performance.

961
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,290
But I can't wait.

962
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:27,860
I dance much better than anyone else.

963
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:29,580
Haste makes waste.

964
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:32,930
Fei Ke,

965
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,450
can you help me get the lead?

966
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,450
How will I help you?

967
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,490
You know the agent
of the performance company.

968
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:45,340
Get them to sponsor our show!

969
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:47,620
I'll try.

970
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:48,580
Fei Ke.

971
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:50,490
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

972
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:51,730
The show was great!

973
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:52,970
This is Jin Hai,

974
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:55,180
Chief Agent of Bolshoi Ballet in China.

975
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:56,340
This is...

976
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,340
I'm Zhang Xuan.

977
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:58,620
I'm Fei Ke's friend.

978
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,290
So you're a dance student too?

979
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:00,970
Yes.

980
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:02,730
Ballet, traditional, classic.
I can do them all.

981
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:04,530
Give me a call
if you have any dancing gigs.

982
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:06,580
Sure. Nice meeting you.

983
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:51,900
You're back.

984
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:53,290
- Congratulations.
- Here.

985
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:54,930
Come on. Hold it for me.

986
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:00,930
You're going out?

987
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:03,290
Jin threw a congratulations party for me.

988
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:04,490
I have to go thank him in person.

989
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:07,690
Isn't it too late now?

990
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,210
It's a special case today.

991
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:12,340
Plus, I'll need more favor from him.

992
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:14,490
He's got connections in the business.

993
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:16,450
I might need him one day to land a job.

994
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:19,010
You're only a freshman.

995
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,290
Go with me, okay?

996
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,100
No.

997
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:25,420
Why not?

998
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:26,970
I thought he was your friend.

999
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:29,580
You're okay if I go alone?

1000
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:41,900
Fei Ke.

1001
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,010
Mr. Jin.

1002
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,180
How are you? Come. Sit.

1003
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:45,210
- Please sit.
- Mr. Jin.

1004
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:45,820
Here!

1005
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:46,770
Do you drink?

1006
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,060
Yes, I do.

1007
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:49,420
Western wine, or?

1008
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:50,340
Anything.

1009
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:55,690
What a drinker!

1010
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,450
Guys, hear me out.

1011
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:01,620
I'm late,

1012
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:02,380
so I'll drink one first.

1013
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:03,770
Bottoms up for me, casual for you.

1014
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:07,690
Nice. Mr. Jin's friend is the best!

1015
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:11,490
Sit.

1016
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:13,140
Thank you for taking care of me,

1017
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,530
and for your referral.

1018
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:15,970
You're welcome.

1019
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:17,770
I'll drink this one up. Mr. Jin, please.

1020
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:18,620
Cheers.

1021
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:20,770
Let's sing songs. Play a game.

1022
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:23,730
Easy.

1023
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:26,250
It's okay.

1024
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,290
Let me pour you another glass.

1025
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,250
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

1026
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:30,420
Let's play a game, Mr. Jin.

1027
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,290
Okay.

1028
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:31,820
Come on.

1029
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,420
Play Lie to Me.

1030
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:39,450
I'll guess two twos.

1031
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:42,490
Are we done?

1032
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:43,450
Let's go home.

1033
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:45,290
We barely got here.

1034
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,250
Not so soon.

1035
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:47,180
It's late.

1036
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:49,660
No, it's not.

1037
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:53,490
Then I'll go first.

1038
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,420
Okay. Go on.

1039
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:00,180
♪Walking alone
through time's dreary paths♪

1040
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,140
Wait for me at home.

1041
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:04,100
Come on. Let's do it.

1042
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:08,300
♪I got used...♪

1043
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:21,210
Who is it?

1044
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:23,770
Who is it?

1045
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,450
Why are you here?

1046
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:33,450
Alone?

1047
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:35,490
What do you think?

1048
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:45,420
I feel terrible.

1049
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,490
My head hurts.

1050
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:52,530
That's normal for first-time drinkers.

1051
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,060
I'll never drink like this again.

1052
00:57:57,530 --> 00:57:58,580
Ever.

1053
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,450
What happened yesterday?

1054
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:03,860
I don't remember.

1055
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:05,380
I left first.

1056
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,100
I called you at twelve.

1057
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:09,210
You told me you were drunk.

1058
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:11,900
After that,
you never answered my calls again.

1059
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:16,690
They got me a hotel room nearby.

1060
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:18,420
A few girls took care of me.

1061
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:20,140
They left afterwards.

1062
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:21,620
Jin said he told you.

1063
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:24,340
I thought you were drunk

1064
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:26,660
and you didn't remember.

1065
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:29,860
Why are you dwelling on the details?

1066
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,690
I don't do this every day.

1067
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:34,420
It's the first time.

1068
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:47,380
Put it down.

1069
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:48,290
Whose watch is this?

1070
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:51,380
Whose is this?

1071
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:54,140
Jin's.

1072
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:56,290
Why is his watch in your room?

1073
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:57,930
He was drunk too.

1074
00:58:58,010 --> 00:58:59,580
He insisted on giving it to me.

1075
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:01,100
It's worth hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

1076
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,340
How could I take it?

1077
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:03,930
Come on.

1078
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:06,620
Don't be mad.

1079
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,860
I won't do it again.

1080
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:13,010
I'm sorry, okay?

1081
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:14,690
Can anyone explain

1082
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:16,490
Aristotle's Wax Theory?

1083
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:22,490
Miss? Wake up.

1084
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:23,580
Please answer this.

1085
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:31,620
The cognitive capacity of humans
is like a piece of blank paper.

1086
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,730
The cognitive capacity of humans
is like a piece of blank paper.

1087
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:35,210
There are no marks born with it.

1088
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:37,100
There are no marks born with it.

1089
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:41,820
Cognition is created
under direct influence

1090
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:42,450
from the outside.

1091
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:46,180
Like a wax creating a stamp.

1092
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:51,100
Boring.

1093
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:52,860
So boring.

1094
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:56,380
I'm a technology student,
taking your class.

1095
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,690
What do you have to complain about?

1096
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,770
Come on. I'm an art student.

1097
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,180
I hate literature classes!

1098
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:04,490
Any plans for tonight?

1099
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:05,730
Studying.

1100
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:08,490
Let's go out for fun.

1101
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,490
The finals are coming.

1102
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:13,730
I'll fail even if I study.

1103
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,250
I take a re-test before graduation.

1104
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,060
They invited me to sing.

1105
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:17,970
Go with me.

1106
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:20,660
Who?

1107
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:25,060
Jin's friends from last time.

1108
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:36,820
Fei Ke.

1109
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:42,490
Come on!

1110
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:04,010
Since we're here,

1111
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:05,250
sing a song.

1112
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:17,300
Drink then.

1113
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:32,630
You turned Fei Ke's friend into yours

1114
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:35,260
and made more friends via them.

1115
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:37,470
Soon, you lost interest in Fei Ke.

1116
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:40,230
Well, you know about love.

1117
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:42,020
We were young.

1118
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,630
We change a lot.

1119
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:46,540
What's the real reason

1120
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:48,430
for you to go get plastic surgery?

1121
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:57,060
None of them look good.

1122
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:01,390
Can't you

1123
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:03,230
sit down and read a little?

1124
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,110
I'm too fat.

1125
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:08,110
So ugly.

1126
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:10,110
No, you're not fat

1127
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:11,150
and you're not ugly.

1128
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,470
You're just anxious.

1129
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:17,630
Look.

1130
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:19,340
Does it look taller this way?

1131
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,230
I want to get my eyes widened.

1132
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:23,340
No, you don't.

1133
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:24,820
Why not?

1134
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:26,190
They all did.

1135
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:28,150
I want to get a new chin too.

1136
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:29,390
Who are they?

1137
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:31,300
The chicks in the clubs?

1138
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:33,470
A lot of college students
do micro-plastic surgeries!

1139
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:35,060
What's the big deal?

1140
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:39,980
Whatever.

1141
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:44,150
You're saying yes?

1142
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:46,980
Then

1143
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:48,500
lend me some money.

1144
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:50,110
I don't have any.

1145
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:53,190
The surgery costs a lot.

1146
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:53,950
If it doesn't go well,

1147
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,630
your parents will hate me even more.

1148
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,980
My parents don't care about that.

1149
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:00,390
I honestly have no money.

1150
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:02,870
Fine. I'll ask someone else.

1151
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:06,110
Zhang Xuan,

1152
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:08,260
if you change your face,

1153
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:10,060
we'll break up.

1154
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:12,740
Fine. Break up then.

1155
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:14,630
You're stingy

1156
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:15,820
and you're outdated.

1157
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:17,780
This has nothing to do with money.

1158
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:19,300
This has everything to do with money!

1159
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:20,230
You don't want me to become pretty.

1160
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,470
You don't want me to make friends.

1161
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:23,870
You don't want anyone
better than you in my life!

1162
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:26,950
Fei Ke.

1163
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:28,670
You're so pathetic.

1164
01:03:49,710 --> 01:03:50,470
Get out!

1165
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:53,150
Fine. I'll get out.

1166
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:55,300
Once I get out, I will never come back.

1167
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:04,230
Also, you didn't just
take a break from college.

1168
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:06,820
You dropped out.

1169
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:08,260
That's right.

1170
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:10,020
After I hung out with those people,

1171
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:12,430
I realized that I've got nothing
in common with my classmates.

1172
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:14,630
They kept talking about
internships and degrees,

1173
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:16,390
so boring, so childish!

1174
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:18,230
What's so good about college anyway?

1175
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:20,260
So what, if you graduate?

1176
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:22,190
It's knowing the right people
that's more important.

1177
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,300
You took pictures and posted them
on WeChat Moment,

1178
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:28,540
blocking out your family and classmates.

1179
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:31,260
Every time,
you spent a lot of time grouping.

1180
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:33,820
Your lifestyle was envied by some,

1181
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:36,470
but shameful

1182
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:38,190
to the others.

1183
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:39,950
Who are you?

1184
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:41,740
How do you know so much about us?

1185
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:44,060
Why did you try to defend Fei Ke?

1186
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:45,540
I wasn't trying to defend Fei Ke.

1187
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,470
I'm just trying to find the truth.

1188
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:48,980
He is indeed guilty,

1189
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:51,300
but you need to resolve it with law

1190
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,630
rather than violence.

1191
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:09,670
He Shan.

1192
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:13,910
I'm finally seeing you again.

1193
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:17,740
In fact,

1194
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:21,820
she's the person I've known

1195
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:24,910
