Sometimes, he told me
he'd buy clients' dinner.

187

And I'd give him my VIP card.

188

00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,160
When I was studying
at Columbia University,

191
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,430
there wasn't much to eat
around the campus,

192
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,350
except for a Chinese restaurant
across the school gate,

193
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,400
called Oris.

194
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,310
Every time I went,

195
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,080
I ordered cowpea and shredded pork rice.

196
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,310
The first time I went to Europe,
I was a backpacker.

197
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,400
Italy, Austria, Germany,

198
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,840
Spain, France, Holland...

199
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,870
I traveled around.

200
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,040
Spent two and a half months.

201
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,870
There was no GPS back then.

202
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,040
No smartphone.

203
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,080
We lived in a hostel that cost
nine euros a bed.

204
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,430
Co-ed, you know?

205
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,040
Including the bathroom.

206
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,110
We hung out like that

207
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,640
for several months.

208
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,350
Until one day...

209
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,740
[Fei Ke]

210
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,640
Hello.

211
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,910
I'm home.

212
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,280
Look at you!

213
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,230
Come on in.

214
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,870
How could it leak?

215
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,750
Well, the rain's heavy.

216
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
And I live on the top floor.

217
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,080
Water flows down the ceiling.

218
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,230
Even my bed's wet.

219
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,520
Call property management.

220
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,670
It's an old apartment.
They don't have property management.

221
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,310
I'll just crash for the night

222
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,230
and leave first thing tomorrow.

223
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
You can stay as long as you want.

224
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,870
Take a bath first.

225
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,550
Okay.

226
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,640
I think we're about the same size.

227
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,720
I got you some of my clothes.

228
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,480
They're new.

229
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,200
I'll go get the guest room ready.

230
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,280
No need, Hao.

231
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,840
I'll just sleep on the couch.

232
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,840
It'll be for a couple of days, tops.

233
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,200
Are you sure?

234
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,160
Yes.

235
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,230
This couch feels even better than my bed.

236
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,350
Fine. Sleep tight then.

237
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,080
Okay.

238
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,160
See you tomorrow.

239
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,750
Goodnight.

240
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,200
You're early.

241
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,280
Went for a run?

242
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,200
I brought you breakfast.

243
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,230
No, thanks.

244
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,160
I'll just grab a sandwich
down the building.

245
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,430
It's a freshly baked croissant.

246
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,870
No time.

247
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,310
I've got a tight schedule.

248
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,720
It's packed.

249
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,750
Take it for the road.

250
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,110
I have to drive

251
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,310
while taking a conference call.

252
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,230
Kimmy.

253
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,160
I'll see you then.

254
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,840
Okay.

255
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,640
Can you drive?

256
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,750
Yeah, I can.

257
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,720
Get changed.

258
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,200
Follow me.

259
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,840
This model is problematic.

260
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,720
Your prediction is not optimistic enough.

261
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,550
A project with a CAGR

262
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,230
of 45% earnings

263
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,670
is not sexy enough.

264
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,750
Who'd want to invest in that?

265
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,870
The gross rate grows with scale.

266
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,960
It'll get higher.

267
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,040
Change the number from 40%

268
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,200
to 50%.

269
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,870
Change it now.

270
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,640
Tell me the IR number.

271
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,990
That's more like it.

272
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,400
The IR should be above 30%

273
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,600
to be able to sell.

274
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,350
I'm running late.

275
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,110
Park the car for me.

276
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:12,910
Okay.

277
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,230
Where's the underground parking lot?

278
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,990
Are you a guest here, or...?

279
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,480
I'm here for a meeting.

280
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,520
One minute, please.

281
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,110
Okay.

282
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,750
Hello. Come with me, please.

283
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,670
Okay.

284
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,230
From that day on,

285
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,720
he started living at my place.

286
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,310
I thought it'd only be a couple of days.

287
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,080
He never mentioned
repairing his apartment again.

288
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,990
He didn't live there for free, though.

289
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,430
He took care of all the chores.

290
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,430
I was a bit uneasy at first.

291
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,640
Try this. Here.

292
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,670
But he helped me

293
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,520
do the laundry, clean the apartment,
clean the cat litter.

294
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,600
He played golf with me
and he drank with me.

295
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,910
Your feet. Keep them straight.

296
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,670
Don't run...

297
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,350
Gradually, I got used to it.

298
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,160
I kind of enjoyed it, actually.

299
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,160
No wonder he cooks.

300
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,350
It's a happy day!

301
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,790
Thanks...

302
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,540
No, thanks! Please!

303
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,060
It's okay.

304
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,570
No. Really.

305
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,450
Fei Ke.

306
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,890
I'm almost done here.

307
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,300
Come pick me up.

308
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,500
Hello.

309
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,620
Is Mr. Cheng not feeling well?

310
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,300
He's okay.

311
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,500
Are you his driver?

312
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,770
Can I help you?

313
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,860
This is a gift that we brought him.

314
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:21,860
He left it behind.

315
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:22,980
Maybe next time.

316
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,220
I can't take it for him.

317
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,860
It's just a simple gift.

318
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,500
Mr. Cheng likes tea.

319
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,860
This is a national gift. Not for sale.

320
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,300
We'd really want him to take this.

321
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,660
Well, I'll take it for him. Thanks.

322
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,370
Bro.

323
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,530
What are you doing?

324
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,380
Someone gave you a gift.

325
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,450
White peony. National feast special.

326
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,140
It's not available in the market.

327
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,140
Keep it for future guests.

328
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,140
What brings you here?

329
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,140
What's this?

330
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,380
Business School of Columbia University?

331
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,690
You learned English?

332
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,650
Forget the Ivy League,

333
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,500
I know every university

334
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,290
within the QS top 50.

335
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,780
Every trade has its master, you know?

336
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,780
Follow this as the standard

337
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,980
for paper and embossed print.

338
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,740
Can you make this?

339
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,860
Idiot. You can easily
buy this in the street.

340
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,020
These are all fake.

341
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,650
It's not the tea that's difficult.

342
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
It's the packaging.

343
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,570
The fonts

344
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,860
and stamps.

345
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,330
There are wormholes in the cotton paper.

346
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,690
To prevent moisture,
it was once wrapped with wax paper,

347
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,450
which left wax stains.

348
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,220
I want it identical.

349
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,410
Can you do it?

350
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,220
Sure,

351
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,020
but it'll cost you.

352
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:56,740
Make it fast.

353
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,410
Master, who's this guy?

354
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,450
We used to share the same bed,
even the same pants.

355
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,530
He's my buddy,
making our way in the city.

356
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,780
When I first got out of jail,
I was penniless.

357
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,980
He was the one

358
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,410
who helped me make a comeback.

359
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,100
Bro, your phone call!

360
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,140
Who is it?

361
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,860
[An from Haiteng]

362
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,290
An from Haiteng.

363
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,050
Answer it and turn him down for me.

364
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,530
Who is this guy?

365
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,900
He's doing charity.

366
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,740
He wants donations.
I've donated several times!

367
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:00,620
Hello.

368
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,330
Hello, Mr. Cheng.

369
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:03,780
This Saturday,

370
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,980
we're holding a charity auction

371
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,050
for autistic children.

372
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,220
Many artists

373
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,380
and leaders in all trades will come.

374
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,050
I'd like to invite you too.

375
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,980
Would it be possible
for you to participate?

376
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,100
When and where?

377
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,620
Check-in starts at six o'clock
on Saturday night.

378
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,930
At Huxin Club.

379
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,450
I'll send you the invitation letter
if you're interested.

380
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,450
Is it the same address?

381
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,020
Yes.

382
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,650
Get me two.

383
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:27,570
Sure.

384
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,170
Have you turned him down?

385
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,290
Then I won't take your time anymore.

386
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,330
I turned him down.

387
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,450
Bro,

388
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,100
can I borrow some clothes?

389
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,170
This Saturday,

390
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,500
I have an important client.

391
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,530
Sure. Pick one.

392
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,410
You know them better than me.

393
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,980
Are you seeing a client or a date?

394
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,530
A vice director of some fund.

395
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,410
I want to leave a good impression.

396
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,860
I'm a vice director of a fund.

397
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,530
Why were you never
so solicitous with me?

398
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,290
Not solicitous? Who ironed your shirts?

399
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,290
Let me tell you.

400
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,780
A vice director of a fund

401
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,930
tends to be most keen
on judging someone by their clothes.

402
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,290
Here. Try them.

403
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,330
They should suit you.

404
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,930
You serious?

405
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,980
These are good stuff!

406
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,170
Of course.

407
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,620
Take them.

408
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:26,930
Thanks!

409
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,690
You look way better than me
wearing my clothes.

410
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,100
Listen to me.

411
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,780
What can help you,
is not these directors.

412
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,330
The really good stuff

413
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,650
is hidden in these charts and lines.

414
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,530
Which stock is this?

415
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,100
Don't ask, for your own good.

416
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,530
Why?

417
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,410
I'm in the trade. It's against the rule.

418
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,620
I've also checked out
Jumpcan Pharmaceutical,

419
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,740
Infun Cast and Yundian Biotech.

420
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,050
Don't buy them. None of them are good.

421
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,500
Then what should I buy?

422
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,810
293784.

423
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,380
193792.

424
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,100
Check out these two for this month.

425
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,740
That's all I can tell you.

426
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,020
293784, ST Yuanxing.

427
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,410
193792, Rongshi Real Estate.

428
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,380
Not bad!

429
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,570
I also checked out
209491, Kelson Technology.

430
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,810
ST Yuanxing just won their case
and finished assets reorganization.

431
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,690
They started to profit
in the second quarter.

432
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,980
Once they get rid of the ST,
they'll have great potential.

433
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,380
Their prices are fluctuating now,
but promising in the future.

434
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,290
Kelson... I heard that they imported
the lithography machines from Japan

435
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,330
to build their own chip production lines.

436
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,810
Their prices have plummeted
from two years ago and have hit bottom,

437
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,860
but things are looking good in the future.

438
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,500
As for Ronshi...

439
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,530
Ronshi bought over 200 lands
in the last year,

440
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,690
with a total value of almost
a hundred billion,

441
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,620
which corresponds to a product value
of almost 300 billion.

442
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,930
Their prices have been low,

443
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,170
but steady.

444
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,220
Yuanxing is for the long run.

445
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,900
Needless to say about Ronshi.

446
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,690
Securities firms are barometers.

447
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,410
Forget about Kelson.

448
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,860
An EUV lithography machine

449
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,220
costs over a hundred million dollars.

450
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,260
In comparison,

451
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:14,980
a DSA machine

452
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,050
would be a cold weapon.

453
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,620
Tell me more.

454
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,930
I'm interested.

455
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,780
No.

456
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,050
Hello, Mr. Cheng.

457
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,020
Please sign in here.

458
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,650
Hello. Please sign in here.

459
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,530
Thank you for being here

460
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,500
at the Haiteng Charity Gala

461
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,740
[Haiteng Charity Gala]
for Caring Star Children.

462
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,810
Tonight,

463
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,740
all the money we raise...

464
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,690
Why are you here?

465
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,140
It's been a while!

466
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,100
Let me introduce.

467
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:16,930
They are my friends.

468
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,260
Xuanxuan and Lily.

469
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,330
So he went to the charity auction
with your identity?

470
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,220
Right.

471
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,650
My invitation letter,

472
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,570
my clothes, my glasses.

473
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,330
So, at the end of the day,

474
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,330
he mooched off of you
for a few days at your place.

475
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,020
What's the big deal?

476
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,140
I got scammed a lot too.

477
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,020
How much?

478
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,620
Twenty million.

479
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,380
After that day,

480
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,410
he seldom came back.

481
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,330
Sometimes he told me
he was staying at his friend's.

482
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,780
And sometimes he was working late
and he had to stay in a hotel.

483
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,290
Bro,

484
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,260
take this one. It's thicker.

485
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,020
Not necessary.

486
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,220
I'm driving.

487
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,020
Bro.

488
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,140
Yuanxing and Ronshi
that you told me about the other day,

489
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,220
they both went up.

490
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,900
You bought them?

491
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,810
Let me see.

492
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,930
The market dropped two percent last week,

493
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,900
while these two

494
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,410
increased by 7.2%

495
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,930
and 6.5%.

496
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,860
Kelson went down, as expected.

497
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,780
How much did you buy?

498
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,290
Nothing.

499
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,050
Then why are you so happy?

500
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,140
Because you were right.

501
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,570
You didn't believe me?

502
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,100
You think I'd make you lose money?

503
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,500
Come on, bro.

504
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,690
Don't be mad.

505
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,570
We're different.

506
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,530
You're operating on your clients' money.

507
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,330
Ordinary stock buyers
use their spare money.

508
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,100
I just got into this line of work.

509
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,140
Haven't been established yet.

510
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,690
With not much savings,

511
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,260
I can't afford the risk.

512
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,170
If I were you,

513
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,900
being able to get such important tips

514
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,330
from a senior trader,

515
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,860
having an unsupervised account,

516
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,450
I'd go all in!

517
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:28,810
What a wuss.

518
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,050
You've got insider information

519
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,900
and money,

520
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,810
but you didn't buy either, did you?

521
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,170
Rat trading is against the law.

522
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,860
A professional trader

523
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,980
cannot manipulate stock trading, you know?

524
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:45,690
Then...

525
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,100
what if you use someone else's account?

526
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,020
You think the supervising people
are idiots?

527
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,740
They target all your relatives' accounts.

528
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,020
Friends' accounts too?

529
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,980
Once caught, you both go to jail!

530
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,100
Who'd want to take such a risk
for a friend?

531
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,570
I would.

532
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,810
Cut it out. It's no child's play.

533
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,380
I honestly would!

534
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,410
Bro.

535
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,140
This place isn't cheap.

536
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,100
Why are you buying me dinner
all of a sudden?

537
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:53,900
To thank you.

538
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,100
For what?

539
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,810
For your information.

540
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,100
You bought it?

541
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,260
How much?

542
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,330
Over 30 thousand,

543
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,410
but it's worth 70 thousand now.

544
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,650
Bro, shall I sell now?

545
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,500
Thanks.

546
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,530
Are you kidding me?

547
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,740
I'm very satisfied already.

548
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,860
It more than doubled

549
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,020
in such a short time.

550
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,020
You're putting in so little

551
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,020
and earning so little.

552
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,930
How many dinners like this can you afford?

553
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,740
Well, these things accumulate.

554
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,500
I've got time.

555
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,170
These things have a momentum.

556
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:26,980
After this while,

557
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,930
you won't know
when you'll get another chance!

558
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:30,810
Bro,

559
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,500
this is my first time buying stocks

560
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,330
on someone else's advice.

561
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:35,860
I chickened out.

I've offered you food and housing!

What do you have to be afraid of?

567
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,860
What now?

568
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,170
ST Yuanxing is around five yuan.

569
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:56,980
It's still low.

570
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,380
Keep buying in.

571
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,810
I don't have that much money.

572
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,020
I'll lend you some!

573
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,330
What if it drops?

574
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,980
Forget about dropping!

575
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,620
There's no "what if"!

576
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,650
No way!

577
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,330
How can you be a trader

578
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,220
if you're so afraid of risks?

579
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,050
If it drops,

580
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,170
it'll be on me!

581
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,620
Don't be mad, bro.

582
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,220
I am indeed a coward.

583
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,380
How about this?

584
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,260
We use my account and your money.

585
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,740
If you earn, spare me a few percent.

586
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,020
I could just learn how to trade from you.

587
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,530
Once I've learned

588
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,930
and got some savings,

589
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,450
I'll have the guts to play by myself.

590
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,530
Is that okay, bro?

591
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,980
Can you keep this a secret?

592
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,260
Eventually, you rat traded, right?

593
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,450
That's where you got careless.

594
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,500
Things like that

595
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,140
have to be taken into your own hands,
no matter what!

596
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,170
You're the one to talk.

597
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,780
He was my son-in-law.

598
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,530
By giving him money,

599
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,900
it'd be the same as my own.

600
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,410
Didn't he scam you too?

601
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,810
He just paid me back!

602
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,220
There's no telling if you'll get it back.

603
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:10,930
You think I'd buy that?

604
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,740
Stop it.

605
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,140
Only when we each tell our stories

606
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,810
will we find out what Fei Ke wants.

607
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,930
So you gave him 20 million
all at once too?

608
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,050
Not really.

609
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,170
I knew I should be cautious,

610
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,900
so I first tried with small sums.

611
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,930
Step by step,

612
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,690
I gradually trusted his reliability.

613
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,380
Was that account under his name?

614
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,140
His name.

My password.

616
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,620
To assure me,

617
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,220
we went to the bank together
and changed the password.

618
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,780
Then I wired my savings to his account.

619
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,500
Because I had first-hand information,

620
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,740

I trusted him entirely.

Every time, I'd check
the account's last login.

But the flight was canceled
at the last minute.

I didn't know how long you'd be gone,

646

So, you're not going to Beijing today?

652
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,170
Didn't I just tell you?

653
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,650
The flight's canceled.

654

It's just that your meeting
is tomorrow noon.

Then you'll have to take the first flight.

That's around seven or eight.

662
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,220
So you'll have to get up at five.

My parents.

Why are you putting
your family photo here?

671

I lied to you.

that I live in a big apartment.

And I earn half a million a year.

678
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,890

00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,090
I could bring them here.

680
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,340

681
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:52,820

After knowing you,

690
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,820

that I'm as successful as you.
