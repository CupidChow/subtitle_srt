00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,610
Wait,

5
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,370
do you remember the location?

6
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,120
Songshan Road.

00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,250
Zhang...

8
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,970
Zhanghua Road.

9
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,440
What's the name of that community?

10
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,970
It's...

11
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,240
Something Haoting.

12
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,170
Yujin Haoting.

13
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:08,960
Right.

14
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,650
Right...

15
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,600
That's the place!

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,570
Room 701, Building Six.

17
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
How do you know?

18
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,960
That's not his home.

19
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,960
That's mine.

20
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,170
Your home?

21
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,650
You mean, Fei Ke brought
people to your place

22
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,760
and made it look like his?

23
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:43,960
Yeah.

24
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,880
Did you know that?

25
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,400
Not until today.

26
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,680
Let Mr. Chen finish first.

27
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,120
Mr. Chen.

28
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,730
Jiajia.

29
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,730
Come in, please.

30
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,400
It's... It's south-facing, right?

31
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,400
Right.

32
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,040
What's the size of this place?

33
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,240
177 square meters,

34
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,400
with a usable area of 140.

35
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,600
The houses in this area go
for like 70 to 80 grand per sqm, right?

36
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,880
I bought it early.
It was just over 50 thousand.

37
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,120
I don't do property flipping

38
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,320
and I wasn't too sensitive
to the prices.

39
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,040
Did you pay with cash or a loan?

40
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,120
Dad!

41
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,570
My parents paid the down payment.

42
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,570
And I'm paying off the mortgage.

43
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,810
How much a month?

44
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,600
I bought at a low rate,

45
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,730
less than four percent.

46
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,810
The entire loan was 3.8 million,

47
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,210
and the monthly repayment
is a little over 20 thousand.

48
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,290
So... 30 years?

49
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,120
Twenty.

50
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,930
I was outside the country

51
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,320
and I bought it under my dad's name.

52
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,210
He's almost 50.

53
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,400
The term is at most 20 years.

54
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:02,570
Mr. Chen.

55
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,960
Do you prefer tea or coffee?

56
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:05,680
Tea.

57
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:06,730
Okay.

58
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,370
Mr. Chen.

59
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,600
This is good tea.

60
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,090
Golden and clear.

61
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,480
The leaves are neat and thick.

62
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,650
The taste is clean

63
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,930
and rich.

64
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,160
It's good tea.

65
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,250
Mr. Chen, you know the deal.

66
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,530
This tea has got
to be five or six years, isn't it?

67
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,650
It's a national gift.

68
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,000
Not for sale.

Traditionally made.

71
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,090
No stir-frying, no rubbing.

72
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,090
It soothes the lungs.

73
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,930
I think you're the expert here!

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,880
I overheard some seniors talking

75
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,760
and I remembered it.

76
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,130
Sorry for showing off.

77
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,210
I'll check out the place a little more.

78
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:18,930
I'll show you.

79
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,160
Fei Ke...

80
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:20,930
Listen!

81
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,440
Whose apartment is this?

82
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,690
Mine.

83
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,000
Cut it out!

84
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,280
It's true!

85
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,850
You can't be serious.

86
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,250
Check it out.

87
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,970
This is my bedroom.

88
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,130
Here's the closet.

89
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,560
There's an open kitchen.

90
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,130
This is the study.

91
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,370
Best lighting in the place.

92
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,410
I'll have a smoke, okay?

93
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,410
Okay, go ahead.

94
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,130
Is that okay?

95
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,040
Sure.

96
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,280
I'll go get you an ashtray.

97
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,280
Here.

98
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,480
Make yourself at home. I'll go cook.

99
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,440
Okay, go ahead.

100
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,000
Okay.

101
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,250
Here, see if you like my cooking.

102
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,690
Okay...

103
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,600
Here.

104
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,000
To our first meeting
and your achievement.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,650
Cheers.

106
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,970
It's a nice apartment.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,210
Why don't you live here?

108
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,040
It's too far from my office.

109
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,090
I thought you had a car?

110
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,650
It wasn't mine, actually.

111
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,810
It belongs to my mom.

112
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,040
Strictly speaking,

113
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,090
I own nothing.

114
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,480
Well, what's your parents'
is eventually yours.

115
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,650
Not the same.

116
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,090
When I bought this place,

117
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,440
my dad was working in Chengjiang.

118
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,970
When the apartment was delivered,

119
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,280
he got transferred to Beijing.

120
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,090
I'm now technically
managing their property.

121
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,880
And you kept me in the dark, too.

122
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,090
If I hadn't done that,

123
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,560
you wouldn't be living
with your dad, would you?

124
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,760
Well, I've actually
been longing to kick her out!

125
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,210
Start a family, will you?

126
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,440
By the way...

127
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,690
What do your parents do?

128
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,160
They're just ordinary public servants.

129
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,600
In which department?

130
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,690
Dad, would you stop interrogating?

131
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,090
Stay out of it.

132
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,090
Mr. Chen.

133
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,480
You're no stranger here,

134
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,850
but

135
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,970
I'd have to ask you to keep it a secret.

136
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm no big mouth, okay?

137
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,480
Management Department,
Ministry of Lands and Mines.

138
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,970
Let me see. Management Department?

139
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,690
First name... Fei?

140
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,480
I took after my mom.

141
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,280
And your dad's first name?

142
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,160
Li.

143
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,160
What does your mom do?

144
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,560
She's a college teacher.

145
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,370
Not a 985 university, just a 211.

146
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,410
She's a professor.

147
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,600
All she does is read papers.

148
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,650
Kind of boring.

149
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,090
Good.

150
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,280
An intellectual.

151
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,440
She's got the insight.

152
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,280
Wait.

153
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,810
She's a college teacher

154
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,720
and she drives...

155
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,320
a Panamera?

156
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:24,760
Well, that,

157
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,560
that was a used test-drive car
from my uncle's shop.

158
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,160
I don't drive it often, either.

159
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,970
Jiajia knows that.

160
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,360
Plus, the parking space
in my office building

161
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,210
costs 60 yuan an hour!

162
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,050
I figured I might as well live closer,

163
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,170
so I'd save some money.

164
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,530
Yeah...

165
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,050
So, um...

166
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,730
Where... Where's the place you rented?

167
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,000
It's a staff dormitory
of Chengjiang University.

168
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,610
It's an old building,

169
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,880
but I like the environment.

170
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,680
I could just walk to their library.

171
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,410
I think that's the top living environment
you can buy!

172
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,440
Well said!

173
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,730
Be efficient
while keeping a low profile!

174
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,210
Come on!

175
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:02,760
Mr. Chen.

176
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,730
- Mr. Chen.
- No need!

177
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,320
Come on, take it.

178
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,000
No need. He's got a lot already.

179
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,240
Take it. I don't drink tea myself.

180
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,120
If they send me more,

181
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,090
I'll have Jiajia bring it to you.

182
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,730
But... That's too polite of you.

183
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,410
It's...

184
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,170
No need!

185
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,610
Snob.

186
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,730
I'm just concerned.

187
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,610
I want you to have a nice life.

188
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,210
But this guy
is quite something indeed.

189
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,650
And he's solid, isn't he?

190
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,680
Well, it's fate.

191
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,000
I guess you have met your fate.

192
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,560
So, you've agreed to our marriage?

193
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,490
No.

194
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,680
Even though I've agreed,

195
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,730
as a girl,

196
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,320
you need composure.

197
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:51,560
Dad!

198
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,440
What more do you have to worry about?

199
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,320
Well, he's said a lot,

200
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,000
but we need to see it to believe it.

201
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,360
At least...

202
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,650
I need to see his parents, right?

203
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,150
[Ministry of Lands and Mines]

204
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:15,760
Mr. Chen,

205
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,210
I checked.

206
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,880
There is a Deputy Director General
surnamed Li.

207
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,920
Born in 1960.

208
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,850
I found some photos for you.

209
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,490
Got it.

210
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,560
So,

211
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,290
the two of them should be a good match?

212
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,560
More like they worked in cahoots to me.

213
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,120
Mr. Chen, have you seen his parents?

214
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,320
In a month,

215
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,530
I met his family.

216
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,800
His father meant to come,

217
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
but

218
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,050
got stuck in Beijing

219
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,440
for some important conference.

220
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,290
I had dinner with his mother.

221
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,920
It was at my own club.

222
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,120
We had a great time chatting that day.

223
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,000
Please, sit here.

224
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,000
Nice to meet you!

225
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,290
His mother is a gentle person.

226
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,800
Good-mannered and knowledgeable.

227
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,970
Mr. Chen, we're family now.

228
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,050
Go easy on the drink.

229
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,290
Mr. Chen, still?

230
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,610
Call me Fa.

231
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,530
Fa is fine.

232
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,850
Once I saw this future in-law,

233
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,360
I knew that my girl would be
in good hands.

234
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,800
Give us a grandson soon.

235
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,970
Well, that depends on Jiajia.

236
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,530
Me and my husband wouldn't demand that.

237
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,360
A son is a must.

238
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,170
A son can do big things!

239
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,730
Either is okay.

240
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,800
You see, don't you have
a great daughter here?

241
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,050
Aren't you proud?

242
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,050
Come on, your son is great too.

243
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,000
Yeah.

244
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:43,610
Fei Ke.

245
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,970
Do bring words to your dad, okay?

246
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,290
I understand
that it's inconvenient for him

247
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,920
to meet us merchants right now.

248
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,530
Some day,

249
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,610
I'll definitely invite him to dinner.

250
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,120
It's a touchy moment.

251
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,120
And my dad is indeed at a conference.

252
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,210
He couldn't come.

253
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,680
That's more important...

254
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,000
I heard that they're correcting
rented accounts,

255
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,050
is that true?

256
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,120
Well, I don't know the specifics,

257
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,000
but rented accounts

258
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,490
do have...

259
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,090
security issues

260
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,170
and mining qualification issues,

261
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,650
which the leaders are focusing on.

262
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,610
I also heard

263
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,920
that they're retracting
all mining licenses

264
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,610
to re-examine before distributing them?

265
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,850
I don't know.

266
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,610
But...

267
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,730
there are over a thousand
rented account companies in the country.

268
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,760
A thorough check

269
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,850
would take time, right?

270
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,360
Fei Ke,

271
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,210
how old is your dad?

272
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,440
Fifty-five.

273
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,650
Born in 1960.

274
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,210
1960?

275
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,210
What's his Zodiac?

276
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,680
Pig.

277
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,050
Wait.

278
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,760
Isn't 1960...

279
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,680
Rat?

280
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,530
My dad was born on December 17
by the lunar calendar

281
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,880
and January 15 by the solar calendar.

282
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:09,850
Yes...

283
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,680
So, he takes on the Year 1959,
the Pig Year.

284
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,800
Born in the 60s.

285
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,490
That's a good age.

286
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,680
He's got potential.

287
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,000
You know what?

288
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,290
Son,

289
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,410
we're here celebrating you and Jiajia.

290
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,850
Let's not talk about work, okay?

291
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,440
Yeah! Enough about work.

292
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,410
Yeah.

293
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,410
Let's eat before it gets cold!

294
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,360
Mr. Chen.

295
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,560
Cheers.

296
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,410
Why are you still
calling him "Mr. Chen"?

297
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,650
Dad!

298
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:36,730
Mom.

299
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,360
Mom, what's up?

300
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,680
The Inspection Group
just entered your dad's department.

301
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,610
That's big!

302
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,610
He's probably going
to be busy for a while, isn't he?

303
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,680
It's okay, Mom.

304
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
It's a critical time.

305
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,170
It's normal to be busy.

306
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,610
Too bad, my dad

307
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,120
wouldn't be able
to leave Beijing for a while.

308
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,560
Yeah.

309
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,490
He's gotta follow orders, right?

310
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,120
It's okay!

311
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,120
We're family now.

312
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,560
There will be another chance!

313
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,000
The kids getting married is important.

314
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,210
Li wants to talk to you over the phone

315
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,050
to apologize.

316
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,650
Come on!

317
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,850
No need...

318
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,090
Let me call him.

319
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,000
Dad.

320
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,610
No need!

321
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:34,800
Hello.

322
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:35,880
Hi, in-law.

323
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's me, Fa.

324
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,170
"Mr. Chen"? Come on.

325
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,090
I'm younger than you. Just call me Fa.

326
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,090
Yes, I understand.

327
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,440
Your job is important.

328
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,760
You need to serve the public.

329
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,120
You have my daughter's hands now.

330
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,730
Don't worry, Dad.

331
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,970
Dad...

332
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,210
I'll drink this up first!

333
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,050
Hold... Hold it!

334
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,120
Listen to me!

335
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,050
Listen...

336
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,290
My brother!

337
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,850
Right.

338
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:01,920
Real brother.

339
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:03,970
Okay...

340
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,920
Enjoy!

341
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,560
Order anything you want!

342
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,000
Okay.

343
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,680
I've got money!

344
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,760
Dad! Take it easy!

345
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,760
Bye...

346
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,530
Easy...

347
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,490
Go back...

348
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,970
Stay there...

349
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,120
Stay!

350
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,410
You're drunk!

351
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,530
Take this.

352
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,850
You're my son-in-law.

353
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,760
You don't need to wait in the lobby.

354
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,050
I thought we agreed

355
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,920
on no bridal gifts
or anything like that.

356
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,210
You think that's for you?

357
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,610
You wish!

358
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,970
Ten million here!

359
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,530
You're an investment manager,
aren't you?

360
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,800
On the one hand,

361
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,680
this is me supporting your career.

362
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,880
And on the other hand,

363
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,610
you'd be revitalizing
my spare cash, right?

364
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,210
Anything you earn

365
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,530
belongs to you and Jiajia.

366
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,050
Okay.

367
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:54,560
If you lose...

368
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:55,210
Sure.

369
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:55,800
It'd be on me!

370
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,410
Okay...

371
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,410
Lately,

372
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,920
there have been
a few promising projects.

373
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,680
I'll go to your place

374
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,010
to introduce them to you later.

375
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:04,490
Come on!

376
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,010
I know nothing apart from mining.

377
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,800
Just invest in whatever you like.

378
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,640
Okay...

379
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,550
I'm not investing in companies here.

380
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,830
I'm investing in you.

381
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,800
Hello. Welcome
to Tianyuan Mansion.

382
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,070
This is our Building Two at sale.

383
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,070
Please take a look at the brochure.

384
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,070
I thought you had an apartment already.

385
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,040
Why are you checking out apartments?

386
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,920
I'm planning on selling Yujin for this.

387
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,710
That's not necessary.

388
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,710
My dad has several apartments.

389
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,880
Yeah.

390
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,670
You and Jiajia can just pick one.

391
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,760
That's different.

392
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,040
That's your apartment.

393
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,830
Not what I give her.

394
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,400
What do you mean?

395
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,040
Yujin Haoting is under my dad's name.

396
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,350
It's not exactly our property.

397
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,190
Besides, I don't like its location.

398
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,470
I've thought it all through.

399
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,710
This apartment

400
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,430
will be under Jiajia

401
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,070
as my wedding gift.

402
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,640
Hello.

403
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,760
Let's confirm.

404
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,590
There are 20 floors in Building Two,

405
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,830
and you booked the lucky apartment
of 1909 on the 19th floor,

406
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,400
under the name... Ms. Chen Jiajia.

407
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,240
Please confirm and sign.

408
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,950
Nine for eternity.

409
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,070
[Party A: Chen Jiajia]
How do I pay the deposit?

410
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,120
Follow me later on.

411
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,800
Okay.

412
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,520
Thanks.

413
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,710
Okay, excuse me.

414
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,430
Wait.

415
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,830
What about that apartment of yours?

416
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,280
Well, for this apartment
I'm buying for Jiajia,

417
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,640
I don't want to buy it with loans,

418
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,920
so I'm planning on selling Yujin first.

419
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,920
Sell it?

420
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,760
Then...

421
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,590
where will you guys live?

422
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,830
Don't worry. I've planned everything.

423
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,240
I'll have to let Jiajia

424
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,040
live with me in a rented house
before the new place is ready.

425
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,000
I told you.

426
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,190
Dad has plenty of apartments.

427
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,190
We could just pick one.

428
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,040
Dad.

429
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,400
Pick one.

430
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,160
Well,

431
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,190
why don't you two move to my villa?

432
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,350
Dad, no need...

433
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
That's settled.

434
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,640
Since he moved into my villa,

435
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,880
Fei Ke did make
a change in our lives.

436
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,400
He cooked now and then.

437
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,160
And he played golf with me at weekends.

438
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,880
Back then, I always thought

439
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,670
that my girl was lucky

440
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,280
to have found a perfect husband.

441
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,000
- I won again!
- Won again?

442
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,350
I didn't do it on purpose!

443
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,670
That's the tile I need, too.

444
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,670
Dad.

445
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,000
Their boss went on
a business trip today.

446
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,950
He asked me to say hi to you.

447
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,400
That's too polite.

448
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,190
I'm expecting them
to profit for me.

449
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,310
Wylon Medical.

450
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,590
Based in Ottawa.

451
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,280
Their Asian office
is located in Chengjiang.

452
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,670
The company has over
a hundred employees.

453
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,160
This is the cancer screening equipment

454
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,830
from Canada that I told you about.

455
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,550
In our country,

456
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,040
Wylon is the only company
with this technology.

457
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,950
All you need is to stick
a needle into the marrow

458
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,000
and take out some tissues.

459
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,310
And you'll be able to predict
your likelihood of future cancer.

460
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,830
Combined with genetic technology,

461
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,670
they can provide
accurate preventative measures.

462
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,400
[Wylon Medical Instrument Co. Ltd.]
Isn't there a Chinese version

463
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,240
for this project proposal?

464
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,190
Yes.

465
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,190
I'll have it translated.

466
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,350
You're having a meeting?

467
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,520
Can I help you?

468
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,190
I'm Susan's friend.

469
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,430
She's on a business trip.

470
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,880
She told me about it,

471
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,120
and she's got arrangements already.

472
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,710
This is Mr. Chen from Nanlin Mining.

473
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,520
He's interested in Wylon.

474
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,880
I'm

475
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,000
showing him around.

476
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,280
Okay. I'll leave you be.

477
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,950
How much does this charge?

478
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,710
Free.

479
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,240
How do they profit, then?

480
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,160
They're not selling services,

481
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,190
but consumables.

482
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,520
Guess how much this one needle costs?

483
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,240
Two yuan?

484
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,920
Nine jiao.

485
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,590
And it's sold at ten yuan.

486
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,670
But it's still nothing,
even if everyone on earth gets a shot!

487
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,070
What if I told you

488
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,160
that it can also predict other diseases?

489
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,000
What if in the future,

490
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,000
it can be incorporated
into the physical examination program?

491
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,760
In the fourth-quarter
release conference,

492
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:34,710
including public and private hospitals,

493
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,280
they're launching
8,000 offline test sites

494
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,280
and expected to go public
in three years.

495
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,120
So how much can we invest?

496
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,280
I'd suggest six or seven million.

497
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,880
That's too little.

498
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,160
Dad.

499
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,800
Right now, Wylon's shares
are popular out there.

500
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,590
With my current position,
that's the best I can get.

501
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,590
Besides,

502
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,310
you shouldn't put all your eggs
in one basket, right?

503
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,160
I've got some other
incubating internet projects

504
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,830
that are also good,

505
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,310
which you can consider.

506
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,120
They're cheap.

507
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,830
When was that?

508
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,190
2016... January.

509
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,640
Did you profit?

510
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,590
Profit? Huh.

511
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,070
So that medical company

512
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,590
was bogus?

513
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,000
On the contrary!

514
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,760
I only found out later

515
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,590
that this company
has been listed long ago!

516
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,240
They don't need investment at all!

517
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:43,760
Wait.

518
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,520
Where's that company located?

519
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,520
Which floor?

520
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,520
Pearl Plaza.

521
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,520
Thirty-eighth floor.

522
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,590
Wylon Medical.

523
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,120
Owned by Zhao Xiaoyang.

524
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,280
Who's Zhao Xiaoyang?

525
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,070
Wylon Asia's No.1.

526
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,800
Our magazine interviewed him once.

527
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,430
The biggest tragedy is,

528
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,240
as an old man, I can't read English.

529
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,070
And I had to believe whatever he said.

530
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,310
But why did he have to scam you?

531
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,760
He's your son-in-law, after all.

532
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,070
Compared to what happened later,

533
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,640
that was just chicken feed.

534
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,280
Dad.

535
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,550
You guys can go now.

536
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,120
What happened, Dad?

537
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,240
There's an official order.

538
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,520
They wanna tighten up
on illegitimate private mines.

539
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,760
You mentioned that before.

540
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,920
Rented accounts, right?

541
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,520
My mining certificate

542
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,800
was rented over a decade ago

543
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,880
while the policy was lenient.

544
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,240
But now they want to tighten up.

545
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,880
They want a thorough check!

546
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,800
Why don't you complete the formalities?

547
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,240
They stopped issuing certificates
long ago!

548
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,800
Three years ago,

549
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,310
someone wanted to buy my mine,

550
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,430
offering 700 million.

551
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,520
I wasn't happy with the price
and I refused.

552
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,400
Now, I can't even sell it

553
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,470
at 70 million!

554
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,310
Without a buyer,

555
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,040
or a certificate,

556
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,550
I'd own nothing more than a dozen...

557
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,920
of rock pits!

558
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,920
Take it easy.

559
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,470
Let me think of something.

560
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,760
Well...

561
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,190
Can you maybe ask your dad

562
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,040
if there's anything we can do?

563
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,430
First, these things take time.

564
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,190
Plus, this is not my dad's
scope of work.

565
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,280
Just policy information would help!

566
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,880
I'm okay to pay, you know?

567
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,190
He won't take any money.

568
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,070
Besides, this is our own business.

569
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,240
It'd be complicated.

570
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,880
You're right.

571
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,190
I've...

572
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,040
I've lost my mind now.

573
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,000
Let me think.

574
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,280
It won't be airtight.

575
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,190
There's gotta be a way.

576
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,070
Dad, take a look.

577
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,190
No need.

578
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,310
Just tell me.

579
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,590
There are lots of listed companies

580
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,350
seeking to buy private mines.

581
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,310
If we manage to get this Zhifeng Group
to do their evaluation

582
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,470
on our mine before it's determined,

583
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,550
and finish the buyout,

584
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,070
we can avoid
a significant amount of losses.

585
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,800
Good...

586
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,710
Do you know anyone from them?

587
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,550
No.

588
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,430
I bet your dad does.

589
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,590
I heard that Yu Zhifeng

590
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,550
was from the Ministry of Mining.

591
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,880
I can't guarantee a sure success,

592
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,760
but I guess I can manage to jump in.

593
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,670
The top priority here is time.

594
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,550
I wish

595
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,640
we can meet this Mr. Yu sometime.

596
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,000
Meet?

597
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,120
No, we shouldn't.

598
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,830
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

599
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,240
I'll be your middleman. Rest assured.

600
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,590
No problem.

601
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,120
I trust you.

602
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,760
Son,

603
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,160
our entire family

604
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,640
relies on you now.

605
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,470
Hello, Mr. Chen?

606
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,590
Who... Who is this?

607
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,520
This is Yu Zhifeng from Zhifeng Group.

608
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,880
Nice to hear from you!

609
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,800
Fei Ke told me about your mine.

610
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,310
We've done some internal evaluation
and we think we can proceed.

611
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,830
The problem is,
there are other companies like yours.

612
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,880
Lately, with the tightening policies,

613
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,000
lots of companies
have been contacting us.

614
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,670
Honestly,

615
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,590
Nanlin's rating is not high enough.

616
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,280
Yes, I understand.

617
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,120
Had you approached us,

618
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,640
we'd have offered a low price.

619
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,880
But Director General Li
was my superior before,

620
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,070
I'd owe him the favor.

621
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,950
You... You don't say!

622
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,950
Director General Li
and I... are in-laws!

623
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,240
In-laws!

624
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,710
220 million.

625
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,950
That's our best offer.

626
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,190
But, um...

627
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,920
Can't... Can't you do more?

628
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,550
Ask for 260.

629
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,240
He won't offer too much.

630
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,950
We're in a special condition.

631
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,310
Well...

632
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,000
How about 260?

633
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,950
That's a lucky number.

634
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,240
Deal!

635
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,430
Why use a talkie?

636
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,000
There wouldn't be records.

637
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,520
So,

638
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,830
what's caught on camera

639
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,310
wouldn't be able to prove
that you'd met Yu Zhifeng.

640
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,430
The room blocks cellphone signals.

641
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,800
By doing so, you'd be clean
from illegal mining or rented accounts.

642
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,470
Fei Ke was meticulous

643
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,640
and arranged things properly,

644
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,590
which is why I fell for his trick.

645
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,310
260 million is not a low price.

646
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,070
Shouldn't that solve the problem?

647
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,670
If it could be solved that easily,

648
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,040
I wouldn't be here today.

649
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,920
What? How could he do that?

650
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,590
I thought we had a deal!

651
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,280
Right when I thought I was saved,

652
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,520
Fei Ke told me
that Yu Zhifeng backed out.

653
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,880
He wanted 200 million.

654
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,670
In the end, Fei Ke said

655
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,400
that if I insisted on 260 million,

656
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,950
I'd have to pay Mr. Yu a 10% commission.

657
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,950
[Chen Shufa]

658
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,400
Commission?

659
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,950
Can an owner from a listed company

660
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,160
do that?

661
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,240
That's not right.

662
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,280
Even if he wanted the money,

663
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,880
he wouldn't dare do it.

664
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,400
A deal that big...

665
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,350
went a bit too easily, don't you think?

666
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,160
You wired all the money
to Fei Ke, didn't you?

667
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,470
Mr. Chen saw him as family

668
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,640
and trusted him entirely.

669
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,710
Under the emergency,

670
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,400
Fei Ke was his last resort.

671
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,670
Right.

672
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,590
He brain-washed me

673
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,160
into not daring to contact Yu Zhifeng

674
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,430
in case the deal went south.

675
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,640
He acted as the middleman.

676
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,920
And the fees

677
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,950
were wired to the account he designated.

678
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,400
Every time I asked him how things went,

679
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,830
he'd answer me the same thing.

680
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,310
Not yet, Dad.

681
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,040
Almost.

682
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,520
Maybe some more work
on the deputy general manager.

683
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,350
Not a lot.

684
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,640
Just wire it to me.

685
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,430
What?

686
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,920
Altogether, he took

687
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,520
over 40 million from me.

688
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,920
And then he disappeared.

689
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,240
Disappeared?

690
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,590
Gone! Out of thin air!

691
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,950
All of a sudden!

692
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,800
I thought something happened to him

693
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,920
and I looked for him for a few days,

694
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,430
before I realized

695
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,190
that he

696
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,000
had run away with my money.

697
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,550
He was a fraud!

698
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,830
I thought you'd met Yu Zhifeng.

699
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,830
I have.

700
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,160
Through a window glass.

701
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,400
It was blurry.

702
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,190
And when did you realize

703
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,310
that Fei Ke was a fraud?

704
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,430
Open the door!

705
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,400
Hello, sir. What can we help?

706
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,470
Sorry, but who are you looking for?

707
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,070
Mr. Fei!

708
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,800
Fei Ke!

709
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,400
I'm sorry, sir,

710
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,590
but we don't have a Mr. Fei here.

711
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,950
The subscriber you dialed
is not answered now.

712
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,830
Fei Ke, where are you?

713
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,590
Pick up the phone, okay?

714
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,400
I'm Mr. Chen!

715
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,400
I'm one of your shareholders, remember?

716
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,120
Mr. Chen?

717
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,710
Hold on, please!

718
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,430
I've invested money here!

719
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,470
- I... I'm looking for Fei Ke.
- You can't go in!

720
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,670
I'm a shareholder!

721
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,120
Sir, I'm afraid
we'll have to call security.

722
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:52,880
We're calling security!

723
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,950
Fei Ke, if anything happens, talk to me.

724
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,350
Don't do this to me, please!

725
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,520
Fei Ke!

726
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,240
Fei Ke...

727
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,640
It's simple. Once I enter,

728
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,710
I'll go to the window.

729
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,400
When I give you the wave,

730
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,280
you can start your lines
with the walkie-talkie.

731
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,350
Have you memorized your lines?

732
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,310
Can you handle this?

733
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,950
Rest assured, bro.

734
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,040
So, today,

735
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,040
I'm recommending to you

736
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,800
this Da'an medical-grade
sphygmomanometer

737
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,590
with less
than three millimeters of error

738
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,590
and comprehensive features,

739
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,550
perfect for people above middle age.

740
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,830
An all-round strengthened arm belt.

741
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,670
High-definition LED all-screen display.

742
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,470
All the data are clearly displayed.

743
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,710
1.5 thousand mA lithium-ion battery.

744
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,190
Six hundred times of recharges.

745
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,070
Enhanced with voice command.

746
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,670
Jiajia?

747
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,190
Jiajia, what's wrong?

748
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:09,800
Jiajia!

749
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:11,870
Answer me, Jiajia!

750
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,520
Jiajia!

751
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:17,950
Where are you going?

752
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,800
I wanna go look for Fei Ke!

753
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,280
Jiajia, calm down!

754
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,840
Wherever he is,

755
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,950
I will find him.

756
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,150
Don't be impulsive. You hear me?

757
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,710
Be good.

758
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,710
Be good. Wait for me at home.

759
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,760
Actually, government officials' profiles

760
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,110
are easily verified.

761
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,080
Their information is semi-public.

762
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,560
We businessmen

763
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,080
are terrified of the officials.

764
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,840
We get scared when we see them,

765
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,520
which makes us vulnerable.

766
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,800
I only found out later

767
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,320
that this guy is audacious!

768
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,240
Sir...

769
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,800
Please! Please help me!

770
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,560
You're looking
for Deputy Director General Li, right?

771
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,470
You can talk to me. I'm his subordinate.

772
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,110
Hello, sir...

773
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:13,800
Take... Take it easy.

774
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,080
Take your time.

775
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,470
You know, Mr. Li and I,

776
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,040
we're relatives.

777
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,190
His son is my son-in-law.

778
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,080
Your son-in-law?

779
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,430
Yes!

780
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,470
We...

781
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,280
We're family!

782
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,520
I'm telling the truth. Look!

783
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,670
It's a wedding photo
of his son and my daughter.

784
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,870
This is my daughter. See?

785
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,190
This is his son.

786
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,710
You... must be mistaken.

787
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,520
Well... What exactly do you want?

788
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,520
Why don't you just tell me?

789
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,240
I can't.

790
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,150
I need to see him in person!

791
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,360
I need to tell him.

792
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,390
If you can't tell me,

793
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,600
I won't be able to help you.

794
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,280
Sir...

795
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,190
Don't go!

796
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:52,950
Sir...

797
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,360
- You don't have to call me sir.
- Fine, I'll tell you.

798
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:54,760
Go ahead.

799
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,710
His son told me that he could
help with the acquisition.

800
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,320
To buy my mining company.

801
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,870
The buyer is Mr. Li's
former subordinate, Yu Zhifeng.

802
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:01,800
You know him, right?

803
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,950
He's the buyer.

804
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,040
Well, this is obviously a scam.

805
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,240
There's no such thing.

806
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,080
Besides, what you just mentioned,

807
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,150
acquisition and everything,

808
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,320
they don't exist.

809
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:11,760
And you know, the biggest problem is,

810
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,870
this son-in-law of yours

811
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
must be a mistake.

812
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,040
Mr. Li doesn't even have a son.

813
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,870
That I can tell you for sure.

814
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,430
But...

815
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,320
Okay, no need for anything else.

816
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,600
Don't believe in rumors

817
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,150
and don't spread them either.

818
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,110
All these things about business

819
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,430
and all the related policies

820
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,520
are in fact public.

821
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,000
All you need to do

822
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,950
is check the official website.

823
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,240
I've got a meeting.

824
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:30,710
Here.

825
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,760
It's the card for our office.

826
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,190
You can call us if you have a question.

827
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,760
Any more problems, tell him,

828
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,630
and they'll try to help you, okay?

829
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,600
Now, will you excuse me?

830
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,390
I'd suggest you call the police.

831
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,760
Jiajia, I'm home.

832
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,190
Jiajia?

833
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,470
Jiajia, I'm home.

834
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,040
Where are you?

835
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,080
