just say it.

Zetian's second mock exam result
came out.

196
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,190
It just passed 410,

197
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,750
not even enough
for a second-tier college.

198
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,510

199
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,510
Why is he so far behind you?

200
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,750
You have to ask yourselves.
