are all elite of the elite.

191
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,870
Be them on campus,

192
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,630
or in society later,

193
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,190
this social group

194
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,870
is way more valuable than any other club.

195
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,140
What's "elite of the elite"?

196
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,540
We only accept one kind
of people to our club.

197
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,390
It's talented people like you.

198
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,100
These three questions

199
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,310
are tough,

200
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,950
even for a graduate student
of mathematics.

201
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,220
Your IQ surpasses your peers so much.

202
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,540
The Finance Club is full of talents.

203
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,830
Xu Ou here, his father

204
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,460
was once president
of the Students' Union.

205
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,460
Uncle Wang is now the director.

206
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,340
Just an ordinary public servant.

207
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,220
President of the Students' Union?
Director Wang?

208
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,020
For discretion,

209
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,990
I took my mom's first name.

210
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,270
Congratulations on joining us!

211
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,580
Welcome.

212
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,830
Fei Ke.

213
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,340
Yes!

214
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,070
Welcome aboard.

215
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:39,750
Yes!

216
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,220
Oh, Fei Ke,

217
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,630
have you borrowed books before?

218
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,020
Not yet.

219
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:47,990
Great.

220
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,780
Everyone's limit is 12 books.

221
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,900
We've all maxed out.

222
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,020
Next week,

223
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,580
the forum is discussing option valuation.

224
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,630
Turned out the library

225
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,190
received some research reports
from abroad

226
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,270
studying weakened
assumed condition problem

227
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,700
which is the basis
of the Black-Scholes Model.

228
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,700
It's extensive in all aspects.

229
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,630
It's the original untranslated version.

230
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,020
Borrow it for us
so we can have a peek.

231
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,220
Okay.

232
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,390
Sir.

233
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,100
You still owe me twelve books.

234
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,390
Return them before
you borrow anything else.

235
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,990
I'm not borrowing. He is.

236
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,430
What do you want?

237
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,270
The Black-Scholes Model.

238
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,220
Reading Room No.4.

239
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,390
On the shelf of Foreign Academic Books.

240
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,780
More familiar than me.

241
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,140
Got it.

242
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,750
I'll get your ticket.

243
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,780
Student Card.

244
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,950
Student Card?

245
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,220
You need to check that?

246
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,630
Of course.

247
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,340
Borrowing books requires a student card.
He needs to record it.

248
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,870
Can I bring it tomorrow?

249
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,950
I forgot today.

250
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,300
Today is Friday.

251
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,660
We don't work tomorrow.

252
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,610
Maybe you could come on Monday.

253
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,460
No.

254
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,610
Our forum starts on Monday.
There's not enough time!

255
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,570
Can we just put down a student code?

256
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,420
What's your student code?

257
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,170
I forgot.

258
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,860
Student code is not enough.

259
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,900
It's the rule.

260
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,220
Where did you put your student card?

261
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,050
In the dorm.

262
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,660
Can you go get it?

263
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,250
Okay.

264
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:24,660
I'll go with you.

265
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,860
No need. I'll go alone.

266
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,420
Wait here.

267
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,100
Kid!

268
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,250
I get off at five.

269
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,810
It's 4:40 already.

270
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:31,930
Make it quick!

271
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:32,730
Okay.

272
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,570
Move!

273
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,020
Hey! Hold still!

274
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,540
Don't push!

275
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,130
- Sorry!
- Hold still!

276
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,450
- Watch it!
- Sorry!

277
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,210
What's wrong with you?

278
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:09,730
Sorry!

279
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,700
Qiao!

280
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,540
Qiao? Where's Qiao?

281
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,540
Over there.

282
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:24,490
Qiao!

283
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,610
I need help!

284
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,450
What?

285
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,060
Get me a student card
of Chengjiang University.

286
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,330
How much?

287
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,210
Fifty. Two days.

288
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,130
I need it now! Please!

289
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,490
I'm busy.

290
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,210
Come on!

291
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,820
Hey! What are you doing!

292
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,780
Sit down!

293
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,370
I'll give you 500!

294
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,020
I need it now! Please!

295
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,820
Please!

296
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:58,730
Let's go.

297
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,820
Where did you go?

298
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,030
It's been an hour.

299
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:12,820
The library's closed.

300
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,460
Sorry! I couldn't find it.

301
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,460
Come on.

302
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,300
I'm terribly sorry.

303
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,700
Fei Ke.

304
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,790
Mathematics School, Class 06.

305
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,420
06205113.

306
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,630
Get busy this weekend.

307
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:38,790
Thanks!

308
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,220
I'm a student in the Mathematics School
of Chengjiang University.

309
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,700
I want to rent your apartment.

310
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,700
Here.

311
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,060
Here.

312
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:51,870
Thank you.

313
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:52,670
Get in.

314
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,700
Why are you here?

315
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,300
Point card, IC card, recharge card.

316
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,580
"Fantasy Westward Journey",
"Warcraft", "Audition Online".

317
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,670
Be my campus agent.

318
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,870
I think I'd focus on my study.

319
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,220
I don't get you sometimes.

320
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,060
Why do you love studying so much?

321
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,270
It's my dream to study in college.

322
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,790
Since I couldn't get admitted,
I sneaked in.

323
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,670
That's dedicated of you.

324
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,990
I don't even know
if I can live another day.

325
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:48,670
It's okay.

326
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,700
You've got good business.

327
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,100
But the worst of luck.

328
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,420
What happened?

329
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,870
Bad luck playing poker lately.
I lost a lot.

330
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,390
Lend me two thousand.

331
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,030
Two thousand?

332
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,180
I don't have that much money.

333
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,060
You rented an apartment, didn't you?

334
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,750
You call that "no money"?

335
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,630
It's a dorm room.

336
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,270
So I can steal classes easily.

337
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,270
So you know you're "stealing"?

338
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,340
Do you want me
to remind security about it?

339
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,870
Or the teachers?

340
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,300
Quit dilly-dallying.

341
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,550
Cough up the money.

342
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:47,940
When?

343
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,100
ASAP!

344
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:31,940
Okay.

345
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:32,910
The lid.

346
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,550
Come on!

347
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,060
Come on, cheers!

348
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:37,990
Thanks.

349
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:39,940
Come on!

350
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,940
Wait!

351
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,910
Tonight,

352
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,870
we're celebrating two things.

353
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,670
First, congratulations on Xu Ou

354
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,750
for becoming the fifth president

355
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,630
of our Finance Club!

356
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,030
Second,

357
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,580
we warmly welcome our new member,

358
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,030
Fei Ke!

359
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,630
Come on, drink up!

360
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,390
Cheers!

361
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,060
Sen,

362
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,670
let's play a game!

363
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:14,790
Yeah.

364
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,060
Let's play something fun!

365
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,580
Fun?

366
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:18,940
How fun?

367
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,580
We have 18 people here.

368
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,630
Here are 18 cards.

369
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,220
One of them is an A.

370
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,270
Whoever gets a K is the king.

371
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,940
They can ask A to tell the truth.

372
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,820
Sounds fun.

373
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,030
Who's K?

374
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:36,870
Show it!

375
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:37,940
Yes.

376
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,150
I'll get you a big one.

377
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,030
Whoever gets A

378
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,630
has to tell us about their first love.

379
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,550
Make it tasteful!

380
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,460
Who's A?

381
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,420
Who's A? Come out!

382
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,670
Who's A? Come out!

383
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,180
Who's A?

384
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,100
Who is it?

385
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,220
Who is it?

386
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,820
I'm A.

387
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,270
President,

388
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,580
I guess it backfired, huh?

389
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:05,820
It's okay.

390
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,460
Ouch, right?

391
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,270
Come on. Okay.

392
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,340
Come on!

393
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:14,390
Actually, it's not really a first love.

394
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,550
Sounds like warming up.

395
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,550
I got sick when I was a sophomore

396
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,870
and didn't go to class
for over half a month.

397
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,580
When I went back to school,

398
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,940
as soon as I came into the classroom,

399
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,630
I found that on my desk,

400
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,630
there was a stash of notebooks.

401
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,060
With a love letter in it?

402
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,340
No.

403
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,030
Within them, were notes of every class

404
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,940
that I missed due to sickness.

405
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,420
- So romantic!
- That's sweet.

406
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,820
How nice is this!

407
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,750
Who was it?

408
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,550
On every page, there were detailed

409
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,220
notes and explanations.

410
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,990
I saw the handwriting

411
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,790
and I knew who it was.

412
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,460
Now comes the hero.

413
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,180
What kind of a man was he?

414
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,180
He had always been top of our grade.

415
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,150
That's our Shan.

416
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,990
Only dates the best in class.

417
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,510
Shut up.

418
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,420
So,

419
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,460
what progress did you have?

420
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,340
There was no progress, actually.

421
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,630
That's why I said
it wasn't really a first love.

422
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,300
Not even a first kiss?

423
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,270
No.

424
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,870
This guy must have gone elsewhere,

425
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,510
otherwise Xu Ou wouldn't have
got the chance.

426
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:31,990
Yeah!

427
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,270
Who was this guy?

428
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,460
What about afterwards?

429
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,180
Have you never met after that?

430
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,990
Yeah. Have you seen him?

431
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,490
We never contacted each other.

432
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,210
I hope he's fine.

433
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:48,940
Let's drink!

434
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,370
Cheers!

435
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:52,900
Come on!

436
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,450
Cheers!

437
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,490
The weather's changed. Can we still go?

438
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,020
It's getting cold!

439
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,210
Shall we still go into the mountain?

440
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,850
Since we're here.

441
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,450
Yeah. We can't give up halfway.

442
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,580
It'll get warmer when the sun gets out.

443
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,370
Plus we'll get warmer if we move.

444
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:08,450
Follow me!

445
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,250
Let's go.

446
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,300
Anyone with energy, come with me.

447
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,610
Go!

448
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,180
Let's all take care of each other.

449
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:23,940
Xu Ou!

450
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,540
Sen!

451
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,060
I've been meaning to ask you.

452
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,850
Why did you take the exam
for someone else two years ago?

453
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:01,700
For my brother.

454
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,540
But it didn't even
reach the entrance level.

455
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,700
That wasn't the real you, was it?

456
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,780
We're separated from the crowd.

457
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,850
We need to find the way fast.

458
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,300
Did you do it on purpose?

459
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:28,900
No.

460
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,450
Why didn't you contact me?

461
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:35,060
I never thought
I'd see you at the exam spot.

462
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,060
You think I reported you?

463
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:49,970
No.

464
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,090
Come on.

465
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:08,820
Thank you.

466
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,820
Li Zerui.

467
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,250
I'm not Li Zerui.

468
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,330
I'm Fei Ke.

469
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,250
Wake up!

470
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,250
Wake up!

471
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,820
Finally found you!

472
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,610
I've got hot water.

473
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:33,300
Here!

474
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,580
Give it to her.

475
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,450
I'll go find others.

476
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:42,900
Anyone?

477
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:27,940
Come on! Stretcher!

478
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:29,330
Stretcher!

479
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,250
There are still a few
more people in there!

480
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,700
How many people all together?

481
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,660
Eighteen.

482
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,450
Eighteen.

483
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,300
Okay.

484
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,970
The temperature in the mountain
dropped to below zero suddenly,

485
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,090
and they soaked in the rain for hours!

486
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,180
Almost everyone

487
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,900
showed signs of hypothermia.

488
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,490
Mild cases can be discharged

489
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,780
after some simple care and observation,

490
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,940
but there are a few severe cases

491
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,370
that have shown symptoms

492
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,450
of speech difficulties
and muscle disorientation.

493
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,700
We're trying our best.

494
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,250
Who organized this?

495
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,210
Director Han,

496
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,210
it's a common decision.

497
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,700
Sit down.

498
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:41,130
This is some extended training organized

499
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,210
by the Finance Club, right?

500
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,090
What a child's play!

501
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,610
Who's in charge?

502
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,730
Who's in charge?

503
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:55,330
I am.

504
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,780
Write down everyone involved in this,

505
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,370
name,

506
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,490
school and class, everything!

507
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,090
How many people?

508
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,780
What do you mean?

509
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,900
I take full responsibility.

510
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,580
I'll take all the punishment.

511
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,060
Leave everyone out of this.

512
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,940
Still playing the hero here?

513
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,660
How can you possibly take
on this responsibility?

514
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,610
Who do you think you are?

515
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,580
I don't care who your father is.

516
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,060
This is getting bad.

517
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,850
There are still three people

518
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,370
getting emergency treatment
in the hospital.

519
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,700
Everyone's talking
about it on the internet.

520
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,900
You'll of course get punished.

521
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,940
If you won't write this,
I'll check you out one by one

522
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,060
and everyone will get punished.

523
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,330
Then just expel me.

524
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,820
You're still being stubborn?

525
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,660
Do you know the consequences of this?

526
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,180
Do you know how bad it looks?

527
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,330
I don't care. I won't write.

528
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,730
I'll do it.

529
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:04,660
Okay.

530
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,170
No wonder you won't go back
to our doghole.

531
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,450
What happened to your hand?

532
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,730
Nothing.

533
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,620
Just got a finger chopped off, that's all.

534
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,890
No big deal.

535
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,140
I saw you on TV.

536
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,060
Is that you?

537
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,450
It is.

538
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,620
Thank god you didn't die.

539
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,340
Otherwise, I wouldn't know who to find.

540
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,620
What exactly happened to you?

541
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,620
Got set up,

542
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,650
lost dozens of thousands.

543
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:04,210
Couldn't pay, got a finger chopped off.

544
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,020
If I still can't pay,
more fingers will be chopped off.

545
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,970
How would you want me to help?

546
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,970
Lend me money if you have.

547
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,970
If not, let me stay here to hide.

548
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,490
Okay?

549
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,060
It's a rented place.

550
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,300
Coming and going, the neighbors know me.

551
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,410
Besides, they don't accept outsiders.

552
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:31,890
Outsider?

553
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:35,620
Outsider?

554
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,730
Outsider?

555
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,780
Aren't you an outsider too?

556
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,340
What?

557
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,020
I need to pee.

558
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,450
Ou.

559
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,620
I'm being expelled.

560
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,100
That bad?

561
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,300
The public was shocked.

562
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:25,620
Famous university students hiking
in the mountains inexperienced.

563
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,780
Hundreds of people searching for them.

564
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,860
Some are still lying in the hospital.

565
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,170
If the college doesn't expel me,

566
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,490
they won't be able to calm the parents.

567
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,780
Go plead to the college leaders
and apologize.

568
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,100
Even if I stay,

569
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,930
my reputation's trashed.

570
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:49,490
The leaders asked me to report the names.

571
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,300
I refused,

572
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,490
but someone volunteered instead.

573
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,210
The problem is,

574
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,300
what's your relationship with her?

575
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,100
Why would she leave your name out?

576
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,210
The teachers are investigating this.

577
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,490
Sooner or later, they'll find out.

578
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,650
Someone there?

579
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,540
Why didn't you tell me? Who?

580
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:18,690
A friend.

581
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,450
Is it He Shan?

582
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,490
No, Xu Ou.

583
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,170
It's not He Shan!

584
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,450
He Shan! Is it you?

585
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,140
No, it's not!

586
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,380
What's wrong with you? That's rude!

587
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,490
Fei Ke, who's this?

588
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,490
He's my senior.

589
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,100
Xu Ou, from International Trading.

590
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:39,820
Sorry.

591
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:41,490
That was a mistake.

592
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,450
It's okay, Ou.

593
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,210
Don't worry.

594
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,820
I won't harm you.

595
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:05,820
Qiao,

596
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:08,300
don't report me, okay?

597
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,580
I barely got my footing here.

598
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,300
I've made friends

599
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,820
and got teachers that like me.

600
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,650
For old time's sake,

601
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,100
can you keep the secret for me?

602
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:26,380
You know, I never rat out my friends,

603
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,860
unless this friend betrays me first.

604
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:32,890
You have so many rich friends.

605
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:34,780
Fifty grand,

606
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,660
that shouldn't be hard.

607
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,820
I honestly don't have any rich friends.

608
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,730
The one just now?

609
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,820
Finance Club, that sounds rich.

610
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,820
Fine, you're not going?

611
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,660
I'll go ask him myself.

612
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,290
I'll go.

613
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:05,620
I'll borrow the money.

614
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:34,730
Hello?

615
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:36,730
Zerui,

616
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,250
your dad's dying.

617
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,620
I'm begging you,

618
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,860
come back to see him, okay?

619
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:57,900
Actually,

620
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,060
he found out about this disease
before you left.

621
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,530
He didn't tell you

622
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,450
because he didn't want you to worry.

623
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:11,290
Now that he's failing,

624
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,860
I thought you needed to see him
one last time.

625
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,140
Is there nothing we can do?

626
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,060
Uremia, late-stage.

627
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,450
He needs dialysis every other day.

628
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:24,820
All these years,

629
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:28,140
we've drained all our savings.

630
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,340
Your brother sent home his salary

631
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,820
to pay for medical bills.

632
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:36,820
I just thought

633
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,420
that between father and son,

634
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,310
what happened was my fault.

635
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,790
If you don't come back,

636
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,980
your father won't die in peace.

637
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,660
That's your own family business.

638
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,980
I don't care.

639
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,420
You misunderstood.

640
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,630
I'm not asking for money.

641
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:09,700
I just thought, over all these years,

642
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,180
whatever conflicts between us,

643
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,700
we could cancel them

644
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,790
in front of your dad.

645
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,900
Don't make him die with regrets.

646
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:26,030
Is there a medical record?

647
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,340
[Diagnosis]

648
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,790
The doctor said

649
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,870
that the only option

650
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,460
is a kidney transplant.

651
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,260
I'll send it to my friends
at the university.

652
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:56,460
See if there's anything they can do.

653
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:05,220
Look.

654
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,460
How long has it been?

655
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,660
Many years.

656
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,420
He needs dialysis every other day.

657
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:14,660
I've got no other option but
to borrow money from you.

658
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:44,390
Right,

659
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,030
did you pass the functional analysis test?

660
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:49,830
I did.

661
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:50,980
What's your score?

662
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:52,980
Eighty.

663
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,110
Professor Lyu is strict.

664
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,260
You got eighty from him?

665
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:03,030
I forgot.

666
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:04,870
I passed anyway.

667
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:07,390
Did you choose Mr. Shu's topology?

668
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,350
I did.

669
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,350
How many credits?

670
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:11,870
Two.

671
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:12,630
Three!

672
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,660
And the teacher for topology is Mr. Lu.

673
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:17,900
The teacher for Functional Analysis
is not Lyu, but Song.

674
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:19,740
His best scores are seventy-something,

675
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,180
there's never eighty.

676
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:22,700
Who on earth are you?

677
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,830
Why did you sneak into our university?

678
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:33,790
Senior Ou...

679
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:34,460
Stop it.

680
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:36,420
You steal classes. I'm expelled.

681
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,790
"Senior" is not appropriate anymore.

682
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,790
All I want is to get a good education.

683
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,700
Go out and turn right,
there's the adult education.

684
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,260
Right,

685
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:54,500
I forgot. You've got no money.

686
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:55,980
You're borrowing money from me, right?

687
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,390
This money

688
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:02,420
is for your dad's kidney transplant.

689
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,030
You want it?

690
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:13,180
You didn't lie about that too, did you?

691
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:17,420
You saw the medical record.

692
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,310
You can forge a student card,

693
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,390
I bet you can forge a medical record too.

694
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,310
It's real.

695
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,030
My dad is lying
in Huishan Hospital right now.

696
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:36,030
It's my last day
at Chengjiang University.

697
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,070
They're here to say goodbye.

698
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,030
I feel very embarrassed.

699
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:43,660
Not because of the expel,

700
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,940
but because of being fooled

701
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:47,390
by you two for a year!

702
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:49,830
Xu Ou.

703
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:51,630
Let me explain.

704
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:52,590
Shut up.

705
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:56,660
Let's break up.

706
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,700
Fei Ke,

707
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:02,870
or whatever name you go by,

708
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:03,550
I don't care.

709
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:06,500
I want you to call Academic Affairs

710
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,980
and tell them that you're an imposter.

711
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,460
And get out of this campus forever!

712
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,220
Hello?

713
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:27,870
Hello.

714
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,180
Academic Affairs Office?

715
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:37,660
Hello?

716
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:41,420
Hello?

717
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:45,460
I didn't call. Now get lost!

718
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,900
Count it.

719
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,660
You wanna scam us?

720
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,630
We'll never believe you again!

721
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,460
[Qiao]

722
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,060
Hello?

723
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,180
Did you get the money?

724
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:52,060
I did.

725
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,770
I'm bringing it to you.

726
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,210
Good. I'll wait.

727
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,620
Get up and come with us.

728
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:27,290
Don't move!

729
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:28,380
Don't move!

730
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,250
I didn't do anything!

731
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,290
Stay back! Stay back!

732
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:35,730
Go.

733
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,580
Stay back!

734
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,250
What are you looking at?

735
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,380
- Shut up!
- Go away.

736
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,420
- Stay back!
- Go away.

737
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:45,900
- Step back.
- Stop staring.

738
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,490
Stop staring. Step back, please.

739
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:49,180
Stay back.

740
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:52,100
Step back, please.

741
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:53,690
Go home.

742
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:55,420
It looks serious.

743
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:14,290
