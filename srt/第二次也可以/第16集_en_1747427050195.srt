1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Wake up

2
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,400
The process is too comfortable

3
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,320
To be forgotten by time

4
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,360
Wake up

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,360
Wake up

6
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,680
Wake up

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,680
The Long Ballad

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,680
Episode 16

9
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,680
Forget it. You've tried your best.

10
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,480
Don't be sad. You will come back.

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm leaving.

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,680
When?

13
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
In a few days.

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,680
Will you come back?

15
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
I don't know.

16
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,680
Then our team...

17
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,680
I'll go.

18
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
Forget it.

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Zheng, why are you here?

20
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
I'm here to form a band for you.

21
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,680
But only three of us can form a band.

22
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
And me.

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
Anjie.

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
You've decided to form a band with us?

25
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,680
But I won't do anything.

26
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,680
Anjie, then you don't need to leave, right?

27
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,680
I think Xiaosu is right.

28
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,680
If we can get the first place,

29
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,680
we can take Youyou to the prairie.

30
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,680
I think I'll give myself a chance.

31
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,680
And give Youyou a chance.

32
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,680
Everyone likes Youyou very much.

33
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,680
They don't want her to leave.

34
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,680
The bright starry sky is like a dream.

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
The fireworks are re-emitting.

36
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
Now I announce that...

37
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
our band, Nihong Shines, is officially formed.

38
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,680
We're going to start rehearsing.

39
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,680
What did I do?

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,680
Anjie, I'll teach you the simplest instrument.

41
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,680
Listen.

42
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,680
Anjie, try it.

43
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Not bad.

44
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,680
I can't do it.

46
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,680
It's okay.

47
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
Just hit it.

48
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,680
You want to compete at this level?

49
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,680
Miss Su, why are you here?

50
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,680
Are you here to teach us?

51
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,680
I'm not that boring.

52
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Why are you looking at me?

53
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
Let's start.

54
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,680
You're all so good.

55
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,680
I can rest assured that I'll go to work.

56
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
Anjie,

57
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
didn't you tell everyone that

58
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,680
you were the champion of the singing competition?

59
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,680
Anjie, why didn't you say it earlier?

60
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,680
It's just a small competition in our city.

61
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,680
And I haven't sung for so many years.

62
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,680
I definitely can't do it.

63
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,680
Anjie, you sing as the lead singer.

64
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
I'll sing a song for you.

65
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
Okay.

66
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,680
I'll sing a song for you.

67
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,680
Okay.

68
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
Anjie, you can do it.

69
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,680
You can do it.

70
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
It's settled.

71
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,680
Have you chosen the song for the competition?

72
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
It's written by Chen Haoyue.

73
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,680
Okay.

74
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,680
But we need to rearrange it.

75
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,680
Let's get ready.

76
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
We'll rehearse tomorrow.

77
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
Okay.

78
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
Thank you, Miss Su.

79
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
You're welcome.

80
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
I'm not that boring.

81
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
I'm just a little bit tired.

82
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
Miss Su,

83
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,680
you're welcome.

84
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,680
I'm doing this for Youyou,

85
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
not for you.

86
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
Youyou,

87
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
have some watermelon.

88
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
Youyou.

89
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
No.

90
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
I think it's better to sing like this.

91
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Anjie?

92
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Where's Youyou?

93
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
She's gone.

94
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,680
She left with so many regrets

95
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,680
and sorrow

96
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,680
step by step.

97
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,680
She's gone with Youyou's hand.

98
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Didn't we agree yesterday

99
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
that we won't leave?

100
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,680
Zheng.

101
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
Oh, no.

102
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
Oh, no.

103
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
Uncle Zheng,

104
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
what are you doing?

105
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
I'm going to sleep.

106
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
Why are you here?

107
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,680
Mom and I are drying the quilt.

108
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
The weather is nice.

109
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
I'll take out the quilt

110
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
and dry it.

111
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Okay.

112
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Su,

113
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,680
you're being too much.

114
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Zheng is in a hurry.

115
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,680
Why are you pretending?

116
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,680
You're not that good.

117
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,680
You look real.

118
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,680
I can't pretend,

119
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,680
but I do look like him.

120
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
I don't think it's good.

121
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,680
You can make it more rich.

122
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
How about now?

123
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,680
Try it.

124
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
Come on.

125
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,680
Come on.

126
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,800
In Taiwan for Domestic compliment

127
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,680
1st song of the first novo

128
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,680
Every time you fall into the heart of the human being

129
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,680
Determined to be a fish in the water

130
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,680
Every time you fall asleep in every

131
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,680
Tomorrow that you can't see

132
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,680
You can't change

133
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,680
The world of the human being

134
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,680
Hey

135
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:16,680
Hey

136
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,680
Hey

137
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,680
Hey

138
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,680
Hey

139
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,680
Sister An, you sang so well.

140
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Why do I suddenly have a feeling of being a champion?

141
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
Definitely can

142
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,680
impossible

143
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,680
The song is not bad, but there is no creativity.

144
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,680
There is no difference from the general song.

145
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,680
If we want to win first place, I think

146
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
We must be in the arrangement and performance

147
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
In every aspect

148
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,680
Have your own characteristics

149
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,680
Indeed, our songs are very good now.

150
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
Just no features

151
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,680
You two are rarely unified.

152
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,680
So you are the first medicine now.

153
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,680
How to make this song special

154
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,680
You are not us

155
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,680
Yes

156
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,680
I am only responsible for the drum

157
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,680
Other things are not difficult to do

158
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
I am busy

159
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,680
I am busy, I am leaving first.

160
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,680
Come on, study, study

161
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,680
Come on, continue to study

162
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,680
Sister An, sing well.

163
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,680
You played well, that one is too good.

164
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,680
I am busy, I am leaving first.

165
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
Come on, study, study

166
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
Come on, continue to study

167
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,680
Come on, continue to study

168
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
Come on, continue to study

169
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
Come on, continue to study

170
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,680
Come on, continue to study

171
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,680
Come on, continue to study

172
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,680
Come on, continue to study

173
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,680
Come on, continue to study

174
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,680
Come on, continue to study

175
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,680
Come on, continue to study

176
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,680
Come on, continue to study

177
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,680
Come on, continue to study

178
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
Come on, continue to study

179
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,680
Come on, continue to study

180
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
Come on, continue to study

181
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,680
Come on, continue to study

182
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,680
Come on, continue to study

183
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
Come on, continue to study

184
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
Come on, continue to study

185
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,600
What we would say

186
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
I just focus on the data

187
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
I just focus on the data

188
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,640
No, no, and all the medicine

189
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,920
I'll ask the carrier to help when you monitor the flight.

190
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,960
Write, first.

191
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,640
I'll check out the calorie points in the jetанity.

192
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,640
But I...

193
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
But I...

194
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,640
What should I do?

195
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,640
Brother, it's okay.

196
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
I won't bring them here.

197
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,640
Brother, don't worry.

198
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,640
I will bring them to the prairie.

199
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
What's wrong?

200
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
Nothing.

201
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
How's the arrangement?

202
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,640
Not bad.

203
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
Take a look.

204
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
Let's go and have a try.

205
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Okay.

206
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,640
Ten o'clock.

207
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
Ten o'clock.

208
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,640
Don't turn on the lights.

209
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,640
Tonight.

210
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,640
The truth is hidden in the old USB.

211
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,640
The breathing rhythm slows down.

212
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,640
The steps slowly slow down.

213
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,640
The world is not a place for suspense.

214
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,640
The creation of the phoenix is like a bullet.

215
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,640
The darkness is always looking for answers.

216
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,640
The world is not a place for suspense.

217
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,640
The darkness is always looking for answers.

218
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,640
The suspicious person.

219
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,640
The plot twists and turns.

220
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,640
The mystery is solved and appears.

221
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,640
The mystery.

222
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Whose body temperature?

223
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,640
Whose position?

224
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,640
Open the door to the heart that has been locked for a long time.

225
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,640
Whose eyes?

226
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Whose turn?

227
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,640
The more I go down the trap, the deeper I get.

228
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,640
The blurry will.

229
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,640
Looking for no one.

230
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,640
The mystery.

231
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,640
The mystery.

232
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,640
The mystery.

233
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
The mystery.

234
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,640
The mystery.

235
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,640
The mystery.
