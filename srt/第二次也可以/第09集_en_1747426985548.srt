00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Wake up

3
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,480
The process is too comfortable

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,400
To be forgotten by time

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,400
Wake up

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,400
Wake up

00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
Wake up

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Coming

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Coming

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You forgot the key again

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You are here

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Is this Zheng's house?

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
She is beautiful but looks tired

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
There are English words on the luggage box

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
She should be

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Then you are

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I am

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I am

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Steward

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Steward

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes, I am the steward

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Master should be sleeping

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I will go to invite him

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Please take a rest in the living room

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Please come in

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Thank you

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Come in

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Zheng

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What's wrong?

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
She is here

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Your ex-wife

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What?

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Why did she come in advance?

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Where is Xiaosu? Where is Xiaochun?

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't know

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Oh, no

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I am making breakfast there

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
She came to me

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I didn't prepare it

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I said

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What?

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I said I am your steward

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Steward

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I can only make a mistake

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You go first

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I will come right away

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Dear guests

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Please have some water

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Thank you

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Master will be here soon

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Please wait a moment

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Did she ask you to teach her master?

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I learned it from the TV

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Master

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Master

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You are so busy

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I am fine

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I am free

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You are still the same

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Welcome back

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What are you doing?

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I am going to the bathroom

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I am going to the bathroom

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I am going to the bathroom

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I am going to the bathroom

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You look beautiful

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Thank you

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You are in the spotlight

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You are afraid of the light

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What are you talking about?

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Master

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The food is ready

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Do you want to eat now?

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Of course

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Well

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You should be polite when drinking water

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You can't drink it

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
like you do

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
with this thermos

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You should drink it

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I am so tired

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It seems that you are doing well

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
these years

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I heard that

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
you have a boyfriend

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Let's see

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't worry

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He is nice to Lu

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Lu told me

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
that you are living in a big house

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
There is a swimming pool inside

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It is soaked in the pool every day

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You are good too

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You have a housekeeper

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Please have a taste

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Mind your words

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It is not madam

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It is Mrs. Qian

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Mrs. Qian, please have a taste

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Anjie

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Call me Mr. in the future

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Hello

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Xiaosu

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Where are you going?

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I am running

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What's wrong?

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Mrs. Zheng

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
She came back in advance

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What's going on?

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I was in a hurry

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I said I am a housekeeper

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You are a housekeeper

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What about me?

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Come back

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Have a taste

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It is good

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Hello

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This is

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I will take you back

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Hello

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I am Zheng's girlfriend

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Zheng

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Introduce yourself

127
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Let me introduce you

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
My girlfriend

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Sudia

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This is my ex-wife

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Li Li

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Hello

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I often hear Zheng remind you

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You are back

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You should stay longer

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
If you need anything

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Just tell Zheng

138
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Thank you

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Zheng

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I will go upstairs and change

142
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You can talk

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Have lunch at home

144
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Anjie's cooking is very good

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This girl

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Looks a few years older than her

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Just 20

149
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You really don't forget your original intention

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Still like 20 years old

151
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I am

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
No

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Chen Haoyu

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The plan has changed

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Stop delivering food immediately

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Now you are a driver

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Remember?

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Go to the rental car

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Since I am Zheng's girlfriend

160
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I have to give him a good face

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Xiao Su

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Madam

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Madam, have lunch

164
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Coming

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Sit down

166
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Anjie, sit down

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yes

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We don't pay attention to these

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Still not paying attention?

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Sister

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Sister

172
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Eat more

173
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You are abroad

174
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You can't eat such a authentic Chinese food

175
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Anjie is invited by us from Sichuan

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Her cooking is very good

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Zheng

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You should eat more

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Can we eat coriander now?

180
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Okay

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Zheng didn't say

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We can't eat coriander

183
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Sorry

184
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Why did I add coriander in your bowl?

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's not coriander

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's coriander

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Please

188
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Miss Su is 20 years old today

189
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Just 20

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Young and beautiful

191
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Why do you like Zheng?

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's fate

193
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Speaking of this

194
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I really have to thank you

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes

197
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
From Zheng's point of view

198
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You are really a senior

199
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
If you hadn't divorced Zheng

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I wouldn't have the chance to be with Zheng

201
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
When are you going to get married?

202
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I have made a deal with Zheng

203
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I will get married on the day of my birthday

204
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This is the best birthday gift from Zheng

205
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We are going to hold a wedding in Malaysia

206
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If you have time

207
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You must come to the venue

208
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No need

209
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But the gift must be there

210
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Then I will thank you

211
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Thank you, senior

212
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Are you going to sign the papers this afternoon?

213
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Zheng

214
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Let the driver take you there this afternoon

215
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Okay

216
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Sir

217
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You really go well with the driver

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The gate

219
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What?

220
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The gate

221
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What?

222
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Madam, please

223
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Okay, I will go there myself

224
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Help me take out my luggage

225
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
No

226
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You don't live at home?

227
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
How could it be?

228
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I am kidding you

229
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I have booked a hotel

230
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No, the driver is at the venue

231
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I will go with you

232
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
No need

233
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I can go by myself

234
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Don't worry

235
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
She is Zheng's ex-wife?

236
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The car is from the venue

237
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Don't worry

238
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
No

239
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Hello

240
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Hello

241
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You are Zheng's ex-wife?

242
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Hello

243
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I am Zheng's girlfriend

244
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Zheng

245
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Zheng

246
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
He talks about you every day

247
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You are so beautiful

248
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Your lines are the same

249
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Sister Su San

250
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Why are you back suddenly?

251
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Why am I back suddenly?

252
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
This is my home

253
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I can go back whenever I want

254
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Oh, no

255
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Master is found

256
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Sister An

257
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You are still angry?

258
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You are so angry

259
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I failed

260
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Zheng

261
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You don't need to be angry with me

262
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I am afraid you will look down on me

263
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I am back this time

264
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
except for the visa

265
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I just want to see

266
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
how you are doing

267
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
How are you?

268
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Now it seems

269
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
you are doing well

270
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I am relieved

271
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
to have so many friends

272
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You can continue to use the car

273
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
these two days

274
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The car is rented

275
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's expensive

276
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I can take a taxi

277
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I will leave before 8 o'clock

278
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I have time

279
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I will take my daughter back

280
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I want her

281
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Ok

282
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Take this

283
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I am not happy there

284
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Give me back the loan

285
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I don't need money

286
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Take it

287
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You and your daughter

288
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
spend a lot of money there

289
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I don't want it

290
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Take it

291
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Actually

292
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
you like sister An

293
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I like her

294
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I like sister An

295
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Why do you think so?

296
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Because I am your concubine

297
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I am leaving

298
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
