1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
Let me answer for passing by.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Wake up

3
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,400
The process is too difficult

4
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,400
The world is a long game

5
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,360
Wake up

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,360
Wake up

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,680
Wake up

8
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,200
What are you doing, kid?

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,280
Sister, you are so beautiful

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Really? Am I beautiful?

11
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,240
You are the most beautiful sister I have ever seen

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,240
You are so sweet

13
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,120
Sister, can I be as beautiful as you when I grow up?

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,280
Yes

15
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,600
You must be more beautiful than me when you grow up

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,240
Then I am the most beautiful person in the world

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,960
Sister, am I beautiful?

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes

19
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,000
My dog is back

20
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,960
Su Yun

21
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,840
Why didn't you see the question?

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,040
Youyou, can you turn down the volume of the TV?

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,760
It will affect my homework

24
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,720
I can't hear you if the volume is too low

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,960
I am coming

26
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,080
Can you write it faster?

27
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,480
Sister Hua An is back

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,800
I want to write it faster, too

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,280
But what is this question?

30
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,400
Why do you cut it?

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,800
Why does she want to cut it?

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,600
We don't even know how to answer questions in the fourth grade

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,040
We don't know where we have been all day

34
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,560
You have been eating with the rice for so many years

35
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,400
Yes, not only eating, but also vomiting

36
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,920
Be quiet

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,080
Mom

38
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,080
Sister An, I am sorry

39
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,160
No, no, no

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,480
Don't say sorry

41
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,400
I am sorry to you

42
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,320
I don't know what my own child is like

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,080
Sister An, calm down

44
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,560
I have said again and again

45
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,840
not to let the child eat junk food

46
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,200
But you

47
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,080
look at the food for the child

48
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,000
You two are still laughing, right?

49
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,760
You actually help the child write homework

50
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,520
You don't know that

51
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,400
you are not helping him, but hurting him

52
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,800
Calm down, calm down

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,160
It will hurt him

54
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,240
And you

55
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,960
Two young people are not sensible

56
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,560
You are old enough to understand

57
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,480
You are indulging the child to watch TV

58
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,480
Don't you know that watching TV

59
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,000
will hurt the child's eyes?

60
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,400
It's better than playing with the phone all the time

61
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,000
At least we can get the content right

62
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,360
You are still arguing, right?

63
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,720
Sister An, we know we are wrong

64
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,520
Sister An, give us another chance

65
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,720
We can definitely take good care of Youyou

66
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,360
Forget it

67
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,480
I will send the child back

68
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,280
Hello, mom

69
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,440
I am too busy

70
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,160
I really don't have time to take care of the child

71
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,760
How about I send Youyou back?

72
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,080
I will tell you when I buy the ticket

73
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,280
Mom, I don't want to go

74
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,000
Baby, don't cry

75
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,320
Baby, I made money

76
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,920
I will take care of you and grandma

77
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,040
Don't cry

78
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,120
No, mom is lying

79
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,880
I don't want to go

80
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,520
Mom, I don't want to go

81
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,920
I don't want to go

82
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,400
I don't want to go

83
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,000
Don't cry, don't cry

84
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,760
Let's go back to the room

85
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,160
Don't cry

86
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,320
You

87
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
You really decide to send Youyou back?

88
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,360
I have to go to work every day

89
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,760
I don't have time to take care of her

90
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,280
I think sending her back

91
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,160
may be the best choice

92
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,400
But Youyou doesn't want to go

93
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,160
I don't want to be separated from her

94
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,360
I have no choice

95
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,280
You really decide to send her back?

96
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,880
How about we discuss it first?

97
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,600
You can take a vacation these days

98
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,240
We will take Youyou out for a day

99
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,920
So that you can

100
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,600
supervise and guide us

101
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,680
Okay?

102
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,560
Let's go out together

103
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,200
We will go out together

104
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,440
and take Youyou out

105
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,760
Thank you, Zhang

106
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,200
We don't need to thank each other

107
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,400
I'm so scared

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,080
Don't hit her

109
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,960
Sister An

110
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,800
Forget it, forget it

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,640
Okay, okay

112
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,320
Sister An

113
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,000
Du Xia

114
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,160
I will buy you a new one

115
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,000
Sorry

116
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,960
Sister An

117
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,560
I don't know what's wrong with the baby

118
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,120
He always says the same thing to me

119
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,840
Stop laughing

120
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,200
Stop laughing

121
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,840
You

122
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,520
Work hard

123
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,240
You

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,040
He

125
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,040
Because I used to buy Susan's lipstick.

126
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,040
I think if her lipstick is broken,

127
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,040
I will buy her lipstick.

128
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Then I can see her.

129
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Brother? Which brother?

130
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
Brother Wu Wen.

131
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Every vacation he came,

132
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,040
Wu Wen played with me.

133
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,040
But he never came.

134
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
I miss him.

135
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Sister, do you know?

136
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,040
Brother Wu Wen sings very well.

137
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Don't be afraid of the dark.

138
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,040
I'm here to accompany you.

139
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Sleep well when you are sleepy.

140
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,040
Don't be afraid of tiredness.

141
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,040
I'm here to accompany you.

142
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Tomorrow we will be together.

143
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Is it good?

144
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
Yes.

145
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
Then I will sing for you every day.

146
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
Okay?

147
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Honey, is this color good?

148
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,040
It's good.

149
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,040
But so many lipsticks.

150
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,040
Do you have so many lips to apply?

151
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
What do you mean?

152
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,040
Don't want to buy me lipstick?

153
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,040
Buy you buy you buy.

154
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
Didn't say.

155
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,040
I buy you buy.

156
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
Buy who?

157
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,040
I didn't say I didn't want to buy you lipstick.

158
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,040
You said.

159
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,040
I didn't.

160
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
You said.

161
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
Will definitely.

162
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Two.

163
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
Three.

164
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Five.

165
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
All right.

166
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Why don't you say you buy me lipstick?

167
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,040
Next, Susan.

168
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,040
Is Susan here?

169
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Okay.

170
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Sister, are you also from the prairie?

171
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Brother Wu Wen said he is also from the prairie.

172
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,040
He also said he would take me to the prairie.

173
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,040
He said the prairie is very beautiful.

174
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,040
He said the prairie was the biggest and most beautiful amusement park in the world.

175
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,040
Never enough to play.

176
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,040
But Brother Wu Wen lied to me.

177
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,040
He didn't take me to the grassland

178
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,040
I didn't lie to you

179
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,040
He is just busy

180
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
He doesn't have time

181
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,040
Sister

182
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
Do you know where Wu Wen is?

183
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,040
Youyou

184
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,040
I will take you to the grassland, ok?

185
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
Really?

186
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
Of course

187
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Sister, you won't lie to me, right?

188
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
Of course not

189
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,040
I will take you to the grassland

190
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,040
Let you see

191
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,040
the biggest amusement park in the world

192
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
How beautiful it is

193
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,040
Great

194
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
Sister

195
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
When can we go there?

196
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,040
Do you think there will be Wu Wen?

197
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
But Wu Wen lied to me

198
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
He didn't take me to the grassland

199
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,040
I didn't lie to you

200
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,040
He is just busy

201
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
Sister

202
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
When can we go there?

203
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,040
Do you think there will be Wu Wen?

204
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,040
Hurry up, hurry up

205
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,040
It's too late

206
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
What time is it?

207
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
Hurry up, hurry up

208
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
Don't be late

209
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
It's too late

210
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Wait a minute

211
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
Wait a minute

212
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
There is one more person

213
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,040
Everyone is here

214
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
Coming

215
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
You are going too?

216
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
Why? Can't we go?

217
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,040
Sister, you are so beautiful

218
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
You have a good taste

219
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
What?

220
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
No lipstick in your bag?

221
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
Let's go

222
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
Go

223
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Go

224
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Youyou, you are so beautiful

225
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
Hit him, hit him

226
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
Go

227
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
Youyou, you are so beautiful

228
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
Youyou, you are so beautiful

229
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
Hit these two

230
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Yes, yes, yes

231
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
Go

232
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,040
Go

233
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Youyou

234
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
Youyou

235
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
Hit him, hit him

236
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
Go

237
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Don't break the glass

238
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
Don't rush

239
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,320
Let go

240
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,280
Who is the child?

241
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,480
Your mom and dad are raising you

242
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,160
You are a big shot

243
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,760
Who is the child?

244
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,600
Your mom and dad are raising you

245
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,800
I am her dad

246
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,160
What about your dad?

247
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,560
Can he beat someone?

248
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:16,880
Yes

249
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,520
Who?

250
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,600
Admit it

251
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,360
You are tall

252
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,200
and young

253
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,880
Who is the one?

254
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,400
Aren't you ashamed?

255
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,160
Who is ashamed?

256
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,040
We are talking about etiquette

257
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,320
Why should we beat someone?

258
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,680
Fine

259
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,680
You want to talk about etiquette?

260
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,000
I will talk about etiquette with you today

261
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,960
Let go

262
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,000
Don't do it

263
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,640
Okay

264
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
I'm sorry.

265
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,640
I was too angry that day.

266
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,640
I was anxious and didn't think it through.

267
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
I said it out loud.

268
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,640
I just don't want others to bully Youyou

269
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,640
and let them look down on her.

270
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,640
I should thank you.

271
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,640
Youyou is always in school

272
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
because of people's expectations.

273
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
I'm sorry.

274
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,640
I'm sorry.

275
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
I'm sorry.

276
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
I'm sorry.

277
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
I'm sorry.

278
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
I'm sorry.

279
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
I'm sorry.

280
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
I'm sorry.

281
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,640
I'm sorry.

282
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
I'm sorry.

283
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
Youyou must be happy

284
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
because you didn't have a father

285
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,640
to fight with in the school.

286
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,640
You got promoted today.

287
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,640
Youyou must be very happy.

288
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
Zheng.

289
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,640
Actually, every time you go on a blind date,

290
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,640
you wear that small coat

291
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,640
because you don't want others to look at you.

292
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,640
I know you're good to Youyou.

293
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,640
But I don't have any hope

294
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,640
for marriage.

295
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,640
That's how I've been all my life.

296
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,640
I don't want to get married again.

297
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,640
Don't waste your time on me.

298
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,640
You can't have a failed marriage

299
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,640
and I had a failed marriage.

300
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
That doesn't mean

301
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
we can't find happiness.

302
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,640
Happiness...

303
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
Happiness is

304
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,640
even more important to me.

305
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
Forget it.

306
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
Forget it.

307
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,640
Forget it.

308
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Forget it.

309
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
Forget it.

310
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
Forget it.

311
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
Forget it.

312
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
Forget it.

313
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
Forget it.

314
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
Forget it.

315
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
Forget it.

316
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
Forget it.

317
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
Forget it.

318
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
Forget it.

319
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
Forget it.

320
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,640
Forget it.

321
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,640
Did you fall?

322
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,640
Did you lose your way?

323
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,640
Is the smile and tears

324
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
a secret?

325
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
Did you get hurt?

326
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
Did you fall?

327
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
Did you get lost?

328
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
Did you get used to it?

329
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
Did you become unfamiliar?

330
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,640
Did you get hurt from the lightning?

331
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Did the world

332
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
get dark?

333
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,640
Did the world

334
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,640
get dark?

335
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,640
The current me

336
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
is not bad

337
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,640
I'm not so stubborn anymore

338
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,640
When did you

339
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,640
stop talking to me?

340
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,640
The current me

341
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
is not bad

342
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,640
I'm used to silence

343
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,640
I'm used to silence

344
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,640
I'm used to silence

345
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,640
I'm used to silence

346
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
I'm used to silence

347
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,640
I'm used to trainer

348
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,640
Then

349
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,640
then

350
00:15:47,640 --> 00:16:02,640
I will

351
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,640
I'm weak and weak, I'm strong

352
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,640
I'm afraid you'll be hurt in the evening

353
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:17,640
No matter what life gives, no matter what the world gives

354
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,640
How do you treat me?
