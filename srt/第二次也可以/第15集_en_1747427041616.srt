1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060
L.O.Λ.E noon broadcast

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Wake up

3
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,400
I'm feeling good

4
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,400
I'm growing up

5
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,400
Wake up

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,400
Wake up

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,680
Wake up

8
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,520
When are you leaving?

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,680
Tomorrow is the earliest day off

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,160
How is Youyou?

11
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,680
I feel reluctant

12
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,520
I won't let Youyou leave like this

13
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,000
At least I can

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,880
take her to the prairie

15
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,320
and take everyone to the prairie

16
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,600
and fulfill brother Wuwen's wish

17
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,040
Good idea

18
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,120
I've never been to the prairie

19
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:37,960
What?

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,800
Are you kidding?

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,080
Youyou's ticket is booked

22
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,720
I can't go to work

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,320
Besides, we have to go to the prairie

24
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,560
We don't have to spend money

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,440
We can eat and drink

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,880
We can afford it

27
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,600
I don't want the child to go

28
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,960
I really have no money

29
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,840
You don't have to see me

30
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,400
I don't have money either

31
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,040
I'm going to get married

32
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,400
There's a lot of money spent

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,880
I have no money and no time

34
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,360
Zheng

35
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,200
Yeah

36
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,840
Sister

37
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,840
We can't be here

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,680
What about later?

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,520
Youyou

40
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,040
I didn't lie to you

41
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,200
I'mardo

42
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,440
You see

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,920
Everyone explains

44
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,560
이죠

45
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,440
but we can't leave

46
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,200
Since you come next time

47
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,880
I'll take you to the prairie

48
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,080
I'll take you there alone

49
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,880
We won't be afraid of anyone's help

50
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,440
Sister

51
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,760
Can I change my wish now?

52
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,560
What wish do you want to change?

53
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,400
Mom, I'm not going to the grassland

54
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,520
But can you not send me away?

55
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,480
Youyou doesn't want to leave me

56
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,440
This is your wish

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,440
Mom, I don't want to leave you

58
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,640
I don't want to leave you

59
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,640
I don't want to leave you

60
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,640
I don't want to leave you

61
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,640
I don't want to leave you

62
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,640
I don't want to leave you

63
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,640
I don't want to leave you

64
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,640
I don't want to leave you

65
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,640
I don't want to leave you

66
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,640
I don't want to leave you

67
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,640
I don't want to leave you

68
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,640
I don't want to leave you

69
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,640
I don't want to leave you

70
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,640
I don't want to leave you

71
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,640
I don't want to leave you

72
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,800
I don't want to leave you

73
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,100
I don't want to leave you

74
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,100
I don't want to leave you

75
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,100
I don't want to leave you

76
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,100
I don't want to leave you

77
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,760
Stop

78
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,720
Why are we playing again?

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,040
No drum, no bass

80
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,280
It sounds awful

81
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,320
Indeed

82
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,680
Since when have you come back, brother?

83
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,180
If we don't rehearse

84
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,180
We won't make it to this year's festival

85
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,180
I'm sorry

86
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,180
What are you doing, Bao Yin?

87
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,180
How is it going over there?

88
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,180
Not good

89
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,180
When will you come back?

90
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,180
If you don't come back

91
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,180
you won't make it to the music festival

92
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,180
Music festival?

93
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,180
Yes

94
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,180
Ok, I won't talk to you now

95
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,180
I'll talk to you later

96
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,180
It's just a lack of money

97
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,180
Money can solve all problems

98
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,180
Come in

99
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,180
Sister Susan

100
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,180
What's up?

101
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,180
I want to form a band

102
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,180
What do you mean?

103
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,180
I knew you would play drums

104
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,180
I was just kidding

105
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,180
But I forgot now

106
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,180
And I don't have time

107
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,180
So should I

108
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,180
settle the debt with you?

109
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,180
What debt?

110
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,180
I'm helping you drink

111
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,180
I'm doing a great favor

112
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,180
Didn't you say you were not drunk?

113
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,180
And did you sign the contract?

114
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,180
You don't want the contract

115
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,180
How can you count on me?

116
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,180
Besides

117
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,180
My band is for

118
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,180
helping Youyou

119
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,180
realize the dream of the prairie

120
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,180
Why are you not

121
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,180
human at all?

122
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,180
Don't you want to

123
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,180
stay with Youyou?

124
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,180
Is it because of Youyou

125
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,180
that you got your lipstick broken?

126
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,180
Is it so cold-blooded?

127
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,180
Get out

128
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,180
Susan

129
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,180
Get out

130
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,180
What are you yelling at?

131
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,180
Zheng, Chen Haoyu

132
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,180
I have good news

133
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,180
What good news?

134
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,180
Do you want the prize of 10,000 yuan?

135
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,180
Yes

136
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,180
But you have to participate in the band competition

137
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,180
And then?

138
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,180
If you win, you will get the prize of 10,000 yuan

139
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,180
Wait

140
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,180
I'm not going to play the guitar

141
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,180
I'm not going to play the guitar

142
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,180
Zheng

143
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,180
You mean the band competition?

144
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,180
Yes

145
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,180
The first place

146
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,180
will get the prize of 10,000 yuan?

147
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,180
Yes

148
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,180
What does it have to do with me?

149
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,180
Zheng

150
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,180
With 10,000 yuan

151
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,180
we can take Youyou to the prairie

152
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,180
Zheng, think about it

153
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,180
Chen Haoyu and I will play the guitar

154
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,180
You will play the piano

155
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,180
Susan will play the drums

156
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,180
We have

157
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,180
a ready-made band

158
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,180
Yes

159
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,180
I'm going

160
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,180
Susan

161
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,180
agreed to participate?

162
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,180
No

163
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,180
I advise you

164
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,180
not to bother her

165
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,180
I have been driven out by her

166
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,180
Zheng

167
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,180
Let's go to the competition

168
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,180
Win the first place

169
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,180
We will get the prize of 10,000 yuan

170
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,180
There is no problem with logic

171
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,180
You think too simply

172
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,180
It's not difficult

173
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,180
Zheng

174
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,180
Think about it

175
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,180
How can you be sure

176
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,180
that you can win?

177
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,180
I'm not as confident as you

178
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,180
Zheng

179
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,180
Let's change the angle

180
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,180
and analyze from Youyou's perspective

181
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,180
If you can take Youyou to the prairie

182
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,180
does it mean that she doesn't have to go?

183
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,180
If Youyou can go to the prairie

184
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,180
does it mean that Anjie has given in?

185
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,180
Is it okay for Youyou

186
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,180
to be happy?

187
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,180
Anjie will be happy?

188
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,180
If Anjie is happy

189
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,180
you may

190
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,180
Yes

191
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,180
Anjie goes to the prairie?

192
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,180
Of course

193
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,180
Anjie is Youyou's legal guardian

194
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,180
She must accompany her all the way

195
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,180
I will participate

196
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,180
We must win the first place

197
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,180
Anjie

198
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,180
I will bring you the dishes

199
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,180
No need

200
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,180
I can do this alone

201
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,180
You can go in and wait for the meal

202
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,180
Anjie

203
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,180
I have something to tell you

204
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,180
What is it?

205
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,180
There is a band competition in our bar

206
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,180
The first place can get 10,000 yuan

207
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,180
With 10,000 yuan

208
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,180
we can take Youyou to the prairie

209
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,180
How simple is it?

210
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,180
It's not simple at all

211
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,180
Your group is easy to get

212
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,180
But I can't do anything

213
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,180
You can learn

214
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,180
I can teach you

215
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,180
I can teach you

216
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,180
I can teach you

217
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,180
No, no

218
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,180
Of course

219
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,180
I am old

220
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,180
I can't learn

221
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,180
and I can't do well

222
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,180
Don't embarrass me

223
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,180
Anjie

224
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,180
The competition is next week

225
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,180
Let Youyou stay a few more days

226
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,180
If you can't

227
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,180
let Youyou go back

228
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,180
Can you?

229
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,180
Give us a chance

230
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,180
Forget it

231
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,180
I have bought the tickets

232
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,180
Anjie

233
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,180
Do you really care about Youyou?

234
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,180
Of course

235
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,180
I am her daughter

236
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,180
How can I not care about her?

237
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,180
You care about her

238
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,180
You care about her

239
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,180
Why did you lock her in the room?

240
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,180
Why did you keep her in the old house?

241
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,180
You think what you are doing now

242
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,180
is for the future happiness of Youyou

243
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,180
But have you ever considered

244
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,180
whether Youyou is happy now?

245
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,180
Old Zheng

246
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,180
can argue with others for Youyou

247
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,180
Chen Haoyu can not work for Youyou

248
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,180
Even that crazy woman Su can

249
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,180
What about you?

250
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,180
Youyou just wants to go to the prairie

251
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,180
Can't you do that?

252
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,180
She also said she didn't want to leave you

253
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,180
Can you do that?

254
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,180
Anjie

255
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,180
We know how much you suffered

256
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,180
and how much you suffered

257
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,180
But Youyou also cares about you

258
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,180
Do you know?

259
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,180
Youyou said

260
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,180
Forget it

261
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,180
I feel a little sad

262
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,180
Thank you, Anjie

263
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,180
Come on, let's eat

264
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,180
I'll give you a toast

265
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,180
Thank you all

266
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,180
for taking care of Youyou these days

267
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,180
Old Zheng

268
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,180
Anjie, you are drunk

269
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,180
Drink

270
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,180
I don't drink

271
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,180
Youyou left after drinking

272
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,180
I don't drink

273
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,180
I don't drink

274
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,180
I don't drink

275
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,180
I don't drink

276
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,180
I don't drink

277
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,180
Cheers

278
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,180
Come on, try it

279
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,180
All my specialty

280
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,180
I really like to eat this

281
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,180
Eat more, baby

282
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,180
This is delicious

283
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,180
Well, Youyou

284
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,180
You come to toast

285
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,180
Toast to uncle and all the brothers and sisters

286
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,180
Uncle Zheng

287
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,180
Thank you for playing with me these days

288
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,180
and for being angry with me

289
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,180
Sister Susan

290
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,180
Thank you for giving me a makeup bag

291
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,180
I like it

292
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,180
You're welcome

293
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,180
Sister Su, Brother Haoyu

294
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,180
Thank you for helping me with my homework these days

295
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,180
You don't have to say this

296
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,180
Cheers, Youyou

297
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,180
Cheers

298
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,180
Mom, thank you

299
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,180
Thank you for being with me

300
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,180

I am very happy to be with you

303
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,180
Really

304
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,180
You can stay

305
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,180
Why do you insist on letting him go?

306
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,180
I want to thank you

307
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,180

398
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,180

399
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,180

00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,180

412
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,980
me

413
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,620
No Diana, no Xuanyuan

414
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,440
Open your eyes for me

415
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,120
You cross the log

416
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,460
Oh, yes, up above

417
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,440
We sleep on our own

418
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,640
I advisory the ruler

419
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,120
I have Collesque

420
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,060
Since you came

421
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,060
Whose body temperature is it?

422
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,060
Whose finger is it?

423
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:32,060
Open the door to your heart that has been locked by the wind

424
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,060
Whose eyes are it?

425
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,060
Whose turn is it?

426
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:42,060
The more I go down the trap, the deeper I get

427
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:46,060
A blur on the camera

428
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,060
Looking for no one
