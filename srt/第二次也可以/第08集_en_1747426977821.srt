Theẹnd

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,240
Episode 2

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,040
What am I gonna do?

5
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,680
Zheng.

6
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,080
You've been out or something?

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,560
Don't you know

8
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,120
he's coming back.

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,240
The ex-wife came back,

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,180
what are you afraid of?

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:57,920
Yeah.

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,800
He.

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,360
He's not afraid.

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,360
Then what is it?

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,240
You don't know that after we divorced,

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,920
he took his daughter abroad.

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,080
In order to get his daughter to study abroad,

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,520
I mortgaged the house and gave them a lot of money.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,840
Now, renting the house

20
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,280
is also to pay off the loan.

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,880
That's not embarrassing.

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,480
But he's doing well abroad.

23
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,840
He came back and saw me so miserable.

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,240
I feel so embarrassed.

25
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,680
Zheng,

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,280
a man should be proud of himself.

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,600
No matter what, he shouldn't be ashamed in front of his ex.

28
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,400
Yeah.

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,120
Pride.

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,280
You know me.

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,920
What's wrong?

32
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,000
His ex-wife is back.

33
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,600
He's leaving like that?

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,400
Think of something.

35
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,440
Zheng,

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,640
I'm going on a business trip for a few days.

37
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,680
My flower...

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,920
I know. I'll get you some water.

39
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,320
No, I'm telling you not to touch it.

40
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,200
It's okay, Zheng.

41
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll help you.

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,400
I'll help you figure out a way.

43
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,240
Inform Anjie to come back early for the meeting tonight.

44
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,240
What's your good idea?

45
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,480
You all know the situation, right?

46
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,000
Our task is to make Zheng

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,400
earn enough face in front of his ex-wife.

48
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,520
You two don't have any objections, right?

49
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,760
Sister Mei.

50
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,720
Okay.

51
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,480
Okay, I'll tell you tomorrow's task.

52
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,440
Cheng Haoyu, you'll be the driver.

53
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,520
Driver?

54
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,800
I need a driver to drive my car.

55
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,400
You can't drive your car.

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,120
We need to get some good stuff.

57
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,960
Get what?

58
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,640
Rent.

59
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,960
How much do we have to pay?

60
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,000
Zheng, it's for your sake.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,880
We have to get some good stuff.

62
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,440
Yeah.

63
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,240
For the sake of our reputation, we have to pay.

64
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,840
Okay, rent.

65
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,480
I have a driver.

66
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,600
It's not a big deal to drive.

67
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,960
I'll be the driver. You'll be the stewardess.

68
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,040
Stewardess?

69
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,520
Isn't that auntie?

70
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,800
Aunt Lan.

71
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,880
No, she can't cook. I'll do it.

72
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,240
You don't have to cook.

73
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,760
Anjie, your role is the most important.

74
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,440
What? What do I play?

75
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,880
Anjie, you play Zheng's girlfriend.

76
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,560
What?

77
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,480
No, no, no.

78
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,800
Anjie, can't you let Cheng Haoyu play?

79
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,040
Yeah, Anjie. You're the only one in the family who's a young lady.

80
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,400
Help Zheng.

81
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,720
Then you play, Xiaosu.

82
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,600
No, no, no.

83
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,200
She's not older than my daughter.

84
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,960
That's too much.

85
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,520
Anjie, you're the best.

86
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,120
Then it's hard on you.

87
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Then...

88
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,360
Okay, okay, okay. I'll play.

89
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,720
But I can't play well. Don't blame me.

90
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,520
Okay, I won't blame you.

91
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,240
And the most important thing.

92
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,440
Zheng, you have to change your clothes.

93
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,840
And buy clothes?

94
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,320
Of course.

95
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,040
Come on, let me tell you tomorrow's mission.

96
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,440
You have to be a good steward.

97
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,040
Okay?

98
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,640
I'll take you to buy clothes tomorrow afternoon.

99
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,640
Do you understand?

100
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
What about me?

101
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,640
Anjie, your mission these two days is to apply more mask.

102
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,640
Then you become beautiful.

103
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,440
And then...

104
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

105
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,440
Okay.

106
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,440
Everyone, let's call it a day.

107
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,040
Okay, okay, okay.

108
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,440
Everyone, the meeting is over.

109
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,840
Xiao Tian.

110
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,640
Xiao Tian, can this work?

111
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,840
Zheng, don't worry.

112
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,840
For the sake of face. Face.

113
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,240
Face.

114
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Face.

115
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,240
Come on, come on. Start training.

116
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,640
Look at me.

117
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,240
Hands up, smile.

118
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,640
As a senior steward, you have to know every detail.

119
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,240
Especially walking.

120
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,840
You have to be light.

121
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,440
You have to be small.

122
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,040
Light?

123
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,040
You have to be elegant.

124
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,240
Elegant?

125
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,840
Elegant.

126
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,240
Why does it look like a palace?

127
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,040
That's what I want.

128
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,840
Hands, neck, back.

129
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,440
Elegant.

130
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,240
Eyes at 45 degrees.

131
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,640
Don't lift too high.

132
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,640
Put your hands on your stomach.

133
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,040
Go.

134
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,840
Don't be so stiff.

135
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
Relax, relax.

136
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,840
That's right.

137
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,640
If I have another chance,

138
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,240
I'd rather be a stage director.

139
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,040
I'll go.

140
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,640
Sir.

141
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,240
Good morning.

142
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,240
Madam, please have some tea.

143
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,440
No, no, no.

144
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,440
Training has been effective this morning.

145
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,640
I'm so tired.

146
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
It's nine o'clock.

147
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,040
I have to sleep.

148
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,840
I have to deliver lunch.

149
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,840
How is it?

150
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,040
Welcome.

151
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,040
Xiaosu, this shop is too expensive.

152
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,640
This one.

153
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
This one.

154
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,640
This one.

155
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,840
This one.

156
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,240
Sir, please get in.

157
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,040
Xiaosu, you've been working hard recently.

158
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,640
Next month, I'll pay you.

159
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,840
Thank you, boss.

160
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,440
The results are quick.

161
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,840
But you're a bit like a typhoon.

162
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,440
and lower your voice

163
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Xiaosu, thank you for your hard work

164
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
I'll pay you next month

165
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,760
That's right

166
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,720
Let's go

167
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,080
Where are we going?

168
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,680
I want to do the whole set

169
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,400
Let's take photos

170
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,760
Take photos?

171
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,360
The photos are really good

172
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,200
Everyone

173
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,800
Everyone

174
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
Are you clear about tomorrow's plan?

175
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,520
No problem

176
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,880
Anjie, what about you?

177
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,440
I'll try my best

178
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,000
It's definitely not a problem

179
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,960
Just show your old Zheng's feeling today

180
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,320
I'm a little bit into it

181
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,080
That's right

182
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,440
Be confident

183
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,320
Old Zheng, you're the only one left

184
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,240
Can't we wear a bag?

185
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,800
I can jump very fast

186
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,320
Old Zheng, you have to get into that state

187
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
You have to imagine that you are a successful person

188
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,120
You have to pay attention to your speed and tone

189
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,160
We can't wear a bag

190
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,400
My heart is beating so fast

191

You have to go earlier.

316
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
Once you open the door,

317
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
you can see the end of the door until then.

318
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,240
Where is it?

319
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240

325
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
Who's body temperature?

326
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,240
Who's finger print?

327
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,240
Open the door to your heart

328
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,240
that's been locked for so long.

329
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,240
Whose eyes?

330
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,240
Whose hair?

331
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
The trap that's set me up

332
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,240
is making me more and more suspicious.

333
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,240
A blurry picture,

334
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
I'm looking for someone.
