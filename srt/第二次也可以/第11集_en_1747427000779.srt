next No.1

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Wake up

3
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,480
The process is like

4
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,440
a growing flower

5
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,440
Wake up

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,440
Wake up

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,680
Wake up

Episode 15

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,760
Don't drink too much.

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,400
Miss.

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,280
You're the one who's drunk.

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,640
You're still acting like a girl.

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,480
No way.

14
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,280
You're a child on the grassland.

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,880
You can't drink too much.

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,800
Here, miss.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,120
I'm used to it.

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,080
Come back to me.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,880
Drink some wine.

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,760
Cheers.

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,360
Here.

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,280
Okay.

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,680
Just one sip.

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,680
Okay.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,480
Cheers.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,360
Cheers.

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,080
Okay.

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,080
You drank it all.

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,760
All.

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,840
Episode 16

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,280
You're a man of your word.

32
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,080
You should believe me this time.

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,040
Usually, Su doesn't look like that kind of person.

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,840
It's called knowing the face but not the heart.

35
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,880
You must solve this today.

36
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,920
If you can't solve it,

37
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,720
you can move out.

38
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,080
No.

39
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,320
You live here very well.

40
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,880
How can you move out?

41
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,360
I mean, let him go.

42
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,600
Let him move out.

43
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,200
What are you two up to?

44
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,360
Is it not the right time for me to come back?

45
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,880
You're just in time.

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,240
We'll have a meeting later.

47
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,440
Meeting?

48
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,200
Who are you going to criticize?

49
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,560
It's not criticism.

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,880
It's saving.

51
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,680
I can't save him.

52
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,360
Let him move out.

53
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,000
What's wrong with him again?

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,960
Do you know

55
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,760
what is

56
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,800
a chicken that doesn't weigh 18 meters?

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,440
What's wrong with him?

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,960
Look at our memories.

59
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,680
Both of us expectation

60
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,880
didn't fit in.

61
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,360
So what's the use in him?

62
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,080
How about you?

63
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,640
Her luggage under him

64
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,960
is not解 απ anymore.

65
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:51,400
My good loss

66
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,400
I never sent ourized our region

67
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,640
my land.

68
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,240
I don't want to take advantage of it.

69
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,160
I don't want to take advantage of it.

70
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,040
I don't think he will sign the contract.

71
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,640
What should we do with the contract?

72
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,080
What should we do?

73
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,120
Tomorrow, we will drink with them.

74
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,040
Until we sign the contract.

75
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,080
Okay.

76
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480
I will change the contract tomorrow.

77
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,760
We will drink together.

78
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,760
Okay.

79
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,760
Okay.

80
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,440
That's the decision.

81
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,800
I don't believe that the contract won't be signed.

82
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,000
Su Shanqian.

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,640
You can't get back your company.

84
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,440
He...

85
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,840
He...

86
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,880
He is dead.

87
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,080
He is dead?

88
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,160
Men are not good.

89
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,840
Stinky men.

90
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,200
Stinky men.

91
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,480
Stinky men.

92
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,480
Stinky men.

93
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,240
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

94
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,120
Who?

95
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,400
Who?

96
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,600
Who?

97
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,720
Stinky men.

98
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,480
Stinky men.

99
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,520
Who is he?

100
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,000
Stinky men.

101
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,720
Stinky men.

102
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,960
Stinky men.

103
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,160
This is not our company.

104
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,760
Cai Wen.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,280
We are home.

106
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,120
Wait.

107
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,520
You go in first.

108
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,440
I will go in later.

109
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,280
Why?

110
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,200
We both drink.

111
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,280
I will explain.

112
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,120
Explain what?

113
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,480
I don't want them to know

114
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,200
I am drinking with my client.

115
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,560
You have to help me.

116
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,240
Okay.

117
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,720
Grandpa.

118
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,080
I am sorry.

119
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,800
I will go in first.

120
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,520
Go.

121
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,240
Su.

122
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,000
Come here.

123
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,680
Sister An.

124
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Why don't you sleep at night?

125
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,160
What are you doing there?

126
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,560
We are waiting for you to have a meeting.

127
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,080
Wait for me?

128
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,080
A meeting in the middle of the night?

129
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,560
How much do you drink?

130
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't know.

131
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,120
I don't know.

132
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,080
I don't know.

133
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,680
How much do you drink?

134
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,720
You can tell me.

135
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,080
I am sleepy.

136
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,600
I don't know.

137
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,720
I don't know.

138
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,880
I was also pulled by you.

139
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,880
You don't want to talk?

140
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,440
I will sleep.

141
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,160
Wait.

142
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,680
Su.

143
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,160
You go out every night.

144
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,040
Why do you come back at this time?

145
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,840
I go to work.

146
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,800
Where do you work at night?

147
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,960
Bar.

148
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,680
Is there any problem?

149
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,520
What do you do in the bar?

150
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,200
I sing in the bar.

151
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,560
I am drinking.

152
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,440
Shut up.

153
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,320
No problem.

154
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,080
What do you want to ask?

155
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,640
I will tell you the truth.

156
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,880
Are you a single?

157
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,880
A singer in a bar in Saudi Arabia?

158
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,280
Sister An, don't talk nonsense.

159
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,280
Sister An, I just sing.

160
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,360
It seems that you can't help but to show the evidence.

161
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,120
See for yourself.

162
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,040
See for yourself.

163
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,200
Su, if you really lack money,

164
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,840
tell us why you do this.

165
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,120
We are your big brother and sister when we go out.

166
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,640
You secretly take pictures of me.

167
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,400
You say you are my big sister.

168
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,800
You are invading my privacy.

169
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,360
She is too guilty.

170
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,280
Look, she is talking nonsense.

171
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,640
Sister An.

172
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,200
How can you talk like this?

173
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,800
Su Liya.

174
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,120
It's not true.

175
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,760
You don't believe me, do you?

176
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,080
Zheng, say something.

177
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,600
Su, you'd better run away.

178
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,200
No.

179
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,960
I don't agree.

180
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,200
Sister Su, you also drink.

181
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,360
Su Liya, I don't drink with my guests.

182
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,320
Sister Su, stop it.

183
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,040
Stop it.

184
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
It's none of your business.

185
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,680
Stop it.

186
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,560
It's none of your business.

187
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,760
You don't have to drink with me.

188
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,480
Actually, I drink with my guests.

189
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,640
Not Su Liya.

190
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,760
She is afraid that I drink too much and come to help.

191
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,800
You drink with her?

192
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,640
Sister Su, you are so weak.

193
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,000
I am not weak.

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,600
You are so weak.

195
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
It's not what you think.

196
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,960
Sister Su drinks with her guests.

197
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,960
It's a lie.

198
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,560
Su is so strong.

199
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,680
How can she drink with her guests?

200
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,800
I don't believe it.

201
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,800
Me, either.

202
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,560
Why do you believe it?

203
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,920
For the sake of life, what's wrong with it?

204
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,480
I have been in this city for so many years.

205
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
I don't even have a place to stand.

206
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,080
I am over thirty.

207
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,720
I am still a five-year-old.

208
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,840
My parents are getting older.

209
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,280
I am getting worse.

210
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,280
I have a younger brother in my hometown.

211
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,880
He needs money everywhere.

212
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,480
I just want to make more money.

213
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,240
What?

214
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,760
Drinking is not a big deal.

215
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,440
I can do anything.

216
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,080
It's hard to find a client like Sister Su.

217
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,920
I have to stay with her

218
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,520
to sign the contract.

219
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,080
I have been here and there for several times.

220
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,240
I even asked someone to change her drink into something else.

221
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,840
I know she is not that sad every time she drinks.

222
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,640
I know she is not that sad every time she drinks.

223
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,040
She is not that sad every time she drinks.

224
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,640
Then why didn't we see you when we went there?

225
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,240
You were alone in Saudi Arabia.

226
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,680
Sister An, we are not stupid.

227
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,280
It's a loss for us to drink alone.

228
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,400
This is the rule of Saudi Arabia.

229
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,080
It wants me to play in the bathroom.

230
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,240
I can't drink alone.

231
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,680
Why didn't you say so earlier?

232
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,280
I will help you.

233
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,040
It's not safe for you to drink alone.

234
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,880
Your family is worried.

235
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,080
Sister An, I am from the Meng family.

236
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,640
I drink with my dad every morning.

237
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,560
I always drink with him.

238
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,480
Then I go to work for him.

239
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,160
You can't even drink with me.

240
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,600
If you have to move out, I will move out as well.

241
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,680
You must stay, brother.

242
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,920
Everyone is no one allowed to move out.

243
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,600
Sister An is on the good side.

244
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,400
She is a mother and she can protect her child.

245
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,120
I understand.

246
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,640
Yeah, everyone is no one allowed to move out.

247
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,560
It was a misunderstanding.

248
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,080
A misunderstanding.

249
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,840
Then...

250
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,640
Let's go to bed early.

251
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
Let's go.

252
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
Let's go to bed.

253
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
If he knew

254
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,640
how you are now,

255
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,640
he would be very sad.

256
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
Let's go.

257
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
Let's go.

258
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,640
Let's go.

259
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:04,720
The most annoying person is not good at

260
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,640
the most annoying person is not good at

261
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
showing off, pretending to be a pharaoh

262
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
showing off, pretending to be a pharaoh

263
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
and making me die.

264
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,640
In the dark, the answer is found.

265
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,640
The suspicious person

266
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
walks far away.

267
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,640
The plot is turning, turning, turning.

268
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,640
The mystery is solved and appears.

269
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
The mystery is solved and appears.

270
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,640
Whose body temperature is it?

271
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,640
Whose finger is it?

272
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,640
Open the door to your heart

273
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,640
when the wind and rain are broken.

274
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,640
Whose eyes are it?

275
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,640
Whose hair is it?

276
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,640
The more I walk, the deeper I get.

277
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,640
The end is a blur.

278
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,640
I'm looking for no one.
