1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,880
watching at home

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Wake up

3
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,400
The process is so comfortable

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,400
The world is so big

5
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,400
Wake up

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,440
Wake up

7
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,680
Wake up

8
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,160
Who is it?

9
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,720
It's me, Chen Haoyu

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,680
What's up?

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,760
You just arrived

12
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,360
Do you need to buy something?

13
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm free today

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,840
I can take you to the nearby area

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,440
Okay

16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,080
We'll set off in an hour

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,240
Whoever comes to me first

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,960
must be a psycho

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,480
Chen Haoyu, 25 years old

20
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,440
A graduate of Information Engineering

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,800
I'll take you first

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,520
What do you need to buy?

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,560
There is a supermarket in the park

24
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,360
with a lot of people

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,440
Let's go there

26
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,480
Supermarket?

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,800
I don't need anything

28
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
Where are we going?

29
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,520
I heard from Zheng that you are a graduate

30
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,160
Yes

31
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,280
Can you take me to your school?

32
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,520
Maybe I want to go to your school too

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,320
Our school?

34
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,000
What?

35
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,840
Can't I?

36
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,080
No, no

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,160
What major do you want?

38
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,480
I don't know

39
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,040
You're going?

40
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,840
What else?

41
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,000
Drive

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,120
Your school is so big

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,080
This is our main classroom

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,120
Is this where you usually go to class?

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,320
Yes

46
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,280
I want to ask where the cafeteria is

47
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,480
I'll take you there

48
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,040
Sit down, I'll go buy

49
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:36,920
Okay

50
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,320
What is he going to do today?

51
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,720
I've put the card on the table

52
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,640
Can you lend me a brush?

53
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,160
Okay

54
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,400
I'll transfer it to you via WeChat

55
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,200
Thank you

56
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,800
Thank you

57
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,000
Thank you

58
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,000
I feel relieved

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,080
I'm so relieved

60
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,320
else what could bathroom be like?

61
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
Wow

62
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,040
what you found

63
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,560
You finally asked

64
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,200
Can you tell me

65
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,640
about the last tenant?

66
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,120
What you found in your room

67
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,680
is related to the last tenant?

68
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,000
Tell me about him first

69
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,920
The last tenant

70
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,040
was a Mongolian

71
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,040
He was very handsome

72
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,080
In my heart

73
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,320
he was a real man

74
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,720
Actually

75
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,160
he was a musician

76
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,760
He played the piano

77
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,680
he wrote songs

78
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,400
he sang

79
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,240
he taught me to write songs

80
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,960
You can write songs too?

81
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,960
I

82
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,680
I can't write well

83
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,280
Can you tell me

84
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,280
the songs you wrote?

85
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,080
Do you still want to write?

86
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,480
I stopped writing

87
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,360
since he left

88
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,800
I haven't written any more

89
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,240
Why did you stop writing?

90
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,360
Nothing

91
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
Why did he leave?

92
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,520
Nothing

93
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,320
Where did he go?

94
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,800
Enough, eat

95
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,080
I have class in the afternoon

96
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,320
You can go back by yourself later

97
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,040
Let's go

98
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,080
Let's go

99
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,600
Go along this path

100
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,560
There is a side door

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,080
It's closer from there

102
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:02,760
Okay

103
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,760
You haven't told me

104
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,160
what you found in your room

105
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,560
I'll tell you when it's time

106
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,200
When it's time?

107
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,240
Zhao, I failed

108
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,960
It's your turn

109
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,000
I didn't find out

110
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,160
Did he know Wu Wen?

111
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,440
What happened?

112
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,840
Have some fruit

113
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,440
I just picked it up, it's fresh

114
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,880
Thank you, Zheng

115
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,240
What's up?

116
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,840
Well

117
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,440
I just want to know

118
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,640
what you found

119
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
in your room

120
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,600
I want to ask

121
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,880
how the previous tenant left

122
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,600
Well

123
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,000
he left without thinking about living

124
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,680
But why are you also curious

125
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,280
what I found in the room?

126
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,680
I'm not curious

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,240
I just ask

128
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,400
I'll send you some fruit

129
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,040
Bye

130
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,960
Brother, I miss you

131
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,320
I will fulfill our promise

132
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,080
Chen Haoyu

133
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,840
Hello

134
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,720
Su Li

135
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,600
I need your help

136
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,600
What's up?

137
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,000
Can you keep it a secret for me?

138
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,800
It's a secret

139
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,560
Tell me

140
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,880
Can you come to the back road

141
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,720
and pick me up?

142
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,000
Back road?

143
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,480
What happened?

144
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,680
Come on

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,840
Just come to the back road

146
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,160
Keep it a secret

147
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,080
Don't tell anyone

148
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,160
What are you doing?

149
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,360
I have something urgent to do

150
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,400
Don't get lost

151
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,280
How can we go to the back road?

152
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,680
Zheng

153
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,160
How can we go to the back road?

154
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,440
Why are we going to the back road?

155
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,240
Don't ask

156
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240
Tell me

157
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,640
Turn right when you go out

158
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,960
Turn left when you see the traffic lights

159
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,200
Turn right when you see the spoked road

160
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,560
I'll take you there

161
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,360
No, no, no

162
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,760
Turn right when you go out

163
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,560
Then what?

164
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,720
Turn left when you see the traffic lights

165
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,960
Turn left when you see the traffic lights

166
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,200
Turn right when you see the spoked road

167
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,440
OK, OK

168
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,200
Bye

169
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,040
Be careful

170
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,440
OK

171
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,480
Three traffic lights

172
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,160
So many

173
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,720
How many traffic lights are there?

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,520
What kind of trick is this?

175
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,480
Stop recording

176
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,560
I'll take you there

177
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,800
Get in the car

178
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,720
But

179
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,800
OK, OK

180
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,240
Put on your helmet

181
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,760
OK

182
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,880
Let's go

183
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,200
Are you OK?

184
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,080
OK

185
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,440
I know the number

186
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,280
What's going on?

187
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,200
The epidemic

188
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,400
Hit someone's car

189
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,760
Is anyone all right?

190
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm fine

191
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,760
I'll deal with it

192
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,800
What's going on?

193
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,560
What did he do?

194
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,520
Didn't you say you wouldn't let anyone else know?

195
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,360
I don't want to either

196
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,800
But I really don't know the way

197
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,280
I really can't find it

198
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,560
Come on, you sign here

199
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,800
You can leave after signing

200
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,800
This delivery car

201
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,120
No matter how anxious you are, you can't wake up

202
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
How dangerous is this?

203
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,600
The car can't be here anymore

204
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
Go back and teach him a good lesson

205
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,360
Give him a hard time

206
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,400
OK, that's it

207
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,120
Delivery

208
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,240
Don't you have class this afternoon?

209
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,200
OK

210
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,200
Let's talk when we get back

211
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,240
OK

212
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,400
Don't hide it

213
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,360
I knew you were delivering food

214
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,600
Don't you have class this afternoon?

215
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
Why did you deliver food?

216
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,720
You didn't skip class, did you?

217
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,720
Actually, I quit school long ago.

218
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,520
Why?

219
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,520
Chen Ming wrote songs and delayed his studies.

220
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,320
He missed many classes.

221
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,120
So I quit school.

222
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,320
I don't want to be known by my parents.

223
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,520
I don't want you to know.

224
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,320
So I kept going.

225
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,720
But it's not a pity.

226
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,120
I don't want to go anyway.

227
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,720
You worked so hard to get into the exam.

228
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,320
You quit school for writing songs.

229
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,720
Why didn't you keep writing?

230
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,120
Why didn't you keep going?

231
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,520
Why didn't you keep going?

232
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Because he left.

233
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,480
He?

234
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
Who is he?

235
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,320
Is he the last tenant?

236
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,120
Chen.

237
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
You have let yourself down.

238
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,920
And let him down too.

239
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
I didn't.

240
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
Did you forget?

241
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
Did you forget how he helped you?

242
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,920
How he helped you find your dream?

243
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
I said I didn't!

244
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,920
It's because I couldn't forget him that I can't get married!

245
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Cheng Haoyu!

246
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,920
Cheng Haoyu!

247
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920

Cheng Haoyu!

254
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,920
Cheng Haoyu!

260
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Cheng Haoyu!

261
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
Cheng Haoyu!

262
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,920
Cheng Haoyu!

263
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,920
Cheng Haoyu!

264
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Cheng Haoyu!

265
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Cheng Haoyu!

266
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
Cheng Haoyu!

267
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
Cheng Haoyu!

268
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920

Cheng Haoyu!

276
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
Cheng Haoyu!

277
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920

278
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920

Cheng Haoyu!

288
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,420
Looking

289
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
Clouds are reaching

290
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,440
I feel I'm drinking now sober

291
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,080
Living, living

292
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,160
You're not speaking ever

293
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,120
Living, living

294
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,520
You're the conscious living

295
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,320
Look, I'm living you

296
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,920
You're born to live

297
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,820
Living, living

298
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,020
I'm living, the only

299
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,720
You Came

300
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:47,220
Beyond two
