00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Wake up

3
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,400
The process is so comfortable

4
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,320
The world is so perfect

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,360
Wake up

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,360
Wake up

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,720
Wake up

Special

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,240
Hey, Su

10
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,520
what's wrong with you again?

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
Sister, Su

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Miss Surya, please strictly follow the schedule.

13
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,600
Miss Susan, you drank so much yesterday. Does your head not hurt?

14
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Why did you get up so early today?

15
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,000
Miss Surya, my head doesn't hurt.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Please don't use the time I have to use the bathroom. I'll be late for work.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,600
Miss Susan, why are you so active at work?

18
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,000
You'll be fired today by the boss.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,800
Miss Surya, it's fine.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,600
Because I have more options.

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,800
They were so happy yesterday.

22
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,200
What's wrong with them?

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't know.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,600
Could it be that the world is in chaos again?

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,400
I don't know.

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,400
Old Zheng, what are you laughing at?

27
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,600
Look. Look. Look. Is it moving?

28
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,400
Old Zheng. Old Zheng. Old Zheng.

29
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,400
What's wrong?

30
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,800
What's that sound in the room?

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,800
What sound? Sound?

32
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,600
It seems to be a girl's voice.

33
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,800
Old Zheng, did something happen?

34
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,400
I heard it too.

35
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,800
It's a ghost. A ghost is a little ghost.

36
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Old Zheng, you're so rude. How can a ghost not tell us in advance?

37
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
What ghost?

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,400
That's Miss An's daughter.

39
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,800
Miss An is at work. She locked her in her room.

40
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,400
You scared me.

41
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Youyou, hello. I'm Sister Surya.

42
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,800
I brought you a lot of delicious food. Open the door.

43
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Open the door.

44
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,400
Youyou, I left the fruit at the door for you.

45
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Don't forget to take it.

46
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Let's go.

47
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,500
Okay.

48
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,000
Look.

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I can help you

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I want to go out

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Where do you want to go?

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I will take you there

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I won't agree

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You tell me first

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I will figure it out

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
As long as you are not locked in the room

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You can go anywhere

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Sister An and Qianfu

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Originally in the old home of Sichuan

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Opened a restaurant

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Originally lived happily

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Later, I have Youyou

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But Youyou just turned full moon

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Sister An found out

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Youyou's father

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And the waitress in the store

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Out of the ghost

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Men are not good things

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Day and night

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Eat in the pot in the shop

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Later

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Sister An divorced Youyou's father

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Live with Youyou alone

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Want to give Youyou a better life

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Choose to work outside alone

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Just put Youyou alone

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
In the old house

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Take care of the outside

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Only on vacation

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Can you come to her

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Stinky man

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Ignore the old brand

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Really selfish

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't know

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Sister An

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How many nights

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
A person quietly

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Cry in the room

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I hate this kind of

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
A young woman's new man

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This kind of man

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Should be celebrated

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The fire is choked by women's tears

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
A failed marriage

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Hit sister An very hard

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Sister An doesn't want to let Youyou suffer

97
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So live alone

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
For men

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's also far from the end

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Good man

101
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
How can it be so easy to find

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Why are you staring at me

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Are you a good man

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Of course I am a good man

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But he doesn't believe it

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Do you want him

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
To feel it

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What good and bad things do you have

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What is a good bad idea

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Old Zheng, come on

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Sister An

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's so late

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You just came back

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I have something to talk to you

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Talk to me

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
How about it

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't know

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What are you talking about

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You take Youyou for me

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yes

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You go to work in the day

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I happen to be at home today

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Nothing to do

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Can take care of Youyou for you

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
No no

127
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Sister An

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Put her alone in the room

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Too cruel

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What about the autism

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Autism

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's you don't understand Youyou

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Sister An

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Sister An

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The child should grow under the sun

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Accompanying friends

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Instead of spending all day in the room

138
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Brush mobile phone

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Brush that doesn't fit

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The age group

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The content to accept

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Slowly his heart will change

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That is getting less and less healthy

144
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Getting numb

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Will lose his sympathy

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And the three of us discussed

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Old Zheng is responsible for playing

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I am responsible for cooking

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Cheng Haoyu is responsible for tutoring

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Let me think about it

151
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
How about it

152
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Maybe

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm sorry

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm sorry

155
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm sorry

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm sorry

157
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm sorry

158
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm sorry

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm sorry

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm sorry

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm sorry

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm sorry

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm sorry

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You really can help me

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Take care of Youyou

166
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
This is what I gave Youyou

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Time table

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You have to follow

169
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,240
Anjie, you did a good job

170
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,160
Are you sure?

171
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,600
We can take good care of Youyou

172
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,600
Don't worry

173
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,600
It will be fine

174
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,920
No problem

175
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,200
I hope so

176
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,440
Is he doubting our ability?

177
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,600
We can't take care of a child

178
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,440
I took care of my daughter when she was young

179
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,480
I have experience

180
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,560
No problem

181
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
I have no problem either

182
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,800
Me, neither

183
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,480
So cute

184
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
Hello, sister

185
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,440
Hello, brother

186
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,280
Hello, uncle

187
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,440
Okay, okay, okay

188
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,560
Youyou

189
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,760
Today, uncle and brother and sister will accompany you

190
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,960
You must be good

191
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,320
Don't cause trouble to others

192
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,200
Understand?

193
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,760
I know, mom

194
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,680
You

195
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Can you really do that?
