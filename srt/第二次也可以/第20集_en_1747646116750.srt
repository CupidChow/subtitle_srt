00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
details in description

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Wake up

3
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,480
The process is too comfortable

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,320
To be the king of the world

5
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,360
Wake up

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,360
Wake up

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,360
Wake up

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Where is it?

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Chifeng

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What?

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Stop the car

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Stop the car

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Stop the car

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Stop the car

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hurry up

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What's wrong?

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Where is it?

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Captain Su

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Captain Su

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Are you sick?

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Take us to Chifeng while we are drunk

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What?

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Chifeng?

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What?

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I fell asleep in Chifeng

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Captain Su

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are kidnapping

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Kidnapping

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I didn't kidnap you

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You were drunk yesterday

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And you wanted to go out

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I will find your father as soon as I get the chance

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Be careful

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
My father

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We are coming

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Go

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's obvious that she is drunk

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How can she count how much she is drunk?

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Biao Xiao Tao, send me back

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Look

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The grassland is in front of us

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We are one step away

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Are you going to retreat?

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Now we have only two choices

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
One

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The grassland is in front of us

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We keep going

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Two

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Turn around

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let the rare courage become a regret

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I will go

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Wu Wen didn't say that

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
She is waiting for you in Chifeng

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Don't you want to see her?

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
How can you have this photo?

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Xiao Su

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Xiao Su

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
How do you know Wu Wen?

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Where is Wu Wen?

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You didn't ask me that day

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Did I know you long ago?

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I not only knew you

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I knew all of you

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Get in the car

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I will tell you the answer

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I will tell you the answer

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Su Di

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Where are we going?

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Didn't you tell them?

70
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,840
I did.

71
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,880
Su Di.

72
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,560
I'm not here to attend

73
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,760
the grassland music festival.

74
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,200
Tell me.

75
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,400
Where is Wu Wen?

76
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,880
Wu Wen?

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,480
He died half a year ago.

78
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,600
Don't you know?

79
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,400
He died?

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,920
He's gone?

81
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,680
What do you mean?

82
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,040
Su Di.

83
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,160
What do you mean?

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,080
What do you mean?

85
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,960
Two years ago,

86
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,520
Wu Wen suddenly came back from Beijing.

87
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,400
Brother.

88
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,360
You're back.

89
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,240
You're back.

90
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,440
I miss you so much.

91
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,240
Are you tired?

92
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,160
How long are you going to stay?

93
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,160
I'm leaving.

94
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,600
You're leaving?

95
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,960
That's great.

96
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,200
I'm tired.

97
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,880
I'm going to sleep.

98
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,560
He came back and changed.

99
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,240
He's not as cheerful as before.

100
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,800
He doesn't talk much.

101
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,680
He often sits on the grassland and gets lost.

102
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,600
He lost sleep all night.

103
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,800
Wu Wen told me

104
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,040
that he had depression.

105
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,960
I don't believe it.

106
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,160
Brother Wu Wen taught me to sing,

107
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,400
ride a horse,

108
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,360
and play the zither.

109
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,560
How could he get depression

110
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,880
when he was so lively?

111
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,600
So I need to figure it out.

112
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,760
I need to find out

113
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,360
how Wu Wen got depression.

114
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,480
I need to find out

115
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,880
how Wu Wen got depression.

116
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,920
What happened to him in Beijing?

117
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,600
Brother.

118
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,280
You're in love?

119
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,560
What's wrong with you?

120
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,720
What happened in Beijing?

121
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,440
Nothing.

122
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,960
Nothing?

123
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,920
Then why are you like this?

124
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,440
Because of him?

125
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,720
Give me the ring.

126
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,160
Because you're in love,

127
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,840
you might get into a fight.

128
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,040
Why are you like this?

129
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,840
I said no.

130
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,800
Give me the ring.

131
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,960
Give me the ring.

132
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,760
Then why do you

133
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,280
look at the ring every day?

134
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
Forget him.

135
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,640
Everything will be fine.

136
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,560
You're a coward.

137
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,160
You're a coward.

138
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,280
I was too naive at that time.

139
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,280
I didn't know Yuzheng.

140
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,840
I thought he was just hurt by his emotions.

141
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,320
I thought he would be fine after a few times.

142
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,040
He was ungraceful.

143
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,440
He wanted to

144
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,400
don't fire me.

145
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,200
I was clearaya,

146
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,760
so why can't you

147
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,840
just forget him?

148
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,280
Do you want to

149
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,960
go back to the hospital?

150
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,440
I think so.

151
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,600
That's why he still

152
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,960
matches withade in the stage.

153
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,360
This the reason.

154
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,280
.

155
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,760
never came back.

156
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,680
How could you just take her to the dugout?

157
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,040
Wu Wenrage wrote you a letter.

158
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,640
He said you would come to the prairie.

159
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,920
But you didn't come for a long time.

160
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,000
So,

161
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,520
you brought us to the prairie this time.

162
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,000
Yes.

163
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,080
No wonder you knew

164
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,120
there was a room in my house.

165
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,880
Wu Wen said

166
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,600
he owed you a prairie trip.

167
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,800
He owed you a concert.

168
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,560
After you finish your study,

169
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,600
you can rehearse

170
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,440
and sing at the music festival.

171
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,320
When you read this letter,

172
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,400
I think

173
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,840
you have come to the prairie together.

174
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,080
The prairie is beautiful, right?

175
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,760
It's really beautiful.

176
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,000
It makes you forget your worries,

177
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,920
your sorrows,

178
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,320
and all the unhappiness.

179
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,000
But I

180
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,040
forgot my happiness.

181
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,440
I don't know when

182
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,480
I will be able to

183
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,400
forget my sorrows

184
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,600
and forget my happiness.

185
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,680
I will be like a black dog

186
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,080
swallowing my heart.

187
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,440
I will be unhappy.

188
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,120
Even if I try to

189
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,520
remember the happy things

190
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,880
and pretend to be happy,

191
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,360
I can't do it anymore.

192
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,880
I'm afraid.

193
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,120
I'm afraid I will lose myself

194
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,320
and lose you.

195
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,760
I'm even more afraid of hurting you

196
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,400
and hurting you.

197
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,680
Su San,

198
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,120
you should hold this letter.

199
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,520
I really miss you.

200
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,480
I can't help but think about

201
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,840
our little things.

202
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,360
But I'm afraid.

203
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,320
I'm afraid we don't have a future.

204
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,160
I'm afraid I can't give you happiness.

205
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,520
I'm even more afraid

206
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,640
of hurting you.

207
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,640
I think

208
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
I'm nothing.

209
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
I don't know anything.

210
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,160
I don't know why

211
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,560
I can't get rid of

212
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,600
this feeling of regret.

213
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,600
I've tried to laugh.

214
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,480
I've tried to

215
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,720
exhaust myself.

216
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,560
I've tried to

217
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,080
cry like a child.

218
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,360
But I found

219
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,560
that kind of empty feeling

220
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
is like a person

221
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,880
who is constantly swallowing me.

222
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,920
I'm sorry.

223
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,960
I don't know what to say

224
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,280
except sorry.

225
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,120
Zheng,

226
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,320
An,

227
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,280
Haoyu,

228
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,560
and Youyou.

229
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,360
You're all by her side, right?

230
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,280
Am I weak?

231
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,640
Zheng,

232
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,840
are you still playing the piano?

233
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,960
Have you found your love?

234
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,640
An,

235
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,680
have you brought Youyou here?

236
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,480
Haoyu,

237
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,400
have you written the song well?

238
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,160
I...

239
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:04,960
I...

240
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,400
I seem to be too nagging.

241
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,840
I'm sorry.

242
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,960
Can you help me

243
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,560
take care of her?

244
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,040
Bravo...

245
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,040
Bravo...

246
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,000
and make it Starless.

247
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,760
Bravo...

248
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,920
Are you still here?

249
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,400
I shouldn't have let him leave alone.

250
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,400
I should have been with him all the time.

251
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Don't blame yourself.

252
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
You're not wrong.

253
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
No one is wrong.

254
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,400
It's the illness that torments him.

255
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
It's depression that torments him.

256
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Sister Su San.

257
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Actually, I always knew you didn't have a boyfriend.

258
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
You're waiting for Wu Wen, right?

259
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Can I wait for him?

260
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,400
I don't know.

261
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
But I want to tell you.

262
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:05,400
This ring is not a lock, but a blessing.

263
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:37,400
I want you to hug me in the world.

264
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:45,400
This is the most I want in my life.

265
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:52,400
I want to drown in my love.

266
00:18:52,400 --> 00:19:00,400
I'm lost in the moment when the sea surface is clear.

267
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:08,400
I was in the mountains and rivers for three days and three nights.

268
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:15,400
But I never knew where you were.

269
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:23,400
I'm afraid I can't sleep at night.

270
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,400
I still have something to tell you in my dreams.

271
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,400
The crowd is full of the mischief of the night.

272
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Loneliness in the dark night.

273
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,400
I'm afraid I can't sleep at night.

274
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,400
I'm afraid I can't sleep at night.

275
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,400
I'm afraid I can't sleep at night.

276
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,400
I'm afraid I can't sleep at night.

277
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,400
I'm afraid I can't sleep at night.

278
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,400
I'm afraid I can't sleep at night.

279
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,400
I'm afraid I can't sleep at night.
