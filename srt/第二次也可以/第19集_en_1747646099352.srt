1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
I'm not there

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,160
All the warm grass

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,640
Wake up, wake up, wake up

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,720
I open the window

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,600
The night that grows in time

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,800
Wake up, wake up, wake up

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Episode 10

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,280
Is this Mr. Su's house?

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,800
Coming, coming, coming

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,800
What's going on?

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,800
Is this Mr. Su's house?

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,760
Yes

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,120
Please sign here

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,280
Su's house?

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,080
Sir, just put it in the living room

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,560
Yes, yes, yes, just put it here

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,280
Thank you, sir

18
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,160
Lao Zhao

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,720
You bought it new?

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,080
Yes, I bought it new

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,120
But I didn't buy it

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,640
It was bought by Mr. Su

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,400
Mr. Su

24
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,700
Hum

25
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,040
The sofa you bought new arrives

26
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,720
Didn't you move away after marriage?

27
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,200
Why are you on the sofa?

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,880
I sent the wrong address.

29
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,000
Liar.

30
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,600
You're all liars.

31
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,720
Su Diya is a liar.

32
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,800
You're a liar too.

33
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,080
You're back.

34
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,840
Let's have dinner together.

35
00:02:44,840 --> 00:03:06,280
Sure.

36
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,400
Thank you for the support

37
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,960
since we came to Beijing.

38
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,880
Because of my ignorance, I've caused you a lot of trouble.

39
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,400
Thank you for your tolerance. I'll drink to my heart's content.

40
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,080
Hey, Xiaoduo, you're taking us out to eat.

41
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,840
Why are you drinking with us?

42
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,920
I'm a girl. It's not convenient for me these days.

43
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,040
Then, what do you need to drink?

44
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,400
Here.

45
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,240
Here. Here. Here.

46
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,680
Cheers. Cheers.

47
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,320
Here. Here.

48
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,560
Old Zheng, I want to toast you for the first time.

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,520
Since I came to Beijing, you've been like a big brother.

50
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,440
You've been caring and taking care of me.

51
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,600
Thank you, Old Zheng.

52
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,200
We're from the same family. We don't need to be so polite.

53
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,480
Chen Heyu, why aren't you paying?

54
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,080
kelp this

55
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,040
in the future

56
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,100
Feel free

57
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,680
Don't worry

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,760
I'll do it

59
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,680
Wait a minute

60
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,920
Get a cup of your favorite coffee

61
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,860
The second cup

62
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,940
I want to see sister An

63
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,600
Me?

64
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,040
I haven't been

65
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,840
And

66
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,220
I am also suspecting that you are

67
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,720
Xiaosu

68
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:39,540
Sorry

69
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,760
Be careful

70
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,660
Sister An

71
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,460
What are you talking about? I'm embarrassed to say it.

72
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,860
Old Zheng, you're not going to drink with me?

73
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,860
I'll drink with you.

74
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,460
Third glass. I want to toast Sister Susan.

75
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,260
Cheers.

76
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,660
I hope you can find your happiness soon.

77
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,260
Cheers.

78
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,660
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,860
Chen Haoyu, fourth glass. I want to toast you.

80
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,860
Why are you so dry? Xiaosu hasn't even started talking.

81
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,260
She's not talking yet.

82
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,260
Are you leaving?

83
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,060
I'm leaving.

84
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,060
Where's the band you said you were going to?

85
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,660
Where's the album you said you were going to release?

86
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,260
Who said we weren't going to form a band?

87
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,460
Of course we want to get married.

88
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,060
You're leaving? What album are you releasing?

89
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,860
If I'm leaving, I'll take you with me.

90
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,260
Really?

91
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,460
Chen Haoyu, do you want to form a band with Surya

92
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,060
or do you want to be with Surya?

93
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,660
Both.

94
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,260
You're thinking too much.

95
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,260
I can't even think about it.

96
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,460
There are some ideas that can be thought of,

97
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,860
but there are some that must be left in the shake.

98
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,460
Cheers.

99
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,060
Cheers.

100
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,860
The last glass. I want to toast our little beauty, Youyou.

101
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,460
I hope Youyou will become more and more beautiful.

102
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,260
Sister, when I grow up, can I go to the prairie to find you?

103
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,260
You don't have to wait until you grow up.

104
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,860
Cheers.

105
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,660
Cheers.

106
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,460
Everyone, hurry and eat.

107
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,860
Xiaosu is leaving.

108
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,260
Let's have a drink together.

109
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,860
Let's have a drink together.

110
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,660
Cheers.

111
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,460
Youyou

112
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,460
Youyou

113
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,460
Youyou

114
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,460
The day I've decided

115
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,260
is the day

116
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,860
when I can experience it,

117
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,260
I can feel it,

118
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:07,260
I can have no regrets.

119
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,460
Actually, Xiaosu didn't lie to us.

120
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,460
What did Old Zheng say?

121
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:22,660
He said that Surya didn't lie to us.

122
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,260
Impossible. I went to the bar myself.

123
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,860
I was just pretending. The boss said it.

124
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,660
I was just pretending.

125
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,860
The music festival Xiaosu said is real.

126
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,860
Our Nihong Shanshou band

127
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,060
was also requested.

128
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,060
Is it real?

129
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,060
It's real.

130
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,260
We called and confirmed it.

131
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,860
He didn't lie to us.

132
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,260
Can we go to the prairie?

133
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,260
To the prairie.

134
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,260
I'm not going.

135
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,260
I'm not going.

136
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,860
I'm getting married.

137
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,060
I don't have time.

138
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,060
Then we won't have a chance to go to the prairie together.

139
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,860
It's so far away.

140
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,860
Ten yuan.

141
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,860
I bought the green ginseng we wanted.

142
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,860
I bought it.

143
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,860
I bought it.

144
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,860
Sister Susan, be careful. Don't fall.

145
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,660
Come back.

146
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,060
You fell.

147
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,060
Come back.

148
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,460
I won't come back.

149
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,860
I won't.

150
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,460
Did you drink too much?

151
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,860
No.

152
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,060
Drink.

153
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,060
We can drink. Cheers.

154
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,260
Drink.

155
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,660
Drink.

156
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,660
Cheers.

157
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,060
We can drink.

158
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,260
I didn't drink much.

159
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,260
Do you want to go for a walk?

160
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,660
We can drive.

161
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,060
Drive and take Youyou to the prairie.

162
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,860
Let's go for a walk.

163
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,060
Let's go for a walk.

164
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,060
Let's go for a walk.

165
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,060
Yes.

166
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,460
Your car.

167
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,660
My car can drive.

168
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,660
It's a bit broken. What's wrong?

169
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,860
Drink.

170
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,860
Youyou.

171
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,060
Take Youyou to the prairie.

172
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,260
Let's go for a walk.

173
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,260
Let's go for a walk.

174
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,460
Where?

175
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,460
Where?

176
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,060
To the prairie.

177
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,660
Let's go.

178
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,660
We're coming.

179
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,660
To the prairie.

180
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,060
Let's go.

181
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,260
Let's go.

182
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,660
I'm nervous.

183
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,860
I'll take me.

184
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,060
None of you can wait for me.

185
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,460
Let's go.

186
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,260
Wait for me.

187
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,460
Let's go for a walk.

188
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,260
I walked around the house.

189
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:02,260
I hid in the crowd.

190
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:08,260
The people in the crowd were wearing their clothes.

191
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:13,260
They were busy on the stage.

192
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:19,260
I locked myself in a little house.

193
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:24,260
I was alone and happy.

194
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:29,260
I was confused and confused.

195
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:35,260
I was used to being satisfied.

196
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:43,260
The life I want is not the life of others.

197
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,260
I'm easily controlled by others.

198
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,260
The days I decide

199
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,260
don't care about what others think.

200
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,260
What I want is

201
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:05,260
the life I want.

202
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,260
I'm not ashamed.

203
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,260
I don't care about others.

204
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,260
The days I decide

205
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,260
as long as I can understand

206
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,260
I can feel it.

207
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,260
I can feel it.

208
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,260
I'm not ashamed.

209
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,260
I don't care about others.

210
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,260
I'm not ashamed.

211
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,260
I'm not ashamed.

212
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,260
I'm not ashamed.

213
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,260
I'm not ashamed.

214
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,260
I'm not ashamed.

215
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,260
I'm not ashamed.

216
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,260
I'm not ashamed.

217
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,260
I'm not ashamed.

218
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,260
I'm not ashamed.

219
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,260
I'm not ashamed.

220
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,260
I'm not ashamed.

221
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:38,260
I'm not ashamed.

222
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,260
