1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Wake up

2
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,480
The process is too comfortable

3
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,400
To be the king of the world

4
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,360
Wake up

5
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,360
Wake up

6
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,360
Wake up

7
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,580
Be the king!

8
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:11,580
介

9
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:23,480
��

10
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:23,840
The van is open

11
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,680
when new 굉장히

12
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,340
¿No?

13
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,060
But it's red

14
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,120
Will someone

15
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,760
I'm so nervous.

16
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,720
Don't be nervous.

17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,040
Let's just practice as usual.

18
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,760
Come on.

19
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,880
One, two, three.

20
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,920
Come on.

21
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,160
No, I need some more water.

22
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,200
Brother.

23
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,120
I need to go to the toilet.

24
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,280
Hurry up.

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,160
I want to go, too.

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,360
How many times?

27
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,560
Once.

28
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,120
Twice.

29
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,960
Why are you so nervous?

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
What's wrong?

31
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,640
Let's just practice as usual.

32
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,800
Relax.

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,360
It's okay.

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,000
No problem.

35
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,040
Mom, you have to cheer up.

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,360
Youyou.

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,240
Mom, I'll watch you from the stage.

38
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,400
Come on.

39
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:26,880
Come on.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,600
Come on.

41
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,840
Come on.

42
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,040
Come on.

43
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,880
Come on.

44
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,720
Come on.

45
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,640
Come on.

46
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,320
Come on.

47
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
So what?

48
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,640
Even if you're full of love,

49
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,640
you can't escape from the fate of the earth.

50
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,040
Are you happy?

51
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
So what?

52
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,040
Even if you're full of love,

53
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,040
you can't escape from the fate of the earth.

54
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,440
Are you happy?

55
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,040
Even if you're full of love,

56
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,040
the one you love is not by your side.

57
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,440
Are you disappointed?

58
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,040
The one who is happy will be the last one to blame.

59
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
Are you happy?

60
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,040
The one who is sad will be the last one to blame.

61
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Are you happy?

62
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,040
Of course.

63
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,040
I will be the last one to blame.

64
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,040
I will be the last one to blame.

65
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,040
You can't change.

66
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,040
So you never change.

67
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,040
You can't change.

68
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,040
So you never change.

69
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,040
You can't change.

70
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,040
So you never change.

71
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,040
Why?

72
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,040
Or I will never change?

73
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
It's not up to you.

74
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:26,040
Do you want to change?

75
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,040
If you want to change,

76
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,040
if not,

77
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,040
why are you still here?

78
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,040
There is a bottom line of determination and compromise

79
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,040
You forget your hate

80
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,040
The mess is like a full-fledged bakery

81
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Unchangeable

82
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,040
So you never see

83
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:44,040
Don't be afraid

84
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Zheng, An

85
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
You must call me when you get married

86
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,040
I will inform you

87
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
You will be our witness

88
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,040
Sister, when can I see you again?

89
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,040
If you miss me

90
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,040
You can play with me, okay?

91
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,040
Sister Susan, don't be so rude

92
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
We are all your family

93
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
Remember to come back and see us anytime

94
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Sulia

95
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Are you really not going back with us?

96
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,040
No

97
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
I will go to see you

98
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,040
If you miss me

99
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,040
You can come to me anytime

100
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
Baoyuan is our home

101
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,040
And it's your home

102
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,040
Welcome to come anytime

103
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
Okay

104
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,040
Youyou, get off

105
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
I'm leaving

106
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
Take care

107
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Be careful on the road

108
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
Bye

109
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,040
Sulia

110
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,040
Sulia, come to Beijing

111
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
Come to us

112
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
Goodbye

113
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
Goodbye

114
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Bye

115
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,040
Bye

116
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,040
Goodbye

117
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
Chang Xiaoyu, what's wrong?

118
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
Nothing

119
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Are you not happy to see Sulia and Baoyuan together?

120
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Sulia and Baoyuan grew up together

121
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
They are childhood friends

122
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
What's wrong with you?

123
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Who said that?

124
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,040
I just think they are not suitable

125
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,040
I think they are a good match, right?

126
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,040
Sister

127
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,040
Chen, listen to me

128
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Give up

129
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
You go back to Beijing

130
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
Xiaosu is in the prairie

131
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
How can they be together?

132
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,040
Are you going to stay in the prairie?

133
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,040
Why not?

134
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,040
This matter is all done

135
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,040
Our band should be rehearsed

136
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,040
There is one more thing

137
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,040
What?

138
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
I'm back

139
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
I'm back

140
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,040
Sorry to bother you

141
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,040
I've decided

142
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,040
I'm not going

143
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,040
Not going?

144
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,040
Yes

145
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,040
You said this is our home, right?

146
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,040
I'm back

147
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,040
I'm back

I'm back

200
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
I'm back

201
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
I'm back

202
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,040
I'm back

203
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
I'm back

204
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,040
I'm back

205
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
I'm back

206
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
I'm back

207
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
I'm back

208
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
I'm back

209
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
I'm back

210
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
I'm back

211
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
I'm back

212
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
I'm back

213
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,040
I'm back

214
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
All right

215
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,220
Please

216
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,860
The recalls of those two

217
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
granny

218
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,720
Once at an event

219
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,720
I'm living in the office

220
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,720
I'm still dreaming

221
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,720
That brilliant starry sky

222
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,720
The fireworks are re-emitting

223
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,720
I'm still dreaming

224
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Please give me strength

225
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,720
To make everything shine

226
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,720
I can't remember how many times I slept in the night and was in a mess

227
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,720
How many times I tried to persuade myself to stop, but I just couldn't

228
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,720
I can't even count how many times my friends broke up with me

229
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,720
I can only tell myself that it doesn't matter, I've been around

230
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,720
Now, life and death are slowly changing

231
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,720
I'm not thinking about whether you're right or wrong in life

232
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,720
But there's still a voice telling me not to comfort myself

233
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Don't lie to yourself, be who you belong to

234
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,720
The outside world is big, I never get lost

235
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,720
Because I'm still determined, still not giving up

236
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,720
If you think of me, the young me

237
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Don't worry, you'll always be the familiar me

238
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,720
I know you're looking forward to me, so what if I'm not

239
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,720
Seeing those boys dancing and singing

240
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
If you still remember those moments

241
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,720
Don't worry, you'll always see

242
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,720
I'll treasure all the brothers who helped me before I die

243
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,720
I'll treasure all the brothers who helped me before I die

244
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,720
What color to play, what car to drive, what kind of building is not mine

245
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,720
What song to sing, what fire, what kind of wonderful is my choice

246
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,720
When will the light on this stage light up for me

247
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,720
When I'm young, my bright dreams will shine on me

248
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,720
I'll remember every time I walked

249
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Every step that I took, I'll never forget

250
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
In fact, I haven't changed much in the past few years

251
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Facing my dreams, I'm still full of blood

252
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,720
I'm always deliberately looking at what the outside world proves

253
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,720
If this continues, I will lose my right to be myself

254
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,720
I'm sorry, dad, mom, I know you're doing this for my own good

255
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
But time is also making me get older and older

256
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,720
I want to pursue the ideal place in my life

257
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,720
I want to become a seed and hope that the light will shine together

258
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,720
Go forward, I hope all run to the end of my brain

259
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,720
My life is always on the road

260
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Go forward, it's hard to go to the end with me

261
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Then get that unique memory

262
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,720
Go forward, I hope all run to the end of my brain

263
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,720
My life is always on the road

264
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,720
Go forward, it's hard to go to the end with me

265
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,720
My life is always on the road

266
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,720

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,720
Open the door to your heart that has been closed for a long time

268
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,720
Whose eyes are spinning, whose turn is it

269
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,720
The road is narrow, making me go deeper and deeper

270
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,720
The blurry will of the camera, looking for no grace
