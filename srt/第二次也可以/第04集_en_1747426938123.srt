00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,280
Beauty dad-ness finally?

3
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,180
I'm not grateful

4
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,380

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,160
Have you already talked to the bros?

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,700
Yes, we have.

11
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,800
How did you make it?

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,840
If you're ready

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,160
Go set off.

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm here.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,920
An Nian, hurry up.

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,880
Coming.

17
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,600
Coming.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,600
Zheng, hurry up.

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,560
Coming.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,640
Su,

21
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,560
where are we going today?

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,320
You'll know when we get there.

23
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,560
Where's Su San?

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,440
He's afraid to go.

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,520
Su San,

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,400
hurry up.

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,440
We're almost there.

28
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,800
Su,

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,120
where are we going?

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,960
You'll know when we get there.

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,760
Hurry up.

32
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
You don't tell me where we're going.

33
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,160
I'm not going anywhere.

34
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,680
Su, just tell them.

35
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,720
Let's go to the rehearsal room.

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,680
Go to rehearsal.

37
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,680
What rehearsal?

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,200
Didn't you tell them about

39
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,400
An Nian?

40
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,120
I did.

41
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,320
What are you waiting for?

42
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,880
The music festival is in three days.

43
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,960
Su,

44
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,240
I'm not here

45
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,520
for the grassland music festival.

46
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,360
Tell me,

47
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,600
where's Wu Wen?

48
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,120
Wu Wen?

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,680
He died half a year ago.

50
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,840
Don't you know?

51
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,560
He died?

52
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,720
He died?

53
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,440
He died?

54
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,840
He's gone?

55
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,760
What does it mean?

56
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,120
Su Li,

57
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,200
what does it mean?

58
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
What does it mean?

59
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,680
What does it mean?

60
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,280
I've put the things you sent

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,520
in your room.

62
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,480
This is the place you lived?

63
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,640
The Russian turtle.

64
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,720
You're in a hurry today.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,880
I'll go in.

66
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,240
There's someone inside.

67
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,800
Someone?

68
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,760
Is it a newcomer?

69
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,560
Doesn't he know the words?

70
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,280
You can't see the time clearly.

71
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,200
Didn't Zheng tell him?

72
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,880
Zheng!

73
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,360
Zheng!

74
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,200
Zheng!

75
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,800
He's sleeping.

76
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,320
What's wrong with the new guest?

77
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,080
The order of use in the bathroom

78
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,160
has been assigned.

79
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,040
Didn't you tell him?

80
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,920
I did.

81
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,000
I gave him a contract.

82
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,160
Did he do it on purpose?

83
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,360
Don't think so bad

84
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,960
when you come upstairs.

85
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,840
You're disturbing me.

86
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,880
I'll pay the rent

87
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,640
if I'm late.

88
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,280
No.

89
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,120
Listen,

90
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,800
drive my car later.

91
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,640
This house will be ruined sooner or later.

92
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,920
Let's wait and see.

93
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,880
Did you make it clear to him?

94
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,520
Did I?

95
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,760
You don't want to be good people.

96
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,960
Just wait and see.

97
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,320
Sister Qi San,

98
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,400
it's not necessary.

99
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,640
We're all neighbors.

100
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,720
Xiao Chen.

101
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,120
Zheng.

102
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,040
How can they

103
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,280
use up all the hot water?

104
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,440
Calm down.

105
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,680
I'll give you a good lesson today.

106
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,400
Calm down.

107
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,200
I'll tell them today,

108
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,800
especially the new guest.

109
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,680
You're too much.

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,720
You're up.

111
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,160
You're up early.

112
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,240
Xiao Chen, are you a langola?

113
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,240
Are you sick?

114
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,640
Yes.

115
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,600
Sister An,

116
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,960
the new guest is here.

117
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,160
I know.

118
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,800
He

119
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,320
gave me a gift.

120
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,160
He's so sweet.

121
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,760
Su San is so angry

122
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,000
by his kindness.

123
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,480
I've told my mom that

124
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,760
Su San has more rules.

125
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,800
It's a bit difficult for me to obey.

126
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,680
I can't blame him for the new guest.

127
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,240
Rules are used to obey.

128
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:05,880
Otherwise,

129
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,120
the house will be ruined.

130
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,080
I'll be late for work.

131
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,800
Zheng,

132
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,440
you have to tell him

133
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,120
the rules of this house.

134
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,760
Tell him.

135
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,960
Tell him tonight.

136
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,360
Because he's wrong in the morning,

137
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,520
I'll tell him.

138
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,320
Xiao Chen,

139
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,120
look at you.

140
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,160
You're a young man.

141
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,440
It's not your business.

142
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,600
Right.

143
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,880
You're young.

144
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,920
You're a man of fire.

145
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,280
Can you forget Sister An?

146
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,240
Well,

147
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,240
I'm a cook.

148
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,480
I'm not a man of fire.

149
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,400
I'm a man of temper.

150
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,160
But I'm a man of...

151
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,360
I've got the wrong lamb.

152
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,800
Don't move.

153
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,600
Su San,

154
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,000
aren't you in a hurry to go to work?

155
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,040
I can't.

156
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,320
Everyone is calm.

157
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,280
Who goes first?

158
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,200
Me.

159
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,120
I'll go second.

160
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,560
Okay.

161
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,920
I'll tell him

162
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,880
the rules of the house.

163
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,760
I'll tell him.

164
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,400
Hello.

165
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,040
May I open the door?

166
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,880
Come in.

167
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,600
If you don't open the door,

168
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
we'll kick you out.

169
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,320
One.

170
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,600
Two.

171
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,320
Hello, sister.

172
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,440
I'm Su Diya.

173
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,040
I didn't see you yesterday.

174
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,480
Did you get the special?

175
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,480
Do you like it?

176
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,520
You're good.

177
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,600
You're good.

178
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,160
The special is delicious.

179
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,400
Thank you.

180
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,240
I have to tell you

181
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,280
about this morning.

182
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,120
Thank you for lending me a towel this morning.

183
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,560
You're so nice.

184
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,640
I'll buy you a new one later.

185
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,480
It's okay.

186
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,560
I can use it.

187
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,800
I'm a newcomer.

188
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,200
I have an trucks loader.

189
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,520
I do everything I need

190
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,480
fancy clothes,

191
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,480
even nossos,

192
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,920
even hoodies.

193
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,120
You're just a hair stylist.

194
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,720
This is how your work gets done.

195
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,960
I don't know.

196
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,040
How can I help?

197
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,160
You're a hair Blower.

198
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,440
I'm working as a hairdresser.

199
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,840
We're so published.

200
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,200
We hope to be popular.

201
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,480
Flowers

202
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,960
praying at the back.

203
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,320
My boss asked me to be dressed like aafoo.

204
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
We'll have a meeting in the living room later.

205
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
What meeting?

206
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
The first-year rent-a-hose meeting.

207
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,320
Oh, I'll be right there.

208
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,320
Who is the real President Fang?

209
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,320
Brother, I saw them.

210
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,320
I told them they would come to me.

211
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Didn't we agree not to rent the room

212
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
and wait for him to come back?

213
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,320
It's been two years.

214
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
I can't afford to lose money.

215
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
What if he comes back?

216
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Let's talk about it when he comes back.

217
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Then let's kick him out.

218
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
How could we kick him out?

219
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Let's go.

220
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Sit.

221
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,320
Sit here.

222
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Zheng said the rules have been given to you.

223
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
You didn't receive the police.

224
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
I gave you another one.

225
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
I received it.

226
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,320
Then why didn't you obey?

227
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,320
The rules are just to break them.

228
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,320
Okay.

229
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Then let's talk about

230
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
the order of use in the bathroom in the morning.

231
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
Why am I the last one?

232
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Because I'm new?

233
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
What do you want?

234
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
The last tenant is also the last one?

235
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,320
Isn't this important?

236
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Of course it's important.

237
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
Maybe he can't stand you

238
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
to bully him and bully him away.

239
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
I'm out here.

240
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
I have to be careful.

241
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
What are you talking about?

242
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
We're good friends.

243
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
How could it be possible?

244
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Very good.

245
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
That's right.

246
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
I found something in the room.

247
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
It seems to be different from what you said.

248
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
What is it?

249
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
Okay.

250
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,320
That's all for today.

251
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Go to work and go to school.

252
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Dismiss.

253
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
What did you find?

254
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
Don't forget.

255
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
Shouldn't you be the one who wants to know?

256
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
He's just trying to trick us.

257
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,320
He wants to take us back.

258
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,320
How do you know?

259
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
If he really found something.

260
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
I'm sorry.

261
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
I'm sorry.

262
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,320
I'm sorry.

263
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
I'm sorry.

264
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
I'm sorry.

265
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
I'm sorry.

266
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
I'm sorry.

267
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,320
I'm sorry.

268
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,320
I'm sorry.

269
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
I'm sorry.

270
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,320
I'm sorry.

271
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,320
I'm sorry.

272
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
I'm sorry.

273
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
I'm sorry.

274
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320

I'm sorry.

277
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
I'm sorry.

278
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,320
I'm sorry.

279
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,320
I'm sorry.

280
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
I'm sorry.

281
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
I'm sorry.

282
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
I'm sorry.

283
