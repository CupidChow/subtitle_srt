1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,020
XIN cheek

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Wake up

3
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,480
The process is too easy

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,400
Take the time to grow up

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,400
Wake up

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,400
Wake up

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
Wake up

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Dad

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,200
Son

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,600
How is your life?

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
Are you used to it?

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
OK

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Dad

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What's up?

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Nothing

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Today, all three of your aunts

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Come to eat at home

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I heard you got into financial college

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
They are all happy for you

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Dad is really proud

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What did dad say?

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You have to learn financial

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Do you have to go out to learn financial?

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What kind of music did you take before?

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What can you do in the future?

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Dad

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What else?

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If there is nothing

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I hang up now

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I have to go to the library

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
OK OK OK

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Son, you read it carefully

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You have to learn it

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Grow up

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Grow up

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
One more

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You are drunk, mom

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sister An

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You are the best

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You are the best

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Why do you drink so much?

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I am in a bad mood

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Dad

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Are you OK?

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I am OK

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Slow down

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Slow down

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How old are you?

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Take care of your health

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Take care of your health

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Take care of your health

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
How is it?

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I just fell asleep after a long night

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
How much did Xiao Chen drink yesterday?

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Not much

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Just four or five bottles

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Four or five bottles

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He shouldn't

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes, he drank less than me

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I have been tossing and turning all night

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll sleep for a while

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Don't look

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You are in the room

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh my god

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why is there no sound when you walk?

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You scared me

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You are not guilty

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What are you afraid of?

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Are you free?

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Why do you keep staring at me?

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Boring

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You came from the inner prison

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What are you doing?

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You guess

75
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I am too lazy to guess

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I can't guess

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I am too lazy to guess

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I am too lazy to guess

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I am too lazy to guess

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I am too lazy to guess

81
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I am too lazy to guess

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Teacher

83
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Can you tell me

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
the story of Chen Haoyu and Wu Wen?

85
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Wu Wen

86
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
How do you know about Wu Wen?

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Chen Haoyu told me

88
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What did he tell you?

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He didn't say anything

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He said

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Wu Wen is handsome

92
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Wu Wen is a musician

93
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and he always teaches him to write and sing

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Do you want to know more?

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What else do you want to know?

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I want to know

97
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
what happened between them

98
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What do you want to do?

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Maybe I can help Chen Haoyu

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's been a long time

101
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
since anyone came here

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This used to be

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Wu Wen's studio

104
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's where he worked

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
To be precise

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Wu Wen is a musician

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He created a lot of songs here

108
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What's wrong?

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you okay?

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Why did he leave?

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I told you

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
He left without saying goodbye

113
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What about Chen Haoyu?

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What happened between them?

115
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Chen Haoyu

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
was brought back by Wu Wen

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He was picked up

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Picked up?

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He was picked up

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He was picked up

121
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
by Wu Wen

122
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Picked up?

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes

124
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
When Chen Haoyu was in college

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
he always sang on the underground tunnel

126
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Wu Wen met him several times

127
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and found he had no place to live

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
so he brought him back

129
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Slowly

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Wu Wen found Chen Haoyu

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
was talented in music

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
so he taught him to write songs

133
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
sing and compose

134
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
At that time

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
we knew

136
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Chen Haoyu wanted to study music

137
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
but his family didn't allow him

138
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Later

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Chen Haoyu wrote some songs

140
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Although it wasn't that good

141
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
it was much better

142
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
than the current songs

143
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Since Wu Wen left

144
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
he became confused

145
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I knew he wouldn't go to school

146
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
but I didn't expose him

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I knew you wouldn't say it

148
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I didn't know what to say

149
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
what to say

150
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What if I made him angry again?

151
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Right?

152
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
After Wu Wen left

153
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Chen Haoyu stopped playing the piano

154
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and singing

155
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and writing songs

156
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I knew it

157
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I knew it

158
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I knew it

159
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I knew it

160
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I knew it

161
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You stopped writing songs?

162
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Zheng

163
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Can I come here often?

164
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You can come during the day

165
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
when everyone is at work

166
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The point is

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
when Susan is not here

168
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm sorry

170
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm sorry

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm sorry

172
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm sorry

173
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm sorry

174
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm sorry

175
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm sorry

176
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm sorry

177
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm sorry

178
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm sorry

179
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm sorry

180
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm sorry

181
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm sorry

182
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm sorry

183
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm sorry

184
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm sorry

185
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm sorry

186
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm sorry

187
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm sorry

188
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm sorry

189
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm sorry

190
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm sorry

191
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry

192
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm sorry

193
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm sorry

194
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm sorry

195
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm sorry

196
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry

197
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm sorry

198
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sorry

199
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm sorry

200
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm sorry

201
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm sorry

202
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm sorry

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm sorry

204
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm sorry

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm sorry

206
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sorry

207
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm sorry

208
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sorry

209
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm sorry

210
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sorry

211
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sorry

212
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm sorry

213
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm sorry

214
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm sorry

215
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry

216
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm sorry

217
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm sorry

218
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm sorry

219
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm sorry

220
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm sorry

221
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm sorry

222
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sorry

223
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm sorry

224
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm sorry

225
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm sorry

226
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
How did you know this song?

227
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Is it good?

228
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
How did you know this song?

229
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Are you familiar with it?

230
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This is the song you wrote, right?

231
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's really good

232
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But there's no lyrics, right?

233
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm asking you

234
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
How did you know this song?

235
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Aren't you curious

236
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
what I found in my room?

237
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
There's a Chen Haoyu's folder in this USB drive

238
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You wrote all the songs in it, right?

239
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's really good

240
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But I like this song the most

241
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
To be honest

242
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
your writing is really good

243
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
If you can write like this in every song

244
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I think

245
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
you can be a professional musician

246
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But Chen Haoyu

247
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Do we need to add a lyric to this song?

248
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Or we can form a band

249
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
There's a special band now

250
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
called Phoenix Legend

251
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We're called Dragon Phoenix Legend

252
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
How about it?

253
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You write the lyrics

254
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I add the lyrics

255
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
We can definitely win

256
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Chen Haoyu

257
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I found the USB drive

258
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I found the USB drive

259
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I found the USB drive

260
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I found the USB drive

261
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I found the USB drive

262
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I found the USB drive

263
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I found the USB drive

264
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I found the USB drive

265
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I found the USB drive

266
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I found the USB drive

267
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I found the USB drive

268
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I found the USB drive

269
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I found the USB drive

270
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I found the USB drive

271
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I found the USB drive

272
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You can record it

273
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
This song is good

274
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Can you record it?

275
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Master

276
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I haven't written the lyrics yet

277
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
No need to write the lyrics

278
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Just sing

279
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Here

280
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'll start with the project

281
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
OK

282
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Recording

283
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:43,000
耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶耶

284
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,400
well

285
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,400
a man man no son ca wrong

286
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The truth is hidden in the old USB

287
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The pace of the game is slower

288
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The pace of the game is slower

289
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The game is not about the suspense

290
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The game is not about the suspense

291
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The answer is in the darkness

292
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The suspicious person

293
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I can turn the plot upside down

294
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The mystery appears again

295
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The mysterious person

296
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Whose body

297
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Whose finger

298
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Open the door to you when the wind and rain stop

299
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Whose eyes

300
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Whose turn

301
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The road ahead makes me deeper and deeper

302
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The end of the blurry will

303
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The end of the blurry will
