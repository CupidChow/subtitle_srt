1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,140
Edward I, opera concubine

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Wake up

3
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,480
The process is too easy

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,400
To make time grow up

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,400
Wake up

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,400
Wake up

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
Wake up

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,000
The Long Ballad

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,040
Wife

10
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,800
What's wrong?

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,480
Our girl

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,960
Has been gone for so long

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,800
I don't know what to do

14
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,880
That's our girl

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,080
Wife, don't worry

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,520
I'm sleeping in every

17
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,720
For the moving tomorrow

18
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,920
You can't change

19
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,080
What a beautiful world

20
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,920
Not bad

21
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,080
But I think it can be better

22
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,560
Let's record a little bit

23
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,240
Now

24
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,880
The distance from recording a little bit is still very far

25
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,080
We record a little bit

26
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,600
First of all, for happiness

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Then we can hear where we have problems

28
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,520
So we can improve

29
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,040
Right, Director Su San?

30
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,240
What are you doing?

31
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,960
I transfer the small thing to my phone

32
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,080
I can listen to where there are problems at any time

33
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,680
I think it's good

34
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,840
I think so

35
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,320
But Su San is still not satisfied

36
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,040
Let's think of a way

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,440
Okay

38
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,200
Hello, Su Diao

39
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,880
Sorry

40
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,400
I want to say sorry to you

41
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,920
What's wrong?

42
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,720
I can't go back to rehearse

43
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,680
Can't rehearse?

44
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,800
Why?

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,440
This year's music festival

46
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,600
I want to participate with my other friends

47
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,400
Beijing?

48
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
Yes

49
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,240
Beijing

50
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,240
Beijing

51
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,240
Beijing

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
Beijing

53
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
Beijing

54
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
Beijing

55
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Beijing

56
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,840
Whose band?

57
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,240
Brother Wen's

58
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,560
Do you need us to do something?

59
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,840
I send you the small thing

60
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,360
You help me register

61
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
Okay

62
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,440
What should we do, Wang Yi?

63
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,480
We can't let Aunt Su Diao in

64
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,960
We have to help

65
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,480
Come on

66
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,040
Come on

67
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,840
Sister

68
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,140
These are the students

69
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,440
I sent them

70
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,960
Since when did you chose me for the program?

71
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,960
Since when did it happen?

72
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,040
It's been a long time

73
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,680
You are willing to come into the program

74
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,200
It's really nice

75
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,920
I've got the invitation

76
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,040
Here you are

77
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,720
What are you laughing at?

78
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,640
Nothing

79
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,360
Listen

80
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,960
Okay

81
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,760
I'm leaving

82
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,720
Boss

83
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,520
Are you guys doing the decoration?

84
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,720
We're just checking

85
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,600
How long will it take?

86
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,360
It'll take half a month

87
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,280
It's not even a few days

88
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,680
Half a month?

89
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,400
Don't you have a competition?

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,560
Competition?

91
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,320
What competition?

92
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
The competition is in two days

93
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,680
Come on

94
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,440
Susan, you're finally back

95
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,440
Let's rehearse

96
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:38,920
Hurry

97
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,240
Sister Susan

98
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,320
What's wrong with you?

99
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,120
Why did you lie to us?

100
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,200
What did I lie to you?

101
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,840
Pretend

102
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,880
Pretend again

103
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,520
Don't you know what you lied to us?

104
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,280
Susan

105
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,480
Take your time

106
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,200
Let her say it

107
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,640
Susan

108
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,720
There must be some misunderstanding

109
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,480
Yes, yes, yes

110
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,120
Take your time

111
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,960
There's no misunderstanding

112
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,440
Sister Susan

113
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,240
Why did Su Tiansha lie to us?

114
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,760
Shut up

115
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,480
You're the dumbest

116
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,000
You're being sold

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,040
and you're counting money

118
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,480
Xiaosu

119
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,680
What's going on?

120
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,440
About the band competition

121
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
Why did you lie to us?

122
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,440
What?

123
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,400
What did you lie to us?

124
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,280
Sister An

125
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,920
There's no band competition at all

126
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,760
No band competition?

127
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,080
No way

128
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,520
How do you know?

129
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,680
I just came back from that bar

130
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,760
They're renovating

131
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,800
It will be open only after half a month

132
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,960
How will the band competition be held next week?

133
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,600
Xiaosu

134
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,280
What's going on?

135
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,560
I lied to you

136
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,800
There's no band competition at all

137
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,120
Why?

138
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,000
Sister Su

139
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,400
You're wasting our time

140
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,080
No

141
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,240
Listen to me

142
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,360
There's nothing to explain

143
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,600
You're lying

144
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,520
Do you understand?

145
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,280
You're not only lying to us

146
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,680
but also our relationship

147
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,280
You're joking

148
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,960
You're joking

149
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
You're joking

150
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,920
Sister An

151
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
You're joking

152
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
You're joking

153
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,480
You're really joking

154
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,040
Sister An

155
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,800
Sister An

156
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,960
I'm sorry

157
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,800
I didn't mean to lie to you

158
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,920
Sister An

159
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,360
Chen Haoyu

160
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,680
Chen Haoyu

161
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,280
Wait a minute

162
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,200
I'll explain it to you

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,040
Zheng

164
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,200
I'm sorry

165
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,880
You don't have to say sorry to me

166
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,080
Listen to me

167
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
What?

168
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,640
Why did you lie to us?

169
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,080
Sister An

170
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,240
Can you listen to me?

171
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
Sister An

172
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
Youyou

173
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
I'm sorry

174
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
Sister

175
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,960
Why did you lie to us?

176
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
I'm sorry

177
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,360
I didn't mean to lie to you

178
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
Sister An

179
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
I'm sorry

180
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
I didn't mean to lie to you

181
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
Sister An

182
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
I'm sorry

183
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,360
I didn't mean to lie to you

184
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,360
Sister An

185
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
I'm sorry

186
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
I didn't mean to lie to you

187
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
Sister An

188
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
I'm sorry

189
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
I didn't mean to lie to you

190
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
Sister An

191
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
I'm sorry

192
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
I didn't mean to lie to you

193
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Sister An

194
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
I'm sorry

195
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
I didn't mean to lie to you

196
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
Sister An

197
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
I'm sorry

198
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
Yes

199
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,120
Baby

200
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Baby

201
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
removed

202
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
رو

203
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
accompanied

204
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360

Never

208
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,360
Some are sad, some are depressed

209
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,360
The evening carriage of Pixiang

210
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Pulls the body

211
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,360
In the crowded world

212
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,360
People have separation

213
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,360
This city, I don't bow

214
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Every time, I cross the current and reality

215
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,360
This city, I help the country

216
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:49,360
Every time, there is a beautiful story

217
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,360
This city, I don't bow

218
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:04,360
Every time, I cross the current and reality

219
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,360
This city, I help the country

220
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:19,360
Every time, there is a beautiful story
