1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Wake up

2
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,400
The process is so comfortable

3
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,480
The world is growing

4
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,360
Wake up

5
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,720
Wake up

6
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,360
Liu,

7
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,920
are we going back to Beijing

8
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,360
or are we going to rehearse?

9
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,400
You're asking me everything

10
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,120
How am I supposed to know it?

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,320
What are your thoughts?

12
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,840
I don't want to give up

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,400
the opportunity to request paintings

14
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,340
You have your unlimited right

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,240
to make your choice

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,240
Why don't you let...

17
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,600
Let's go

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,600
We are...

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Old Zheng, are you willing to go crazy with us again?

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
Old Zheng is willing.

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
Anjie is willing.

22
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Let's go crazy again!

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Go!

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Go!

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Go!

26
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Go!

27
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Long time no see, Sidi.

28
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Long time no see.

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
This is a friend from Beijing.

30
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
A friend from Vienna?

31
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
No, we are friends from Syria.

32
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Also a friend from Vienna.

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
This is our rehearsal room.

34
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
From today on, it will be yours.

35
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
The equipment should be enough.

36
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
If you need anything, just tell me.

37
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Thank you, Bao Yin.

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Thank you, everyone.

39
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Thank you.

40
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Come on, let's start rehearsing.

41
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Not bad, right?

42
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
It's not bad.

43
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Is he the boy you mentioned?

44
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Who?

45
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
He is Bao Yin's competitor.

46
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Competitor?

47
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
He looks good.

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Does he look handsome?

49
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Definitely not.

50
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Sidi and you are the best.

51
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
The most wonderful stage in my dream.

52
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,600
The most wonderful stage in my dream.

53
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Stop.

54
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Stop!

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Sister Su San, you made two mistakes.

56
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Zheng, and you.

57
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
You made the same mistake several times.

58
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
I only made one mistake.

59
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
I made one mistake.

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
We only have three days.

61
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
It's only two and a half days.

62
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I hope you can practice your basic skills.

63
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
If we just play like this,

64
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
I think we will be eliminated.

65
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Cheng Hao Yu, you need to optimize your composition.

66
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Okay.

67
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
You are the best.

68
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
You are the best.

69
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
You are the best.

70
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
You are the best.

71
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
You are the best.

72
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
You are the best.

73
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
You are the best.

74
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
You are the best.

75
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
You are the best.

76
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
You are the best.

77
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
You are the best.

78
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
You are the best.

79
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
You are the best.

80
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
You are the best.

81
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
You are the best.

82
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
You are the best.

83
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
You are the best.

84
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
You are the best.

85
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
You are the best.

86
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
You are the best.

87
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
You are the best.

88
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
You are the best.

89
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
You are the best.

90
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
You are the best.

91
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
You are the best.

92
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
You are the best.

93
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
You are the best.

94
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
You are the best.

95
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
You are the best.

96
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
How is it?

97
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Still not good.

98
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Look.

99
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
I call an ambulance for you.

100
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Why?

101
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
You don't believe me?

102
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Baoyun is a high-class company that graduated from the music college.

103
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,600
I have also crossed the highest mountain range.

104
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,600
I have followed you to the end of the world.

105
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,600
I have seen you come every spring.

106
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,600
But you are not here.

107
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,600
No more?

108
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,580
ACbulb,

109
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,660
we were here in the first place,

110
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,600
we really won't stay in that place!

111
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,880
Show me!

112
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,660
Better go!

113
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,820
Come in!

114
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,600
Please have a seat please.

115
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,420
Ok.

116
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,600
The auditions are about to start.

117
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,040
I want to be a singer.

118
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,240
I want to be a singer.

119
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,840
I want to be a singer.

120
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,720
I love you.

121
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
Friends,

122
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,880
we're going to perform tomorrow.

123
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,200
We've succeeded in performing.

124
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,840
We've succeeded in performing.

125
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,200
Cheers.

126
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,160
Congratulations, kids.

127
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,000
What's your plan after the performance?

128
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,600
Work hard.

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,880
Buy a house early.

130
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,640
Take our Youyou to your side.

131
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,720
Great.

132
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,880
Anjie,

133
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,280
listen to me.

134
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,360
You don't have to be so stressed.

135
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,160
You can be as far as you want.

136
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,560
There's a way.

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,800
I'm going to the bathroom.

138
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,760
Where are you going?

139
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,880
Mr. Zhou,

140
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
why are you going there?

141
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,520
Anjie,

142
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,680
why are you going there?

143
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,960
Why are you going there?

144
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,960
The bathroom is over there.

145
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,680
The bathroom is over there.

146
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,480
Right.

147
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,160
Uncle.

148
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,320
You,

149
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,520
my Sister Anzhi.

150
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
Sister Anzhi.

151
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,760
Go for it.

152
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,680
Sis Susan.

153
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,280
Will you be separated?

154
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,520
Of course not.

155
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,840
We will always be a team.

156
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,000
Yes.

157
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,720
We will always be a team.

158
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,600
Then we will always be a team.

159
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,680
Yes.

160
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,920
We will always be a team.

161
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,080
What's wrong?

162
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,560
Where is Youyou?

163
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,760
She is here.

164
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,040
No.

165
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,360
Aoyi, come on.

166
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,320
You pulled the rope so well.

167
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,120
Come on.

168
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:50,440
You are so

169
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:50,920
good.

170
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
You are so good.

171
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,480
I am so happy today.

172
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,920
It's been a long time since I came back.

173
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,960
It's so happy to be here.

174
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,760
Zheng.

175
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,880
What's wrong with you?

176
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,240
I was depressed just now.

177
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,120
Yesterday, she was drunk and broke my heart.

178
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,320
It happened on that day when Xiao eben said

179
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,480
they would try to detchant you.

180
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,600
He said that he saw that kind of things sometimes.

181
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,160
He was always earning money in the old days

182
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,240
while the way he looked today ports towards earning money.

183
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,520
That time, he once told me

184
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:26,560
that he was ATHENA,

185
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,920
at least

186
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:28,840
toyotaning

187
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
whom every day.

188
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
At that moment,

189
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,200
it was just a dream.

190
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,080
He had been working here through the night.

191
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,480
You're the east, I'm not going west

192
00:09:42,880 --> 00:10:00,760
Marry him

193
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,480
Youyou

194
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,080
Will you let Uncle Zheng be your new father?

195
