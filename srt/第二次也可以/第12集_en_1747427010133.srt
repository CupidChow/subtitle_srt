1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Wake up

2
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,400
The process is too easy

3
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,320
The end of the world is too long

4
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,360
Wake up

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,360
Wake up

6
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,720
Wake up

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,480
Dad, mom

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,760
I'm leaving

9
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,200
Okay, let's go

10
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,000
You get ready

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,120
go

12
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
little girl

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,880
Foreigners interested in reviewing

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,280
Okay.

15
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,880
Bye.

16
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,480
Bye.

17
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,080
Bye.

18
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,080
Miss.

19
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,280
You must fulfill your brother's wish.

20
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,480
Come back safely.

21
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,280
Zhang, I'm going to work.

22
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,680
Be careful.

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,680
Don't suspect him again.

24
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,080
You almost wronged him.

25
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,080
I know.

26
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,280
I did it on purpose.

27
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,880
What's wrong with you?

28
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,480
I booked a ticket for him today.

29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
He'll come when the ticket is booked.

30
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:15,880
Okay.

31
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,080
I'll pick him up with you.

32
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,880
Thank you.

33
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,080
You're so stupid.

34
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,680
You...

35
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,480
Don't talk nonsense.

36
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
Listen.

37
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,480
If you talk about the bad words of Su Lian,

38
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,880
I'll go with him.

39
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,880
Shui Shan.

40
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,680
Wait.

41
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,680
I have an idea.

42
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,080
We've met Su yesterday.

43
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,880
Come back early after work.

44
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,280
We'll go to the bar to have a drink with him.

45
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,480
An, Zheng.

46
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,480
Why are you here?

47
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,080
We're here to have a drink with you.

48
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,680
What do you want to drink?

49
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,480
I'll treat you.

50
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,080
Zheng, please.

51
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,480
Yes, I'll treat you.

52
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,880
Sit down.

53
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,480
I'll get the wine.

54
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
Okay.

55
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,880
I have a good idea.

56
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,480
Zheng, you're here again.

57
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,680
Little girl, what do you mean?

58
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,280
You're so unruly.

59
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,680
Zheng, what do you mean?

60
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,880
I'm not unruly.

61
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,080
I'm just asking for it.

62
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,080
Zheng, what do you want to drink today?

63
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,080
I've been waiting for you since yesterday.

64
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,080
Shui Shan, drink more.

65
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,880
You said you wanted to keep the body.

66
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,080
So we're drinking today.

67
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,280
Cheers.

68
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,680
Zheng, you're hungry.

69
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,480
Thank you.

70
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,480
You're here again.

71
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,480
Come on.

72
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,480
Let's have a drink.

73
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,080
Come on, let's have another drink.

74
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,280
Cheers.

75
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
Come on.

76
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,080
Come on.

77
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,480
Zheng, I can't stand it anymore.

78
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,280
Calm down.

79
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,680
It's okay.

80
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,280
Zheng, calm down.

81
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,480
I'm fine.

82
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,680
Zheng, drink more.

83
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,880
Let me help you.

84
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
Calm down.

85
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
It's okay.

86
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
Zheng, drink more.

87
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,880
Zheng, are you having fun today?

88
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,080
I've been waiting for you.

89
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
Sit down.

90
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,280
I'm here.

91
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Let me have a rest.

92
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
I'll drink with you.

93
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,480
Wait.

94
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,680
Don't drink too much.

95
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,480
Come here.

96
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,680
Drink with us.

97
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
That's right.

98
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,480
Mr. Liu, you're different.

99
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
Different?

100
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,080
Or I'll think

101
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,480
you two look down on us.

102
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,080
Right?

103
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,880
Okay, let's listen to the song.

104
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Come on.

105
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,280
Pour it.

106
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,080
Come on, cheers.

107
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
Come on.

108
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
Cheers.

109
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
Good wine.

110
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
Look at Su.

111
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,680
It's like drinking a cup of wine.

112
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,080
A natural actor.

113
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,280
Zheng, you're wrong.

114
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,680
The bottle of soya is different from the one he drank.

115
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
Different.

116
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,480
Zheng, you're wrong.

117
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,880
The bottle of soya is different from the one he drank.

118
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
Different.

119
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,480
Mr. Liu, I can't drink anymore.

120
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
I can't drink anymore.

121
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,080
What are you talking about?

122
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,080
Where is this?

123
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
I'm just starting.

124
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,480
I'm not happy yet.

125
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,480
Go on.

126
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,680
Mr. Liu, I'll drink with you.

127
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,080
I don't want you to drink.

128
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,480
Don't fight.

129
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,680
I still have a little girl to talk to me.

130
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,480
Did she say

131
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,880
that we should fight?

132
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,880
I don't feel anything now.

133
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Okay.

134
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,680
I'll drink this bottle.

135
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Warm it up.

136
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,680
Do you think I'm a fool?

137
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,480
You think I can't see it

138
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,680
when I drink?

139
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
I'm telling you.

140
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,080
I've already seen it.

141
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,880
I'm telling you.

142
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,480
I'm here to play your little monkey today.

143
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,080
How about this?

144
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,480
You two have been working hard these two days.

145
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
I'll be a little more happy.

146
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,680
You drink it up.

147
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,280
I'll sign it.

148
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
How about this?

149
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,280
You two will eat with us tonight.

150
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,280
Tomorrow morning,

151
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,080
I'll open the box.

152
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,880
Okay.

153
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,280
What do you want?

154
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,480
Nothing.

155
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,880
Please drink.

156
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,880
Please drink.

157
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
I'm sorry.

158
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,680
What are you doing?

159
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
What do you want?

160
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Back up.

161
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,880
Come on.

162
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,880
Hit it.

163
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,280
Hit it here.

164
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,880
Why is there so much ash here?

165
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,280
We are civilized people.

166
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,080
We don't know anything.

167
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
Get out.

168
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
Get out.

169
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Okay.

170
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,880
I'm telling you.

171
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,280
This contract.

172
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,480
You don't want to sign it.

173
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,280
You're giving them a face, aren't you?

174
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,480
Get out.

175
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,280
Get out.

176
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,080
Sister Su San.

177
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,880
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,280
It's okay.

179
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,680
What about the contract?

180
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,480
What should we do?

181
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,080
They're all here.

182
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,480
Tonight, we will not get drunk.

183
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,280
Drink.

184
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,880
Let's forget Su De's unhappiness.

185
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,080
Cheers.

186
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,080
Cheers.

187
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,480
Xiao Su.

188
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,680
We are here to support you today.

189
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,480
You haven't sung yet.

190
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,280
Yes.

191
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,880
I haven't sung yet.

192
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,080
Chen Haoyu.

193
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,880
Let's go.

194
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,080
What?

195
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080

The

212
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280

217
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,280
