1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Wake up

2
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,400
The process is too comfortable

3
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,400
To be forgotten by time

4
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,360
Wake up

5
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,360
Wake up

6
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,360
Wake up

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The process is too comfortable

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
To be forgotten by time

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Wake up

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Wake up

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Wake up

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Wake up

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Wake up

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Wake up

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Wake up

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Wake up

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Wake up

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Wake up

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Wake up

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Wake up

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,920
others

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,480
Are for room

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,880
Where the sound and insipid

24
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,480
Will come

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,780
Wake up

26
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,440
Wake up

27
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,460
Where am I?

28
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,460
Chifeng

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Stop the car.

30
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Stop the car!

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,800
Stop the car!

32
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,600
Stop the car!

33
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Stop the car!

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What's wrong?

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Where are we?

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,800
Captain Su,

37
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,200
are you sick?

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,000
You took us to the Chifeng

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,600
while we were drunk.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,800
What?

41
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Chifeng?

42
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,000
Are we going to Chifeng?

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,800
Wait.

44
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Where's Chen?

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
Where's Chen?

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Chen!

47
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,000
Why are you here?

48
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
What's wrong?

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Where are we?

52
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,800
We're going to Chifeng.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What?

54
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,600
I fell asleep in Chifeng?

55
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,400
Su Lv,

56
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
you're kidnapping.

57
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Kidnapping?

58
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,000
I didn't kidnap you.

59
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,600
You were drunk yesterday

60
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,200
and wanted to go out for a walk.

61
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,200
What else

62
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,800
is suitable for the long distance?

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We're going to Chifeng!

64
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,400
We're coming!

65
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,200
We're coming!

66
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,000
Let's go.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,800
Well,

68
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,000
it's obvious that you were drunk.

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,800
How can you count

70
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,000
when you're drunk?

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,800
Yes.

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Su,

73
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,400
you really need to think about it.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,800
Turn around.

75
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Take me back.

76
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,600
Yes.

77
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,800
Let's go back

78
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,000
while we're still far away.

79
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,400
We're going to Chifeng.

80
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,600
Look.

81
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,000
The grassland is ahead.

82
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,800
We're just one step away.

83
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,800
Are you going to give up?

84
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,600
You're just saying it because you were drunk yesterday.

85
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,000
It's because you were drunk

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
that we didn't compromise on life.

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,800
Don't you want to go to the grassland

88
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,600
and see it?

89
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,600
Now we have only two options.

90
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,000
One,

91
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,000
the grassland is ahead.

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,200
We keep going forward.

93
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,600
Two,

94
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
we turn around

95
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,800
and let the courage we once had

96
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
become a regret.

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,400
I never said I was going to the grassland.

98
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,000
Take me back.

99
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,200
Don't lie to yourself, sister.

100
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,600
Wu Wen didn't say that.

101
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
He's waiting for you in Chifeng.

102
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't you want to see him?

103
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't want to see him.

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,200
I don't want to see him.

105
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,600
Why do you have this picture?

106
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,200
Xiaosu.

107
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,000
Xiaosu.

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,400
How did you know Wu Wen?

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Where is Wu Wen?

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Didn't you ask me that day

111
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,600
if I knew you long ago?

112
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,400
I not only knew you,

113
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,800
I knew all of you.

114
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,000
Get in the car.

115
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,400
I'll tell you the answer.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,200
I'll tell you the answer.

117
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll tell you the answer.

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,200
Where is Wu Wen now?

119
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,800
Is he in Chifeng?

120
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,600
Can you tell me

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,600
what happened

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,400
to Wu Wen in Chifeng?

123
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,400
Wu Wen has been living in my house.

124
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,800
He stays in his room almost every day

125
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,200
to play the piano and write songs.

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,800
Until Susan moved in.

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,400
You live in this room?

130
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
So small?

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,800
It's not small anymore.

132
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,200
Okay.

133
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,600
I'll send you the address.

134
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,400
Okay.

135
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Tell me if you need anything.

136
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,600
What's up?

137
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
I'm from the band.

138
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,000
What?

139
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,200
How did you know?

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,400
The drummers are in the bag.

141
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,200
Yes.

142
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,200
I play drums.

143
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,000
What about you?

144
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,600
I play the piano.

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I also write songs.

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Is there a band?

147
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,600
Just disbanded.

148
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,600
Then

149
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,600
let's play together.

150
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,400
Okay.

151
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
I'll think about it.

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,600
Okay.

153
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,600
Wu Wen is a very enthusiastic person.

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The first time anyone meets him,

155
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
they will have a familiar

156
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,000
and warm feeling.

157
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,800
I'm tired of you.

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,400
Thank you.

159
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,200
It's okay.

160
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Call me if you need help.

161
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay.

162
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Okay, thank you.

163
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes, the password is correct.

164
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,400
Why can't I open it?

165
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
What's wrong, Zhou Bin?

166
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
This is my daughter's

167
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
domestic card.

168
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't know what's wrong with her.

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,600
I wrote a foreign account.

170
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,000
She said she could see her photo

171
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,400
in it.

172
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
I can't open it.

173
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,200
Let me help you.

174
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
It's your daughter's photo, right?

175
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Yes.

176
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,600
Don't do this kind of thing again.

177
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,600
You can find me.

178
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,000
You're so great.

179
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,800
Can you rent a room for me?

180
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,200
What?

181
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,600
The rehearsal.

182
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,200
The basement was

183
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,200
our heaven at that time.

184
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,800
It was the starting point of all our hopes.

185
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,200
Good.

186
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,000
This is the place

187
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,400
where our dream begins.

188
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,600
Let's hurry up.

189
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Okay.

190
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,400
Let's drink.

191
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,600
Then,

192
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,800
I was with Wu Wen.

193
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,600
Good choice.

194
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,000
It's interesting.

195
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,800
There are feelings

196
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,600
and dreams.

197
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
After Wu Wen met me

198
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
in the basement,

199
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
he took me back to the living room.

200
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Why are you sleeping here?

201
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,200
I haven't found a place to stay.

202
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,000
You're looking for a place to stay?

203
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,800
Come with me.

204
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,800
Where?

205
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,200
I'll find you a place to stay.

206
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,200
I have no money.

207
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,600
I don't need your money.

208
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,400
Where are you taking him?

209
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
To the hospital.

210
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Wait for me.

211
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,600
You'll live in this room, too.

212
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Zheng.

213
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Zheng.

214
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,400
What's wrong?

215
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,400
I have a new customer.

216
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,600
Who?

217
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,000
A college student.

218
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,200
The rent is

219
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,200
on me.

220
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
I see.

221
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
How is it?

222
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,400
It's nice.

223
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,800
We, who were not related,

224
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,400
lived together

225
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,200
like a family.

226
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,000
We were together

227
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,400
for a long time.

228
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,600
We drank,

229
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,400
played and sang together.

230
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,000
At that time, he always said,

231
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
the prairie is the freest

232
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,400
and happiest place in the world.

233
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,200
He must take all of us

234
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,000
to the prairie

235
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,400
to let go of ourselves.

236
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,600
