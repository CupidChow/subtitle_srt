Wake up

00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,400
The process is so comfortable

4
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,400
The world is so beautiful

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,360

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,080
You left so early

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,600
It's late, it's nine o'clock

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,840
Little girl, how many days have you been out?

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,280
Two days

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's almost done

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Don't be too hard on the little girl

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
After all, it's good will

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes, I'll go see her later

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Then I'm going to work

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Be careful

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Don't worry

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Xiaosu

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Xiaosu

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Open the door

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Xiaosu

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Are you okay?

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why don't you give me an explanation?

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay, I'll give you a chance

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You haven't been out for two days, right?

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll make you a bowl of noodles

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Come on

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You're not hungry, are you?

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Xiaosu, your noodles are really delicious

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What's delicious? You're hungry

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Can you tell me why?

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Lao Zheng, can you do me a favor?

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Last time

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
How to help

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Can you get everyone together?

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Give me an explanation, okay?

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Aren't you afraid that they will eat you?

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm not afraid, I'm full

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
First of all, I want to apologize to everyone

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Sorry

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I lied about the big band competition

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There is no band competition at all

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Sorry

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The competition is fake, but the lie is true

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What else can I say?

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Xiaosu, what do you think?

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This kind of lie can't be kept for long

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You let Xiaosu finish first

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I didn't want to hide it for long

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Then what do you want to do?

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I want to take Youyou to the grassland

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You need money to go to the grassland

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You said there was a bar competition

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You can get ten thousand yuan if you get a name

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But there is no competition at all

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Where did the money come from?

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
My band is not going to the bar for the competition at all

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But for the grassland music festival

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I can't go

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If we can go to the music festival

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We will get 30,000 yuan

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I have sent Yang to them

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
They have sent us an invitation

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
30,000 yuan?

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Who knows if he is going to send us an invitation?

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Of course it's true

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You can call the organizer

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And ask him if what I said is true

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So what if it's true?

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I have said it

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I am going to get married soon

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I have no time

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I won't go to the grassland

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Don't you want to go to the grassland?

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't want to go

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I don't want to go

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't want to go

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Who said I want to go to the grassland?

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I never went there before

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Now I won't go

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I will never go there in the future

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I will never go

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Why did you go to the grassland?

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The music festival is real

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Are you going to leave?

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What?

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I am going to leave

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But I am not going alone

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You have known me for a long time, right?

94
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I am going to leave

95
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I am going to leave

96
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I am going to leave

97
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I am going to leave

98
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I am going to leave

99
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I am going to leave

100
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I am going to leave

101
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I am going to leave

102
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I am going to leave

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I am going to leave

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I am going to leave

105
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I am going to leave

106
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I am going to leave

107
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000

108
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I am going to leave

109
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I am going to leave

110
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I am going to leave

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I am going to leave

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I am going to leave

117
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I am going to leave

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000

I am going to leave

120
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I am going to leave

121
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I am going to leave

122
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I am going to leave

123
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I am going to leave

124
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000

But I am still slow

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I am so sad

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I am still getting experienced

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Because of you

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I am still I can not work

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
These days

146
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I have been waiting so long

147
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I resigned before the poetry

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I have been practicing

149
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
To hint at the future

150
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Sorry

151
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Sorry

152
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Sorry

153
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,060
Yes...

154
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,800
Guardian.

155
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,980
Guardian Honey.

156
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,960
Greetings.

157
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,700
Look over here.

158
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,160
My daughter and her daughter-in-law

159
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,860
have all got a Bayern Coming-of-age Award.

160
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,260
Thank you.

161
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,360
Oh, my God

163
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,400
You have a good taste

164
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,600
This sofa is the first-class yellow cowhide of Baqi's import

165
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,520
How much is it?

166
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,880
32,800 yuan

167
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,040
It's a good deal

168
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,640
Thank you

169
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,680
Let's have a look

170
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,560
More than 30,000 yuan

171
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,720
I'll make it if he makes it

172
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,400
I'll sell it to you when I make money

173
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,400
Thank you

174
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,880
Miss, is there anything I can help you?

175
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,640
I want you on this sofa

176
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,920
Mom, don't worry

177
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,800
Mom, I won't talk to you

178
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,720
Let's keep in touch

179
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,160
Wu Wen, are you all right?

180
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,080
Brother, the day you waited for has finally come

181
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,720
There is a music festival

182
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,000
Look, there is also the official music band

183
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,720
Xiaosu didn't lie to us

184
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,920
I'm sorry

185
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,320
I didn't mean to

186
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,280
I'm sorry

187
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
I'm sorry

188
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,400
OK

189
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,520
What's wrong?

190
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,840
Miss An, I have something to say to you

191
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,720
Say it

192
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,200
I'm leaving

193
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,440
I want to eat with you tonight

194
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
I don't think I need to live here.

195
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,440
Anjie, can you cook dinner for me tonight?

196
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,440
I just said,

197
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,440
we don't have to be unable to get along with this kid.

198
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
He didn't mean to lie to us.

199
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,440
Besides, you also saw it.

200
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,440
Xiaozu didn't lie to us.

201
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,440
Yeah, what do we do now?

202
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
I, I'll go shopping quickly.

203
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,440
Then I'll make some more special dishes to comfort him.

204
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,440
Okay, let's go.

205
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
Ten o'clock, ten o'clock.

206
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
I'm the light's room.

207
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Tonight,

208
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
I'm the oil pan hiding in the warehouse.

209
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
The breathing rhythm is getting slower.

210
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
The steps are slowly changing.

211
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
Right, the past is not a wishful thinking.

212
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
I'm the one who creates the phoenix.

213
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
I'm the one who creates the phoenix.

214
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
I'm the one who creates the phoenix.

215
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,440
I'm the one who creates the phoenix.

216
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
I'm the one who creates the phoenix.

217
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
I'm the one who creates the phoenix.

218
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
I'm the one who creates the phoenix.

219
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
I'm the one who creates the phoenix.

220
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,440
In the darkness, the answer is always found.

221
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
The suspicious person.

222
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
I can turn the plot upside down.

223
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Turn it upside down.

224
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,440
The puzzle opens up and appears.

225
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
You turn.

226
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Whose body temperature is it?

227
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
Whose finger is it?

228
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
Open the window.

229
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,440
The wind has broken your heart.

230
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Whose eyes are it?

231
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
Whose turn is it?

232
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
The road is narrow.

233
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,440
The more I go, the deeper it gets.

234
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,440
The end is a blurry needle.

235
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
Search for no one.

236
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,440
