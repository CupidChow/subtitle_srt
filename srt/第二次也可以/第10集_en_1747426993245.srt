YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Wake up

3
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,280
The process is like

4
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:49,500
a world of

5
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,500
Sister An

6
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,000
Why are you back now?

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,500
Zheng hasn't eaten for a day

8
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,000
I brought him some food

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
I think I smell love

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,000
Don't talk nonsense

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What are you going to do

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
in this dress?

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Go to work

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Go to work?

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
In this dress?

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Zheng

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,500
You haven't eaten for a day

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,500
Come and eat

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Don't starve

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let it go

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I can't eat

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You have to eat even if you can't

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hurry up

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Don't think too much

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's good to be like this now

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
As for me

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
As long as the child is good

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's better than anything

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You said

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's okay not to see

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I saw it

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's more like my daughter

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
She's not with me

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You said

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If she met a bad person abroad

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What if she learned badly?

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yang Zheng

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you know what Su Diya

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
has been busy with recently?

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't know

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What's wrong?

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I saw her dress like that

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
She went out to work

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What kind of dress?

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Like that

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Young people love beauty

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Is there anything wrong?

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But one night

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's dark

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
She dressed like that and went out

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Don't you think it's weird?

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You're worried about her

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What if she's in danger?

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That's what I'm worried about

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Did she really learn badly?

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Come on, cheers

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Mr. Liu, have a bite

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Mr. Chen, have one too

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And mine

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Of course

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Thank you

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Susan, you're wrong

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Mr. Liu has dried the wine

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Do you have to drink it too?

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Cheers

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I can't drink anymore

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Brother, what kind of person is she?

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Who?

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Susan

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
She

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
She's beautiful

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
She's a little straight

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But she's nice

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
She's very handsome

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
She wants to be the best female archer in China

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
She can give up everything for her dream

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
She's good at drinking

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
She can't even hold two cows

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Master

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Can't you hold two cows?

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I can't

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Come and see me

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's too lively

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't have time for that

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's hot

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You're good at drinking

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If you drink like this

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You'll get sick

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's all Jin Zhu's dad

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He has to be with her

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That arrogant man

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He gave up everything for his dream

93
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And he's already bowing to Jin Zhu's dad

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't be so over-reacting

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I can't afford to drink

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If I can't afford to drink, I won't have a job

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Where can I get money if I don't have a job?

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Money, money, money

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I only know money

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Where's your dream?

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Thank you, dad

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll pay you back

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
No, I have to be the best archer in China

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm leaving

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Dream

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Dream is a dream

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Dream is a dream

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You have another choice

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Come on

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Mr. Chen

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
To you

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
To you

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Tonight

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Mr. Liu, to you too

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm leaving

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Xiaosu

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You're back so late

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Anjie

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Why are you still awake?

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I

121
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll pour a glass of water

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Pour water

123
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
A smell of smoke and alcohol

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Is it really blood?

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Xiaosu

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You're finally awake

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Anjie

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Aren't you going to work today?

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I took a day off today

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
By the way, I cleaned up the house

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Xiaosu

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You're back so late recently

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Get off work

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Then you'll be back tonight

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Is it safe?

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Is there anyone to see you off?

137
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's just at the intersection

138
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's very close

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Bar

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll go to the bar

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What are you doing in the bar?

142
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Why are you back so late?

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Singing

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Only singing?

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I drink sometimes

146
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Then will you

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Go out

148
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Go out to drink with the guests

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I won't, Anjie

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I mainly sing

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But sometimes the guests are happy

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll drink more

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Then you make a lot of money

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yes

155
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
If the guests are happy

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll give them more money

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yesterday, I had a good time

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yesterday, the guests were very generous

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I made a lot of money

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Anjie

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Anjie

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What's wrong with you?

163
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Do you want to get back to work?

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
No

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
No

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
No, I mean

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Do you want to change jobs?

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Me?

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You come back so late every day

170
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Stay up late

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's okay, Anjie

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I like singing

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I like this job

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Beidiao

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes, Beidiao

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You have to know every guest

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You

178
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You have lived here for so long

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I know you

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You mean

181
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
We know each other in Jianshan?

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I didn't say that

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You mean Su?

184
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Be quiet

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Be quiet

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What about Su?

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
He goes out every night

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
with a lot of makeup

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He comes back when the sun is about to rise

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
He comes back

191
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He drinks so much

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
and goes to bed early

193
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He wants to wake up in the afternoon

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He drinks so much every day

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And just now

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He said he was singing in the bar

197
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
He sings in the bar

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He has a little bit of smoke

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's normal to drink

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
He doesn't only sing

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
He also drinks

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Guests give him money

203
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Think about it

204
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Why did he give him money for nothing?

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
He also said

206
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
A few days ago

207
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
A guest was excited

208
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and gave him a lot of money

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
No, you

210
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What do you mean?

211
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Zheng

212
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If Sudia is your daughter

213
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
She is now

214
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
with someone who is not clear

215
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
and not good

216
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Are you at ease?

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
If she is my daughter, I

218
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What should we do?

219
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We have to think of a way

220
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
to help her

221
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Come

222
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Look

223
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
She is out

224
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
like this

225
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Can it be assured?

226
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's true that it can't be assured

227
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But

228
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Before we investigate it

229
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We can't talk nonsense

230
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If it's out

231
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It will affect the little girl

232
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
When can we investigate it?

233
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'll let people go to the bar

234
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and see

235
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Then we will know

236
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Okay

237
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Come, drink

238
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Come, buy it

239
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Buy it

240
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Brother

241
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Drink

242
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Happy

243
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Come

244
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Cheers

245
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Cheers

246
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Come

247
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Susan

248
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You are not in a good state today

249
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But this wine

250
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We can't waste it

251
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Come, buy it

252
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Mr. Chen

253
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Come

254
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I really can't drink

255
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Mr. Chen

256
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Bosses

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I am Susan's good friend

258
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Welcome to our bar

259
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Today

260
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I will drink with you

261
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Okay

262
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Come

263
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Sit

264
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Susan's friend

265
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
is also my friend

266
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Can we drink a few glasses?

267
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Come, boss

268
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Cheers

269
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Come

270
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Susan

271
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Drink

272
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
We all drank

273
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You are not missing

274
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Are you here to harm me?

275
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
This sister is happy

276
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Come

277
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Let's drink another one

278
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Susan

279
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I like you so much

280
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This sister

281
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Good character

282
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I like you like this

283
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Come, cheers

284
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Brother

285
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You are a big business person

286
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You must take good care of me

287
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
This sister

288
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Sister

289
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Don't worry

290
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We will take care of each other

291
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Take good care of each other

292
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Brother looks like a happy person

293
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
In this case

294
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Let's do another happy one

295
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Slow down

296
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
This sister

297
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
No matter how good the singing is

298
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The alcohol content is still so high

299
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
As long as the boss is happy

300
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Sister Susan

301
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Are you here today

302
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
To sign a contract with brother?

303
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's a good thing

304
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Brother

305
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Sign this contract

306
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I will accompany you to have a happy one

307
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
As long as we are happy

308
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
We sign the contract

309
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
We are all happy

310
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Brother

311
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Just because of your words

312
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I am happy

313
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Good

314
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So good

315
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Little sister

316
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What are you doing?

317
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Brother

318
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I go to get some wine

319
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Little sister

320
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What are you talking about?

321
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Come to Guo Guo's place to drink

322
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
How can you let yourself drink?

323
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Drink ours

324
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Of course we drink our wine

325
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Let you spend money

326
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Come, come, come

327
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Sister

328
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You go to the bathroom to make up

329
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'll chase after you when I'm late

330
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Isn't it, brother?

331
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yes, yes, yes

332
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yes, yes, yes

333
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
My eyes are really uncomfortable

334
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Then you drink first

335
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Come back quickly

336
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Sister

337
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You sing well

338
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The alcohol content is still good

339
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Drink another cup

340
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Drink one

341
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Come, come, come

342
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Come, drink, drink

343
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What do you think I said?

344
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I just want to give you a littleQuite some

345
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,120
Brother

346
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What do you want me to tell him?

347
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Come

348
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,320
This is the car

349
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,000
I'll take the public transport

350
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Come

351
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,880
When old man kill me

352
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
This is the car

353
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Come

354
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I want to give you one

355
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Go

356
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm going to turn on the lights tonight

357
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The truth is hidden in the old USB

358
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The rhythm of breathing is slower

359
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The footsteps are slowly moving

360
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The music is not good at showing off

361
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Creation makes me die

362
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The answer is in the dark

363
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Suspicious person

364
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I can see the plot is turning around

365
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The mystery is solved and appears

366
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You ask

367
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Whose body temperature is it?

368
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Whose finger is it?

369
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Open the door of the city wind

370
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Whose eyes are it?

371
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Whose hair is it?

372
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The mystery is solved and appears

373
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The mystery is solved and appears

374
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The mystery is solved and appears
