1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
Sarlè§†

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Wake up

3
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,400
The process is too comfortable

4
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,320
To be the king of time

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,360
Wake up

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,360
Wake up

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,680
Wake up

8
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,120
Su Rui

9
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,160
I ask where you are

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,240
You will see him

11
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,400
When?

12
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
You are here

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,240
Why are you in a hurry?

14
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,360
What do you think?

15
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,080
Go to sleep

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,920
Go to sleep

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
One

18
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,680
Two

19
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
Three

20
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,640
Mom, there are so many stars in the sky

21
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
Silly girl

22
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,640
Stars in the sky can't be counted

23
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,720
Mom

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,920
They all look so low

25
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,040
What are you picking up the stars for?

26
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,440
For mom

27
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
Thank you

28
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,200
Zheng

29
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,280
What?

30
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,280
Go

31
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,200
Where are you going?

32
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,200
I know to pretend to be stupid

33
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,360
Where are you going?

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,000
Why should I go there?

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,480
You are so bad

36
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,800
You are a man

37
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,920
Can't you take the initiative?

38
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,840
I really look down on you

39
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,680
What do you mean?

40
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,920
You are not bad

41
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,160
If you are not bad

42
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,880
Why are you so jealous in front of Baoyu?

43
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,840
You take Su Rui back

44
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,360
So fast

45
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,680
I slept for 30 minutes

46
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,760
What time is it?

47
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,640
geen

48
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,320
So fast

49
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,800
I didn't count

50
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,800
I didn't hear you

51
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,040
Say it

52
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,200
Jack

53
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,720
Then where are you going?

54
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,440
Let's go

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,520
veil

56
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,040
K TV

57
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,360
I have to go

58
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,320
Now let's go

59
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:19,960
Go

60
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,720
Go

61
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,560
Just go

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,560
Add

63
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,240
Forget it

64
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:24,840
Explaining

65
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
mess

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,600
Now

67
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Why are you here so early?

68
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Why are you here so early?

69
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Mr. Su said that this is your first time to come to the prairie.

70
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
He will take you to the desert today.

71
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
This is our first time to come to the prairie.

72
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
You take us to the desert?

73
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Yes. The end of the prairie is the desert.

74
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
This guy is a little silly.

75
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
What?

76
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
No. I said hello.

77
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
You are really good.

78
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
I am good.

79
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Mr. Su.

80
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Mr. Su.

81
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Mr. Su, you are here.

82
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Everyone, get in the car.

83
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
We are ready to go.

84
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Hurry up.

85
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Zheng, hurry up.

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Xiao Zhuo, get in the car.

87
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
I want to ride a motorcycle too.

88
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Do you have a license?

89
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
No.

90
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
You don't know how to move your hands.

91
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Why are you riding a motorcycle?

92
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Get in the car.

93
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
The End of the Prairie

94
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Aren't we going to the prairie?

95
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Why are we here in the desert?

96
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
The end of the prairie is really the desert.

97
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
I was lying to you.

98
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Yes. I thought you were lying to me.

99
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Our heart was originally a desert.

100
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,600
When they have a desire, they will slowly grow grass.

101
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
When the grass becomes a prairie,

102
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
when our desire becomes stronger,

103
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
it becomes a forest.

104
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
It's not desire.

105
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
It's love.

106
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Our heart was originally a desert.

107
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Because of love,

108
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
the grass that slowly grows

109
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
becomes a prairie.

110
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
When our heart is as hot as the sun,

111
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
it will become a forest.

112
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
I can't remember how many times I slept in the night and was in a mess.

113
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,600
How many times I tried to persuade myself that I really couldn't stop.

114
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,600
I also saw how many friends broke up with me.

115
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
I can only tell myself that it doesn't matter.

116
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
I was in the past.

117
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Now, I can't remember how many times I slept in the night and was in a mess.

118
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,600
I can't remember how many times I tried to persuade myself that I really couldn't stop.

119
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,600
But there is still a voice that tells me not to comfort myself.

120
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Don't lie to yourself.

121
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Be who you are.

122
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
The world outside is big.

123
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
I never get lost.

124
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Because I'm still firm and still not giving up.

125
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,600
If you think of me when you're young,

126
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
don't worry, you'll always be the familiar me.

127
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
I know you're looking forward to me.

128
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
What's wrong with me?

129
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Seeing those boys dancing and singing.

130
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,600
If you still remember and are afraid of those moments,

131
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
don't worry, you'll always see.

132
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
I'll treasure the future.

133
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
All the brothers who helped me.

134
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Take care of tomorrow.

135
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
You have to face all my efforts.

136
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,600
What color to play, what car to drive, what kind of building is not mine.

137
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,600
What song to sing, what song to do, what kind of wonderful thing is my choice.

138
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,600
When will the light on this stage light up for me?

139
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
I'm young and bright.

140
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
The bright dream shines on me.

141
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
I'll remember every road I've walked in the past.

142
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,600
I'll look back at every sad step.

143
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,600
In fact, I haven't changed much in the past few years.

144
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Facing the ideal, I still keep my blood.

145
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,600
I'm always deliberately proving to the outside world.

146
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
If this continues, I will lose my right to be myself.

147
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm sorry, dad and mom.

148
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
I know you're doing it for me.

149
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,600
But time is also making me older and older.

150
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,600
I want to pursue the ideal place in my life.

151
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,600
I want to turn it into a seed and hope that the light will shine together.

152
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,600
After the stormy years,

153
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:36,600
my life is always in the air.

154
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,600
Go forward, it's hard to go to the end with me.

155
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Then we'll go back.

156
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Otherwise, it's getting dark now and we can't go back.

157
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Brother Guanyin, when can we come here again?

158
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,600
If you want, I can take you here every day.

159
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
Let's go.

160
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Let's go.

161
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
What?

162
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
I want to ride a motorcycle too.

163
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Okay, then you ride.

164
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
I don't know how to ride.

165
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Cheng Xiaoyu, get in the car and go.

166
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
I don't know how to ride, but I can sit.

167
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,600
You're so tired.

168
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Can you slow down?

169
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,600
The children on our grassland grow up on horseback.

170
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
It's very slow.

171
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
The wind is getting stronger.

172
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Slow down.

173
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,600
I can't open my eyes.

174
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
I beg you.

175
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Okay.

176
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Xiaosu, you're so happy.

177
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Which one do you like more?

178
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
You're so quiet.

179
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
What are you talking about?

180
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Brother, I tell you,

181
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
don't be too early to make a decision.

182
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Time will prove everything.

183
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
The battle is not over yet.

184
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
You can see it slowly.

185
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Don't be too fast.

186
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Zhu Zan, you're still young.

187
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
You haven't thought about it that much.

188
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,600
By then, I'll have them all married.

189
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
The rehearsal room is ready.

190
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Are you going tomorrow?

191
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Wait for my news.

192
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
They may not be ready yet.

193
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Is there any difficulty?

194
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
I'll think of a way.

195
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
What time is it?

196
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Why don't you go back to sleep?

197
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
I'll go first.

198
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Wait for your news.

199
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Be careful.

200
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Be careful.

201
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Slow down.

202
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
It's dark.

203
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Don't fall.

204
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
What are you talking about?

205
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
What does it have to do with you?

206
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
What do you want to do tomorrow?

207
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Don't ask.

208
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
What are you doing?

209
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
This is a girl's bag.

210
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
You can take it over there.

211
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Don't ask.

212
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Don't ask.

213
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Think of a way.

214
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
What way?

215
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Why can't I ask?

216
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
What do you want to ask?

217
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Tell me.

218
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
What's wrong with me?

219
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Why don't you sleep?

220
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Why don't you sleep?

221
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Be confident.

222
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
You too.

223
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Su Tian.

224
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Su Tian.

225
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Su Tian.

226
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
What are you doing?

227
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,600
I'm going to buy you the biggest diamond in the future.

228
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
I don't care.

229
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
I care about

230
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,600
giving you the best.

231
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
I care about giving you the best.

232
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Ten o'clock.

233
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Ten o'clock.

234
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
I'm in the room with the lights on.

235
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Tonight.

236
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
The truth has been hidden for a long time.

237
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,600
The pace of the breath is slower.

238
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
The footsteps are slower.

239
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,600
The past is not about the betrayal.

240
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,600
The creation of the phoenix is dead.

241
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,600
The answer is in the dark.

242
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,600
The answer is in the dark.

243
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,600
The answer is in the dark.

244
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
The suspicious person.

245
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,600
The plot turns around and turns around.

246
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
The mystery opens and appears.

247
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
The mystery.

248
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Whose body temperature?

249
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Whose position?

250
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Open the door to your heart when the wind blows.

251
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Whose eyes?

252
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Whose turn?

253
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
The road is narrow.

254
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,600
The more I go, the deeper it gets.

255
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,600
The foggy will.

256
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Search for no one.
