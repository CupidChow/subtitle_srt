1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
Hi, twos!

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,800
It's always inner peace...

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:11,800
I'm not on that road

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,800
All the warm grass

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,800
Wake up, wake up, wake up

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,800
The process is too comfortable

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,800
I'm on the wrong side of the world

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,800
I'm not on that road

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,800
All the warm grass

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Wake up, wake up, wake up

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,800
The process is too comfortable

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,800
I'm on the wrong side of the world

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,800
Wake up, wake up, wake up

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,800
The Long Ballad

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,800
But reality is so cruel

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
Dreams are so simple

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,800
The pressure of life

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,800
Wu Wen can no longer write a song she is satisfied with

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,800
Suddenly one day

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,800
Wu Wencheng changed into a person

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,800
His temper became more and more strange

22
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,800
Why?

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,800
I don't know what I'm doing

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,800
Are you okay now?

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Or is it just a dream?

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,800
Have you made up with this world?

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,800
Where are you now?

28
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Are you still full of life?

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,800
The dream of childhood

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
She is sick

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Wu Wen starts to lose sleep

32
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Can't sleep all night

33
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,800
What are you doing?

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,760
It's time for Vietnam

35
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:18,000
You sleep

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,800
Later, I went to see the doctor with him.

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,800
The doctor said that he had severe depression.

38
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,800
There was nothing good about it.

39
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,800
He could only be maintained by medication.

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
But his family needed to be with him for 24 hours.

41
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
He didn't have an accident.

42
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Then...

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
How long can he get better?

44
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Depression is hard to cure.

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Take your medicine first.

46
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
He has smile depression.

47
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,800
He smiles when he's alone or with his family.

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Then he feels sad and sad.

49
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,800
If you want to ease the symptoms of the disease,

50
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,800
you'd better find his premonition.

51
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Slowly,

52
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Wu Wen realized that his illness was serious.

53
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,800
But he had no choice.

54
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,800
What's the point of living?

55
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
No matter the world...

56
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
What about me?

57
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Finally,

58
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Wu Wen decided to leave.

59
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
I want to go home.

60
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
With you.

61
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
I'll go by myself.

62
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,800
We can go to the prairie together.

63
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
What are you looking for?

64
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
I want to go home.

65
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Take a picture with me.

66
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Let's take a picture together.

67
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Come on.

68
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Stand here.

69
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Put your hand here.

70
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Come on.

71
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
Put your hand here.

72
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Three, two, one.

73
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,800
I'll be back.

74
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
When I'm better,

75
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
I'll take you to the prairie.

76
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,800
The End

77
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,800
When Wu Wen left,

78
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
I was so reluctant.

79
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,800
I've never seen my brother again.

80
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,800
So I've been waiting for him.

81
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Why do you have to come here?

82
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
I'm Su Liya.

83
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Everyone mentioned Wu Wen.

84
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,800
They're the brothers who grew up with me on the prairie.

85
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
They are all Wu Wen's brothers.

86
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
They are all my brothers.

87
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,800
They are all Wu Wen's best friends in Beijing.

88
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,800
This is the owner of the old Zheng's joint house.

89
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,800
He is very nice, but a little stingy.

90
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,800
An Jian, a great chef in Sichuan cuisine.

91
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,800
A cool and warm worker.

92
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Su San, always put out the life and material.

93
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,800
But cold and hot inside.

94
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,800
As for him, Chen Haoyu.

95
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,800
Sometimes I really feel like he is a fool.

96
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Brother Wu Wen.

97
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,800
I brought them to the grassland.

98
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Mom, is this the grassland?

99
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Yes, this is the grassland.

100
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Dad, it's so beautiful.

101
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Mom, can we really see brother Wu Wen?

102
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Dad.

103
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Are you tired? I'll drive.

104
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Let's go.

105
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
What is this?

106
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
I hit it with my hand.

107
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Get off.

108
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Get out.

109
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
I only hit it with my hand.

110
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Are you ready?

111
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Ready.

112
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Go.

113
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Go.

114
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Go.

115
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Go.

116
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Go.

117
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Go.

118
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Go.

119
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Brother Wu Wen didn't lie to me.

120
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
The grassland is really beautiful.

121
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,800
The grassland is so beautiful.

122
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Shili, where is Wu Wen?

123
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
I didn't sleep last night.

124
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
I'm sleepy.

125
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Dad.

126
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Mom.

127
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
Good.

128
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
It's good that you're back.

129
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
Let's go.

130
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Our daughter is back.

131
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Girl, have you done this time?

132
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Dad, mom.

133
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
Let me introduce you.

134
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
This is the first time I've seen you.

135
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
I'm so happy.

136
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
I'm so happy.

137
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
I'm so happy.

138
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
I'm so happy.

139
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Let me introduce you.

140
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
They are my friends from Beijing.

141
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Hello, aunt.

142
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Hello, uncle.

143
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
Hello.

144
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,800
I'll cook for the guests in the garden.

145
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
You guys go ahead.

146
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
Thank you, aunt.

147
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
You're welcome.

148
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Is this your first time to come to the grassland?

149
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Yes.

150
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
What's your name?

151
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
My family.

152
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
How old are you?

153
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Eight.

154
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Eight years old.

155
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Is this your first time to come to the grassland?

156
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Yes.

157
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Good.

158
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
How do you like our grassland?

159
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
Uncle, is this the Mongolian bag?

160
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Yes, this is the Mongolian bag.

161
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Is this your first time to see it?

162
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
Yes.

163
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Let's go inside and have a look.

164
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Let's go.

165
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Uncle, see you later.

166
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Uncle, is this Mongolian bag made of these wooden sticks?

167
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Wooden sticks?

168
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
Kid, let me tell you.

169
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
This is called Hanagang.

170
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Our ethnic group is a nomadic group.

171
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Wherever we go, we bring the Mongolian bag to wherever it is.

172
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
Wherever it is, it's our home.

173
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
How do we move it?

174
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Just take it off and put it away.

175
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
Put it away?

176
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
It's so big.

177
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
How can I put it away?

178
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
It's like an umbrella.

179
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
You can hold it.

180
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
It's much smaller when you put it away.

181
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
Yes.

182
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
Put it away?

183
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
This is so good.

184
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,800
I don't want to leave.

185
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Thank you, aunt.

186
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
You're welcome.

187
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Eat.

188
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
Eat.

189
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,800
We have so little food on the grassland.

190
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,800
I don't know if you can get used to it.

191
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
Yes, we can.

192
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Really?

193

We're used to it, aunt.

194
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Sudea made her father go shopping fast.

195
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,800
She must have made you a lot of trouble.

Uncle, Sudea is very sensible.
