00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
Episode 15

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Wake up

3
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,560
I'm in

4
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,440
The world of the world

5
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,440
Wake up

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,440
Wake up

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,680
Wake up

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,000
Zheng

9
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
What are you thinking?

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What's wrong with your eyelids?

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I thought I was getting up early

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
My eyelids were jumping all the time

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What do you think is going to happen to me?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What era is this?

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So superstitious

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The eyelids jump because of nerves

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Or muscle tension

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Is it good?

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You're too tired

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You can't rest well

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Just sleep

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Sleep

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's good to sleep

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Are you going out?

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Don't get lost

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's okay, I'm now a navigation software

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Just get familiar with the surrounding environment

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If I get lost

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I will call you

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If I get lost

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Miss, we don't have a business here

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hello

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm here to find Manager Sun

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Hard-working singer

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hard-working

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This way

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Manager Sun, someone is hard-working

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Wait for our call

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What's your name?

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Su Diya

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Sing a song

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Who?

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's me

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's cold

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What are you doing?

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Sleeping

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Sleeping

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
In the daytime

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm going to sleep

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Sleep in the daytime

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What's wrong with your eyes?

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I have a bad eye

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I keep jumping

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Su said I didn't rest well

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Just sleep

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why are you back?

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm back to get something

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Is it a knife?

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll help you

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No, no

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Are you sure you can sleep in the daytime?

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Can

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I love you so much

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I can't tell you the story

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Your last word

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I hide in my world

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Can I drink?

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Do singers need to drink?

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Some guests are more enthusiastic

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's inevitable

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I am Mongolian

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm going to work tonight

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
8 o'clock every day

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
200 yuan a day

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Small fee

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Ok

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Hello, Chen Xiaoshi

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You slept for two days

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You should wake up

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll give you a place

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Come to me tonight

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Please drink

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm at the bar

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Where are you?

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Sir, what would you like to drink?

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Give me a beer

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Ok

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Thank you

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Thank you

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Thank you

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Ok

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Stop singing

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I thought you were crazy

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Where are you?

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm drunk

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Your song is good

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I added lyrics to your song

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You are not angry, are you?

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Your lyrics are so good

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Much better than mine

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Can you change your name?

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Name?

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You are the birthday man

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
No

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I mean the legendary song

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Sounds like a joker

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Chen Xiaoyu

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Let's make a team

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Really?

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You are not kidding me, right?

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Of course not

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I will write the song

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You will be famous

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
with lyrics

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What's our name?

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
How about the song?

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's so bad

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Is it?

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I think it's good

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's ok

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll think about it

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You have made up your mind?

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I have

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
If he were here

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He wouldn't see me like this

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Is he so important to you?

131
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Not important

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's very important

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I wouldn't write a song without him

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I will write many songs

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Many songs

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I will write

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
many songs

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I will write

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
many

140
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
many

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
many songs

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hey

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Can you give me back the USB drive?

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Why do you want it?

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's not yours

146
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I want to keep it as a souvenir

147
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You play the guitar well

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Who did you learn it from?

149
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
My brother

150
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Your brother?

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Does he play music?

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I guess

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Sulia

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
How did you find the USB drive?

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
We have cleaned this room many times

156
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Zheng

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Why don't you sleep at midnight?

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I can't sleep

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
How do you think?

161
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Not bad

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But I think something is missing

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What?

164
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
If I can play the piano

165
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It will be more fulfilling

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What?

167
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Did I say something wrong?

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I know who can help us

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Zheng

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Zheng

171
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Zheng

172
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Zheng

173
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I need your help

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Zheng

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Zheng

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Are you ok?

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Brother

178
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
He fell asleep

179
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What?

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Why did he fall asleep sitting down?

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He didn't sleep last night

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The sun

183
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
made him faint

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Go

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Go with me

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What are you doing?

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I just fell asleep

188
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm in a hurry

189
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm not sleeping

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Chen

191
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
One more

192
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What?

193
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Zheng can play the piano?

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Zheng

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Come here

196
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'll let you sleep

197
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Zheng

198
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Zheng

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Zheng

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Zheng

201
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000

I didn't expect your piano to be so good

229

It's not exactly good

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's it

Your piano is so good

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Why don't you continue playing now?

240
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
