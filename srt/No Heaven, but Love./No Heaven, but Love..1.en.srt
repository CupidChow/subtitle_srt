00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,878
It's okay to be alone

183
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,631
Ha, what are you talking about

184
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,175
[Sunghee Mo] How much money has been spent,

185
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,177
You should know how to thank this

186
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,720
Don't do that, because

187
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,683
[Sunghee Mo] Ha, because the coach also takes a precious time

188
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,938
You don't have much to select the national team,

189
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,776
Oh, it's just saying goodbye

190
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,611
Is Juyoung a mother?

191
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,246
[Sung Hee Mo] Don't worry, they don't know

192
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,961
Turn the hamburger once

193
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,170
mom

194
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,880

sorry

200
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,361
Don't take it until you say it's a car today

201
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,280
[Intae] Did you know?

202
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,323
Why should I do it?

203
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,867
It's all a strategy, so tell me to defend

204
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,538
All right

205
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,841

231
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,470
Did you do it all?

232
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,347
[Intae] It's just a hugang.

233
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,140
I won, but I won!

234
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,850

[Joo -young is crying] No

246
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,250

Inevitably

249
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,555
[Joo Young Mo] I don't have to regret it.

250
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,313
Do you know why my mom had Taekwondo?

251
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,148
I don't know

252
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,858
Why did you let me?

253
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,820
[Joo Young Mo] Taekwondo was originally a defense movement

254
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,658
Even if everyone in the world can't find it

255
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,370

[Sighs of the Captain] If you don't speak without words, are we only behind us?

295
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,781
Are you crazy?

296
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,869
If you're going to Taekwondo in that mental state,

297
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,998
Can't you see the whole team because of one?

[Joo Young's ridicule]

299
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,422

[The sound of the siren]

311
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,563
Because you can take a free gift

312
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,422
Thank you

Why aren't this right? Why is this these days, this?

316
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,164
Oh, I can't go home because this is not right.

317

Yeji

319
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,212
[Manager] Can you give me a glass of drink?

320
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,720
Here

321
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,555

[Manager] I want to go home too, huh?

326
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,734
But the settlement is not right

327
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,319
Money is empty

You're going to a juvenile school?

Stop coming out now

335
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,963
I have to study hard

336
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,051
Let's go

[Woman] A girl

341
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,118
You can't win medals so

342
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,872
[Joo Young] I do it myself

343
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,625
[Woman] Joo Young -ah

344
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,545
If you're going to school like that, just drop out

345
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,634
And how many times do I tell you not to wear gym suits inside?

347

I have to work harder

352
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,858
[Women] Parents are so good to study well and exercise well

353
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,946
Well, uh, what are your mothers these days, are you busy?

00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,364
I was coming to school once

[Joo Young] Now? It's too late

900
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,885
[Yes] Yes, it's coming now

901
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,015
[Joo Young] Can't you work?

902
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:40,767
Let's stay with me

903
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,103
The period is over now

904
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,773
Even if you want to go in, you have to make money

905
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:55,365
Then I will work with you

906

[Yeji's pale laugh]

907
00:58:57,992 --> 00:59:00,161
[Yeji] If you hear, you are stunned

908
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:25,144
what?

909
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,521
This is my amulet

910
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:28,940
I won all the garage and the game

911
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:30,275
Until the coach changes

912
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,446
Are you giving me?

913
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:36,990
I take you

914
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,158
Take a good look at the interview

915
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,245
thank you

916
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:50,378
- [Juyoung] Yeji -ya- [Yeji] Huh?

917

Let's live together

918
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,134
Wait a little

919
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,094
I'll protect you

920
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,017
Really

921

[Rhythmic music flows]

922
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:08,021
[Madame] Let's take care of your own.

923
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:10,732
[Employee] My sister is also trying hard

924
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:12,567
-Oh, settle here- [Employee] Oh, really

925
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:14,485
Is it Mija?

926
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,738
- yes? - [Madame] How old are you

927
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,490
Oh, 18 years old

928
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:20,950
[Madame] Mizarar is better

929
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,369
Because the uncles are dying

930
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,123
Now [sigh]

931
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:30,877
Active with this

932
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:38,843
It's called a cafe, what…

933
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:41,346
There's nothing big, just serving

934
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,431
[Madame] You can talk

935
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:45,725
I'll give you 8,000 won per hour

936
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:49,437
You know it's a fifty five hundred reasons if you go to the convenience store?

937
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:51,522
8,000 won?

938
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:52,732
[Madame] Would you like to do it today?

939
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:55,068
Just sit comfortably

940

941
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:57,612

943
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,992
Hey, I like you too

944
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,994
You're the first time today, please do well

945
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:07,038
Give me the last one

946
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:09,040
[Madame] Uh, I'll bring you

01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,189
uh? huh

956
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:01,861
[Staff] Are you doing well?

957
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,530
The friend in charge of the teacher

958
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:08,659
What was your name, what was your name

959
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,870
I think it was called Joo -young and peer

960
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,164
I'm a peer, so I'm going to be well like a friend

961
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:17,960
Mr. Lee

Home project

963
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:24,592
Is there a teacher who will take care of me?

964
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:33,810
Can I come in here?

965
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:34,769
[Joo -young's pale laugh]

966
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:36,437
You don't have to meet the claim

967
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,730
It's so boring

968
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,359
Seonghee Birthday, it's good to congratulate you first

Oh, it's okay.

974
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,843
[Yeji] Oh, but let's really go out

975
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:08,761
What should I do when someone comes

976
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,056
Okay, you know

977
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:14,600

984
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:38,207
I was a person who was a hugu in my school.

Yes, senior

986
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:44,964
Oh, instead, I would like it in the next game

[Sunghee] Why are you doing this? Do not

998
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:18,414
Sunghee, it's time to stop rebellion now

I went to the police station and wrote all the documents

It's all over, but why?

1221
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:28,605
[Man 1] It is a report that came to the association

Oh, you know everything

1227

Why are you doing this to me?

1228
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:46,164
If this is true, it doesn't end with qualification suspension

1229

The reason for this case is prominent

1288
01:29:41,667 --> 01:29:46,297
This is because Han Sung -hee, the youngest national team, made a complaint.
