00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,490
Episode 8

2
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,760
Ah... I miss the scent of my mother.

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,940
On days like these, my mom would pat my head.

4
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,830
The blowing of the wind and the singing of birds were my lullaby.

5
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,960
Why? Did you not like Mom's lullaby?

6
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,970
Orabeoni...

7
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,170
Our mom could not sing a lullaby.

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,400
Because she was mute.

9
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:03,210
♫When you offer me tears, what can I do?♫

10
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,580
♬ I'm afraid of being suspended a long time somewhere in memory♬

11
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,920
- Then—
- Ah!

12
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,170
You forgot everything, huh?

13
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,810
Of course, even I was too young to remember.

14
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,750
I know so, since our father told me about it.

15
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,730
♬ So I can't let it go ♬

16
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,630
What are you doing, Seon Woo? Shouldn't you go back before you get caught?

17
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,380
You already got a fail too.

18
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:42,100
♬ Although you and I became tears for each other♬

19
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:49,700
♬ After time passed on a bright day♬

20
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:57,200
♬ When we just held each other and it was just like a dream♬

21
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:05,690
♬ I remember that time then.♬

22
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,790
They promised to meet between 2-5 in the morning, but they didn't show up.

23
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,420
Don't get too close to them. I can't sleep well

24
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,690
when I think of you living with such low-level punks at the school.

25
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,860
Then what is my level?

26
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,930
You know that I'm still nothing at the moment.

27
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,050
What do you mean you're nothing? How can you say this?

28
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,910
King, you are the center of this kingdom. I know this and the heavens know.

29
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,270
And Your Majesty also knows that.

30
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,430
These watery eyes are just aging thing.

31
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:57,470
Come to think of it, they often treated me incorrectly.

32
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,930
I will write all of those names, and I will punish them in all sorts of ways, such as

33
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,740
tearing them into pieces and boiling them in a hot pot.

34
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,070
- You mean Peang Hyung?
- Yes. That's how it called!

35
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,270
I will let them be punished that way.

36
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,360
Got it?

37
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,370
The guard Pa Oh, here takes your sacred royal order.

38
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,420
Why are you coming just now?

39
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,870
Do you know how long I've been waiting here?

40
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,460
I'm not someone you should make wait so long.

41
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,100
What is it?

42
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:52,080
Shouldn't you have a better expression after attending your mom's memorial?

43
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,460
Our mom couldn't sing a lullaby.

44
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,640
Because she couldn't speak.

45
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,420
Is it possible to forget

46
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,330
all of your childhood memories of your mother?

47
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:19,540
For example, if your mother were mute or not.

48
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,650
I'm envious.

49
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:26,370
The memories I want to forget, but can't, are memories of my mother.

50
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,490
Who's the dummy who forgot these kinds of important things?

51
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,140
Me.

52
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,220
You were all here.

53
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,800
What is that?

54
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,700
I know it looks like a weird situation, but I'll tell you once we go inside.

55
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,180
Hey. Why are you leaving this to me?!

56
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,690
Hey!

57
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,250
- Take him.
- Hold him!

58
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,850
Wake up!

59
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,380
Aigoo, I said it is tilting.

60
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,170
We just got to the 15th (round). With this slow speed,

61
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,660
when are we going to get to the 100th?

62
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,440
At one point, you guys fought each other to death.

63
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,400
You are all a bit closer to each other now.

64
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,830
Traitors. This...

65
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,570
Hey!

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,670
Hold onto it well.

67
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,550
- Didn't you say "The End" wine?
- It is a sort of end.

68
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,650
The end of you and me.

69
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,370
Hey. Is there anyone who can tell me what happened to me last night?

70
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,190
Do it properly, properly!

71
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,850
So...this is 16th.

72
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,880
No way. He isn't going to make us do all 100 times, is he?

73
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,760
According to my calculations,

74
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,360
if we keep going just 20 more times, our legs will give out. And if we do it 100 times,

75
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,790
we'll die...

76
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,390
I know, right?

77
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,920
But why did Ban Ryu do that to Soo Ho's sister?

78
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,450
What did Ban Ryu do?

79
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,170
He touched them. Soo Ho sister's breasts.

80
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,230
He's a psycho. Isn't he crazy?

81
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,230
Ah, it's hot.

82
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,260
What the...!

83
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,830
I'm seriously going crazy!

84
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,560
Because of that so called "the end wine", I had experienced the end of my endurance.

85
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,270
You all deserve "Paeng Hyung." (punishment of boiling one in a pot)

86
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,190
That's weird. I can't remember yesterday. Why?

87
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:58,360
My memory is vague but I feel like something bad happened.

88
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,060
Dunno.

89
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,510
You dropped this.

90
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,100
It's a unique symbol. Does it have a meaning?

91
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,920
You don't need to know because it's not even mine.

92
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,300
Then you can give it to me. It's a hobby of mine to collect these things.

93
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,440
Sell it. I will pay whatever you want.

94
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,980
It's not something I'm selling. It's something I need to get paid back for.

95
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,580
That's a shame. This is just my style.

96
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,370
You saying you liked my sister.

97
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,240
Were you sincere?

98
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,460
- I'm asking if you were sincere?
- If I was, what will you do?

99
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,270
Soo Ho and Ban Ryu are considered to be the worst enemies.

100
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:27,570
They'll end up fighting because of his younger sister. Someone will have to die in order for this to end.

101
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,350
Ban Ryu deserves to die for what he did.

102
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,850
If he would've done it to me I would've just...

103
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,350
Here.

104
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,060
What the heck are you doing?

105
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,990
If you don't want it, then do whatever.

106
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,790
What's wrong with them?

107
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,880
They looked quite uneasy.

108
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,560
Not sure. I d-don't really know.

109
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,370
Did I lose my memory and become sensitive?

110
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,590
Hey! Just remember this.

111
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,460
Everything... is a misunderstanding.

112
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,690
What kind of bullsh*t are you saying?

113
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,470
Hey. Hey!

114
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,360
Are you crazy? Are you crazy? Why did you come here?

115
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,630
Are you looking for trouble?

116
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,850
Please be sure to give it to Ban Ryu.

117
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,290
But... are you really... over there...

118
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,170
Someone's life is on the line.

119
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,030
Make sure you give to him!

120
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,130
My head hurts so much, but why?

121
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,620
Why are you doing this to me?

122
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,430
Hey! Come out!

123
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,280
Omo!

124
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,680
Who was that person?

125
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,020
This is for me?

126
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,510
Yes.

127
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,330
My brother, Soo Ho, is ignorant and reckless,

128
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,390
different from his nice and cool appearance.

129
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,750
His strength is the only thing to be proud of.

130
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,780
But I don't have the confidence to persuade him with a letter.

131
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,020
So please, survive.

132
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:01,260
I will explain everything to my brother when he comes out of the Hwarang school.

133
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,460
I will definitely clarify that

134
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,320
you're not the one who touched me, but instead it was me.

135
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,520
What are you doing here?

136
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,410
Because the laundry is piled up.

137
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,600
What? Why are you staring?

138
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,680
Does it matter if I look at you?

139
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:10,510
I want to look at my brother's face. Can't I do that?

140
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,370
If a young child forgets losing his path, he'll even forget his own name.

141
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,610
So the fact that you didn't remember that Mother couldn't speak.

142
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,100
It could be forgotten.

143
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,630
It's just like that.

144
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:49,990
♬ Don't look at me with sad eyes ♬

145
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:57,450
♬ Your aching heart displays everything ♬

146
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:04,700
♬ If you keep doing that you will just leave me ♬

147
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:13,000
♬ When you offer me tears, what can I do? ♬

148
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:21,770
♬ I'm afraid of being suspended a long time somewhere in memory ♬

149
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:29,200
You should go, and be careful of strangers,
♬ I'm afraid the more I try to wipe it out, the more I will be left yearning ♬

150
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:37,410
and travel on busier streets.
♬ So I can't let it go ♬

151
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:51,400
♬ Although you and I became tears for each other ♬

152
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:59,000
♬ After time passed on a bright day ♬

153
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:06,600
♬ when we just held each other and it was just like a dream ♬

154
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:14,600
♬ I remember that time then. ♬

155
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,100
Oh my! You scared me!

156
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,470
- Who?
- Me!

157
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,140
There's no news about someone dying inside, right?

158
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,500
Aigoo, what are you talking about?

159
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,600
I'm asking if my brother has kill Ban Ryu yet.

160
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,760
No, not yet.

161
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,710
That's a relief.

162
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,680
Hey...

163
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,630
Do you want to have a drink?

164
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,380
Sure.

165
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,740
How long have we known each other?

166
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,320
It's been about 12 years?

167
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,830
When I was getting bullied by the neighborhood kids because my brother was so good looking,

168
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,740
you still played with me.

169
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,010
And when I got bullied as a half, without even a mom,

170
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,770
you played with me too.

171
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,490
Cheers!

172
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,160
I...

173
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,440
like my brother.

174
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,440
I like your brother too.

175
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,800
I envy you.

176
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,960
You won't say something like that once he puts you in a headlock, right?

177
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,850
Hey. Why are you like this?

178
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:04,470
I wish my brother could be my real brother,

179
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,690
but I also wish he wasn't.

180
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,720
What are you talking about?

181
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:34,420
The longer I wait, the only person getting stronger is you.

182
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:40,700
I will become stronger as a Hwarang, Mother.

183
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,810
Your Highness! I will call a doctor.

184
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:51,560
No. Ahn Ji Gong.

185
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,620
Get Ahn Ji Gong.

186
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,410
Alright.

187
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,420
Doctor

188
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,880
You must come to the palace.

189
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,910
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for a patient.

190
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,680
I am not here to ask you for a favor.

191
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,910
You must go.

192
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,020
I'm thinking of killing Ji So (Queen Dowager),

193
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,670
extremely slowly.

194
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,380
What are you surprised for? That's nothing new.

195
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:59,510
All the soldiers working for her are my people anyway.

196
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,940
You don't have to hurry.

197
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,150
I need to slowly kill her without anyone noticing

198
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:11,730
so that nobody will be against me for electing the next king.

199
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,310
What is the reason you are telling me this?

200
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,720
I just told you.

201
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,130
I think we have the same point of view.

202
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,860
It's different from last time.

203
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,430
It is slowly getting worse.

204
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,440
Poison?

205
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:43,010
Do you have any symptoms in your chest area?

206
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,010
Sometimes.

207
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:51,350
Is it this sickness a death penalty for all the sins I have done to you?

208
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,070
For the sin of separating your wife and son from you.

209
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,940
But you found your son, didn't you?

210
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:08,570
It's a temporary sickness from scattered energy in your body. Keep your body and mind at peace.

211
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,450
Is it really not a severe disease?

212
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:18,460
If you don't believe me, call a palace practitioner to confirm it.

213
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:26,670
I don't believe anyone in the palace, except you.

214
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,880
I think of the past.

215
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,860
Back when we were sure we would get married.

216
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:47,070
When we ran around in the field like children under the clear, blue sky.

217
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,550
The gaze you gave just for me.

218
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,860
Do you still hate me that much?

219
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:12,260
If I said I still want you, would you be able to come back to me?

220
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,080
What are you doing?

221
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,150
Is this the tea Her Highness drinks?

222
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,790
That's right, but why are you doing this?

223
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,910
Was the tea not made correctly?

224
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,180
No. There's nothing wrong with it.

225
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,790
It's nothing.

226
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:58,670
Why is a successful merchant in the capital like you working with Hwarang?

227
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:04,700
Isn't it for an investment? A merchant like me can't predict the future.

228
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:10,650
It's not easy to have an opportunity to build close relationships with the future members of the royal council.

229
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:18,240
As for Seon Woo, the son of Ahn Ji Gong. please tell us everything about him.

230
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,670
But about him... Why?

231
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:25,900
Just do it as you are told. How dare you ask for a reason?

232
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,330
I was just curious about that Hwarang.

233
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:34,660
Ah, well if you're talking about Dog-Bird,

234
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:41,840
he seems to be ignorant, reckless, and smart in a way and not so (smart).

235
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:48,830
Anyway, he's different from the noblemen who were raised royally in the capital.

236
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,450
Dog-Bird?

237
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:57,820
It means he's like a dog and a bird. It's a nickname he was given when he was a Cheonin.

238
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:04,340
Anyway, you can say he's unique, and he's not normal.

239
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,690
Anyhow, he is not like his narrow-minded father.

240
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,940
I saw this and picked it up. You can use it.

241
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:30,390
Huh? What is this? It's a needle container. But why?

242
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,130
Why do you think so?

243
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,360
Think about it.

244
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,760
Why is he like this? Does he want me to do acupuncture on him for free?

245
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,760
They are gold needles! These are nice.

246
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,410
Where have you been buying everything?

247
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,920
What do you mean? What?

248
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,040
Ah, seriously.

249
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,860
Wait, wait.

250
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,270
Why is he like this?

251
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:18,150
This is from the West! What taste!

252
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:21,930
Wow! It's from Baekje! (One of the Three Kingdoms, Silla, Baekje and Goguryeo)

253
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:28,470
Wow! Doesn't it come from the West Sea?

254
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:33,580
I'm feeling this texture for the first time!

255
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,180
Wait, what is this?

256
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:44,920
I am not sure how to call it correctly, but maybe it is bait? Bait to lure your heart, isn't that it?

257
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,650
Who would make the clinic like this? It's a burden!

258
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,820
You have to think about the person's good deed. Do you know how much all this costs?

259
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,740
How much is it? Is it worth a lot of silver?

260
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,790
Not silver. It probably cost gold and a lot of it.

261
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:03,830
Huh? Then give it to me!

262
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,920
Aish! What kind of crazy person did this unnecessary thing?!

263
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,940
You said she would like it.

264
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:16,550
That's weird. I thought this was the best way to impress a girl. Maybe she has poor taste in interior decor?

265
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,850
I ought to... Go! I don't want to see you.

266
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,720
Who? Do you mean me?

267
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:26,130
Hey.

268
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,460
Are you the one who did this unnecessary thing?

269
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,400
It cost too much gold to call it unnecessary.

270
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,560
If you have too much gold, donate it to the hungry people. There are a lot of those in the capital.

271
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,400
Or give rice cakes away to the hungry kids.

272
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,150
Why am I doing this? Because I want to.

273
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,350
Even if it's unnecessary, I wanted to give you good and pretty things.

274
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,000
- Why?
- Because I can.

275
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:00,450
Or, because I want to.

276
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,210
Yeah, but why?

277
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,460
Because I like you.

278
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:12,490
I know you weren't that smart, but I didn't know you were an idiot. Now that you know, just use them.

279
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,860
Or trash them.

280
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:27,580
I'm sure hearing a lot of things. Does your mother know that you're doing this stuff?

281
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,210
♫  Into the shimmering light  ♫

282
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:54,960
♫ my small dream lay over there  ♫

283
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,590
Is he a person?

284
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:00,450
I couldn't even sense when the sword struck.
♫  The road that I found  ♫

285
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:04,600
He's so strong. He could break my head in an instant!

286
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,510
♫  You were there  ♫

287
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,850
Oh, Soo Ho!
♫  Like a dream  ♫

288
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:14,390
Hang in there, Soo Ho!

289
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,750
Can Soo Ho do any better than others?

290
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:23,080
Even so, he is known as the most skilled defender with a sword, right?

291
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,230
He only has to resist it 10 times, right?
♫ Opened up to me ♫

292
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,170
Now it's 8 times.

293
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:35,990
♫  All I need is only you, chase that star  ♫

294
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:40,200
♫  Until you unfold all the dreams heaven has  ♫

295
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,990
♫  Even if darkness surrounds me  ♫

296
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:49,740
♫ I will never let you go ♫

297
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,300
- Wow!
- That was great!

298
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,060
Awesome.

299
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:44,500
How can we be assured of the safety of the Queen with such weak guards and soldiers in the palace?

300
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,880
Stop it, Jap Chan. You better watch what you are saying!

301
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:55,450
Please think things through.

302
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,790
They say that there are multiple rulers in this kingdom.

303
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:08,530
With so much land and their own soldiers, they could be mistaken for a king.

304
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:11,480
Examples can be found among many members of the royal council.

305
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,320
How miserly of you, all of you.

306
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:24,370
When you have to help out the financial situation for the palace, you want to make it worse by arguing over nothing.

307
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:29,110
Where do you think this place is that you stepped foot in here? In what capacity?

308
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:36,850
As a previous member of the royal council and as a current Master of Hwarang who is growing the future members of the royal council.

309
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:41,500
This meeting is to decide on the important issues about royal family matters. Get out of here.

310
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,400
Am I not here because of that?

311
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:57,590
Music and Entertainment
Let me present the Hwarang's performance on the Moon Festival.

312
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,310
What exactly is your intention in displaying the Hwarang performance?

313
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:08,060
Don't you want to make clear to the world the Hwarang as Silla's Hwarang

314
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:13,050
through the promotion of Your Highness' Hwarang as soon as possible?

315
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:16,500
What better opportunity is there than a celebratory feast such as Hangawi. (Moon Festival. August 15 on the Lunar Calendar)

316
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,240
when all the subjects' attention will be focused on Silla's royal family?

317
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,070
Are you saying that Hwarang will do the performance for King Jin Heung's benefit?

318
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:26,500
Hwarang will do a performance for the subjects.

319
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,840
For the subjects?

320
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:38,490
Don't you see what Poong Wol Joo is up to? He wants to declare that Ji So owns Hwarang in front of the subjects.

321
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,360
How about just preventing that from happening?

322
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,320
Do you have a good scheme to stop the performance?

323
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,580
Get my horse ready.

324
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:05,050
I am very sorry to say this, but Poong Wol Joo is in the palace at the moment. You cannot meet him.

325
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:08,490
I'm not here to meet Wol Joo, I'm here to meet Hwarang.

326
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,300
Gakgan!

327
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:32,650
Show your respect to see Gakgan Yeong Sil Gong.

328
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:42,660
But why is the Gakgan here? Is it because of Ban Ryu?

329
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,530
Who knows.

330
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:52,490
Since I'm here, I would like to speak with one of the Hwarang.

331
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,320
Ban Ryu.

332
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:02,760
No, I want to talk with Seon Woo.

333
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:11,380
Yeong Sil Gong is looking for the Hwarang the Queen Dowager picked?

334
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,770
Why does Yeong Sil Gong want to meet him in private?

335
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:25,460
Don't be so concerned. It was all for your sake.

336
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,990
For my sake? What do you mean?

337
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,860
You look better than I imagined.

338
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,600
What is the reason for wanting to meet me?

339
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,740
Well, It was hard to get the chance to meet you, but

340
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:46,260
now that the chance is given, I don't know what to ask first.

341
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,980
Come back when it comes to your mind.

342
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,550
I heard your friend died? By a palace guard.

343
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,730
What kind of sin did he commit that he had to be killed?

344
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,800
What are you?

345
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,630
Did you see? The king's face?

346
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,630
What do you mean by the king's face?

347
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:12,820
The king's face. The king's face.

348
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:19,410
I... I think I saw the king.

349
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:30,080
It seems you finally remember. If you're wondering if I'm on your side or against you, let me say one more thing.

350
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,040
I am on the side opposite the Queen Dowager.

351
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,820
Your father and I are the people who have grudges against Queen Dowager.

352
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:49,570
If only I can find out who the king is, I can get revenge.

353
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,370
You got the wrong idea. I don't know anything.

354
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,550
If you are finished, I will be on my way.

355
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,370
Dog-Bird.

356
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:27,380
Mak Moon, if you died because you saw the king's face. If that's true,

357
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:36,610
then I can't forgive that king. If I ever meet the King,

358
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:41,160
the I will get pay back for your life.

359
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,730
You must be more amazing than we thought, considering that Gakgan came all the way to the Hwarang school to see you.

360
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:54,460
Who is he ignoring? I'm not someone who should get this kind of maltreatment...

361
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,080
He deserves death by boiling.

362
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:09,600
What is this, seriously? I can't rest properly.

363
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,280
What is this?

364
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,960
No way.

365
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,760
What is it?

366
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,680
I recognize this drumming.

367
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:10,560
Soon the capital will celebrate the Hangawi festival.

368
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,020
You must perform music and dance in front of the people and the Queen Dowager.

369
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:21,260
Are you saying you want us to dress up, dance, sing and perform in front of the Queen Dowager?

370
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,970
What I am saying is not that you perform cute tricks in front of Her Highness,

371
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:32,530
but that you present cheering music and dance performances for the subjects to enjoy.

372
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:37,540
This is your second assignment.

373
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,380
Have fun.

374
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:49,090
The right teacher to teach you the music

375
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:54,020
and dance is Woo Reuk here.

376
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:58,730
You guys should be honored to hear his music in person.

377
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:03,220
Is he truly the famous Gaya's musician Woo Reuk?

378
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,460
Is he that popular?

379
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:12,620
Even I've heard about him. There's no instrument he can't play. They say he especially rocks on gayageum. (Gayageum is a string instrument.)

380
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,790
He rocks on what?

381
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,200
But...

382
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,460
This...

383
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,570
Ahjae (another form of Ajussi), what are you doing here?

384
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:28,420
I'm not "Ahjae." I'm your teacher.

385
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:34,200
Did... Did you go over the wall! Are you crazy at your age!

386
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,760
Why did I do that surreptitiously when I'm not a Cheonin?

387
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,590
You always lived like one, though.

388
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:47,140
I'm not going to live like that anymore. So if you don't do it properly, I'm going to shoot arrows again.

389
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,250
How do you know Poong Wol Joo?

390
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:02,930
People who share an appreciation for the arts have a way of getting through to each other.

391
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:08,280
Do well. I heard you are the first nominee for failure.

392
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:52,100
The basis of all instruments is rhythm. Rhythm is the ruler of the instruments.

393
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:57,100
If you cannot master the rhythm, then even a beautiful melody

394
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,650
is nothing but random noise.

395
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:12,650
The rhythm is not about suppressing the freedom of the melody.

396
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:18,350
It is the force which draws the free melody without exhausting it.

397
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:22,790
Now, open your hearts wide,

398
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,990
and feel the rhythm. Did you get that?

399
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,900
Yes!

400
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:45,630
You guys will have to use your whole body to make noise.

401
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:49,150
You should use your feet. You use your hands.

402
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:54,740
You use your shoes, and you use... your cheeks.

403
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,010
Cheeks.

404
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,570
Do it harder!

405
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,990
Oh!

406
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:19,800
That was good!

407
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,730
Wow.

408
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,420
Why? What?

409
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,130
As I expected, this is the best for a hangover.

410
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:07,190
You squeezed out the best tasting arrowroot juice I have ever had.

411
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:12,150
By the way, where on earth did that unknown man roll in from?

412
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:14,230
Watch for your mouth.

413
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:20,160
Where did he come from? His music seems weird.

414
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:27,340
I thought he was someone you would know.

415
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,930
How would I know him?

416
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:35,290
He used to care for your brother. How could you not know him?

417
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,790
That man is the one who raised my brother?

418
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:43,230
Yeah.

419
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,550
What are you doing?

420
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,830
I told you to do this.

421
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:04,330
It doesn't do what I want it to.

422
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,660
- Okay.
- Again!

423
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,630
The noble offspring are dancing and singing in front of the Queen Dowager?

424
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:24,540
This is beyond humiliation!!

425
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:28,590
Look. They said they want to raise intelligentsia of Silla.

426
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:31,470
Queen Ji So is showing her true colors in this way, isn't she?

427
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:37,410
The queen is making the Hwarang into street clowns and showing them to the people.

428
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:41,800
Yeong Sil Gong. Are you doing to let the Queen humiliate us like this?

429
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,890
It seems the Queen Dowager wants to get things done faster.

430
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:49,290
There must be a reason to do so.

431
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,310
Isn't she rushing to establish her sovereign authority?

432
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:13,960
I wasn't going to say this, but...

433
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,540
- Then don't say it.
- Dancing...

434
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:20,890
Do you want to be recorded as the humiliated one forever in Silla's history?

435
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,840
Who can call me humiliated? I will remain

436
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:28,010
as a legendary king who was handsome and even danced well.

437
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,910
By what chance?

438
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:33,510
Haven't you tried to think about the reason you couldn't get married?

439
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:38,280
I didn't get married out of loyalty to you. It's not that I couldn't.

440
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,370
And if I go out, I have huge popularity amongst women.

441
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:48,500
I know you want to think that way, but you're not their style.

442
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,990
Why not?

443
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,430
You really don't know what women are like.

444
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:56,820
Jeez.

445
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,900
I forgot everything because of you!

446
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:33,540
Is your body made of sticks?

447
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,640
I heard this is the second assignment. If you get a fail on this too,

448
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,400
they said you could actually be kicked out.

449
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,360
I'm getting better.

450
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:46,340
Getting better, my ass. You're getting worse because you're doing it alone.

451
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:51,290
Don't mind me. I'll somehow pass.

452
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,730
Besides your stiff body, you have no sense of rhythm.

453
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:00,460
So you grab it. Then you bend your back.

454
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:06,310
This. You can't do this?

455
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,940
I don't know who's calling whom "sticks."

456
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,570
I'm very flexible!

457
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:19,420
You can't even do this. Now, do it again.

458
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,920
Go over there. I'm going to get distracted.

459
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,160
Like this. Like this.

460
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,860
Like this.

461
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,810
Do it like this. Like this.

462
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:33,320
Don't do that! It's weird!

463
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:40,670
It's nice to see you smile.

464
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:03,470
He's your brother, right? He definitely said the necklace belonged to his friend, not him.

465
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,960
Brother,

466
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:14,720
Mother couldn't sing lullabies.

467
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,620
Because she couldn't speak.

468
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,500
Let's do it faster.

469
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:16,300
Ban Ryu, you ridiculed it, but you were trying your best.

470
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:21,500
What do you mean I was trying my best? I didn't put in much effort.

471
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:26,210
Even if you didn't put in much effort you were still better than Seon Woo.

472
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:28,880
That jerk...

473
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:39,410
Han Seong, what are you doing in this room?

474
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:44,840
It's so loud that I can't sleep.

475
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,780
I need to do the group dancing with you guys anyway, so I'm sleeping here from now on.

476
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,240
Are you really choosing me?

477
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,080
- Is it really me?
- Ewww.

478
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,060
It's too bad.

479
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:05,210
- I could have enjoyed your company for sleeping.
- What the?

480
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:12,990
I can't believe this. Do you want to die? Aren't you going back?

481
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:16,260
I don't know. I would rather sleep with someone who is like a human.

482
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,810
Hey...

483
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:23,310
Give it back.

484
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,010
Guys?

485
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:40,880
Go!

486
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,860
One, two, three.

487
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:52,990
♫ Grating grating on my torn heart ♫

488
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
♫ Your cold sighs ♫

489
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,380
♫ Ever so slowly like a withering flower ♫

490
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:04,740
But, somehow frivolously dancing with a sword,

491
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,550
and dancing like that?

492
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:11,400
You don't know that dance? Many dance like that in the west.
♫ Damn this love only because of you  ♫

493
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,000
♫ Even if it hurts, I can't stop ♫

494
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,410
Hey, they dance like that with swords?
♫ Even if it kills, for me still it is you ♫ Without you the tears which penetrate my heart ♫

495
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:22,650
That is exactly what you call a "sword dance."
♫ And falling into a black hell ♫

496
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:30,670
Sword dance... Satisfying anyway, since they are working hard.
♫ You are that existence to me ♫

497
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:36,800
♫ You who are turning away turn your feet toward me ♫

498
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,870
♫ I request and want you, you are everything in my life ♫

499
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:51,700
♫ Please carry me off on the dispersing light na na na na na na ♫

500
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,630
♫ It’s gonna be you na na na na na na  ♫

501
00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:01,540
♫ It’s gonna be you na na na na na na  ♫

502
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:06,860
♫ Wo-o-o-o I can't let go ♫

503
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:16,040
Hurry and accept it.

504
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,290
What is this?

505
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:20,600
One appears to be a heartrending love letter and

506
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:25,920
another is a warm letter sent by the father to his son.

507
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:35,860
I heard that you will be performing at the Hangawi Festival in the capital.

508
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:41,750
I will certainly tell my brother, who doesn't know anything, the truth about that day.

509
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:47,330
Also, I would like to meet you and apologize in person.

510
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:51,890
Until then, please be safe from my ignorant brother.

511
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:54,610
I wish you all the best.

512
00:52:55,250 --> 00:53:00,640
There's a lot of talk in the capital about you dancing.

513
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:06,930
Show us your great dancing. I will look forward to it. Soo Yeon.

514
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:29,580
The Queen Dowager has great expectations.

515
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,830
Are you referring to the Hangawi festival?

516
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:35,470
The Hwarang will perform group music and dance.

517
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:38,280
It seems the popularity of Hwarang will continue to rise.

518
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,050
Is there a way?

519
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:47,020
You have to make it so that the disappointment is as big as the expectations.

520
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:52,620
I will have to make the Hwarang laughingstocks in front of the people.

521
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:56,010
Who can do that?

522
00:53:57,010 --> 00:54:01,510
Since it's the first request from his father, he would do well.

523
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:31,100
Are you Teacher Woo Reuk?

524
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:42,220
Are you alright?

525
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:48,020
But young lady who are you?

526
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,890
I heard there were only men at Seonmoon.

527
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:57,800
My name is Ah Ro. My father is Ahn Ji Gong

528
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:05,630
Then, are you Mak Moon's sister?

529
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:07,410
Mak Moon?

530
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,400
That was my brother's name in the past.

531
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,050
It is dried mountain raspberry tea.

532
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:35,430
It will be good for you to drink this tea since your chest feels heavy and you are surprised easily.

533
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,050
With your brother...

534
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:42,290
You aren't like him.

535
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,020
I know as well that we do not look alike.

536
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:50,120
Mak Moon...

537
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,530
was warm-hearted child.

538
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,470
It's Seon Woo, his name now.

539
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:02,430
That's right.

540
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,880
That's right.

541
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:14,630
If I met the person that raised my brother, there was something I wanted to ask.

542
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,050
Did my brother...

543
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:32,160
ever miss me?

544
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:51,210
If you drink this, your head won't hurt and this will help calm your anger.

545
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:55,800
It's that kind of tea, so I will leave it here.

546
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:27,500
This.
♬ Don't look at me with sad eyes ♬

547
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:32,370
It was over there. I heard it's a good medicinal herb.
♬ Your aching heart displays everything♬

548
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:36,790
It prevents headaches and lowers anger.

549
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,130
It's Chrysanthemum.

550
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:42,280
They're not flowers. They are medicine.

551
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,530
I like that you are...

552
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,490
my brother.

553
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:59,400
♬ I'm afraid of being suspended a long time somewhere in memory♬

554
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,600
But you are not.

555
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:07,760
♬ I'm afraid the more I try to wipe it out, the more I will be left yearning ♬

556
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,130
♬ So I can't let it go ♬

557
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:14,370
Who are you?

558
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:29,200
♬ Although you and I became tears for each other ♬

559
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:36,700
♬ After time passed on a bright day ♬
