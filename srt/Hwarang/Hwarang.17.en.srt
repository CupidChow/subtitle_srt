1
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,440
There's no need for that. They're after me.

2
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,770
What are you talking about? If they've entered this place, they're attacking us!

3
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,830
Dog-Bird!

4
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,700
Protect Seon Woo.

5
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,920
Episode 17

6
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,950
If you make a noise, your head will go flying off.

7
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,960
- Who are you?
- Me?

8
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,850
The real owner of the bracelet. The one you've been searching far and wide for.

9
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,790
The faceless King.

10
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,720
King? I thought it was Ahn Ji Gong's son.

11
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,050
No, it's me.

12
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,290
I'm your Lord, Jin Heung.

13
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:49,000
Next time, I'll come to really take your life.

14
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,560
No!

15
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,190
No!

16
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,170
I will not avoid it any longer.

17
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,950
What are you talking about?

18
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:15,090
Now, I must become Silla's real king.

19
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,660
Do you even know what being a King is about?

20
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,280
I've protected Silla. I've endured times when the throne was unstable.

21
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,280
Because I've endured harsh times, it's still the sacred bone's Silla.

22
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,470
You, who haven't even soiled your hands with a single drop of blood,

23
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,780
you who don't even know what it means to protect the throne! The real King of Silla?

24
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,300
I know. It's the Silla that you've protected.

25
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,310
However, your name will not remain anywhere in history,

26
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,280
because Silla's King is none other than me, Jin Heung!

27
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,990
The reason I live is because of you.

28
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,950
You're alive, because I eliminated your enemies first.

29
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:08,500
Didn't you try to use me as an excuse to satisfy your thirst for power?

30
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,830
If you want to feel resentful because of me, do so,

31
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,960
since all you'll have for yourself is that resentment and regret.

32
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,270
It's my Silla.

33
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:27,060
It's my Silla, which I should rightfully rule.

34
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,560
Mo Yeong! Mo Yeong!

35
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,370
Yes, Queen Dowager.

36
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,910
Ahn Ji Gong. Call Ahn Ji Gong.

37
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:29,880
Your Highness, Ahn Ji Gong has gone to Cheonin village to take care of the plague.

38
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,500
Would you like some tea?

39
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,720
Yes. Give me some tea.

40
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,170
I'll have it ready soon.

41
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,210
I'm the faceless king that you've been searching for far and wide.

42
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,820
I'm your Lord, Jin Heung.

43
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,840
Are you alright?

44
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,260
He hasn't hurt anything in particular, but he can't wake up?

45
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:46,240
I looked him over well and although there isn't an undamaged part of his body,

46
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,150
there was no evidence of a fatal injury.

47
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,020
Then why can't he wake up?

48
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,080
He's been weird from the start. The collapsing part.

49
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,760
He collapses?

50
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,200
You didn't know that Seon Woo suddenly collapses?

51
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,560
Is there still no news from the capital?

52
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,450
Damn it.

53
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,700
Doctor! Doctor, please save my child.

54
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,620
Please save my child.

55
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,700
One moment. Lie down over here for a moment.

56
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,830
I'm alright. Please, my child...

57
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,060
Please, just save my child.

58
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,830
Stay strong. He'll be back soon. Just wait a little while.

59
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,920
Isn't that a poisonous herb?

60
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,940
I'll have to use this at least.

61
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,200
- You can't!
- At least this much!

62
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,730
I can't just stand idly by.

63
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,450
Chew this.

64
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:54,880
As long as you can endure the poison, you can live. Chew it.

65
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,600
Mommy! Mom!

66
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,630
By any chance, do you have any ginseng or white peony?

67
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,690
Who has those these days? I don't have any.

68
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:58,300
If we can't obtain the medicine, what will happen to those people?

69
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,580
We have to save them. No matter what.

70
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,110
(Star anise -- still used today as the major source of anti-flu drug Tamiflu)

71
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,270
What is that?

72
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,840
Star anise, that the capital has supposedly run out of...

73
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,670
What is that carriage?

74
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,640
Why is progress so slow?

75
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:59,680
Maybe, because Ahn Ji Gong is treating those in the Cheonin village, the intensity of the plague compared to earlier isn't...

76
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,890
That detestable guy always acts in the most annoying manner.

77
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,560
Shouldn't we put them out in the market now?

78
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,090
Do you know how to turn this medicine into gold?

79
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:19,560
If 70% of the medicine here rots away, this turns into this.

80
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,670
The fear of catching the plague, anxiety about not being able to get medicine

81
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:30,890
is what makes gold. Because of people like Ahn Ji Gong,

82
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,580
my gold is rotting away.

83
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,900
Why do you want to create the Won Hwa again? (Two appointed heads of a society of maidens praised for beauty and filial piety)

84
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,590
Don't you know what happened to Won Hwa Nam Mo and Joon Jeong?

85
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:04,210
Joon Jeong killed Nam Mo out of jealousy. Nam Mo's Nangdoo killed Joon Jeong.

86
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:08,020
You probably know the story differently.

87
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,350
What do I know differently?

88
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:15,400
Stop here. Then, I will also stop.

89
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
You will stop?

90
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:25,830
Give up your regency and abdicate. Also, don't mess with the Hwarang.

91
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:30,690
- Then there will be no trouble.
- How can you, like rebels who destabilize the royal family,

92
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:35,240
utter the word 'abdicate'? They are my Hwarang!

93
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,800
It's not a matter for someone who's no different than a ghost to dare interfere in!

94
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,370
If you had left things as they were, I wouldn't have expected anything from you.

95
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,870
Without a name and as if he hadn't been born,

96
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,830
that's how I would have left him to live.

97
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,820
- Exactly who?
- Everything was

98
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:02,660
- started by Your Highness. Ji So, you are the one who started it!

99
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,410
- Excuse me.
- What, now?

100
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,680
There's something I must tell you.

101
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,930
I got it. So, tell me later.

102
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,740
It's a really important matter that countless lives depend on.

103
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,560
Look, I also don't have a moment to lose right now. Save it for later.

104
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,950
Then, I'll go inside first.

105
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,660
For diarrhea, this is the best medicine.

106
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:21,640
Well then, our industrious one, what did you have to say? People's lives depend on it?

107
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:32,370
Right now, the plague is spreading in Cheonin village. People are dying every day.

108
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:37,050
- But, because there's no medicine, we can't do anything about it.
- What a pity.

109
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:42,080
Every year when the plague hits, the Cheonin are the first to die.

110
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,950
So?

111
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,660
Wait, this is? This is star anise that is good for coughs and colds.

112
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,380
This is medicine that can't be obtained these days. Where did you get it?

113
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:03,020
The capital is out of it and it can't be obtained, even if you pay a premium price. In one place

114
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,580
- it's overflowing to the extent of rotting away.
- Where would that be?

115
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,150
The storage room in Yeong Sil Gong's home.

116
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:19,580
Help us, Poong Wol Joo, so that we can help them. Please, I beg of you.

117
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:26,950
I mean, what kind of power do I have? I don't have a house or a single silver coin.

118
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:32,820
Still... Are you going to watch them die like this??!!!

119
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,560
- Oh, what a scare.
- No matter what it takes, we have to find a solution.

120
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,470
Why are you like this to me?

121
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,090
Poong Wol Joo, you can't.

122
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:52,390
But, have you paid a visit to your brother?

123
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,740
What about my brother?

124
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:01,760
Well, from an assassin the other night, he slightly...

125
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,670
Assassin?

126
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:13,450
Assassin? In any case, there isn't a day that goes by without him getting hurt. If he got seriously hurt, seriously!

127
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:02,260
Who did you think of me as?

128
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,220
I don't think that's important.

129
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:13,530
I have a betrothed. I don't have any thoughts of accepting a half-blood like you as my husband.

130
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,190
However,

131
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:23,920
I must know what this is. This chaotic feeling I get when I see you.

132
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,590
What it is, I must know.

133
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:34,540
It sounds like you're getting confused because of me, but you don't need to bother.

134
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,610
Because, if it was what just happened, I've already forgotten about it.

135
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,300
I didn't say I am curious about what you think.

136
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,830
I'm curious about my heart.

137
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,580
This is a command I'm giving as Silla's Princess.

138
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,650
Until my curiosity is resolved,

139
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,120
don't run away.

140
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:07,390
Until I'm no longer curious,

141
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,710
stay where you are.

142
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:57,080
I'm using that child because I want to use you properly. Because she has the power to move you.

143
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,190
If you assumed the title of king, continue to act like one if you don't want to lose your sister.

144
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:13,700
I heard an assassin entered Seonmoon. Didn't you get hurt?

145
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,640
I'm okay.

146
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,390
Let me see.

147
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,630
I'm totally fine.

148
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,280
If you're finished talking, I'll be on my way.

149
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,990
One moment.

150
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,260
Today's weather is really nice.

151
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,170
That's right.

152
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:06,120
Whoa. Here he goes again. What kind of man plays push-and-pull like that?

153
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,560
Even though I know, it hurts again.

154
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,840
What brings you here?

155
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,460
You were right.

156
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,400
My brother was inside Seonmoon.

157
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,360
Ji Dwi.

158
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,170
- How did you—
- I told you.

159
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,950
It's unfair that you're the only one who knows my brother.

160
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,920
Have others found out about that?

161
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,460
Your greed knows no bounds.

162
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,470
What do you mean by greed?

163
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,810
Your brother was mistaken for the King and even faced an assassin.

164
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:09,360
Are you still protecting my brother as well?

165
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,570
- That's—
- Is Seon Woo

166
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,330
really your brother? The way you look at Seon Woo

167
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,750
isn't the way a sister looks at her brother.

168
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,240
What do you want to say?

169
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:29,470
In one hand, you have my brother. In the other, you have Seon Woo. I'm asking if you aren't weighing your options.

170
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,100
Princess, you are the one who is being greedy.

171
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:39,600
Wanting to have someone even though he doesn't like you is being greedy.

172
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,950
It's not like that for me. It's different.

173
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,880
I understand the reason why Her Highness the Queen Dowager chose you.

174
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,480
You... really get on my nerves.

175
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,530
Chose me. What does that mean?

176
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,060
Is it a metaphorical expression to say that Ban Ryu

177
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,230
has returned to his old self since he's sitting over there?

178
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,130
Metaphorical my ass. He's expressing it directly.

179
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,040
Where were you last night?

180
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,680
Don't concern yourself with my whereabouts.

181
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,820
An assassin entered. Seon Woo almost died. But I didn't see you at all through the night.

182
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,420
Is this coincidence?

183
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:04,970
Whatever you imagine has nothing to do with me. Instead, get out of my way.

184
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,650
I lost my appetite since I'm looking at the Queen Dowager's dog.

185
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,850
Are you running away again? As the bad guy?

186
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:19,810
I'm warning you, don't pretend to be my friend.

187
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,410
You must not be related to this incident at all.

188
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:30,170
Because, if you are in the slightest, you're a son of a bitch. So, I'll kill you.

189
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:48,460
Here, eat.

190
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,470
Thanks.

191
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,290
What's up?

192
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:18,520
Because an assassin came in the other night, the atmosphere totally feels like you're being acknowledged as the King.

193
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,350
Don't pay attention to him.

194
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:29,640
Are you (formal tone)... okay (informal tone)?

195
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,930
You know that you're also acting weird, right?

196
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,090
I know.

197
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,220
Eat this. It's delicious.

198
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:52,460
Since we're talking about it, are you really His Majesty?

199
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:58,230
I mean, well, you can give us a slight hint.

200
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,320
What?

201
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,340
I'm not hungry.

202
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,890
What brings you here? (casual speech)

203
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,700
What brings you here? (formal speech)

204
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:47,120
Sit down. It's natural for a distant nephew like me to be standing.

205
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,500
Also, aren't you my teacher?

206
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,520
If you give me a command,

207
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,520
I think I'll be able to become a bit more comfortable.

208
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,020
A command?

209
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,990
Then.

210
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:13,200
If I'm to become a real king, didn't you say I had to deal with things?

211
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,860
Yes, that's what I told you.

212
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:24,190
After I deal with things, then what else do I have to do?

213
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:30,930
Get a person on your side. If I were a faceless king,

214
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,920
I would get someone powerful.

215
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,890
Someone powerful.

216
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,420
Someone like Park Yeong Sil?

217
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,300
Yes.

218
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:47,320
If you can get Park Yeong Sil, please do so.

219
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:53,780
Then, all the power that he has will also become Your Majesty's.

220
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,420
If I can obtain it, do so?

221
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,330
What if I can't...

222
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,560
and I have to kill him?

223
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:10,090
Have I obtained you?

224
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,640
You've obtained your cause.

225
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,060
My cause?

226
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:25,090
If it weren't for my cause, are you saying you would've chosen someone else?

227
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:32,500
Sometimes, a selection isn't something that's better.

228
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,730
It can also be the lesser of the two evils.

229
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,490
Until when are you going to run away?

230
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,140
You, don't you have something to tell me?

231
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,540
How does it feel pretending to be the King?

232
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:18,890
You should know what it feels like.

233
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,660
I've never pretended to be the King.

234
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,790
You've never been a real one either.

235
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:35,720
Don't think you know everything because I'm also doing everything I can.

236
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,320
I'm also...fighting as well!

237
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:53,630
Fight? Is that what your fight is about? Running away, hiding, and avoiding things?

238
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:58,110
It's a fight hoping that Silla will become better.

239
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:03,350
A fight hoping that the citizens won't die because of Silla's bone rank order system.

240
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:08,800
Never again will ordinary citizens become robbers!

241
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,620
A fight that protects.

242
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,930
The plague is spreading in Cheonin village.

243
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:30,730
We must quickly distribute medicine and take care of it. Even in the capital,

244
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,850
we have run out of medicine for the plague.

245
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:39,380
Right now, we have so many immediate concerns. Are we going to spend our time with a mere plague in Cheonin village?

246
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:46,140
You're right. South Buyeo and Goguryeo's sense of order seems off. Will you just sit idly by?

247
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:51,980
We don't know when the plague will take over the capital. Aren't you even afraid?

248
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:58,730
If we can no longer collect more taxes, we should all make a united effort and get rid of the source.

249
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,510
Don't we just have to open the palace storage room at Wolsong?

250
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:07,170
If we distribute the grain and medicine in Wolsung's storage house, we'd probably be able to save a Cheonin and then some.

251
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:10,120
What are you going to do if the plague strikes the capital?

252
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,450
Wolsung is like the capital's final remaining fort.

253
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:17,000
Without being equipped with medicine, how will we prepare for the plague?

254
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,810
Isn't the situation the same for everyone?

255
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:25,730
If the Cheonin are that precious, why don't you empty out the storehouse?

256
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,680
What?!

257
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,780
Even if that mere Cheonin village disappears entirely, nothing will change.

258
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:37,840
Anyway, since they know that any Cheonin who climbs over the palace walls will die, they won't do it so thoughtlessly.

259
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,120
When will you abdicate?

260
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,030
Didn't you tell me?

261
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:46,640
- That Hwarang is Sam Maek Jong.
- Abdicate!

262
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,580
- Come down from the throne.
- Now, come down!

263
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:54,790
Abdicate!

264
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,420
Abdicate!

265
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,600
Now the time has come for you to step down!

266
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,930
Abdicate!

267
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:05,820
Abdicate!

268
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,750
Your Highness, are you alright?

269
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,390
We asked whether we should dispatch an envoy to Goguryeo.

270
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:37,660
Like I said before, until they apologize for their mistakes

271
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:45,310
and promise that they won't make the same provocations, trade with them is impossible.

272
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:21,330
A fight hoping that Silla will get better.

273
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:26,470
A fight hoping that the citizens will never die because of the bone rank order system.

274
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:34,880
Never again will an ordinary citizen become a robber! A fight that protects.

275
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:50,570
Hey, Seon Woo. Poong Wol Joo is looking for you.

276
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,160
Ji Dwi, you too.

277
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,920
Don't ask me why he's looking for you two. I don't know either.

278
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,750
The reason why I called you two

279
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:09,960
is to give you a problem to solve.

280
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,670
Come in.

281
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,270
Now come to me.

282
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,190
Because I'll live not as anyone's king, but as your Jin Heung.

283
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:40,060
Right now, are you using me as an excuse to run away?

284
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:46,180
Someone who has given up knows by looking into one's eyes.

285
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:51,580
Your Majesty has never given up.

286
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:13,900
Here is someone who manages the work of many by herself. She's a doctor at Seonmoon, but outside of it

287
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,680
she does a variety of work. Well, you know her well without any introductions.

288
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:23,960
Anyway, she found out an interesting fact.

289
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,970
Briefing.

290
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:45,660
In truth, we're out of medicine to treat the plague in the capital and all of Silla.

291
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:52,940
Right now in Cheonin village, the plague is spreading and the Cheonin are dying with us not being able to do anything.

292
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,850
By coincidence, I came to know of where this medicine is.

293
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:02,090
That is...in Gakgan Yeong Sil Gong's storage room.

294
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:10,350
In that storage room, there's more than enough medicine to treat the plague in Silla.

295
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:14,230
Even though it's rotting away, they aren't opening their doors or selling it.

296
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:21,950
Except, if they hear that a little bit of the medicine has become available, they buy it all and keep it stored there.

297
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:26,390
So, in the capital, we're in a state where we can't buy medicine, even if we pay premium prices.

298
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,700
Yeong Sil Gong is waiting until the plague becomes more rampant

299
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:34,710
and plans to sell the medicine at prices more expensive than gold.

300
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:39,730
Before then, the Cheonin in the village will all die out.

301
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:49,440
This is a problem. How should we solve it?

302
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,860
What do you mean by solving a problem?

303
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:56,960
As you've heard, if we delay, the lives of the Cheonin in the village

304
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,850
will be at stake.

305
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,490
What will you do?

306
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:13,910
Both of you must solve this problem together.

307
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:18,300
The reason is, regarding the role of the King,

308
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:25,010
I have a guess as to who will be wondering about you more than anyone.

309
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,120
Well, if it isn't, then forget it.

310
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:34,300
In any case, I've given you the problem. So, solve it.

311
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:38,850
This problem isn't about passing or failing.

312
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,510
It doesn't matter if you solve it or not.

313
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:47,950
It's fine if you leave and pretend as if you never heard anything.

314
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:55,770
All decisions will need to be made directly by you two.

315
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,950
What do you want to do?

316
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:19,330
Why did you do that? Don't you know those Hwarang's personalities?

317
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,860
They're immediately going to create some kind of trouble.

318
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:25,920
I called them to create some kind of trouble.

319
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,160
If you don't create some kind of trouble, this world won't change.

320
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:38,210
How they're going to go about it is up to them.

321
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:43,340
Their awakening might

322
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:48,010
change Silla a little bit.

323
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,340
You can't solve it.

324
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,310
Why do you think I can't solve it?

325
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,890
Because you don't know.

326
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:07,560
How they live, what kind of people they are, how beautiful that place is.

327
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,340
As a result, how worthy they are of protecting. You don't know.

328
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:16,310
I know that stacking up medicine in a storage room and doing business with people's lives is worthy of death.

329
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:20,050
You're not the only one. I also get upset when I see something that is unjust.

330
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:24,080
You wouldn't know how persistent your heart has to be for that.

331
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:31,270
Don't we just need to reach the same conclusion? I'm also solving it.

332
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:34,360
- I have one answer.
- Same with me.

333
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,460
Dog-Bird!

334
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,610
Protect Seon Woo.

335
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,250
You better not be related to this incident in any way,

336
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:02,610
because even if you're slightly involved, you're a son of a bitch.

337
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:06,280
So, I'll kill you.

338
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:28,460
Have you been well all this time?

339
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,070
I longed for you so much.

340
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:41,760
I tried not to, but I couldn't help wanting to see you.

341
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,580
That's why I came.

342
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:55,150
It's okay if you changed your mind. Now, it's okay if you don't think I'm pretty.

343
00:40:55,150 --> 00:41:01,760
Still, I'm so thankful to you, Ban Ryu.
♬  When the path on which I fearlessly ♬

344
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,320
♬  went out and searched for the small dream ♬

345
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,090
I thought there were only men like my brother in the world,

346
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:13,600
but you let me know that there are also good men like you in the world.

347
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:20,650
So, I appreciate you.

348
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,120
♫  Like a dream ♬

349
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,740
I wanted to see you just one more time.

350
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,900
Because, as it is,

351
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:34,920
I don't have the confidence to send you off.

352
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,460
But,

353
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,210
since I'm looking at you like this,

354
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,620
I miss you even more.

355
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:51,190
♬ I'm fine with you as the only one.♬

356
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,840
♬  I will find the star ♬

357
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:58,520
♬  until I reach the dream suspended high in the sky ♬

358
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:03,380
I want to hurt your heart.

359
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:09,050
When you think of me, you will think of that wound first

360
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,900
so you can forget about a guy like me.

361
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:17,140
I want to hurt your heart, I know I should do it...

362
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:25,600
But when I see your face, I can't think of anything so run away.

363
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:32,820
I'm a bad guy. So,

364
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,590
run away as far as possible from me,

365
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:40,560
before you get hurt.

366
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,050
♬  If I even try to ask my heart over and over ♬

367
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:49,590
You're not a bad guy. I know.

368
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:52,880
You're a good person, Ban Ryu.

369
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:59,050
♬  In an hourglass which can't be stopped ♬

370
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,840
You're doing what?

371
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:05,200
No way. Really?

372
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,730
Are you going to do it with us or not?

373
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:10,200
I'm not sure.

374
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,260
I have a reason I must do it, but you guys don't have to.

375
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:18,410
I can't take responsibility for it so think it over carefully.

376
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:19,950
I'll do it.

377
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,390
I'm doing it because of me. Because it sounds like something that should be done.

378
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,200
After hearing about this, do you think I'll be able to sleep?

379
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:36,010
Fine, well. Although the Gagkan may be my father.

380
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:38,890
Don't you have too many fathers in the capital?

381
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,730
By the way, what are you going to do about Ban Ryu?

382
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:50,360
Ban Ryu can't.

383
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,580
Naturally, he wouldn't be able to. It's emptying the Gagkan's storage house.

384
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,350
He would expose all of our plans.

385
00:43:56,350 --> 00:44:02,280
It's not like that. It's something that can hold him back. We can't do that to him.

386
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,990
Anyway, we have to do it without him knowing.

387
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:42,980
Come over here! Come over here!

388
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:50,140
Who are you?

389
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,400
Sorry, sorry.

390
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:59,680
Tell him that Hwarangdo's Poong Wol Joo came to drink 30-year-old red wine.

391
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,760
Pardon?

392
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:06,560
Poong Wol Joo is here! Wi Hwa has arrived!

393
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:15,280
Please draw the attention of Yeong Sil, Gagkan, or whoever he is.

394
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,170
Why are you asking that of me?

395
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:26,270
Because I don't want to fail. I must save those people at all costs.

396
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:31,470
Wow, now you know how to mind your manners around me.

397
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,990
Dog-Bird, you make me do all sorts of...

398
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:50,150
Where's the outhouse?

399
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:17,560
Where's the outhouse?

400
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,950
You can't go over there.

401
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:22,180
Look, I'm about to go in my pants.

402
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,990
- This isn't the outhouse.
- No, I'm going to go right here, okay?

403
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,700
Let go! All of you. I'm Poong Wol Joo!

404
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,960
What are you doing?

405
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,620
Let go. I'm Poong Wol Joo!

406
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:42,630
Aigoo, hello? Yeong Sil Gong is waiting for you. Escort him.

407
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:45,400
That's right. But, I have a bit of an emergency.

408
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,490
- Escort him.
- Yes.

409
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:49,430
Hey! My body!

410
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,710
Hey, you! Your hands on my body... I just had diarrhea.

411
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:56,690
Are you there?

412
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,020
Who are you?

413
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,370
We came from Wolsung. ( Location of the palace.)

414
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:04,320
From Wolsung? What for?

415
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,070
Escort her.

416
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:12,120
Why are you doing this? I should at least know the reason. Why are you doing this?

417
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,190
What brings you here at this time of night?

418
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:20,130
After having a glass of alcohol,

419
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:27,260
I thought of the red wine you spoke of the other day.

420
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,030
You suddenly thought about red wine?

421
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:32,060
Yes.

422
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:40,300
Besides Seonmoon, I heard that many excellent swordsmen

423
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,770
were here at your house as your subordinates.

424
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:51,360
Send a few of them to Seonmoon.

425
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:56,380
Recently, an assassin entered Seonmoon and

426
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:59,920
there was an incident that put the Hwarang at a security risk.

427
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:03,390
Why?

428
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,840
Have you already sent them?

429
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:20,500
Father! Father!

430
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,690
Where is Father? Father.

431
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:27,920
Hey, I have something to tell Father.

432
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,690
Hey, before he starts a fire, hurry up and escort him.

433
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,030
Tell Father to come!

434
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:38,980
Hey, let go. I told you to let go!

435
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,720
Escort him quietly.

436
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,560
Let go. Hey. Let go.

437
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,100
It's Ban Ryu, Father.

438
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,920
Ban Ryu?

439
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,250
What are you doing?

440
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:04,660
Please kill me.

441
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,200
Did you drink?

442
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,700
Yes, I did.

443
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:17,570
Because I was tormented...so tormented, I drank.

444
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:24,000
You took me in as your adopted son early on with ambitious hopes.

445
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:31,730
But, because I've only disappointed you every time, I can't live and endure it.

446
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:33,890
Even the assassins at Seonmoon this time—

447
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:36,050
Won't you shut up?

448
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:11,880
I've seen all kinds of crazy behavior, but this takes the cake.

449
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,500
There aren't only one or two places like this.

450
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,720
More gold and medicine than the royal family.

451
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:22,070
This kind of person is Silla's Gagkan.

452
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:24,510
Is this the norm for this place?

453
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:28,370
No. This isn't it.

454
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:31,580
We don't have time to stand around like this. Quickly.

455
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:41,440
Here,

456
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,030
I will die.

457
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:50,220
Fine, how bad he must have felt...

458
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,390
Drag him out!

459
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:58,220
Don't come. If you do, you all die!

460
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:02,990
I'm Park Ban Ryu.

461
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:06,020
The future king of Silla!

462
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,840
Move. You're not moving?

463
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,280
- That ambitious dream
- Don't come near me.

464
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,830
was to be Silla's king.

465
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:22,170
- Hey! I'm Park Ban Ryu.
- Grab him!

466
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:26,240
Won't you let go!

467
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,340
Put it down.

468
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,320
I'm Park Ban Ryu. I said I'm Park Ban Ryu!

469
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:47,830
Who is this?

470
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,580
How nice to see you, Dog-Bird.

471
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,390
Doh Go.

472
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:59,440
They're the guys we saw in the capital.

473
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:05,660
Thanks to you, on rainy days, it still really hurts where I got hit by the arrow.

474
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:11,240
Hey, me first. I have more negative feelings towards them.

475
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,490
I didn't even know anything, but I needlessly hung around.

476
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:18,360
Take him!

477
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,800
Let's go.

478
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,430
Ahn Ji Gong.

479
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:25,790
♬  When the path on which I fearlessly went out♬

480
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:28,340
♬  and searched for the small dream ♬

481
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:32,730
♬ which was concealed in the flickering starlight♬

482
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:35,910
♬  was more than I could bear♬

483
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:42,400
Eum Jin Dae Seo. Drink and smile broadly.

484
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,850
Could it be?

485
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:46,920
It's the Joo Ryeong Gu. (14 sided dice used during Silla dynasty)

486
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,310
It's him.

487
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:54,450
♬ and even a shard of my crushed heart ♬

488
00:53:54,450 --> 00:54:03,610
♬ became a light in your breath.♬

489
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:07,760
♬ I'm fine with you as the only one.♬

490
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,350
It's the first time I've seen so much gold since I was born.

491
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:14,920
But, why did Ban Ryu cause such an uproar earlier?

492
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:20,300
♬ Even if darkness surrounds me, you are the only one I will never throw away ♬

493
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:23,520
It's too close to call it a coincidence.

494
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,440
♫  Always be mine  ♫

495
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,390
Thanks.

496
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:37,910
♫  Come closer  ♫

497
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:46,200
Sometimes, I think what it would've been like

498
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:49,210
if you had ascended the throne.

499
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,740
If you had, I

500
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:58,720
wouldn't have had to live while giving up all those things.

501
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:04,770
I wouldn't have had to go through those horrific years.

502
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:10,400
Everything was started by Your Highness.

503
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,080
Ji So, you started it all!

504
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:21,020
20 years ago, Wolsung

505
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:35,030
You... I have to kill you.

506
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:37,430
Your Highness.

507
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:40,470
You'll continue to be a source of trouble.

508
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:44,300
Please spare my life.

509
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,820
We were incomparably close friends.

510
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:53,090
I no longer need a Won Hwa, who will interfere with Silla's royal family.

511
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:57,360
Just like Nam Mo died, you also cannot live.

512
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:05,700
You must be framed for everything. For my son's sake, I must kill you.

513
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,090
- What is it?
- Ah Ro.

514
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:45,390
Ah Ro was dragged to the palace.

515
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:47,710
- When?
- Did you know about this?

516
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,150
I'm asking you when!

517
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:17,200
Sam Maek Jong says he'll become the King.

518
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,800
Sam Maek Jong wasn't like that before.

519
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:29,000
He was a kind king, who was waiting to inherit Silla from me.

520
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,430
Did you make him change like that?

521
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:43,090
Did you shake up Sam Maek Jong's heart

522
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:46,820
just like your mother did to your father!?

523
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:51,950
I'm... I'm not it. I've never done such a thing.

524
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,490
It doesn't matter.

525
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:03,280
I'm going to make you into a Won Hwa.

526
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:08,990
And I'm going to make you live a Won Hwa's fate.

527
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:30,130
♬  Because I knew our ending would hurt ♬

528
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:36,820
♬ Because I wish for a miracle like in movies♬
