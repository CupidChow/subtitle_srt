1
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,050
Episode 10

2
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,010
Are you okay, Your Highness?

3
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,760
I have to rest for a moment.

4
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,230
I will escort you.

5
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,440
Never mind. I will go with the head of the guards.

6
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,310
Was it your idea, Mother?

7
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,230
- Where is he? I can't find him...
- For whom are you looking?

8
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,110
Hyung Ji Dwi and Hyung Ban Ryu.

9
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,630
If we don't find them quickly, we all get fails.

10
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,770
What? Did you say "a fail?"

11
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,910
Where did they go?

12
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,540
Oh!

13
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,590
What? He was here.

14
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,630
What is the reason you sent Sook Myeong to Seonmoon ( Hwarang school)?

15
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,710
Who is that?

16
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,740
The Queen Dowager?

17
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,680
When the King is at the Seonmoon is there any reason that the Princess cannot?

18
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,600
Mother.

19
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,490
Mother...?

20
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,980
If you are uncomfortable with Sook Myeong at Hwarang, then you can leave Hwarang.

21
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,520
A king dancing in front of his citizens...

22
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,500
Do you really want to throw away your dignity as a king?

23
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,390
Why does it matter, when no one knows I am King?

24
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,450
If you, Mother, do not hand me the throne, I cannot be King anyway.

25
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,530
Then... Ji...

26
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,300
Ji-Ji Dwi is...

27
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,330
King Jinheung?

28
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,620
You ask why I sent Sook Myeong?

29
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,310
According to the tradition of the sacred bone, Sook Myeong will be your bride.

30
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,120
I can't let that happen.

31
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,980
I'll decide who will be my bride.

32
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,940
Do you still not know?

33
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,220
Your heart doesn't matter.

34
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,870
Did you finish well?

35
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,220
You completed it well?

36
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,620
This is not just a simple act of ripping the drum and ruining the festival.

37
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,870
Did you not know? Right now, Yeong Sil Gong is testing you with this task.

38
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,160
If you fail, everything that we have worked for

39
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,020
will disappear in vain. Is that what you want?

40
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,030
Are you that scared?

41
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,530
What?

42
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,530
Are you that scared of Yeong Sil Gong.

43
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,750
You brat!

44
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,900
It's all for your sake.

45
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,650
If this ends up well,

46
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:21,250
your godfather will make good use of you.

47
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,990
When our great success is so close, how can you be so foolish?

48
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,420
I know that you're doing this for my sake,

49
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,820
but you don't care about what I think.

50
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,090
How did things go?

51
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,320
It was completed well.

52
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,390
Good.

53
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,830
- What do we do now?
- Aish!

54
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,690
- We're doomed.
- We're doomed.

55
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,940
We must let the Queen know about this immediately and stop everything.

56
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,280
We cannot make the Hwarang laughingstocks in front of all the people in the capital.

57
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,920
- There is no solution to this.
- It's Ban Ryu's doing.

58
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,920
- I won't leave him alone!
- Looks like we're done for.

59
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,800
- We cannot dance?
- No.

60
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,280
If he is the man I know, he won't end like this.

61
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,890
Ban Ryu!

62
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,280
You! We're you thinking of doing this since the beginning?

63
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,800
He's just the same, this bastard!

64
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,700
Restrain yourself.

65
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,020
If we fail this, I won't let you go.

66
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,810
Then... I will end your life for sure.

67
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,780
Be quiet, you fool! I'm trying to concentrate.

68
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,890
This will work?

69
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,400
Who am I?

70
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,020
Who is who? A crazy old man from Mang Mang village.

71
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,090
You...

72
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,920
You again... beating me, huh?

73
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,410
The Greatest Musician Woo Reuk.

74
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,190
The Greatest or the Worst, what are you planning to do?

75
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,960
I have to make something.

76
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,250
In the end, an accident occurred...

77
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,020
Is that what you are saying?

78
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,220
In truth, it is right before an accident will strike.

79
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:14,060
Did you plan this in the first place, to embarrass the Royal Family? Or...

80
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,900
Are you incompetent in controlling Hwarang?

81
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,720
Whatever happens, Hwarang must perform.

82
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you understand?

83
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,400
Yes. I'll keep that in mind, Princess Sook Myeong.

84
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,970
It was done as you instructed.

85
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,620
Isn't she Ahn Ji Gong's daughter?

86
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,910
Yes, that is correct.

87
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,430
Did this child see?

88
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,570
It seems that she heard the conversation between Your Highness and His Majesty.

89
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,330
Did you really?

90
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:11,370
According to the tradition of the sacred bone, Sook Myeong will be your bride.

91
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,590
I can't allow that. I'll decide who will be my bride.

92
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,790
Do you still not know?

93
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,610
Your heart doesn't matter.

94
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,630
Something bad has happened.

95
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,830
What?

96
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,560
Somehow, I think she heard.

97
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,120
What?

98
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,890
The words shared between Your Majesty and the Queen Dowager.

99
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,320
Who do you mean?

100
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,510
Doctor Ah Ro.

101
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,810
What?

102
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,970
Then, that girl

103
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,530
found out who I am?

104
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,130
Yes.

105
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,530
Anyway, I think Hyun Choo (the head of the guards) has taken that girl away.

106
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,520
My Mother took her to kill her.

107
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,160
I can't let Ah Ro die! That can't happen!

108
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,020
Your Majesty!

109
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,230
Wh-Where am I?

110
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,000
Your...

111
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,770
Your Highness Queen Dowager.

112
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,280
What did you see?

113
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,990
Did you see the King?

114
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,910
Your Majesty!

115
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,510
Your Majesty!

116
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,820
- Move.
- If you save that doctor,

117
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,710
you are endangering yourself.

118
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,580
If they kill that child,

119
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,960
you will end up seeing with your own eyes

120
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,740
how dangerous I can be.

121
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,930
I asked whether you saw the King.

122
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,740
If...

123
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:24,370
If... Ji-Ji Dwi...

124
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,470
is the King you mean...

125
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,520
I saw.

126
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,460
I know your father Ahn Ji Gong.

127
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,560
I know.

128
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,550
You took after your mother a lot.

129
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,610
The fact that you resent my mother,

130
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,420
I also know.

131
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,830
How can I let you live?

132
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,090
I searched for a way.

133
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,900
But,

134
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,980
I couldn't find one.

135
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,170
Kill her.

136
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:39,730
Please spare me. Please spare me, please spare me!

137
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,310
Please spare me.

138
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,380
Kneel! I am your monarch.

139
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,970
Your Majesty.

140
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,960
What... What are you doing?

141
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:25,400
I tried so hard to protect you... but

142
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,320
are you now ruining it yourself?

143
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,580
This child is one of my subjects.

144
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:36,180
The only subject who can comfort the King of Shilla. Therefore,

145
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,340
I must protect her.

146
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,140
- Sam Maek Jong!
- I am not Sam Maek Jong but Jin Heung!

147
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,510
This nation's King!

148
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,440
I must break that child and Sam Maek Jong apart.

149
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,540
Whatever it takes.

150
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:51,240
Are you... really... the king?

151
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,920
Yes.

152
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,900
Why aren't you saying anything? Even though you said I was the king.

153
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:14,840
Do you seriously not know how huge a confession this is?

154
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,290
It's not that...

155
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:22,680
It's just because... everything I've done all that time has come to mind...

156
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,980
What has come to mind, though?

157
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,280
Well... that...

158
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,410
Are you seriously such a crazy guy, coming to ask for me to put you to sleep?

159
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,370
Watch what happens if you take a step closer.

160
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:48,070
I know a few pressure points that will make you impotent, and I will press one of those!

161
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,210
You won't be able to move for a short while.

162
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,380
Next time, I'll press the actual pressure point to make you a useless man.

163
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,530
Don't come closer.

164
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,910
Why was I like that?

165
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:04,170
I heard such crap like a dog's barking.

166
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,410
Does your mother know you're like this?

167
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,640
I am doomed!!

168
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:19,970
Are you going to kill me?

169
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,760
Since we have shared some nice moments together,

170
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,290
I'll let you decide how I will kill you.

171
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,440
How about Peang Hyeong? The punishment with boiling a person in a pot?

172
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,610
Really.

173
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,080
Am I not offensive?

174
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,500
Considering many facts so far,

175
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,050
I don't think I should know you... I mean... Your Majesty.

176
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,190
People who have seen the King's face...

177
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,690
They say they died, right?

178
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,130
However, you are my only subject who knows that I am me.

179
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,370
The most special person to me.

180
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:33,290
So, don't keep on acting awkwardly and just act as you normally do.

181
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,700
Because of you I'll get caught again.

182
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:49,670
♬ Don't look at me with sad eyes ♬

183
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:57,220
♬ Your aching heart displays everything ♬

184
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:03,580
Where were you?
♬ If you keep doing that you will just leave me ♬

185
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,490
She was with me.

186
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,560
I didn't ask you.

187
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:14,330
♬ When you only offer me tears, what can I do? ♬

188
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,900
Then...

189
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,860
Go. Go, please... I was grateful today.
♬ I'm afraid of being suspended a long time somewhere in memory ♬

190
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,080
Why is she greeting like this?

191
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,440
♬ I'm afraid the more I try to wipe it out, the more I will be left yearning ♬

192
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:41,340
♬ So I can't let you go ♬

193
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:51,800
♬ Although you and I became tears for each other♬

194
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:57,710
♬ After time passed on a bright day♬

195
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,040
Where did you go?

196
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,800
Do you know how much I worried?

197
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,130
Why would you?

198
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,950
You're not my orabeoni, nor even anything, so why would you worry about me?

199
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,860
I said that I am following what your real brother wanted to do for you.

200
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,430
I also told you

201
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,180
that I don't like you being my orabeoni, that I'm not accepting it.

202
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,490
There's somewhere we should go together.

203
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,370
Not with me.

204
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,520
Let go of me! Let go!

205
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,260
Let go!

206
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,620
I said let go!

207
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,440
♬ There is neither a start nor an end and ♬

208
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:47,930
♬ By myself I'm saying goodbye. If you even remove two letters ♬

209
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,790
What is this?

210
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,150
This is your sister.

211
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,800
I'm sorry that I brought her so late.

212
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,130
As you said, she is pretty,

213
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,910
but she's not kind.

214
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,720
She isn't smart either.

215
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,960
Look as much as you like.

216
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:23,460
It's your sister whom you said you wanted to see so much.

217
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,920
Do you think she's grown this much?

218
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,580
No...

219
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,950
This much?

220
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,810
Good!

221
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:36,580
If we go to the capital, I'll even give you my sister.

222
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,980
You'll be really surprised. She's really...

223
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,610
really... pretty.

224
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,480
He meant to go to you.

225
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,530
He said that he saw you with that necklace in the Okta store.

226
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,780
and that he definitely must go see you again.

227
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,340
Up till the end he missed you and was concerned about you.

228
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,240
♬ Although you and I became tears for each other ♬

229
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,420
♬ After time passed on a bright day ♬

230
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:25,290
♬ when we just held each other and it was just like a dream ♬

231
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:31,800
I'm sorry that it was me.
♬ I remember that time then ♬

232
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,270
Instead of your brother...

233
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,320
I survived.

234
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,160
What kind of person was Orabeoni.

235
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,250
He smiled a lot and often shared his things with others.

236
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,710
The kindest person in the entire world.

237
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:23,470
He was a brother, a mother and the only family to me.

238
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,890
It would have been nice if I had met him in person.

239
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:59,650
Even if you do this, you are not my brother.

240
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,930
I don't like it. I don't accept it.

241
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,470
Whatever you say, I will live as your orabeoni.

242
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:11,460
It doesn't matter whether you like it or not.

243
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,500
Because that way I can be at your side.

244
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,180
Because that way I can protect you.

245
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,660
Protecting you

246
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,700
is the only reason I am still living.

247
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,190
Did you see?

248
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,840
He grew up well.

249
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,170
I apologize for not being able to keep my promise.

250
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,150
That is that child's fate.

251
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,520
Will you just leave him like this without doing anything?

252
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:09,920
There might be a chance, that he can live quietly like that with no trouble, don't you think?

253
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,580
In all honesty, I wish fort that.

254
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,770
A poison which makes one sick very slowly, but

255
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:32,070
until one consumes more than the certain amount, there are no particular symptoms.

256
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,480
Is Ahn Ji Gong here?

257
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,560
Who are you?

258
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,310
Hwi Hyeong Gong?

259
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,110
It's been a long time, Ahn Ji Gong.

260
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,900
Why have you come...?

261
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:16,050
I came to get treatment for my legs by the best doctor in the Three Kingdoms.

262
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,850
Infantile paralysis (poliomyelitis).

263
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:25,890
That is the disease I can't do anything about, when the right timing has been missed.

264
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:30,670
Well, that is why I ended up like this.

265
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,760
If my body could have ridden a horse and appeared on the battlefield

266
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,050
I wouldn't have lost my rank as a successor to the throne.

267
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:49,550
They wouldn't have removed my name from the sacred bone list.

268
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:53,870
What is the reason you sought me?

269
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,090
On the night of the festival,

270
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:03,190
your daughter was captured and dragged on a horse into the palace by the head guard.

271
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,100
In any case, it seems like Ji So will hurt your child.

272
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:16,700
What is the reason for telling me this?

273
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:22,500
Let's say, this is the payback for what you've done for me.

274
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:29,230
Instead of making Hwarang laughingstocks, we ended up making them popular.

275
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,700
The entire country is talking about Hwarang.

276
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,220
We helped the Queen earn something good.

277
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:39,140
That's why in the beginning, I said we have to prevent Hwarang from forming.

278
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,390
Geez.

279
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,060
So it turns out

280
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:50,140
Poong Wol Joo is better than we thought.

281
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,170
He's slowly making Hwarang his.

282
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:57,720
So, shouldn't we think of some kind of plan?

283
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,350
I heard that Queen Dowager placed Sook Myeong inside Seonmoon.

284
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:06,260
We should put someone in there too.

285
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:13,640
Just because you didn't want to participate, did you think we couldn't make things happen? No matter what, things will happen as we planned.

286
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,470
Don't delude yourself into thinking you already have become a full son of Yeong Sil Gong.

287
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:22,810
You and me, both can lose everything as soon as we disappoint Yeong Sil Gong with even one mistake.

288
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,160
Forget about having a father like me. Also,

289
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,450
think of a way to get recognized by Yeong Sil Gong.

290
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:35,900
That is the only way both you and I will survive.

291
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,400
Father Gakgan and Father Japchan...

292
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,200
That means, I don't have any father.

293
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:51,000
One father is not recognizing me as his son yet, and the other is

294
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:55,040
telling me to forget about him.

295
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,000
What are you so happy about

296
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,800
while my insides are so drying up from worry that I feel I could die?

297
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,150
It was fortunate.

298
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,810
The first person who discovered my real identity was that child.

299
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:29,370
To be honest, it didn't look like she was that pretty.

300
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,790
Haven't you seen the women in this Okta store?

301
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,380
Compared to all the girls here, Ah Ro's appearance is...

302
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,130
That's why you haven't been successful.

303
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:40,190
You don't have the eyes to recognize pretty women.

304
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,040
I don't know that I don't have eyes to recognize women.

305
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,180
I can foresee that the Queen Dowager will not end this quietly.

306
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:53,400
If someone puts that child in danger, no matter who it is, kill him.

307
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,900
Even if that is Hyeon Choo, the head guard.

308
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,040
This is an order.

309
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,490
I will accept that order.

310
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,100
- The musical instruments... did you really not ruin them?
- Hey, Hey.

311
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,300
Has it been a while, Ban Ryu?

312
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,990
Aren't you thankful?

313
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,510
You should have done well,

314
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,700
then I wouldn't have had to do it instead. Don't you think so?

315
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:27,520
How are you so sure that Ban Ryu didn't do it?

316
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:32,300
That guy chews his lip when something unjust happens to him.

317
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,320
I saw him do that.

318
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,790
Do you think he would do something crappy like that with his personality?

319
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,410
He wouldn't do it, even if he died and came back.

320
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,370
I don't know if you are enemies or friends.

321
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,920
It's weird.

322
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,030
You know everything about him, but you don't know about "the breast incident."

323
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,040
Don't mention that breast thing.

324
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,050
- Was that my sister just now?
- Yeah, that was that breast I said.

325
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,240
Ah, seriously. Mouth.

326
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,470
Is she ignoring me? And what is with that wine bottle?

327
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:12,550
I heard that Ban Ryu touched Soo Ho's sister's chest.

328
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,830
- Isn't that your sister?
- What on earth are you doing to me?

329
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,960
Did Ban Ryu violate her?

330
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,400
- Did he just touch her?
- Let go of me!

331
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,710
Soo Ho?

332
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,910
Hey! Come out!

333
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,400
Soo Ho?

334
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,600
This bastard. I'm going to kill him.

335
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,270
Ban Ryu!

336
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,900
What the...

337
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,460
Let's go over there for a second.

338
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:14,120
I'm thankful.

339
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,800
And the performance yesterday was cool too.

340
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,980
This a valuable red wine. Please accept it.

341
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,920
- Why are you doing this?
- Let go!

342
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,500
This bastard. Come over here!

343
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,550
How dare you? To my sister?

344
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,390
Come here! Aish. Huh?

345
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,710
This is an unexpected twist no one expected.

346
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:04,140
He's so pitiful.

347
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,460
Is your life inside the school alright?

348
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:31,230
What are you so curious about?

349
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,600
Also nothing has happened to Ah Ro, right?

350
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,890
You should ask her. Why are you asking me...

351
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,830
like that.(trying to be more polite)

352
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,060
I know, right?

353
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:50,490
It seems I think of you as the real Seon Woo.

354
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,590
I hope you could do that too, I mean to Ah Ro.

355
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,940
Act like her real brother.

356
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:20,860
It doesn't matter if you think of me as your brother or not.

357
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,390
I'm going to live as your brother anyway. Protecting you...

358
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,860
is the only reason why I am alive.

359
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:53,630
Even though you are here for a break from the Hwarang school,

360
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,990
we don't have many side dishes to enjoy together.

361
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:01,720
Little side dishes? Not really... One more than there.

362
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:08,300
Are you both going back to Hwarang in the afternoon?

363
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,920
Yes.

364
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,550
Since, your brother is always next to his sister,

365
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,830
it's a relief.

366
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,480
Geez...

367
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,960
How much alcohol did you drink

368
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,290
to get injured like this, when you are the best sword-fighter in the capital.

369
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,320
I'm sorry.

370
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:48,290
I heard that Ban Ryu received a pass last time

371
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:50,290
and you got a fail.

372
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,720
- Yes.
- This, I ought to!

373
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,980
Aigoo.

374
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,350
Alright.

375
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,930
There is nothing that can be done about losing in academics, but

376
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,660
you have to win all the tasks done physically.

377
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:09,750
That is Gakgan's and my fight for pride.

378
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:13,060
Losing to a guy like that traitor's son

379
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,800
doesn't make sense. Got it?

380
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,770
Yes.

381
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,970
Come here!

382
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:35,720
Ah! Stop it! I said stop!

383
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,820
What are you doing? Why are you protecting Ban Ryu? Are you crazy?

384
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,910
I'm not protecting him!

385
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:47,160
Then why are you protecting the one who touched you there in front of everyone?

386
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,280
I'm the one that grabbed Ban Ryu's butt!

387
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,330
What did you touch?

388
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:56,130
I feel so frustrated that you always put me in a headlock, so

389
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:59,520
I was trying to get my revenge by playing a prank on you.

390
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,850
He was wearing the same Hwarang uniform, so I mistook Ban Ryu for you.

391
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:08,560
And after finding out that it wasn't you, I got embarrassed and ashamed.

392
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,360
So, I blamed it on Ban Ryu. So now that you know, stop bothering that person!

393
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,080
That person?

394
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:30,110
Seonmoon

395
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:42,130
♬ When the path on which I fearlessly ♬

396
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:47,310
♬ went out and searched for the small dream ♬

397
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:53,230
In the end, the music assignment was completed. Was it fun?

398
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,990
Yes, Poong Wol Joo.

399
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:01,660
The people enjoyed it and you guys enjoyed it,

400
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:05,690
so there is no reason to not give everyone a pass.

401
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,960
Are you curious about the next task?

402
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:23,810
Before the assignment, I intend to attach an appendage to each of you.

403
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,220
Appendage?

404
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,780
Are you ready?

405
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,250
Yes.

406
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,630
These are the Nangdoo who have been selected. They all excel at martial arts.

407
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,900
What is your name?

408
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,580
My name is Dan Se.

409
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:54,040
He is the grandson of Hyeon Jae Gong.

410
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,060
Seok Hyeon Jae...

411
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:03,690
So is he well? It has been a while since I saw him.

412
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:07,160
After losing his power and authority,

413
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,040
he is always worried about losing what he has left.

414
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,610
He cannot sleep.

415
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:18,170
Your sassiness hints at your disobedient characteristic.

416
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,120
What is your name?

417
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,840
It is Kang Seong, Poong Wol Joo.

418
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,680
Kang Seong.

419
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:52,060
How old are you?

420
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,360
I am 22 years old.

421
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,820
Aish...

422
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:59,630
Ah, my birthday is in January and my zodiac is a dragon.

423
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:16,230
The one in front of you is your Nangdoo.

424
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:21,740
From now on, you will use them as your subordinates, but also

425
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,860
you will have to receive their help.

426
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,120
Stand!

427
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:31,640
Nangdoo, pay your respects.

428
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:42,480
Are you crazy? Am I a pushover? Is the world so beautiful you are ready to die?

429
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,050
Then what am I supposed to do? This is the only way to serve you by your side.

430
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,710
How old did you say you were?

431
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,990
Twenty two years old.

432
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:56,610
Not even 10, but 20 years.

433
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,730
That is because I am young-looking.

434
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,650
Your mustache!

435
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:08,520
It is a bit enviable that Dan Se is your Nangdoo.

436
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,020
What luck.

437
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:14,240
I am called Dan Se, Seon Woo.

438
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:16,320
You are my Nangdoo?

439
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,830
Am I not pleasing to you?

440
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:20,690
Why did you choose me out of the rest?

441
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,180
Who were you expecting?

442
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,690
Just not you.

443
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:37,020
I didn't choose you because I wanted to.

444
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:42,690
Lord Yeong Sil personally requested it of me.

445
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:47,120
It seems that he doesn't believe that you are doing well.

446
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,750
Nangdoo, line up!

447
00:45:55,550 --> 00:46:01,500
You must become one with each other. Through your wisdom, instruct them, and after they have received instruction

448
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,930
the Hwarang should compete with each other.

449
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,560
Do you understand?

450
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,510
Yes.

451
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:29,900
So, are you saying I have to shoot arrows while riding on the horse?

452
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,250
That's what you call "Goongmal," archery and horsemanship.

453
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,170
Why do you have to do that?

454
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:38,780
Shoot the arrow and ride the horse, doing the two simultaneously?

455
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,790
Because, that is how you fight in a war.

456
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:44,540
Why is it me?

457
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:51,810
I heard you are also a half-blood and Han Seong's older brother.

458
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,340
Shouldn't you be protecting your younger brother instead?

459
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:01,100
It won't be pleasant to hear. Must you hear about it?

460
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:07,240
If I become someone else's Nangdoo, I will have to truly serve.

461
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,490
But it seemed like I wouldn't have to do that if it were you.

462
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:15,080
This is the reason why I chose you.

463
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,760
Are you satisfied?

464
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,790
I have no intention that you should serve.

465
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:24,520
I don't need a liege or anything.

466
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:30,310
You and I are the same. And when I see it, you are the same as everyone else.

467
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:43,570
Why are you so serious again today?

468
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,450
I heard Nangdoo Dan Se is Han Seong Rang's older brother.

469
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:57,390
Are you disappointed that your hyung did not become your Nangdoo?

470
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:02,130
You are a half too, like my hyung?

471
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:07,110
Aren't everyone half and half? Half from the mother, half from the father.

472
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:12,900
My grandfather dotes on me especially.

473
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:18,260
But as much as he dotes on me, he hates Hyung.

474
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:21,460
I like my older brother more than my grandfather.

475
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:26,280
Your household's affection relationship is quite complicated.

476
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,750
I am disappointed that Hyung didn't become my Nangdoo...

477
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:36,580
I am glad that he became Seon Woo Rang's Nangdoo. Seon Woo Rang is a nice person.

478
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,720
I think he is the coolest person among the Hwarang.

479
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,450
Really? Is that really so?

480
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:47,830
Yes.

481
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:52,480
That's why it's a relief that my older brother became the Nangdoo of someone like that.

482
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:11,540
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

483
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,960
It seems like you are avoiding me?

484
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,820
No, I am not. There is no way.

485
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:25,040
What is this contrived reaction? Is it because I'm the king?

486
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:30,030
Are you crazy, what if someone hears?

487
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:32,600
There are only the two of us. Two.

488
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,260
How frustrating. You don't know, even after you lived wandering around to hide yourself?

489
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:39,230
"In the day the mouse hears and in the night the bird listens."

490
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:42,950
It's probably "In the day the bird listens and in the night the mouse hears." (Meaning there is no secret in the world..)

491
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,760
Is that important when we are talking about the king?

492
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:53,300
I said "King." Again "King." Ki— I'm crazy.

493
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:57,020
Are you going to Ji Hun Dang library?

494
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,680
Is that so?

495
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:03,650
Quiet. Be quiet and just follow me.

496
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,060
Alright.

497
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:12,110
Are you uncomfortable that I am the king?

498
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:16,110
Please, can you not talk about that anymore?

499
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:18,730
I am nervous and anxious.

500
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:21,700
Why are you nervous? I am the king.

501
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,800
Again. Again.

502
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:29,860
Are you perhaps worried about me?

503
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,610
Is it like that?

504
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:39,060
Of course, I will be worried?

505
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:42,770
When inside the Hwarang school, 'ing' is here.

506
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:47,120
That 'ing' is me 'ing'?

507
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,610
It's somehow erotic.

508
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:52,890
This person, seriously!

509
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,670
I apologize.

510
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,590
It's this kind of feeling.

511
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:05,790
Meeting someone who truly knows me.

512
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:11,310
I have never felt this before in my life.

513
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,820
You don't know...

514
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:21,610
how precious and important you are to me?

515
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:31,530
If my brother does anything to Ban Ryu, you have to tell me immediately!

516
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:32,900
If I tell you, what will you do?

517
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:37,270
Then I will go over this wall and end my brother.

518
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:39,430
He's dead, Kim Soo Ho. I won't leave you alone.

519
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,940
Are you the Soo Hyeon I know?

520
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,200
I'll protect my man by myself.

521
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:46,160
- I'm envious.
- About what?

522
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,880
I want to be as forward as you.

523
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,220
What's stopping you?

524
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:55,270
Do you remember Mystic Gong and Fatal Gong?

525
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:57,540
What? Is there a second edition to that erotic story?

526
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,310
This is a story about Mystic Gong, who has to live as someone else,

527
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:03,560
and Fatal Gong who has to hide his identity.

528
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,540
Whom do you like better?

529
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,570
For me, it's definitely—

530
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:37,080
If you keep that up, you are not going to pass.

531
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,870
To the Nangdoo who belongs to the Hwarang who receives three fails and leaves Seonmoon...

532
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:43,390
what is going to happen to him?

533
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:44,890
Why are you asking me?

534
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:47,990
I'm thinking about whether I have to change my Hwarang.

535
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:50,920
Who will receive a failure? I am Dog-Bird!

536
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,450
Right now, there is no hope.

537
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:58,960
You have a special talent to say a very rude thing in a polite way.

538
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,130
I will hear that as a compliment.

539
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:02,520
How is this a compliment? It's an insult, insult!

540
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,290
Try again, please.

541
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:06,600
If you practice like this for ten years

542
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,210
perhaps you might hit the target.

543
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,860
I will let go of this like this, but

544
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:37,200
we are not done.

545
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,940
Just eat. No need for an apology.

546
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:47,770
- You are holding it well, Soo Ho.
- What can he do when he has no other choice?

547
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:52,320
It's not breast, but Ban Ryu's butt.

548
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,930
If you do that, you are going to get hit!

549
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:01,250
Did you come to see me?

550
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:06,530
It's Doctor Ah Ro. Don't you need to go see her?

551
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,860
She's not here to see me.

552
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:25,110
Why are you avoiding me?

553
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:27,550
You're not even coming to the doctor's room.

554
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:32,010
You're right.

555
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:36,520
I must have started thinking of you as the real Seon Woo.

556
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:40,620
I wish you would do that as well to Ah Ro.

557
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,880
Like a real brother.

558
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:49,350
You said I wasn't your older brother. I plan on living as your older brother.

559
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:51,520
Then are we strangers?

560
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,790
I really hate you and you make me angry.

561
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:57,540
I wish you would always get beat up, get hurt, and be sick.

562
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:04,570
I wish the same thing happens on the next day.

563
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:12,060
♫  Even though I knew nothing will change without you  ♫

564
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:20,390
♫  this was only everything I could do for you  ♫

565
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:29,990
♫  Because I knew our ending will be so painful  ♫

566
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:36,760
♫  We will dream of the ending just like a movie ♫

567
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:42,690
♫  I became timid right in front of the love ♫

568
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:02,260
Orabeoni. Orabeoni.

569
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,600
The pulse...

570
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,770
There is no pulse.

571
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:18,380
There is no pulse.

572
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,350
Wake up. Wake up!

573
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:27,230
How can you do this?

574
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:28,650
What am I supposed to do?

575
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:32,460
Wake, wake up!

576
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,640
Wake up.

577
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:02,840
How can you do this? How can you do this?

578
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:07,140
I didn't even say what I felt.

579
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:11,600
How can you do this? How can you do this?

580
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:22,430
I didn't get to say that I am glad you aren't my older brother yet.

581
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:26,280
Because I thought my heart was going crazy like that,

582
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,150
because I really hated myself,

583
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:32,320
I couldn't even tell you why I was being nasty.

584
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:39,650
Because I was falling for you,

585
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:45,020
that's why my heart felt so constricted I felt like dying.

586
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,750
Only now I can barely breathe.

587
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:55,860
Because my heart flutters when I look at you.

588
00:57:55,860 --> 00:58:01,230
There were so many days that I thought I was going to die from my heart beating so fast.

589
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:06,630
What will I do if you die like this? What should I do?

590
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:11,550
♫  I want to have the impression that  ♫

591
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:16,850
♫  love is something ordinary ♫

592
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:21,390
♫  like the strong wind  ♫

593
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:27,260
♫ which brushes past ♫

594
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:32,540
♫ Like a sad dream ♫

595
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:37,760
♫ After falling into a deep slumber ♫
