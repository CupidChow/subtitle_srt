1
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,000
Episode 6

2
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,700
Ah!

3
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,000
Are you crazy? Why were you sleeping next to me?

4
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,800
If you left when I told you to leave, we wouldn't be like this!

5
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,400
If anyone's going to leave, it should be you!

6
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,200
Just because you can't see yourself, you are spitting out whatever.

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,100
You look like a mess.

8
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,100
It doesn't look like you just slept together.

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
As a rumor from the inside, if I gossiped that you guys had something going on, wouldn't it be true?

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,400
All night, you guys...

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,500
were feeling each other up.

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,600
You dirty bastard.

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,600
That's right. Let's see this until the end!

14
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,000
Let's see.

15
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,900
Didn't you hear what I said?

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,500
My hobby is to watch fighting and fire.

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,000
Start!

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,000
Yah!

19
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,100
Who is it?

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,500
Can you guys be quiet?

21
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,200
I can't sleep because of you guys.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,500
At last, the Hwarang's hell door is opening.

23
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,300
What do you mean, hell door?

24
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,800
The Queen Dowager and Young Sil Gong officially started their rivalry.

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,700
Rivalry?

26
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,700
Kim Seup's son, Soo Ho and Young Sil Gong's son, Ban Ryu.

27
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,600
- Just the two of them being in the same room is unbelievable.
- I like that!

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,300
A crazy half-breed and unknown guy from the west are fighting as well.

29
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,600
On top of that, there is beautiful Yeo Wool, who is overlooking the whole thing.

30
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,100
Do you understand?

31
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,100
This is not the best room, but a hell room.

32
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,400
How dare you get cocky in front of me.

33
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,100
Cocky?

34
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,400
Sorry about that. I have a habit of laughing when I get nervous.

35
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,900
Listen to me closely. I don't like being here.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't like the Queen Dowager's dog over there.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,200
Especially that guy.

38
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,800
And also your habit of being cocky.

39
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,800
Ban Ryu, leave him alone!

40
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,400
Hey, it wasn't him. I'm the one who threw it.

41
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,700
A half-breed like you, do you think you're on the same level as us?

42
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,300
It doesn't matter if the Queen Dowager sent you. You can never mix in with us.

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,000
After an oil clump like you floats around,
(i.e. oil and water won't mix well)

44
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,600
you're just going to sink to the bottom of the gutter.

45
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,000
You're the one in the gutter.

46
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,600
You haven't done anything, so you're like a stagnant pool of water.

47
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,600
That's what's in a gutter. Did you get that?!

48
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,600
Seriously...

49
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,400
This half-breed!

50
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,600
Didn't I tell you guys to stop?!

51
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,100
Don't interfere!

52
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,100
- How dare you— Who are you? Let go! Aren't you letting go?
- Ow!

53
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,900
What are you doing?

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,100
This! Ow! Ow!

55
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,400
What are you?

56
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,900
Aren't you getting out of the way?

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,200
If you get three warnings, you can't stay in Hwarang.

58
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,600
Whoever disturbs the order of Hwarang,

59
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,900
one who escapes from here without permission and one who breaks the trust of Hwarang,

60
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,900
all will get warnings.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,500
Within the Hwarang code, there is no bone rank.

62
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,900
So there are no servants and the like, which you guys used to have.

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,300
Therefore, you guys have to do all the chores for yourselves.

64
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,100
Ah, it's done.
♫  Grating grating  ♫

65
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,600
♫ on my torn heart ♫

66
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,700
♫ Your cold sighs ♫

67
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,600
♫ Ever so slowly like a withering flower ♫

68
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,700
♫  Causing my heart to fall ♫

69
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:37,700
♫ Damn this love only because of you,
Even if it hurts, I can't stop  ♫

70
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,800
♫ Even if it kills, for me still it is you ♫

71
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,900
♫ Without you the tears which penetrate my heart ♫

72
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,900
You have to take turns to help do chores around this place.
♫ And falling into a black hell ♫

73
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,100
♫ You are that existence to me ♫

74
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,100
♫ Don't leave me. Don't leave me. ♫

75
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:02,100
♫ You who are turning away turn your feet toward me ♫

76
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,600
♫ I request and want you, you are everything in my life ♫

77
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,400
A Hwarang needs to get up early
♫ Please carry me off  ♫

78
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,300
in order to train the body and mind.
♫  on the dispersing light ♫

79
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,000
♫ Until the world ends na na na na na na ♫

80
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,800
Why are you doing this?

81
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,200
You can get out of this place once every ten days.
♫  It's gonna be you  ♫

82
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,100
Except that, you are not allowed to go outside

83
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:27,400
♫ It’s gonna be you na na na na na na ♫

84
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,800
♫ Wo-o-o-o I can't let go ♫

85
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:39,900
Last. You have to take showers and have meals with your roommates at all times.

86
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,200
Why are you doing all the laundry by yourself?

87
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,700
What? Should I...punish... these bastards...

88
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,200
Because I was assigned to.

89
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,600
But it looks like I'm good at this. I must have skills in this field.

90
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,500
But you have a skill for something else which is shortening my life.

91
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,600
Are you watching out for that kid well?

92
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,600
How can you think of a woman now?

93
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,200
It's not because of her. It's because of the herbal medicine.

94
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,000
Is it okay for you to be here? What if you get caught?

95
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,500
They'll get me out, I guess.

96
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,900
Who? Mother?

97
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,600
Is she not?

98
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,700
I thought you were inferior to the head of palace guards because of your appearance. But...

99
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,700
Don't worry because I can do acupuncture with this type of needle.

100
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,700
This is a spot where I have succeeded 98 out of 100 times.

101
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,700
Then, what happened to the other two times?

102
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,800
One person got bad eyesight,

103
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,900
and the other person's fact got twisted, probably.

104
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,200
This is driving me crazy.

105
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,600
Thank you for this.Thank you.

106
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,300
Another free patient?

107
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,300
Why didn't I become a doctor?

108
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,000
Because I can't compete with my father in the capital

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
for skills and money for treatment.

110
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,300
What brings you here?

111
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,100
I was just wondering if you've heard from your brother.

112
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,000
So, I don't think you heard from your brother either, but

113
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,900
you rushed all the way here because you wondered if I heard news of my brother

114
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,600
Now that you say so, that's true.

115
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,700
Anyway, did you hear from him?

116
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,600
Your brother who is kind, sweet, good looking, and has a great body.

117
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:52,620
He is kind, affectionate and has a good shape as well, but

118
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,080
I haven't heard any news from him.

119
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,520
Sighing for what? People might think you sent off your boyfriend.

120
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:05,000
Just because I have something that I didn't give to him. That bothers me.

121
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,250
Again.

122
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,300
AGAIN!

123
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,240
Again!

124
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,130
AGAIN!!

125
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,110
But who are...

126
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,910
Poong Wol Joo and I formed a close relationship, watching Alba together. (Alba is a spherical translucent gem, for secret viewing, that he showed to Poon Wol Joo in his shop)

127
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:45,350
You don't need to know in detail. In any case, it's salty.

128
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,330
Right? Eating at the same table doesn't sound right, after sleeping in the same bed? (In old Korea, men and women did not eat at the same table.)

129
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,260
How dare you, a Cheonin, eat with me at the same table?

130
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,860
Isn't this the way Cheonin normally eat?

131
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,230
Did you lose your mind after you got beaten up by a Cheonin?

132
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,960
You only think about yourself, right?. You still are acting up.

133
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,210
What bullsh** are you saying?

134
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,640
I heard that the daughter of Ahn Ji Gong is a storyteller of erotic stories at Okta store.

135
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,350
It says that your sister, a half-breed girl, is really good at...

136
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,180
story-telling.

137
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,990
Are you upset as well? Why?

138
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,220
Thinking of your own brother?

139
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,360
Five days from now, I am planning to stop by at Okta store, once I get out of here.

140
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,100
Let's go together. I will pay for you for a storytelling show.

141
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,290
It will be even better if we can hang out with your sister.

142
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,170
If you hold yourself back here, you will be torn into pieces.

143
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,530
It's too easy. The way to shut your mouth is your sister.

144
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,270
The whole school is turning upside down?

145
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,180
Exactly. I have a feeling.

146
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,830
That can turn into a big fight.

147
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,580
They are all naturally good at fighting anyway.

148
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,390
Ah, you came at right time.

149
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:00,810
Can you scratch my back in the middle? I can't reach there. This won't do it, either.

150
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:07,060
It is not just fist-fighting with a hang-over. It is fighting for LIFE AND DEATH!

151
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,810
Okay. I got it! Scratch my back A LITTLE!

152
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,100
- Oh, Geez, Where? Where?
- In the middle, middle.

153
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,750
- Here?
- Put your hands in.

154
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:00,170
It seems that you don't know anything about pride.

155
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:05,600
You will know that what I said earlier was not false if you learn who I am.

156
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:11,680
I can start when you start. Are you stupid?

157
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,320
I am not stupid. I am in the midst of enduring so that you can't start.

158
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,010
You won't be able to endure here.

159
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,090
Both you and this Hwarang,

160
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,610
because I will break both of you.

161
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,960
Why does it have to be me?

162
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,810
First, I don't like you, Queen's Hwarang.

163
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:39,160
Second. Because if I fight with other kids here, families will intervene and turn it into a complicated problem,

164
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,530
but you aren't one of them.

165
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:47,710
Third. The face of your sister is so nice that

166
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,250
one wants to take her as his mistress.

167
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,640
You're the one that started it.

168
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,980
You and I haven't even started yet.

169
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,140
This jerk!

170
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,760
You are all so pathetic!

171
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,340
This half-breed!

172
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,270
STOP!!

173
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,800
What are you guys doing now?

174
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,880
You broke the rules of Hwarang.

175
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,030
Breaking the order of Hwarang, breaking the trust between Hwarang.

176
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:42,280
You caused a huge commotion in the school, which should have been a sacred studying place.

177
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,760
Following the Hwarang's discipline,

178
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,810
I will punish you to be responsible.

179
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,120
Which punk started this mess?

180
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,130
Who was it?

181
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,750
It was me.

182
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,160
I started it.

183
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,850
Look up to me and rely on me,

184
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,740
since you are not alone anymore.

185
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,250
Feeling assured and good when you are together.

186
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,610
Making me cry,

187
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,730
and hurting right here in a strange way,

188
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,420
and making me feel lonely. That must be family.

189
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,360
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

190
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,190
Which family member will make you hurt here and have tears come into your eyes?

191
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,930
Giving you a headache when you are together. That's family.

192
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,690
Am I wrong?

193
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,810
I can't walk around with my chin up in the capital because of my brother.

194
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,320
He has gone out with all of my friends.

195
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,210
You are the only one that my brother didn't go out with. That is why I have only you as a friend. Stop talking nonsense.

196
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,140
Then, what should I call this?

197
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,060
Feeling assured, and good when you are together. Tears, emptiness, and pain at sight of him.

198
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,770
What will it be?

199
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:12,720
That's called love, foolish girl. Didn't you know that, when you are a well-known storyteller of erotic tales?

200
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,550
A love?

201
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:18,090
Hey, it doesn't make any sense? How can I...my own brother? Huh?

202
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:21,670
- Like and love—
- Miss!

203
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,870
Miss.

204
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,150
Ah, I searched all over the town, without knowing you were here.

205
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,410
What? What happened?

206
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,430
You have to come quickly with me now to Hwarang school.

207
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,860
Hwarang school?

208
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,820
Isn't that the place forbidden for a woman?

209
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,830
When did I say for you to go there as a woman? Come with me as a doctor.

210
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,830
A doctor?

211
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,130
This way.

212
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,920
Oh my goodness. What am I supposed to do here?

213
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,650
I am not a real doctor, and I was just self-taught by watching my father.

214
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,300
Nevertheless, why do you think you were called?

215
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,270
This is a very sensitive issue.

216
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:14,340
It has been only a few days since the Hwarang were created, but they are already having dogfights and commotions.

217
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,720
If people found out about this...

218
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:23,310
As you can see, these kids won't mind anyone as their doctor.

219
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,280
Just put some ointment and sew up some torn wounds.

220
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,560
I will write off half of your debt.

221
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,320
Done with talking.

222
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,160
Come out, come out.

223
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,300
Are these all the patients here?

224
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,200
Why? Is there not enough?

225
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,200
That's not it. It's because I don't see my brother.

226
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,600
If you're talking about your brother, the bamboo hat? The necklace?

227
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
What do you mean, bamboo hat?

228
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,300
You came back?

229
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,300
What will happen now? Is that half-breed guy going to get kicked out?

230
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,000
Well, I guess that's what will happen.

231
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,200
However, we have the support of our father's official positions.

232
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,100
He's a half breed and the son of a doctor. How can he compare to Ban Ryu?

233
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,000
Of course.

234
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,750
Innocent true bone—guilty nobody.

235
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:40,790
Hey, if you have a bone you are innocent. If you don't have a bone you are guilty.

236
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:46,600
Hey! What are you saying? Did you not hear that there is no bone-rank system here?

237
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,800
If they can get rid of it that easily, it's not a bone rank system.

238
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,900
Can you think of a kingdom without a bone rank system?

239
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,100
Think about it.

240
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,500
It looks like it will be like this for the time being.

241
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,400
Which side are you on?

242
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,900
Are you with the half-breed or Ban Ryu?

243
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,300
I'm not with Ban Ryu. He's a brat.

244
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,600
Your arm is bleeding. Did you get hurt?

245
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,300
Me?

246
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,600
What is this? What is this blood?

247
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,400
You deliberately started it, both in the room and in the hall.

248
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,900
No, I didn't.

249
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,200
I only said to start. I didn't actually start it.

250
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,300
You saw that half-breed guy came at me first.

251
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,850
You shouldn't have said something about that guy's sister.

252
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:38,490
When I knew there was nothing better to provoke him than that,

253
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,600
why shouldn't I have?

254
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,720
Now I can see the reason that the half-breed called you a gutter.

255
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,200
The world has never changed. The strong always beat the weak.

256
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,700
And the strong and powerful ones get whatever they want.

257
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,300
What is it?

258
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:03,500
I thought about it, and you're someone who wouldn't do Hwarang, even if you died.

259
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,500
So what is the reason for coming here after resisting it until the end?

260
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,200
You. Did something happen to you?

261
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:20,900
Are you miserable? That is how power is. If you can't wield it, you can't do anything except submit.

262
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,600
What can you do?

263
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:33,100
If you ever want to fight, let me know. I have no time to listen to your nonsense.

264
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,100
Ah, that bastard.

265
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,300
I think we will have to give you stitches.

266
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,200
It will probably hurt a lot.

267
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,600
It doesn't matter, so just do it.

268
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
How old are you this year? You look young.

269
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:02,200
Oh, ho, who is young? At a glance, I am your orabeoni, by a long time.

270
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,100
Here. Chew on this, at least. It's dried Paeonia lactiflora, but it helps to relieve pain.

271
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:16,100
A grown man can briefly endure this.

272
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:21,000
You should just chew this. Orabeoni.

273
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Orabeoni? Orabeoni.

274
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,500
By chance. By chance, are you Ahn Ji Gong's daughter?

275
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,300
Do you know me?

276
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:44,100
I think you are the most popular half-bone in the world.

277
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:58,010
I'm wondering what to do with you from now on. Do you have any complaints?

278
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,300
Well, even if you did I can't help it.

279
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,400
I have something I'm curious about.

280
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,400
If I didn't do anything, if I avoided. If I kept it in,

281
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,700
would I not be here?

282
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,870
Do you regret it now?

283
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,000
Not regretting, but thinking.

284
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,900
Timid, hesitant, and backing down. Is that the Hwarang you desire?

285
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,110
If I say it, will you do it?

286
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:32,380
So, that's why I am thinking. That's not my approach.

287
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,900
Then what's your approach?

288
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,200
I think that there is nothing in this world that can stop me.

289
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,880
Saying something whether it's right or wrong. Breaking something down that should be broken.

290
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:50,490
If there is an injured, weak or pretty person, I will protect them no matter what.

291
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,280
Lightly.

292
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:09,330
Okay, it's done.

293
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,140
Thanks.

294
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,390
Ah, where on earth is he?

295
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,010
Pervert Gong?

296
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,650
It's really you.

297
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,020
Have you seen my brother?

298
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:30,220
Do you only think of your brother, when there's a good patient in front of you?

299
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:35,100
Ah, who on earth created this mess? What about my brother? Is he okay?

300
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,400
Follow me. I don't think it's okay for you to be here.

301
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,610
What are you saying...

302
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:52,770
Don't get hurt. I don't want you to get hurt anymore.

303
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,380
But I got hurt again.

304
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,670
♫  Flickering starlight  ♫

305
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,600
♫  Whatever  ♫

306
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,150
Ah, what are you doing?

307
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,600
Can't you see I'm hurt?

308
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:19,790
Ah...

309
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,800
Anyway, it's impossible for a patient to walk like this for so long, without resting.

310
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,730
Are you crazy?

311
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,620
I couldn't sleep for four days and I got hit.

312
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,270
Wait a minute and help me sleep. I won't do anything.

313
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,910
Only for thirty minutes.

314
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:43,120
And, you're not pretty enough for me to do anything in broad daylight.

315
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,780
It isn't even our first time sleeping together.

316
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,290
This guy, who slept with you?

317
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,950
Only for fifteen minutes.

318
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:59,320
♫ If I only have you, that's enough ♫

319
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,400
♫  I follow the stars  ♫

320
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,440
♫  that is the dream the sky hung up  ♫

321
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,470
I don't even know whether you are a real doctor or not, but you are a skilled doctor for me.

322
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:14,330
You are a stupendous healing drink.

323
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:19,130
I don't have the time to sit here like this right now. I need to quickly find my brothe—

324
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:26,350
What? Have you fallen asleep already?

325
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,640
Can you show me the way to the Master's room?

326
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:11,890
I will guide you there.

327
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,410
It's here.

328
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,060
Thank you.

329
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:44,290
Big trouble, (for) me.

330
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,470
The assistant must be doing a good job.

331
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:54,250
Is this the Hwarang and teaching you spoke about?

332
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:01,000
Even if you build a sandcastle, some sand will flow down. You are building the future of Silla.

333
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,990
Are you sure you can't handle it breaking this much?

334
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:10,750
There's no dead men, no man with broken legs so bad that he can't ride a horse. I think we should be relieved for this much

335
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:17,800
Let us talk now.

336
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:25,080
Did you, Your Majesty, come all the way here because you are curious about your Hwarang, or are you curious about my Hwarang?

337
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,410
Who is your (Gong's) Hwarang?

338
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:37,680
He is called Ji Dwi. He was named that while in the west.

339
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,020
I am a distant ajusshi (uncle).

340
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,930
Let me ask you something this time.

341
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:51,500
Why out of all people did you want Ahn Ji Gong's son in Hwarang?

342
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,100
He... is my son.

343
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,680
He's Ahn Ji Gons's son, and Ahn Ji Gong' used to be my lover once,

344
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,290
so please consider him as my son.

345
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:17,190
If you are curious about his son, you should go meet him.

346
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:24,210
Do you think I sent you here to see you being punished like this?

347
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,270
I can't believe the Hwarang I sent is getting kicked out.

348
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,370
I too was curious at first as to why you sent me here.

349
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,790
A criminal, who deserved to be torn and killed.

350
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,220
Why did she make me a part of Hwarang?

351
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:46,660
But I figured it out soon. You confined a weak animal

352
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,300
and used it as an example to show others how it will be beaten and broken, until they arre tamed.

353
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:56,210
I know I am an easy and right target. I know.

354
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:04,610
I will tell you once more the reason why you should continue to stay in Hwarang.

355
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:09,070
As you mentioned, you are here to get punished for your deadly sins. However,

356
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:14,300
if you don't pay for your sins, someone else will have to pay instead.

357
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,840
Whether it is your sister or your father.

358
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:32,070
Until when are you going to sleep?

359
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:37,950
Excuse me. Hey!

360
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,630
I got caught.

361
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,420
Caught for what?

362
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:04,860
The brother you always look for whenever you talk is imprisoned in the warehouse.

363
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,000
The warehouse? Why is my brother—

364
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,200
That tiresome brother of yours is the start and the end of this mess.

365
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,370
Why did you tell me that now?!

366
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:33,750
Orabeoni, are you here?

367
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,270
It's me, Ah Ro.

368
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,480
Why are you here now?

369
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,720
I can ask you exactly the same thing! Why are you in here?

370
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,850
Is there anyone out front?

371
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:51,810
No. There's no one here.

372
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:26,210
I came as a nurse since there were injured Hwarang. I didn't sneak in here, so...

373
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,250
Even if you didn't sneak in, how is this different?

374
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,520
Your face. Are you okay?

375
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,640
I'm not okay because of you.

376
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,280
So, leave this place immediately.

377
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,620
Let me treat your wounds first.

378
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,640
Those are nothing to me! The thing that is making me go crazy right now

379
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,400
is the fact that you're in here with me.

380
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,080
Then you should not have gotten hurt!

381
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,950
I only see those wounds now. Those wounds are my biggest worry and concern right now.

382
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,080
I don't know how you spent time at the Cheonin village.

383
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,800
That is no longer the case because I am here right now.

384
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,180
If you get hurt, I'm going to treat it all.

385
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,440
♫  Don't look at me with a sad gaze  ♫

386
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,730
So, please look.

387
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,910
You seriously...

388
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:21,590
You should sit down, Mr. Tall Man.

389
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,550
♫  I see it all  ♫

390
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:33,460
♫  Why didn't you leave?  ♫

391
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:41,160
♫  If I only give you my tears, what should I do?  ♫

392
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:48,040
♫  memories that I lose my sleep over ♫

393
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,860
Ow, ow.

394
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,680
Aigoo. Stop overreacting.

395
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:56,470
I-It really does hurt.

396
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,540
So right! This is the famous one

397
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:04,280
that hurts only bad people. It does work.

398
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:14,330
I really love to see you laughing.

399
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:18,610
Me? How did I laugh?

400
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:24,070
It's a shame that people don't see it. You should laugh more often, brightly.

401
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,750
♫  On a tiring and hard day ♫

402
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,570
♫  Hold each other tightly  ♫

403
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,320
♫  It's like a dream  ♫

404
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,700
I don't like that you're in here.

405
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:43,230
I don't like other guys looking at you either.

406
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:46,290
- Also—
- It's a bit too late for that.

407
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:49,670
I've already met all of them, and

408
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:53,490
some of them might get their mouth turned to the wrong side tomorrow morning.

409
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,900
You have no fear.

410
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,960
Why should I have fear? My older brother is here.

411
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:09,000
♫  Since there was no beginning, there will be no end  ♫

412
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,180
♫  I wrote two words "Breaking up" by myself  ♫

413
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:20,290
♫  Tell that this is not dew drops ♫

414
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,360
I heard you were really looking for your brother

415
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,150
and you met him. But your expression is a bit ambiguous.

416
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:32,190
I don't know. After seeing him, I feel even less settled.

417
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:36,830
But is that bamboo hat guy really your brother?

418
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,260
Huh?

419
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,730
It's quite strange.

420
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:10,040
It's been over ten years since I've lived without you.

421
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:15,170
The few days I haven't been able to see you seem much longer.

422
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:21,330
I both worried in vain, and wondered.

423
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:28,530
When you weren't here, it didn't matter to me where you lived.

424
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,730
But right now,

425
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,190
it's odd, but I keep thinking of you.

426
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,810
Maybe, that's what a family is.

427
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,590
Did you ask to let that Hwarang go?

428
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:59,310
I asked you to take care of the Hwarang.

429
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:03,300
I didn't ask you to make them dry up and die. If you are kicking someone out because of something that small,

430
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,540
would there be any Hwarang left?

431
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:10,520
Without Hwarang, how can I control the royal council

432
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,350
and plan a new future?

433
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,780
You say "I."

434
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:21,220
I thought you asked me until recently to help plan this new country.

435
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,560
It seems the owner has changed.

436
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,830
Did you forget that you gave me authority? Or

437
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,450
do you want to change it back to how it originally was?

438
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,960
Of course not.

439
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,090
I won't do anything, but

440
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,850
if your discipline is not working

441
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:45,100
and if I think I might lose all my Hwarang,

442
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,320
I can withdraw the authority I gave you.

443
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:51,430
Do you understand?

444
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,170
Take back authority?

445
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,990
Aigoo.

446
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,390
And who is this?

447
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:06,050
Isn't Poong Wol Ju the Wi Hwa Gong who is taking care of the Hwarang?

448
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,480
It looks like you are leaving after meeting the Queen Dowager.

449
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,530
Yes.

450
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:15,440
You can't ever understand the mysteries of a woman's mind.

451
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,300
It is totally different from what men like us think.

452
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:26,400
I don't think a woman's mind is the only thing that can change.

453
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:32,350
I happen to have a tasty red wine at home. Why don't you stop by?

454
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:36,370
Or should I visit you someday?

455
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:40,650
My son is also Hwarang. His name is Ban Ryu.

456
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:44,180
He is someone who is used to hearing that he's royal since he was young.

457
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,100
Royal?

458
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:51,870
The country could be changed tomorrow by a cup of wine.

459
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:57,190
Red wine... Appealing!

460
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,140
Then, shall we set a date?

461
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:03,360
Great. Then after we make the wine tomorrow

462
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,750
we'll drink it 30 years later. Would you like that?

463
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,560
Then, I'll take my leave first.

464
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,480
What the...

465
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,150
That old guy is venomous.

466
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,930
I'm not thinking of throwing you out right away.

467
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,320
I'm glad of that.

468
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,020
After just slowly strangling you, then I intend to throw you out.

469
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,170
First, you must receive a pass on this exam.

470
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,050
If you receive a fail three times, you will have to leave Hwarang.

471
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:03,090
It'll become a painful experience for you.

472
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:07,960
You will learn the hard way that you are so stupid, that you know nothing.

473
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,810
I assure you, the result will be the same.

474
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:17,430
You're not leaving right now in vain would be a wise choice.

475
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,960
What will you do?

476
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,280
Will you stay or leave?

477
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:27,870
I only have one choice. I'll stay.

478
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,630
Since there is a reason to stay.

479
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,150
Stay.

480
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,480
Look here carefully.

481
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,590
Su (meaning water)

482
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,360
Do you know what this means?

483
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,450
It says water.

484
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:11,110
Is water strong or weak? If it is strong, how strong is it and if it's weak, how weak is it?

485
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:14,370
Water beats fire, so it's strong.

486
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:17,990
But if there is something blocking its way, it's just going to flow the other way.

487
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:20,850
Water is weak and pathetic.

488
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,830
Water avoids things and is pathetic. Anything else?

489
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,920
Water is kind.

490
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:30,060
It surrounds the whole world and it brings dead sprouts back to life.

491
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,720
And it slowly flows even to the lowest spots.

492
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,830
So, since water is not strong,

493
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,180
it is kind.

494
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,530
Yes. Water is kind.

495
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:48,580
Hey. You. Don't you have anything to say?

496
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,150
Water is...

497
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,880
exhausted.

498
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,780
How so?

499
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,560
Water is

500
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,530
constantly giving you something,

501
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:05,270
like fish and gold,

502
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:09,690
until the bottom is dried up and it can't produce anything anymore.

503
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:12,890
Water is constantly exhausted.

504
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,890
Hm, water is exhausted.

505
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,870
"Wang"
(King)

506
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:29,000
This is your first task.

507
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,390
It is your task,

508
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:35,080
to debate about what water means for a king.

509
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,560
But first, you need to have knowledge about the Tao Te Ching. 
(Chinese textbook of philosophy written by Noza)

510
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,550
Ah...

511
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:45,640
Ah, seriously.

512
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,980
"Wang"
(King)

513
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:52,720
What, Tao Te Ching?

514
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,430
Aigoo.

515
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:57,520
That's a really hard task.

516
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,600
It is like forcing a child to summersault when one can't even walk.

517
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,830
How can he tell a man who thinks there are only 200 characters in the world to read the Tao Te Ching?

518
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:08,090
How can he?!

519
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:11,590
Why are you getting mad at me? Am I the one who assigned it?

520
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,740
Ah, what should I do?

521
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:17,480
What should I do?!

522
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,770
This has been air-dried well.

523
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:31,880
Is this all the star anise you have?

524
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,670
Yes.

525
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,340
This is a big problem.

526
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:41,890
If a deadly contagion spreads, a person with medicine will make a fortune.

527
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,950
Ahn Ji Gong.

528
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:47,510
Do you know me?

529
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:54,760
You should have left him to live quietly.

530
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:59,140
He was trying his best to live quietly.

531
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:03,030
Hwarang? You made him do something like that?

532
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:06,610
Don't you think this is mine and that child's fate?

533
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,620
You're saying something ridiculous about fate.

534
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:15,120
Do you think I don't know that you are using him to get revenge for your son's death?

535
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,200
That guy...

536
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:23,090
That guy shouldn't be revealed to the world like this.

537
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:27,830
His fate is ruined, and you know that

538
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:31,760
- you opened the unlocked door to it.
- Wait.

539
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,320
What kind of guy is he?

540
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,200
Excuse me!

541
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:55,340
What does he mean by he shouldn't be revealed to the world like this?

542
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:07,670
Big

543
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:17,120
The black is the letters and the white is the background.

544
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:20,700
Why is this so complicated?

545
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:31,690
Are you okay? I am concerned about the evening.

546
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:36,320
I put on medicine that heals wounds well, so it should be better in a few days.

547
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,090
It will be hard to do stuff in the water.

548
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:43,530
But you are lucky to get proper treatment on time.

549
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:46,260
If not, you would have suffered for a few months.

550
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,100
Thank you.

551
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:56,060
You're almost like a doctor.

552
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,050
Anyway, it's good for us to have you here, but when are you going to tell him?

553
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:08,770
I was going to tell him.

554
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:11,330
Hey, hey!

555
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:34,760
Wait. I feel like I've seen you before?

556
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,230
Why is he like that?

557
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,630
Am I hallucinating?

558
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:18,910
It's a hallucination. I'm a ghost.

559
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:22,680
A ghost wouldn't be that stupid.

560
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:25,540
What are you doing?

561
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:32,420
I came here as a doctor.

562
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:36,560
Are you crazy? You have seen that only dirty-minded guys are here, haven't you?

563
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:40,590
If you're that worried then you can protect me.

564
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:44,920
Then, is it safer outside? Even if someone is walking minding their own business, they can get kidnapped in the capital.

565
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,830
What's more dangerous in here than out there?

566
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:50,000
At least I have you here.

567
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,150
How can it be safe to walk around without my brother?

568
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:57,320
Do you want me to walk around like that?

569
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,920
How can a beginner not knowing anything other than 200 characters prepare for the Tao Te Ching?

570
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,860
Is there a teacher better than me?

571
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:12,430
Still, No!

572
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:25,460
♬ At every opportunity I think of it ♬

573
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,820

Here, copy it.

578
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:42,690
What are you doing? Aren't you going to write?

579
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:48,180
It is only until this ends.

580
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:51,890
My mouth will hurt if I have to repeat that.

581
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:54,850
Why? Do you want to pinky promise?

582
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,220
♬ Only the confessions I couldn't say are piling up. ♬

583
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,920
Not that.

585

586
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,470

00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,050

That's it.

604
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,040
That's it. Right.

605
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,890
What? Were you practicing without me?

606
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:27,800
You learned how to ride a horse quickly. You are learning how to write quickly too.

607
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,430
Is there anything you can't do?

608
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:33,320
Don't start acting up.

609
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:39,000
Huh! You have bad manners toward your teacher!

610
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:47,120
Don't do that!

611
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,490
Oh my, oh my! Hey!

612
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:58,750
Don't do it.

613
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:03,620
That's a face I've seen a lot.

614
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,380
Seriously.

615
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,110
Jeomsun, come here!

616
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:11,420
What is this?

617
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,200
It looks good on you.

618
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,340
You have two sets of eyebrows, though.

619
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:20,400
You look like you eat well.

620
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,980
Quickly, this.

621
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,260
No, no. Don't do it. No!

622
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:30,450
"Wang"
(King)

623
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:38,470
You can't have it all. Queen or mother,

624
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:42,990
choose only one. I will also do that.

625
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,070
If I stay silent about you,

626
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:52,180
no one will know who you are.

627
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:56,600
Are you going to give up living as a king?

628
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:02,170
Stop getting on my nerves until I can't take it anymore.

629
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,830
Don't drive me crazy to the point of

630
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:11,860
me wanting to throw you out.

631
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:31,970
That scared me! What are you doing?

632
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:35,160
It's still there, the lender mark.

633
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:40,160
When are you going to repay your debt?

634
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,560
Pervert. How can you just ask for it so suddenly?

635
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:51,580
I definitely told you that I'll pay my debt late.

636
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:54,160
There is a way to repay your debt.

637
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:04,610
Why aren't you starting?

638
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:07,120
Why are you here?

639
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:10,960
She didn't tell you?

640
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,170
You see. I gave some silver...

641
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:17,030
Let's start quickly. There is no time and the road is long.

642
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,070
Here.

643
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:25,450
Here. Hold your brush and get some ink.

644
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:32,090
Oh, aigoo.

645
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:33,830
So, you can do it like this?

646
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:35,860
Is this how you write it?

647
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,030
Soo
(Water)

648
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,200
Hey.

649
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,440
I'm sorry, I thought you were my brother.

650
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,130
Can't you stop calling that bastard brother?

651
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:32,240
I should call my brother, "Brother." What else would I call him?

652
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,890
Anyway, don't do it.

653
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,220
Is it true that you can't read letters?

654
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:05,360
That's right. You have to teach me from beginning to end.

655
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,500
That is the character for butterfly, "Jup."

656
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:26,520
More than just words, if you think about it as a drawing, you will be able to see the writing in the drawing.

657
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:45,410
I have seen people who do not know any writing,

658
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:48,140
but I haven't seen anyone who could not read it.

659
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,160
One more character.

660
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,990
Do you have a character you want to see?

661
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:57,880
Wang
(King)

662
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,620
What is the meaning of this drawing?

663
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:20,830
I don't know what anyone else thinks of it.

664
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:24,790
For me, I pity the King without a face.

665
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:26,900
Pity?

666
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:32,800
The mother has no thoughts of coming down, so he has to get stronger by himself and fly.

667
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:37,090
It's too bad for the young bird.

668
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:45,830
He became king without wanting it and is not able to come out into the world.

669
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:49,960
He is like the young bird that fell out of its nest.

670
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:53,620
In the world

671
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:58,570
there is a life that should not have been born.

672
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:01,400
If it had not been born in the first place

673
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,100
there would not have been a reason to fall out of the nest.

674
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:08,460
How can you say such things as that? When you think about it, it's so sad.

675
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:13,740
To someone who hasn't slept in his own house and is wandering around.

676
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,620
How dare you

677
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:19,820
say that the King is sad?

678
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:21,820
Why are you suddenly?

679
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,890
Just what are you?

680
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,740
Who are you to shake me?

681
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:33,390
Don't be like this. I don't know what situation this is.

682
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:35,290
Who are you to?

683
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:41,100
Who are you to make me insignificant?

684
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:49,940
If you keep being like this, Orabeoni won't stand still.

685
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,910
I told you not to call him orabeoni, didn't I?

686
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:55,020
Soon Orabeoni will—

687
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,470
♫ A slight sprinkle is falling ♫

688
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:03,920
♫ Black tears cover me ♫

689
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,530
♫ In my two red eyes ♫

690
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:09,190
♫ I boxed you up ♫

691
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,750
♫ I want to go back again ♫

692
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:14,350
♫ to turn the clock back ♫

693
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:22,360
♫ to when it was beautiful ♫

694
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:27,500
♫  I want to have the impression that ♫

695
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:32,790
♫  Love is something ordinary  ♫
