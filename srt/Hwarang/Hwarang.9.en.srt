Episode 9

2
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,710
Here.

3
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,070
They were there, you said it was medicinal herbs...

4
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,560
Your head won't hurt, and your inner anger will calm down.

5
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,790
- These are chrysanthemum flowers...
- Not flowers, but medicinal herbs.

6
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,580
Orabeoni...

7
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,780
I'm happy because you're my orabeoni.

8
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:19,700
Once I met the person who took care of my brother, there was something I wanted to ask.

9
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,390
Did my brother...

10
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,750
ever miss me?

11
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,780
Mak Moon, this guy,

12
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,830
always talked about his sister.

13
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,790
Even when he was sleeping,

14
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,300
he wished to dream of you.

15
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,590
He fell asleep, praying that to God.

16
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,740
But,

17
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,850
why can't he be here?

18
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,170
But you're not.

19
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,140
Who are you?

20
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,710
Yeah.

21
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,360
I'm not your brother.

22
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,120
Who are you then?

23
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,620
A friend of your brother's.

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,660
So...

25
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,310
So...

26
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,190
What happened to my real brother?

27
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,340
He died.

28
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,320
Why is it he died and you survived?

29
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,110
Tell me.

30
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,970
Tell me! I said, tell me!

31
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,030
Have you ever heard that Cheonin will be killed if they sneak into the capital?

32
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,750
You've heard of it, right?

33
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,890
He could've escaped...

34
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,810
But by helping me...

35
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,770
He was struck by the sword of a guard.

36
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,590
I don't care if you don't think of me as your brother.

37
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,550
Because, I'll live as your brother.

38
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,790
That's what your brother wished for.

39
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,660
So...

40
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,160
you live that way, too.

41
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,850
What's wrong? Did something happen?

42
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:52,520
♫ You were so far away ♫

43
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,050
♫ Without being able to see you I ♫

44
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,920
If you're curious about your childhood,

45
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,750
ask me.

46
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,240
Even if you don't remember it,

47
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,410
I remember it.

48
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,510
O...

49
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,100
Orabeoni...

50
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,710
Since you are

51
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,880
my brother.

52
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,120
My real brother.

53
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,150
♫ A slight sprinkle is falling, black tears cover me. ♫

54
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:41,280
♫ In my two red eyes I boxed you up ♫

55
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,550
♫ I want to go back again, to turn the clock back, ♫

56
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:53,230
♫ to when it was beautiful ♫

57
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,730
♫  I want to have the impression that ♫

58
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:04,810
♫  Love is something ordinary  ♫

59
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,290
♫  Which brushes past ♫

60
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,750
Don't get hurt. 
♫  like a strong wind  ♫

61
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,290
Now,

62
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,510
I wish you wouldn't get hurt.

63
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,360
I'm...

64
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,560
I'm scared because of you.

65
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,800
I'm afraid you might get hurt.

66
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,630
I'm afraid I might not be able to protect you.

67
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:40,320
When I thought I had no brother, I didn't care where he lived.

68
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,490
But now,

69
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,970
It's funny but I keep thinking about you.

70
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,970
♫ Once I erase you ♫

71
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,970
So, that must be a family.

72
00:07:53,970 --> 00:08:00,320
♫ My heart will weep so many sad tears.  ♫

73
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,690
Do Not Approach

74
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,690
Why isn't he coming?

75
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,490
Do not approach?

76
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,140
What the...

77
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,950
Hey, I'm curious. The day we went over the wall,

78
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,930
did nothing really happen to me? It seems everyone is avoiding me.

79
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,990
It's just so weird.

80
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,540
There is something unsolved and unbearable about it.

81
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,600
It's weird, I can't remember it.

82
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,390
What the? Are you sick?

83
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,090
Yeah.

84
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,690
Who said so?

85
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,990
Who said you could be sick?

86
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,820
You, if you make a mistake in front of the Queen on the performance day, are dead meat!

87
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,120
If you understand, get well soon!

88
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,050
How dare he, I ought to just whack him!

89
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:32,020
What the— That dance. Was he supposed to dance in front of the Queen Dowager?

90
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,110
Oh, I can't get it. He is totally going crazy. Total...

91
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:55,340
Silver coins. It's the thing you love best. Can you accept it and stop crying?

92
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:02,430
Should I hug you? Or should I kill...

93
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,520
the one who made you cry like this.

94
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,960
Tell me. I'll do whatever you want either way.

95
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,720
Is there someone at Seonmoon bothering you?

96
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,500
Are you being taunted and dis-respected? If someone is bothering you,

97
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,650
I'll dismember him joint by joint, cut off his tongue,

98
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:40,580
and without giving him a drop of water to drink, dry him out under the sun until he dies.

99
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,500
I get angry and can't stand your crying.

100
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,830
If anyone hurts you like this... I'll kill him.

101
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,460
If anyone worries you so much that you're crying...

102
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,150
I'll kill him too.

103
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,150
So tell me.

104
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,110
What kind of guy made you cry?

105
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,130
The fact that I am crying

106
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,140
is because of me.

107
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:24,350
There is so much reproach and dislike but on the other hand my heart is relieved,

108
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,670
I'm disgusted and hate so much that I am like this.

109
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,210
I hate myself.

110
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:40,020
♬ Like the brilliant day you came to me ♬

111
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:46,900
♬ Like when the moonlight shone between you and me ♬

112
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:51,840
♬ Everything that is ours may disappear ♬

113
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,530
Stop crying. I won't leave you alone any more.

114
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,320
I'll make you mine.

115
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,780
♬ Stay by my side ♬

116
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,120
Why didn't you tell me?

117
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,370
What's your reason for having me believe he was my orabeoni?

118
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,920
What other things are you hiding from me, Father?

119
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,490
I saw you following her out.

120
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,130
So?

121
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,010
Is she okay? Ah Ro?

122
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,250
I think you are too old to make your sister cry.

123
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,430
Tell me if she's okay.

124
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,880
Since I'm curious,

125
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,500
I mean, I'm asking because I'm envious. What could you have done to hurt her that much?

126
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:17,500
How can you make her so sad and bewildered?

127
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,920
I'm asking, so answer me. Is that child okay?

128
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,940
I don't care if you don't consider me as your brother
because I will live as your brother.

129
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,560
This is what your brother wished for.

130
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,780
So...

131
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,780
You live that way, too.

132
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,530
♬ Don't look at me with sad eyes ♬

133
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:57,210
♬ Your aching heart displays everything ♬

134
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:04,550
♬ If you keep doing that, you will just leave me ♬

135
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:13,330
♬ When you offer me tears, what can I do? ♬

136
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,830
♬ I'm afraid of being suspended a long time somewhere in memory ♬

137
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:25,770
I don't know about other people, but I pity the king hiding with a mask.

138
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,450
That I am crying... is because of me.

139
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:44,130
I pity you, too. Why don't you look at me in the way I look at you?

140
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:51,400
♬ Although you and I became tears to each other  ♫

141
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,580
♬ After time passes... ♬

142
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,800
Citizens?

143
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,590
Do you mean the Hwarang are going to dance and act for the citizens?

144
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,450
Hwarang are for the new kingdom.

145
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,270
Hwarang belong to the king and the royal family.

146
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,600
It doesn't matter who the Hwarang belong to.

147
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,900
It's the Hwarang's mission to protect the citizens' and the country's welfare.

148
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,730
What do you think about Poong Wol Joo?

149
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,920
He is the only person who can handle the Hwarang.

150
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,300
But also, he is someone you cannot trust fully.

151
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,380
Not completely trustworthy?

152
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,100
Then, I should make it so that I can believe him.

153
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,240
Now who is that?

154
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,830
The princess. Princess Sook Myeong.

155
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:18,940
Ah, she went somewhere because she was sick? Then, why has she suddenly come back?

156
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:56,130
Your Highness Queen Dowager I have returned after the change of air for my health.

157
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,720
Is your body feeling okay?

158
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,250
Thanks to your concern I am completely recovered.

159
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,770
It's a good thing you came, Princess.

160
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,300
We will have to keep Sook Myeong in the Hwarang's school.

161
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:35,750
From the time she was a child, she has learned the royal family's code of etiquette, dancing and singing.

162
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,290
Even for the preparation of the celebration, she will be a great help for you.

163
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:47,040
I'm thankful for the offer, but I will decline.

164
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,330
Decline?

165
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,020
Because I know the Seonmoon tasks, I'll do it. Please don't be concerned.

166
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,440
Is Ji Dwi really your nephew?

167
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,470
Although he was accepted into Hwarang without any quibbling between us over conditions,

168
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:09,640
if he is a spy planning a revolt to disrupt the country's organization,

169
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,950
then that becomes a different story.

170
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,730
There's no way.

171
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:19,190
Within the capital, you are the only one related to him, and I don't even know what he's done before or where.

172
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,210
How can you be sure of this?

173
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,270
Can't you trust me?

174
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:30,200
Can you prove it? What is his real name, where is his family?

175
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:36,020
One way or another, wandering by himself, he ended up here. If you can prove just one thing about him,

176
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,090
I will believe what you say.

177
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:45,070
Just call me Ji Dwi. There's nothing to reveal about my household, because it's insignificant.

178
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:49,930
The truth is, I studied abroad in the West, so I have no relations with anyone here.

179
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,770
I will drag down the

180
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:59,100
the noisy owner of this place. The Queen Dowager.

181
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,360
If I torture that Ji Dwi by myself

182
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,750
to dismember his body joint by joint and cut off his skin speck by speck in front of you,

183
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,360
you will be able to see he confesses everything before he dies.

184
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,350
Are you now

185
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,360
making a deal with me?

186
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,600
What will you do?

187
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,180
If that is the case,

188
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,630
just do as you wish to do.

189
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,780
You're only going to kill the nephew?

190
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,670
A nation where the citizens are merry but the king sufffers.

191
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,650
A country where the subjects don't worry for the nation, but

192
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,620
but the monarch worries for the subjects. \

193
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,790
Is that the way you want the kingdom to be?

194
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,820
Who are you?

195
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,740
Someone who really believes the kingdom will change.

196
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,790
This is my half truth.

197
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,760
I will accept.

198
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,170
Princess Sook Myeong will

199
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,870
be accepted here in the Hwarang school.

200
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,790
I don't care if you don't think of me as a brother,

201
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,740
because I will live as one.

202
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,070
This is what your brother wanted.

203
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,750
So,

204
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,670
you live that way, too.

205
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,780
Geez, is this the one that people call an anger sickness?

206
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:05,390
I finally feel I am calming myself.

207
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,650
What happened to you, my 100-talented girl?

208
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,370
Seon Woo...

209
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,040
Seon Woo...

210
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,750
Is he a great Hwarang?

211
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,840
Is he someone trustworthy?

212
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,400
What kind of person is he truly?

213
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,110
You're not even my brother.

214
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:40,590
You're not the real one anyway.

215
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,090
Who did you think I was?

216
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,830
- Your brother?
- Leave, stop bothering me.

217
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:10,770
I'm not someone who'd bother anyone though.

218
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,400
I'm someone who makes it hard for people.

219
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,890
- Do you want to kiss again?
- It's not like I couldn't do so.

220
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,320
Leave when I say it nicely.

221
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,270
You're so close.

222
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,300
Do you not feel anything?

223
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:45,050
The heart of the person in front of you is beating,

224
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,960
screaming that he likes you.

225
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,920
♫  Close your eyes  ♫

226
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,290
Do you not feel anything?

227
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:57,790
♫  So I can't see you  ♫

228
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:03,570
♫  This weak heart  ♫

229
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,690
My brother is

230
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,020
okay?

231
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,060
Did he eat?

232
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,480
Could he digest it?

233
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:24,550
♫  Someone who gets hurt by love  ♫

234
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:29,720
♫  Even if it hurts, it's fine.  ♫

235
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,750
♫  I can't stop it  ♫

236
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:42,440
♫  Because my love is you ♫

237
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,080
♫  When I hold out my hand  ♫

238
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,360
Now you see me.

239
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,850
I shouldn't get disappointed, but I'm very disappointed.

240
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:59,650
But now we got a little closer. Next time,

241
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,770
we're going to get even closer.

242
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,550
♫ So that I can't leave you  ♫

243
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,860
♫  It grows larger and larger  ♫

244
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,800
♫  A day without you  ♫

245
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,940
♫  I can't hold on  ♫

246
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:38,540
♫  The person you are as much as dying  ♫

247
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,860
Guide her well.

248
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,790
I heard you were coming and you are actually here.

249
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:01,670
Then you should head inside. I will lead you.

250
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,940
If it's okay, I was thinking of looking around by myself.

251
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,800
If you did, then you should.

252
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:16,880
She takes after her mother.

253
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:40,290
Woah. It's the first time since I was born that I am seeing the Princess.

254
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,630
Why did the Princess come here?

255
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:46,000
Came to get married. Isn't that natural?

256
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,050
A princess at the age of preparing for marriage came here where the best men in the capital gathered. What other reasons could there be?

257
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,560
She is looking for her groom-to-be.

258
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,060
She's not my style. She doesn't look like her mother.

259
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,830
What type of girl is cold like that? She doesn't even smile.

260
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,450
- What are you talking about?
- Huh?

261
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,980
Isn't her mother colder?

262
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,780
I wonder what she's thinking about.

263
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,530
I don't think it's anything.

264
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,940
The things that my mother is doing,

265
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,560
everything has a meaning.

266
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,600
Why didn't you kill it? It was poisonous.

267
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:06,200
It wasn't its fault for being born with poison, so why do I have to kill it?

268
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,860
If you're afraid, then you can be more careful.

269
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,250
It's okay. Give it back.

270
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,560
What will you do if I can't?

271
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:48,280
You living like my brother, acting like nothing happened. What happens if I say I don't like it?

272
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:53,180
Nothing will be different. Whether you like it or not, I will live as your brother.

273
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,240
Liar.

274
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,270
You said that you remembered everything that I don't.

275
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:05,930
Didn't you tell me to ask you about my past if I didn't remember it? Whenever you open your mouth, you lie.

276
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,110
They were all lies.

277
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:16,000
My sister got burned from a brazier. She got hurt.

278
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,770
She smiled that day. She cried.

279
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,540
She was pretty.

280
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,250
I know because they were stories I heard over and over again.

281
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,380
What's your real name?

282
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,100
You can't even say your own name.

283
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:54,010
My name is only Seon Woo. I didn't have a name in the first place.

284
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,700
Whenever I look at you, I feel extremely ashamed.

285
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,130
I hate myself to death. I'm so disgusted that I could die.

286
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:08,130
♫  I can't hold you  ♫

287
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,980
Leave. I don't even want to see you.

288
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,600
♫ Black tears cover me ♫

289
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,630
♫  In my two red eyes, I boxed you up ♫

290
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:26,900
♫ I want to go back again to turn the clock back ♫

291
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:34,860
♫ to when it was beautiful ♫

292
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,960
♫  I want to have the impression that ♫

293
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,230
♫  Love is something ordinary  ♫

294
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:55,160
♫  Which brushes past like a strong wind  ♫

295
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:52,380
There is no better night to drink.

296
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,630
Yes. It is quite good.

297
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:05,490
Why did you accept? I'm talking about Princess Sook Myeong.

298
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,340
To protect my Hwarang.

299
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,850
What?

300
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,740
Have a drink, Deputy Chief.

301
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,980
It's not it's fault for being born with poison, so why do I need to kill it?

302
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,760
You can never disappoint Yeong Sil Gong.

303
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,450
You have to prevent Hwarang from dancing and playing instruments at the lunar festival.

304
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,930
Ban Ryu is still alive, right?

305
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,030
I can't live because I'm worrying too much.

306
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:33,800
Outside of there, even little kids are singing that Ban Ryu touched my breasts.

307
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:36,540
Were you that well-known to people?

308
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:43,390
Well, it's only one or two people at the moment, but that doesn't matter. It's really serious to me.

309
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:46,360
Is there any medicine which erases your memory?

310
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,780
If that medicine existed, I would take it first.

311
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,190
What happened to you?

312
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:56,030
My brother isn't my brother, but I want him to be,

313
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:03,190
but he's not my brother and he keeps on insisting that he is, so I hate him.

314
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:07,600
It doesn't sound like you are working on a new erotic novel. What is it?

315
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,790
Dance is imitating nature with your body.

316
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:19,320
The wind blows, the rain falls, the sun rises,

317
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:25,000
the river meets up with the ocean. Your body must move the same way.

318
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,020
You should know the strength of your body

319
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:34,720
and the softness of your body in order to put them into dance.

320
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,410
Turn around.

321
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,400
Hold it.

322
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,030
You can't do this?

323
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:55,490
I can't do it either.

324
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,400
- It hurts more for me.
- We're almost touching.

325
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:00,100
- Wait a minute, wait.
- Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

326
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,090
Carefully, carefully. Wait, wait.

327
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,930
More, more, more.

328
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,730
Don't you think this is too much?

329
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:16,250
Maybe I didn't like the brother who made his sister cry, or I'm jealous.

330
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,400
Why are you here?

331
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,560
Poong Wol Joo told me to be here.

332
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:51,780
You surprised me! You danced well. In my opinion, you are a talented dancer.

333
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,580
Just close your mouth and eat.

334
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:57,060
Ah, okay.

335
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:08,360
Is "don't approach" ended? This is really a big deal for me to share my rice with someone.

336
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,520
Say that you're sick one more time. I'll—

337
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,630
You seem fine.

338
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,290
A little.

339
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:27,120
I'm going to do this performance well. I'm going to show the Queen my deep loyalty.

340
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:33,250
So please cooperate. Huh? I said cooperate.

341
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:37,920
Loyalty? Are you sure?

342
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,600
About what?

343
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:49,970
At last, the time has arrived to begin the celebration ceremony. Are you ready to entertain the people?

344
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,600
Yes! Poong Wol Joo!

345
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:02,190
Show to the Queen and the members of the royal council that they can't rule the people only with a sword and a brush.

346
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:06,710
And heat up the capital with your dancing and singing.

347
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:12,180
Depending on the citizens' reaction, you will either fail or pass.

348
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,450
Do you understand?

349
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,820
Yes! Poong Wol Joo!

350
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,620
Where did the bastard, Ban Ryu, go?

351
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:29,760
You can never disappoint Yeong Sil Gong. Never!

352
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,330
Is it the truth?

353
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:39,070
Your feelings toward Soo Yeon, is it the truth?

354
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:48,420
I don't like you, but Soo Yeon seems to like you a lot.

355
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:53,600
However, if your feelings are not sincere, I will tear this up.

356
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,620
I will convey this to Soo Yeon.

357
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,430
I have not be able to wait one more day, so I am sending letter like this again.

358
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,600
Tomorrow at the festival, I will watch you dancing from the front row.

359
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,690
Please keep your heart at ease at the performance.

360
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:27,390
I will always support you.

361
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,090
It's the Princess.

362
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,820
She is Princess Sook Myeong.

363
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:13,880
For the time being, she will be staying here, for you

364
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,190
she will give a lot of insight to you.

365
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:22,600
What are you good at, Princess?

366
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,500
Well...

367
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,490
This much?

368
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:48,120
I heard that this festival, to the capital,

369
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,820
will be a ceremony to introduce Hwarang for the first time.

370
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:56,080
There shouldn't be any mistakes.

371
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,640
Do you understand?

372
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,930
It doesn't look right.

373
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,190
How is it?

374
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:16,060
Decorate to life (as pretty as possible).

375
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:19,750
Today, by the Hwarang, who are more beautiful than women,

376
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:22,450
our beauty might be trampled on (our beauty would be lost).

377
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,810
- Okta's pride is at stake.
- Understand?

378
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,860
Yes.

379
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,840
What is that?

380
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,150
Just stay still. This...

381
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:44,280
Ban Ryu will do well, right?

382
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,630
Do not worry.

383
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:50,050
He is someone who resisted entering into Hwarang.

384
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:54,770
He must be grinding his teeth from the insult of having to dance before the Queen Dowager.

385
00:42:54,770 --> 00:43:00,630
For Moon festival, we must give the subjects a nice present.

386
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,960
The Queen's Hwarang

387
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,550
running around in confusion, would be fun to see.

388
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:18,410
I don't know whether the Queen Dowager might faint at the sight.

389
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,590
Why are you here?

390
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:34,030
Why? Because I want to see you.

391
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,210
Why? I tried to speak openly with candor.

392
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,920
You said you couldn't sleep before.

393
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:47,360
You must be sleeping well now. seeing that you can afford to make jokes.

394
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,590
What if I still can't sleep?

395
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,080
Are you going to sleep with me?

396
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:56,060
Don't do it. My needle may be quicker than my will.

397
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:02,430
♬ When the path on which I fearlessly♬

398
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:05,860
You are coming to tonight's Hangawi festival, aren't you?

399
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,530
♬ went out and searched for the small dream ♬

400
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:09,930
Well...

401
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:13,810
Come. I today..

402
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:16,680
I'm thinking that I'll dance for you.

403
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,290
So if you don't come, I think I will be lonely.

404
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:23,390
To me, the subjects

405
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:27,490
you are the only one.

406
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:30,330
So you must come.

407
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,280
♬ and even a shard of ♬

408
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,800
I am getting sick of listening him the same thing over and over.

409
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:45,600
Ah, my head hurts.
♬ became a light in your breath.♬

410
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,470
You aren't my brother.

411
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,650
I'm letting you be because

412
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:12,550
it is an offense to hide a Cheonin. I am fine

413
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:18,930
but my father... He has spent all his life searching for my brother,

414
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,390
I feel sorry for Father.

415
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:38,520
Why is your hair like this?

416
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,630
Will you come later?

417
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:54,000
Why is he touching me? He's not my brother. He's just nothing.

418
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,900
I can't show my weakness in front of the royal council and the people.

419
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:16,340
It won't be easy for you to sit still for a long time.

420
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:20,970
If you can, try to relax your body where nobody can see you.

421
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,090
Your Highness, I prepared a cup of tea for you.

422
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:43,180
No need for tea. I will not be drinking tea today.

423
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,630
I heard that Hwarang just left their school.

424
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:02,360
I understand.

425
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:08,030
Let me prepare for your departure.

426
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,310
I will also leave now.

427
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:18,040
What do you think

428
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,800
about my proposal to start again?

429
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:28,510
It is cold at night. Please wear warm clothes.

430
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,320
Get dressed quickly, quickly.

431
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,180
- On the next beat, you go...
- Exactly, it's on the third beat...

432
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,700
One, two, three.

433
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,330
- Also your elbow...
- It's the third one...

434
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:54,590
The rhythm is right. One, two, three...

435
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:56,490
Of course, it's a problem. There are a lot of problems.

436
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:59,160
Do it. One, two, three, four.

437
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,600
That's not right. What are you doing?

438
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,960
Hyung, when I do it on top, you do it on the bottom.

439
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:09,090
- All right.
- Also, show your elbows, and then stretch it like this.

440
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:11,620
That's right. Do it again.

441
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,460
No, don't let your shoulders stick out.

442
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:18,150
Stretch it out. Just stretch. Just like that.

443
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:19,890
Turn around.

444
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,500
Let's go together.

445
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:47,940
Han Seong, here to pay my respect to Yeong Sil Gong.

446
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:54,510
Today's celebration will be very fun for many reasons, I think.

447
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:57,240
Please enjoy yourself.

448
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,080
Thank you, Yeong Sil Gong.

449
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,610
Is he getting ready alright?

450
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:24,290
He must be getting along fine, right? But anyway, what's it got to do with me?

451
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:30,020
Doctor Ah Ro? What are you doing here?

452
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,180
We're very busy right now, would you help us?

453
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,180
Please help us. Let's go.

454
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,860
No, no, no, I... There... I... th...

455
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:42,490
Done, it's done.

456
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:44,420
This thing...

457
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,640
Here, this is our reinforcement who will help us.

458
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:57,450
Well, if there's something you need, tell me. I'll help you.

459
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,460
Doctor Ah Ro!

460
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,950
This doesn't tie up very well. Tie it up for me.

461
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:18,310
Where are you going?

462
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:19,530
I have somewhere to be.

463
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:22,620
Somewhere to be? Here?

464
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:25,490
What?

465
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:31,960
Ah, well... N-Never mind.

466
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,840
Seriously those guys...

467
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:37,600
Where is Ban Ryu?

468
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,700
What are you doing here?

469
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,720
They're all searching for you, but what are you doing here?

470
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:14,050
Didn't we decide to be indifferent towards each other?

471
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:16,960
Do you wish me to pay attention to you again?

472
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,630
Are you alright, Your Highness?

473
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:11,180
I must rest for a bit.

474
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,610
I will escort you.

475
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:16,210
It's okay. I will go with the head of the guards.

476
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:30,170
How are they?

477
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:34,560
Our lads are very handsome, aren't they?

478
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:44,150
Very well. Are you fully ready to play today?

479
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:46,560
Yes, Chief Officer.

480
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:52,270
Very well, what is it?

481
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,560
Informing you about this now is a bit untimely, but

482
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:01,010
I thought I should tell you that two Hwarang from our room have disappeared.

483
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:08,430
Damn it! Those guys seriously...!

484
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:11,560
He means this kind of thing is somewhat unlucky, right?

485
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,860
♬ When the path on which I fearlessly ♬

486
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:20,130
♬ went out and chased the small dream ♬

487
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:25,450
♬ which was concealed in the flickering starlight ♬

488
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:30,320
♬ was more than I can bear ♬

489
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,490
♬ You were there. Like a dream ♬

490
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:38,410
♬ then another world ♬

491
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:41,130
The performance will go well.
♬ which I came to know ♬

492
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:44,420
Looking at how you practiced even to the extent that you hurt your hand like this.
♬ even a shard of my crushed heart ♬

493
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,810
It just happened...

494
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:49,130
It will go well, as everybody worked hard.

495
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:55,360
♬  became a light in your breath ♬

496
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:59,190
There's no use here, right?
♬ If you are the only one, that's fine for me ♬

497
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,650
Where am I supposed to find him?
♬ I will find the star ♬

498
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:03,310
Who are you looking for?
♬ Until I reach the dream ♬

499
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:06,230
Ji Dwi and Ban Ryu.

500
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:08,730
If we don't find them quickly, we all get fails.
♬ Even if the darkness surrounds me ♬

501
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:09,830
What? A fail?!

502
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,060
♬ You are the only one ♬

503
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:18,400
Well, if it's a fail, what? What does that have to do with me?
♬ I will never throw you away, you will always be my ♬

504
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,590
Yes, it has nothing to do with me.

505
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,420
Why is she like that?

506
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:25,970
♫  Woh oh oh oh~  ♫

507
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,100
Why is she like that?
♬ Please come closer ♬

508
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,330
It's me, Pa Oh.

509
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:41,040
She has been waiting.

510
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,060
Is it your idea?

511
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,390
Where did he go?

512
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:09,440
Oh, what? He was here!

513
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,410
What was the reason for sending Sook Myeong to Seonmoon?

514
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,440
Who is it?

515
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:21,500
Her Highness the Queen Dowager?

516
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,430
The King is at Seonmoon, so why can't the princess be there?

517
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:27,060
Mother!

518
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:31,220
Mother?

519
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:35,700
If you're uncomfortable with Sook Myeong being in the school with Hwarang, then you can leave.

520
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,370
A king who dances in front of his people!

521
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:42,270
Are you really going to throw away your dignity as a king?

522
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:46,120
No one knows that I'm the king, so what does it matter?

523
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,770
If you don't hand over the throne

524
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:51,660
I won't be able to become king anyway.

525
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:57,770
Then... Ji Dwi is...

526
00:55:57,770 --> 00:56:01,050
King Jinheung?

527
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,930
Did you ask why I sent Sook Myeong?

528
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:16,850
According to the tradition of the sacred bone, Sook Myeong will be your bride.

529
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:22,290
I can't let that happen. I will choose my bride.

530
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:24,630
Do you still not know?

531
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,470
Your heart doesn't matter.

532
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,690
How did your task go?

533
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:59,100
I think it went well.

534
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,450
That's good.

535
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,340
What are we going to do now?

536
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,520
Aish, it's ruined.

537
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,200
Isn't she Ahn Ji Gong's daughter?

538
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,600
Yes, that's right.

539
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:35,520
Did this child see?

540
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:40,660
It seems that she heard the conversation between Your Highness and His Majesty.

541
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,330
Did you really!

542
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:07,410
♫  I want to have the impression that  ♫

543
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:12,370
♫  Love is something ordinary  ♫

544
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:17,110
♫  Which brushes past ♫
