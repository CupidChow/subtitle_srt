1
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,710
Father! No!

2
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,480
No! Please save me!

3
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,280
When 15 minutes pass, I will behead them.

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,840
Save us!

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,100
So, before then, Silla's king should declare his kinghood.

6
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,060
Episode 15

7
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:44,000
Fifteen minutes haven't passed yet.

8
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,150
Was it too early?

9
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,050
Now, you've wasted half of the 15 minutes.

10
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,980
I am...

11
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,960
the King.

12
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,230
I am...

13
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,330
Silla's King!

14
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,030
Are you really Silla's King?

15
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,760
- How can I trust you?
- The one who made me step forward is you.

16
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,790
If you weren't going to believe me, you shouldn't have searched in the first place.

17
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,990
Oh wow, you are bold.

18
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,320
We can't just leave him like that. He might really die.

19
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,750
Do you really believe that guy's really the King?

20
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,040
Yeah, I do. Why don't you?

21
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,800
Let's just say he's the King. So, what can we do for him?

22
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,010
Neither he nor we can do anything.

23
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,310
We have to at least break the door down and fight together!

24
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,040
The Hwarang sent to prevent a war attacked South Buyeo first.

25
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,050
Is this what you want to hear? Do you want to be the cause of a war?!

26
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,110
What good comes out of us doing this to each other?

27
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:50,800
I am...Silla's King!

28
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,970
I think that winning or losing in a war is luck.

29
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,120
If you have good luck, you win. If your luck is bad, you lose.

30
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,510
But these days, because I have good luck,

31
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,940
someone who was a citizen of Silla gave me a substantial amount of gold

32
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,180
and told me that a king was among the Hwarang.

33
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,120
Although I didn't know he would really come forward,

34
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,140
by any chance, is it because of that girl?

35
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,970
That pretty girl who was among the captured.

36
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

37
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:43,100
Whatever the reason, forget it. It doesn't matter to me whether you're the King or not.

38
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,480
Whether you're the King or not, I'm going to make you into one.

39
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:54,060
Also, I will make you beg at my feet to save your life.

40
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,790
If you're a Crown Prince, it'd be nice if you acted like one.

41
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:05,070
Taking a delegation without any troops hostage, saying that you'll take over Silla,

42
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,010
who would say that's becoming of a Crown Prince? South Buyeo's King.

43
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:14,650
So, your father also won't be telling you ,"Good job."

44
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:19,020
What do you know about His Majesty to be running your mouth like that?

45
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,010
I'll give you a chance. A chance to save face as the future king of South Buyeo.

46
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,860
Who is giving whom a chance?

47
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,820
You may have already heard, but there's no one in Silla who knows the King's face.

48
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,730
If the Queen Dowager says I'm not the King, that's the end of it.

49
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:39,630
You'll probably end up being left as the lowlife who slaughtered the unarmed envoys, who accompanied the Princess.

50
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,660
So, I'm giving you a chance. A fair and square chance for Silla's King and

51
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,320
South Buyeo's Crown Prince to go head to head.

52
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,690
I grew up amidst a fierce war.

53
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,940
Unlike you, I didn't live in hiding.

54
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,740
As to whose life was more intense, we'll find out when we measure it.

55
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:12,800
I am... Silla's King!

56
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,260
That can't be.

57
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,180
He can't be my brother.

58
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:27,350
Still, seeing that he voluntarily came forward in a situation where his life was at stake, wouldn't he be His Majesty?

59
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,980
He put his life on the line?

60
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,970
But, why do I feel that he isn't?

61
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,680
I'm the wife of the man who was beheaded earlier.

62
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,100
Everyone is afraid because they think they'll be next.

63
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:20,160
You're a citizen of Silla. Why did you come all the way to South Buyeo?

64
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,630
For people like me, what does it matter which nation I am a subject of?

65
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,970
Eating and surviving is more frightening.

66
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,870
Don't worry too much, because everyone will be alright.

67
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:43,930
If you lose spirit like this, even if we have the opportunity, we won't be able to return.

68
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,990
- So, stay strong.
- What do you mean by alright? What is alright?

69
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,610
That faceless king and all of us are on the verge of death!

70
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,240
Can a king without troops or weapons save us?

71
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,910
The one who came forward as the King earlier is someone I know better than anyone else.

72
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,740
He's never going to leave us to die.

73
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,220
Can you promise that?

74
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,140
If we die, you die as well. Can you make that promise!?

75
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,130
- I believe in him.
- I asked if you can make a promise!

76
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:28,210
I promise. I'll also stay here with you.

77
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:47,890
How can I have the opportunity to beat Silla's King fair and square?

78
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:53,430
If you spar with me one on one, people will say that the Crown Prince let Silla's King off easy.

79
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,870
Take all the measures that will ensure your win. I will accept them all.

80
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,660
Are you looking down on me?

81
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,650
I could be.

82
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,990
Do you think of yourself as the King? In other words,

83
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,070
I'm curious what a king who has never been the King

84
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,870
thinks of himself.

85
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:23,830
Even if only a single beast lives in the forest alone, will that beast be able to forget who it is?

86
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:32,070
If I win, the Princess cannot go back.

87
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:37,370
The Hwarang who came with you, along with the citizens...

88
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,950
I will behead them and send the heads back.

89
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,190
Let's not make it complicated and make the decision with a sword fight.

90
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,430
The conditions are up to me.

91
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,040
Agreed.

92
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,660
General!

93
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:00,280
Wait. Before you leave, let's test your luck.

94
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,430
It's 5 and 6.

95
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,620
Escort him well.

96
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,560
He is Silla's King.

97
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,340
Let's go.

98
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,930
Is this the place where Silla's citizens are imprisoned?

99
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,540
Yes. That is correct.

100
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,240
I will prepare another location.

101
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,370
My original place is comfortable. I'll go there.

102
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,460
Are you okay?

103
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,600
I mean, are you okay? (more formal)

104
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,840
Are you really the King?

105
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,620
Tell me. I'm asking if you are the King!

106
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,100
Stop it, Ban Ryu.

107
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,860
Yeah, I'm the King.

108
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,810
Until we get out of here.

109
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,220
Then are you saying that you're not the King afterward?

110
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,790
I'll tell you if I'm the real king or not, if we get out of here alive.

111
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,760
We need to live in order to have a king,

112
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,020
and you also need to keep your heads.

113
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:47,650
What are you thinking of doing— Ah, since I'm trying to use formal speech all of a sudden, it's not working.

114
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,610
What are you thinking of doing? (Speaking informally.)

115
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,860
I'm going to fight with Crown Prince Chang.

116
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:30,650
That's a reckless move. He has been trained by war.

117
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,150
He thinks killing people is a joke.

118
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,570
I will win, because I have something to protect.

119
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,630
Are you talking about your sister?

120
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,700
Yeah.

121
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:55,090
Also, the people who were born in the wrong nation and are starving and afraid.

122
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,590
In your words, "the people."

123
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,750
Is that...the truth?

124
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,510
It is even confirmed that Gakgan's servant went into South Buyeo with a gold vase.

125
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,760
Gakgan's son is also in the delegation.

126
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,940
That's not his son. It's his godson.

127
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,690
Your Highness, His Majesty... Please save His Majesty.

128
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,870
The members of the royal council... Call them.

129
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,370
What do you mean by that?

130
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,530
They said the Hwarang are going to die.

131
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,610
What do you mean die?

132
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:15,740
There will be no peace-making. Also, the Hwarang will not be able to return.

133
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,940
It seems the Crown Prince of South Buyeo got a tip that the King is in the Hwarang.

134
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,720
Probably from Park Yeong Sil.

135
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,420
Then, are you saying that there will be a war?

136
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,980
The royal council will not make a move since Park Yeong Sil won't either.

137
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,560
Then what should we do?

138
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,630
What do you think we should do?

139
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,850
Poong Wol Joo (Head of the Hwarang) possesses the answer.

140
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,510
Why don't I see Gakgan (Park Yeong Sil) here?

141
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,250
While entering the palace, he had an intestinal illness, which caused him to vomit and have diarrhea. He went back.

142
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,650
Right now, he is receiving medical treatment.

143
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:08,180
He said that something happened to the envoy of Hwarang sent for peace-making.

144
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:12,270
But, would such a thing happen? He seems to be mistaken.

145
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,700
This is from a well-informed person.

146
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,860
If we don't quickly bring the troops, the safety of the Princess and the Hwarang—

147
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,700
Are you thinking properly?

148
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,480
If we immediately bring the military into a situation that hasn't even happened and cause a problem,

149
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,350
Silla will have a huge responsibility to bear.

150
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:31,680
My son isn't in danger. Is that it?

151
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:37,090
At this time when we're seeking peace, mobilizing the military is impossible.

152
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,580
There's no justification for it.

153
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:47,120
Up until recently, you wanted to go to war. Now, because we don't have a justifiable cause, we can't mobilize an army?

154
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:54,180
Exactly which nation do you represent? Are you saying you don't give a damn about Silla's security?!

155
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,340
Are you saying that you made a deal with Crown Prince Chang?

156
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,690
Things turned out easier than I thought. Catching the enemy by using enemies.

157
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,850
It looks like it will take care of itself.

158
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:26,090
Are you saying Sam Maek Jong is really among the Hwarang that left as envoys?

159
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,160
He is, definitely.

160
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:38,400
But even if he isn't, we'll have to make it so that he is.

161
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:53,120
There will be no peace-making. Also, the Hwarang will not be able to return.

162
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,430
It seems the Crown Prince of South Buyeo got a tip that the King is among the Hwarang.

163
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:02,720
Poong Wol Joo (Head of the Hwarang) possesses the answer.

164
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,970
Damn it.

165
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:28,490
As expected, I have good luck. Isn't it sheer luck that I met him now?

166
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:35,560
Had I met him later, who knows what would've happened to me? I get that kind of thought.

167
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,520
Are you planning to kill him?

168
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,310
Isn't everything he says correct?

169
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:47,930
When everyone knows he is the King, killing him after treating him like one would justify my actions.

170
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:52,590
The one who made Silla's King surrender, South Buyeo's Crown Prince.

171
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:59,860
If Silla can come into my hands like that, in the future, dominance of the three kingdoms

172
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,990
will fall easily into my hands.

173
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:11,960
I think I will be able to give a big present to the King on his birthday.

174
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,120
General, what do you think?

175
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:23,270
If something bad happens to the Crown Prince, I'll die too.

176
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:32,530
You also seem to have aged a lot. I'm Chang.

177
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:40,170
I'm South Buyeo's Crown Prince, Chang. The one who grew up with the battlefield as my playground.

178
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,890
Guys! Hey, guys!

179
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:49,330
Hey, what, what. Hey, did you hear about that?

180
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,130
They said the Hwarang may not be able to return.

181
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:51,790
What?

182
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,510
What are you talking about? What do you mean they can't return?

183
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,740
Right now, they're being held by South Buyeo's Crown Prince

184
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,870
They're all going to die!

185
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,390
What do we do?

186
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,730
What? Explain it in detail!

187
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,620
- Are you serious?
- What do we do? What do we do?!

188
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:15,150
Do you think that the Hwarang has enough power to change Silla?

189
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,430
It's very unlike you. Why do you ask such a question?

190
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,180
Because I suddenly had that thought.

191
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:32,140
If a bird that has left its nest is to fly in the sky, it will need many days. After sending them out into the world,

192
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:38,030
will they really be able to fly? I had that kind of thought.

193
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,820
Poong Wol Joo,

194
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:48,970
in the beginning, I didn't like this place. I didn't acknowledge your teachings either.

195
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:54,550
However, right now, I know that those children have become different from before.

196
00:21:54,550 --> 00:22:00,550
They are no longer children who remain in an adult's world. They form their own judgments.

197
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:05,390
They are children who can decide what kind of life they will live.

198
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,650
By any chance, do you plan on creating another uproar?

199
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,680
No, no.

200
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,740
Bu Jae, thank you.

201
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,490
This is a ridiculous contest. Give it up, now.

202
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:41,790
Rather than doing nothing, I have to try something. Also, I'm not going to lose.

203
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,120
Are you ready?

204
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,020
Don't die.

205
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:48,320
What's this?

206
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,530
It's one on one. Other conditions remain the same.

207
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:57,620
Consider this as something I did out of concern for you.

208
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,630
Let's go.

209
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,260
What are you doing right now?

210
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,150
Princess, this is a war.

211
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:55,670
Here, much of what happens to Silla depends on the outcome. Including you, Princess.

212
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,930
I don't know why that woman keeps catching my eye.

213
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:13,460
Seeing that you're buying time with nonsense, you must be afraid.

214
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:21,020
You...seem to have trouble just holding the sword.

215
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,490
It seems like you're quite interested in me.

216
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:30,280
I am...South Buyeo's Crown Prince, Chang!

217
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:45,760
Today, I plan to face Silla's King, Jin Heung, in a sword contest.

218
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:52,290
This contest is a fair one where we respect each other.

219
00:25:52,290 --> 00:26:00,300
Depending on the outcome, henceforth, the relationship of the two nations will become different.

220
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:05,860
No matter what the result, I will accept the result. In the future,

221
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,960
I will not make any objections about this incident.

222
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,760
This, in front of Baekje's commander and

223
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,730
Silla's Hwarang,

224
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,720
I swear.

225
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:02,370
Are you already tired?

226
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:08,780
If you went to war with that kind of skill, you wouldn't have been able to survive 15 minutes and would've died.

227
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,560
He's precise and quick. I can't avoid it.

228
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,670
It will hurt a bit this time.

229
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:39,030
He's playing with me. If he's going to cut me and make me tired, he's thinking of stabbing me.

230
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,890
At this rate, I won't be able to withstand two rounds.

231
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:44,150
What are you doing instead of running away?

232
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,060
I'm having fun. I guess you're not?

233
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:52,980
Because you're only playing around, it's not fun.

234
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,830
Then, should we end it?

235
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,620
Sounds good.

236
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,760
If you want my arm, I'll give it to you. However, this time, I'll also cut you.

237
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:13,330
Instead, one move quicker! One, two, now!

238
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:41,820
General. Didn't you say it's a fair contest in which much is at stake for Silla and South Buyeo?

239
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,400
Are you going to defy the Crown Prince's command?

240
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,600
Let's change the rules.

241
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,520
Now, it should be fun.

242
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,750
Aren't you afraid of dying?

243
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,390
What about it?

244
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:09,600
This is where Mak Moon and that rascal lived.

245
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,580
He didn't even have a name, so we called him Moo Myeong.

246
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:23,640
Later on, everyone called him Dog-Bird. Dog-Bird.

247
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,450
Earlier,

248
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,920
you told me I unlatched the gate of fate.

249
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,200
What does that mean?

250
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,830
Did I say that?

251
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,520
There's no such thing as coincidence in the world.

252
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,830
Why out of all people did I raise your son as well as that child?

253
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,560
What does that mean...

254
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,730
Who do you think

255
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,480
that child is?

256
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,980
Enough.

257
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,950
It isn't over yet!

258
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:24,030
Acknowledge...your defeat.

259
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,040
Keep your promise.

260
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:55,790
Through this incident, I will not go to war with Silla.

261
00:33:55,790 --> 00:34:02,780
Also, I will release Silla's Princess and the delegation.

262
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,080
What about the people?

263
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,630
What's going to happen to the people here?

264
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:15,710
They have nothing to do with this incident.

265
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:21,190
Since, they are criminals guilty of stealing South Buyeo's goods,

266
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,610
they will have to pay with their lives.

267
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,570
- How can you do that?
- Put all of them in jail!

268
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:56,810
- We have to leave now?
- We don't know when the Crown Prince will change his mind.

269
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:01,330
But, where are the remaining two Hwarang?

270
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,700
Are you thinking of bringing her out by yourself?

271
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,200
- Mind your own business.
- Give up.

272
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,020
The moment you get caught by the Crown Prince looking for her, she will be the first to die.

273
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,160
Then what do you want me to do?

274
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:52,820
Because the Crown Prince isn't feeling well, he isn't able to see you off. Please understand.

275
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:57,790
Tell the Crown Prince that we are happy about making peace between our nations and

276
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:01,400
continuing the alliance.

277
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,970
I will do so.

278
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:51,000
You trust him? He isn't someone who would leave us to die?

279
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:55,560
They all ran away. Now, what are you going to do?

280
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,730
If you have a mouth, then at least say something!

281
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:01,350
Why are you being like this? What wrong did this young lady do?

282
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,680
What do you mean she didn't do anything wrong!

283
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,270
She shouldn't have made us hope! Or needlessly have any expectations!

284
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:13,600
Because of you...being here is more hellish!

285
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:22,190
This is starving to death, that's what. I'd rather be one of the ones who got beheaded.

286
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:26,030
They don't have to worry about being hungry or dying.

287
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:31,210
Still, don't lose hope.

288
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:35,350
- That wench is still...
- Even if we're going to die anyway,

289
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:39,110
waiting and dying without hope, isn't something a person should do.

290
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:43,410
If you're alive, doing what you can is what makes one a person.

291
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:47,330
What we can do now is to prepare.

292
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:50,290
What do you mean by prepare? Prepare for what?

293
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:54,430
Prepare to run away when the opportunity comes.

294
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:58,380
Prepare to live well again when we return home.

295
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,990
Prepare to be happy again.

296
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:08,970
So, even though we're going to die, even so,

297
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,620
don't abandon hope.

298
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,960
There are four at the south entrance of the jail and four at the north.

299
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,850
If we're going to get everyone in there out, we have to do it as quietly as possible.

300
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:52,220
We can't get caught with the jails empty for a long time.

301
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:56,530
But, will you be alright in that state?

302
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,330
Let's go.

303
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,030
Who is there?

304
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,180
Come out quickly. Quickly!

305
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,240
There is no time!

306
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,560
Please move quickly!

307
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,950
Are you okay?

308
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,860
That's a relief. Let's go.

309
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:36,480
Come out. Come out.

310
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,190
South Buyeo's Crown Prince had great tolerance to

311
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:09,340
send Silla's envoys back.

312
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:13,070
How can you do something so immoral?

313
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:19,280
We originally came here to make peace, but your Crown Prince locked us up and treated us poorly.

314
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,980
If South Buyeo doesn't want to go to war with Silla, you should stop at this point.

315
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:30,470
In order to show that our countries are at peace, we will take our citizens back.

316
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:36,950
I will understand that you want to bury your bones in South Buyeo's soil.

317
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,410
Did you have to talk so rudely...

318
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,230
Did you have to say it that way?

319
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,900
It didn't work.

320
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,450
Kill them!

321
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:07,340
Go!

322
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:19,660
Are you okay?

323
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:24,890
We will take care of things here, so you guys take the people towards the South gate.

324
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,300
Ban Ryu.

325
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:32,670
It's that way. Come quickly. Hurry!

326
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,770
I let them go as you commanded.

327
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:21,780
Then, we'll have to begin the hunt.

328
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:30,350
Let the South Buyeo hunters capture the only beast of prey living in the forest.

329
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:54,270
We're alive!

330
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:57,240
We're alive!

331
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,960
We're alive!

332
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:21,960
Spread out! Everyone, spread out!

333
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,650
Soo Ho!

334
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,590
Huh?

335
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:05,450
Soo Ho!

336
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:14,150
That's a shame. Someone else got shot.

337
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:16,820
We are too close to Silla's border.

338
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:22,050
Then, I guess we will have to end the hunt.

339
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,940
No! You can't!

340
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:46,590
My child...my child...

341
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:57,290
No!

342
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,790
Instead of a tiger, isn't this a rat caught in a trap?

343
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:55,240
Jin Heung! Don't you think we should finish the game?

344
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:00,530
I think I'm the victor. Were you the type to be this persistent?

345
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:03,660
I'm saying that we should have a proper fight.

346
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:08,780
The win on that day left much to be desired.

347
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:13,000
Then you and I...will fight one on one!

348
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,770
No. This time, it will be an all-out-war.

349
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:24,070
I lost the desire to let you all return alive.

350
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,620
They are undoubtedly Silla's citizens!

351
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:39,020
So as the King, how can I leave them to die?

352
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:44,530
Didn't you say that they have nothing to do with our contest?

353
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:48,490
Also, those who organized a prison break for the criminals who stole items from South Buyeo,

354
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,590
how can I let them go alive?

355
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,490
If you want to try, go ahead!

356
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:02,340
I'll block everything.

357
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,810
You want to take it to the very end?

358
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,020
General.

359
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:21,910
Aim!

360
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,640
What is that?

361
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,400
They are Hwarang.

362
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:36,170
Looks like I appeared at just the right time.

363
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:47,320
To release you as Hwarang anywhere, you sure are in an awful state.

364
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:53,010
Other than the looks, I am proud that you guys are my Hwarang.

365
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,450
I don't know who you are,

366
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:06,190
but you are currently on Silla's land.

367
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,920
Apparently, it seems you lost your way while hunting.

368
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:16,060
You're very close to being mistaken for starting a war.

369
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,660
By chance, you wouldn't be South Buyeo's Crown Prince Chang,

370
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:26,900
who chased our peace-seeking delegation which wasn't even accompanied by troops?

371
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:32,660
If you're not this or that, you sure look like a bunch of robbers.

372
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,290
What would you like to do?

373
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:40,460
Why don't you observe our Hwarang's skills before you leave?

374
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,740
Why don't we return? I don't think this is the right time.

375
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:08,920
Hwarang. They're called Hwarang.

376
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,670
Your Majesty, the Crown Prince.

377
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,050
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

378
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:25,900
I was so absorbed in tiger hunting that I crossed the border.

379
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:31,890
Please, generously forgive me for that.

380
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:34,480
If that's the case...

381
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:46,000
Today as well, I am leaving you with a debt.

382
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,630
However, the next time we get to meet,

383
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:56,350
at that time, let's finish the hunt. Jin Heung.

384
00:51:56,350 --> 00:52:00,230
♬ I'm fine with you as the only one. ♬

385
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:02,840
♬ I will find the star. ♬

386
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:07,000
Let's go.
♬ Until I reach the dream ♬

387
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,810
♬ Even if darkness surrounds me ♬

388
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:13,350
♬ You are the only one ♬

389
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:16,050
♬ I will never throw away. ♬

390
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,700
♬ You'll always be mine. ♬

391
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:32,290
♬ I'll whisper in your ear ♬

392
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,870
♬ You're everything to me. ♬

393
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:48,550
Congratulations. Didn't everything turn out the way Your Highness wanted?

394
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:53,050
Is everyone really safe?

395
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:55,520
It seems so.

396
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:06,410
But, is that Hwarang really His Majesty?

397
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:14,380
Among the citizens, it is widely rumored that Seon Woo is His Majesty.

398
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:18,540
The real king who will strengthen Silla.

399
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,870
Aigoo, are you alright?

400
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:31,800
Aigoo, aigoo, my child...

401
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:36,420
What are you doing over here? It doesn't look good over there either.

402
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,380
Ahn Ji Gong!

403
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:55,250
We can't contain the illness. The need for medicine is urgent.

404
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:59,730
The medicine for the epidemic has also run out in the capital.

405
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:12,020
So, all of them returned alive?

406
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:17,790
They even rescued all the citizens captured in Baekje and crossed the border.

407
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:25,530
I apologize.

408
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:28,030
This isn't it.

409
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:31,730
This isn't what I pictured.

410
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,230
An honorable wound, you rascal.

411
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:45,010
Hey!

412
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:49,530
With something this trivial, if you're a man, you should endure it.

413
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,570
Sheesh.

414
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:58,490
Exactly what did they do to have such vigorous appetites?

415
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:02,920
How will one be able to make any profit? Sheesh.

416
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,180
I am

417
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,920
the King.

418
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:27,280
I... am Silla's King!

419
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,360
To the point of going mad

420
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,820
I wanted to embrace you.

421
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:30,720
Your injuries.

422
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:34,110
Are they alright?

423
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,100
Let me take a look.

424
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:55,950
I'm sorry... for avoiding you.

425
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:03,090
I know that it was to protect me.

426
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:11,550
I thought I was dying while holding back my desire to run to you.

427
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:15,550
♬ Your aching heart displays everything ♬

428
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:22,360
♬ If you keep doing that you will just leave me ♬

429
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:30,000
I don't really know what I should say in this situation.

430
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:39,590
♬ I'm afraid of being suspended a long time somewhere in memory ♬

431
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:41,380
♬ I'm afraid  ♬

432
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:47,090
I love you.
♬ the more I try to wipe it out, the more I will be left yearning  ♬

433
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,050
I love you.
♬ So I can't let you go ♬

434
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:57,900
♬ So I can't let you go ♬

435
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:09,500
♬ Although you and I became tears for each other ♬

436
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:16,990
♬ After time passed on a bright day ♬

437
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:24,800
♬ when we just held each other tight and it was just like a dream ♬

438
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:32,300
♬ I remember that time then. ♬
