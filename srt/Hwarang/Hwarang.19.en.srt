00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,980
Episode 19

2
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,540
Who is that?

3
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:38,040
I am the King of Silla, Jin Heung.

4
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,600
Is this a dream?

5
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,080
How did you know to come here?

6
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,610
Wherever you may be, did you think I wouldn't be able to find you?

7
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,900
I won't send you anywhere anymore.

8
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,830
♫ Don't get hurt ♫

9
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,500
♫ Don't come any closer ♫

10
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,640
♫ My frozen heart ♫

11
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,480
♫ Can't embrace you ♫

12
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,430
♫ A slight sprinkle is falling ♫

13
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,460
Open your eyes.
♫ Black tears cover me. ♫

14
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,970
♫ In my two red eyes ♫

15
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,290
Ah Ro, open your eyes. Ah Ro, open your eyes.
♫ I boxed you up ♫

16
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:44,100
♫ I want to go back again to turn the clock back ♫

17
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,830
♫ to when it was beautiful ♫

18
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,870
Please leave. I'll take care of this.

19
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,700
Don't you need to save her, Seon Woo?!

20
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,350
Why are you here?

21
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,300
Me? I came to protect them.

22
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,590
Don't you know who ordered me here?

23
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,980
Under whose command do you think I came?! And, you!

24
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:33,040
You keep speaking informally to me, but I've been eating the palace guards' food for ten years longer than you have!

25
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,250
Get out of the way.

26
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,110
I have come under the command of Her Highness the Queen Dowager to punish the impudent pretender to the throne.

27
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,310
You don't know who the false monarch is.

28
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,980
Because you serve a false monarch, you're confused as to who the real king is, right?

29
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,900
It's the true king's command to protect them.

30
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,010
It's a royal command, you rascal!

31
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,970
It is you who are disobeying the royal command.

32
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,680
Are you up to the task?

33
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,490
I'm going to start by killing you.

34
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,050
Chief guard, obey the royal command.

35
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,820
Your Highness!

36
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,380
Your daughter has become a Wonhwa.

37
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,270
A Wonhwa?

38
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,900
I shall make your son, no, my son, the king.

39
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,180
That child is Joon Jeong's son

40
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,700
Hwi Gyeong Gong's son, the sacred bone of Silla.

41
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,780
Wh-What is is this?

42
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,790
You must save her.

43
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,910
Take her in... inside!

44
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,130
Go.

45
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,550
I don't want to.

46
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,440
I'm saying this as this child's father and doctor!

47
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,190
Because you are a disturbance, leave.

48
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:09,350
♬ I'm chanting and chanting again the incantation ♬

49
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:14,970
♬ that I am not going to love ♬

50
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:20,930
This cannot be. Ah Ro, you must endure.

51
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,000
If something happens to you as well...

52
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,920
Please... Please endure.

53
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,780
♬ Even knowing it would be without ♬

54
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,430
♬ It was everything ♬

55
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,070
♬ that I could do for you.♬

56
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,450
Make sure to eat. You must survive.

57
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,740
♬ Because I knew ♬

58
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,760
♬ our ending would hurt ♬

59
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,690
♬ Because I wish for a miracle like in movies ♬

60
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:05,240
Don't get hurt. Now, I hope you won't get hurt.

61
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,640
I haven't even told you that I liked you because you weren't my brother.

62
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:18,490
Because this heart of mine is about to go crazy, because I hate myself so much,

63
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,990
I couldn't tell you that's why I acted so hatefully.

64
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,390
♬ I'm bringing you back to my side again ♬

65
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:32,450
♬ Even if you try to leave, ultimately that's your place ♬

66
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,070
♬ A few days together with you ♬

67
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,040
♬ That's what a gift is and ♬

68
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,080
♬ I am thankful for being able to see you♬

69
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,960
She narrowly escaped receiving a fatal wound.

70
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,690
What happened?

71
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:27,600
The Queen Dowager sent the chief guard to kill me. She was hit by the arrow instead of me.

72
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:35,190
If I stay by her side, she'll continue to be in danger,

73
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:41,050
because she knows that the one who influences me is Ah Ro.

74
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,080
So what do you plan to do?

75
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:04,000
♫ I have never dreamed of you ♫

76
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:16,100
♫ Heart, don't love her ♫

77
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,520
♫ Blindfold me so that I can't see you ♫

78
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:33,100
Being like this does not suit you.

79
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,780
♫ This foolish heart...♫

80
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,860
So hurry and get up.

81
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,200
♫  only wants you. ♫

82
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,150
A guy like me

83
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:52,580
thought it didn't matter whether I was born into this world or not.

84
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,550
After meeting you,

85
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:59,570
♫ Being wounded ♫

86
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,640
I was thankful for the first time for being born.

87
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:09,140
♫ Even it it hurts it is okay. I can't stop. ♫

88
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,000
Because the reason I'm alive right now is you,

89
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,930
♫ Because you are my love ♫

90
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,190
it's a relief.

91
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:24,330
♫ From where If I extend my hand I can touch you ♫

92
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,870
I'm sorry. Also,

93
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,950
♫ Don't get too far away ♫

94
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,520
I really love you.

95
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,290
♫ Don't leave me alone ♫

96
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:53,200
♫ The more you are pruned away the more your grow ♫

97
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:08,100
♫ I can't bear even a day without you ♫

98
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:20,700
♫  You are the person whom I love to the point of death. Receiving a wound ♫

99
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:31,200
♫  even it hurts is okay. I can't stop ♫

100
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:44,900
I will cover up the mistake you made.

101
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:50,500
You just need to stay put. Just like when no one knew what you looked like.

102
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,630
I will protect you. I will arrange for a detached palace for you to live in.

103
00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:01,000
Stay there for now. I will shut the mouths of the Royal Council.

104
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,460
It is not a mistake.

105
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:07,950
If it is not a mistake, how can you ascend the throne without preparation?

106
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:14,560
Do you know what ultimately becomes of a king without power? A plaything!

107
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,920
Played around with by the Royal Council. In the end, you will lose everything!

108
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,800
Losing the throne, you will also lose your life.

109
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,250
Will the sacred bone tradition end with your childish behavior?

110
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:37,150
I am already the king. The only thing that happened today was revealing that fact.

111
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:42,420
No. You're not a king.

112
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,050
You've only been under my shade with that justification.

113
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,560
Yes. I have been hiding under your shade.

114
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,990
I know very well that I'm alive thanks to you.

115
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,250
That shade was even comfortable, and there were times I even regarded it as fortunate.

116
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:00,900
However, living that way was not always pleasant.

117
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,900
Now, I came to let you know I will stand on my own.

118
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,360
In front of everyone without hiding my identity, I will deal with everything.

119
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:16,160
I came to create the future of Silla I dream of on my own!

120
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,750
You will regret it, most certainly.

121
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:27,090
That regret will also be my share to bear.

122
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:32,290
That is something I will handle.

123
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,220
You're here.

124
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,380
If you are my father...

125
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:09,320
My mother... I mean...

126
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,890
I must also have

127
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,870
a mother.

128
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,980
Well, was there someone like that?

129
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,650
Joon Jeong.

130
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,430
She was one of Silla's Wonhwa.

131
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:43,830
She was beautiful. She was an emminently virtuous person who received the subjects' trust.

132
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,060
The Wonhwa was a threat to the weak royal family.

133
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:55,700
In addition, when she was a Wonhwa bearing the child of a sacred bone, she was even more of a threat.

134
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:04,370
When it happened, you were the child she was bearing.

135
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,800
The baby is m-moving.

136
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,920
Ji So.

137
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,920
I'm still the same,

138
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:27,690
I was a Cheonin, then a half-breed,

139
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,660
now I'm a sacred bone. After so long.

140
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,480
Father.

141
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,630
I know it was difficult for you to live.

142
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:59,660
However, I won't say I'm sorry.

143
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:06,470
I had hoped that you would live freely without a name or a care for things like being a prince.

144
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,000
That...

145
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:14,090
was the best option to protect you.

146
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:23,670
I watched over you for a long time. And now it's time.

147
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:32,330
Preparations have been made to make you into a king. There is no one in Silla stronger than you.

148
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:40,040
There is no one who understands the people as well as you. A new king who will change the present and the future of chaotic Silla.

149
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,280
That person is you.

150
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,420
But then, where is the chief guard?

151
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:04,690
Mo Yeong. What about the tea? How much longer will it take?

152
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,390
Gakgan (Park Yeong Sil) will not take this without making a scene.

153
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:28,210
Someone who doesn't know anything, with such recklessness and childishness, wants to sit on the throne?

154
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:33,360
What kind of Silla will he create? How have I protected Sila.

155
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,420
Yee Chan. ( 17th rank, 2nd grade official).

156
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,260
Yes, Your Highness.

157
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,980
There is something you must prepare.

158
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,590
Come in.

159
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,850
Isn't she the palace maid?

160
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:19,030
How is Ji So feeling?

161
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:25,560
Because she's been drinking tea laced with trace amounts of poison for 10 years, symptoms are now starting to appear.

162
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:31,680
Her hands tremble, she has fainting spells, and she has hallucinations.

163
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,490
It would've been a done deal if we had just killed off Sam Maek Jong.

164
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,050
Had the faceless king died quietly while wandering outside the palace and

165
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:47,330
Ji So died from a chronic illness,

166
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:53,110
who would have held a revolt against me, Park Young Sil, for ascending the throne?

167
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:03,160
There is a way to kill Sam Maek Jong.

168
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,330
You called for me?

169
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,760
Is there...something the matter?

170
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,930
His Majesty Jin Heung has returned.

171
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,660
There is something you must do.

172
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:50,260
One moment, over there! Did you hear the news?

173
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,160
- The king has changed.
- What are you talking about?

174
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,170
That faceless king. That king has changed.

175
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,330
What?

176
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,390
Ji Dwi is the king.

177
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,470
So you mean, Ji Dwi is the king?

178
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:16,520
According to my information source, for certain, he already entered Wolseong and said, "I am Jin Heung."

179
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,300
That fair-complexioned guy is the King? Then what is Dog-Bird?

180
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,490
That's what I mean.

181
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,950
So instead of Seon Woo, Ji Dwi is the real king?

182
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:32,640
This is why they say you need to observe a person till the very end.

183
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,610
- I don't remember.
- What?

184
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,580
Was I nice to Ji Dwi all this time?

185
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,960
How regretful. I should've been nice to him.

186
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,080
That way, I'll be able to live comfortably without worrying for the rest of my life.

187
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,470
You dropped this.

188
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,660
Were you surprised because Seon Woo wasn't the real king?

189
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,590
What's with him?

190
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,590
Seonmoon's atmosphere is already disturbed as it is.

191
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:48,490
Poong Wol Joo, Poong Wol Joo!

192
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,890
Did you hear that Ji Dwi is His Majesty King Jin Heung?

193
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,040
Why shout and make so much noise?

194
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:02,000
By chance, did you already know—? Then you should've told me!

195
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:07,460
But, what are you doing right now?

196
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,300
I was fired. From being Poong Wol Joo.

197
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,560
What are you talking about? Instead of Seon Woo, they said that Ji Dwi was the king.

198
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,930
- It's a mess.
- Aren't you affected by this at all?

199
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:35,940
You also thought that Dog-Bird was the real king.

200
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,890
He was believable as the king, that guy.

201
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:52,430
What's this? Why is Bu Jae coming into Poong Wol Joo's lecture?

202
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:02,700
From today, Poong Wol Joo has left Seonmoon.

203
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,500
So, there is no afternoon lecture on the Book of Odes.

204
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,280
Since it's a day off, you may leave Seonmoon.

205
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,600
Why did Poong Wol Joo...

206
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,530
I told you Seonmoon's atmosphere is disturbed.

207
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,020
Your Majesty, Princess Sook Myeong has arrived.

208
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,530
You want to go against my wishes?

209
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:55,000
How dangerous that Hwarang is, what a source of trouble he is,

210
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,530
- you have no idea.
- But,

211
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,560
it was the King's royal command.

212
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,000
Royal command? Royal command?!

213
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,790
In Silla, what I order is the royal command!

214
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,550
I put Sam Maek Jong on the throne.

215
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:22,670
I created everything. I did!

216
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,580
Your Highness, Queen Dowager.

217
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,500
Mother! Mother!

218
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:42,460
Is there no one there? Mother!

219
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,130
Among the Hwarang, Ji Dwi is the best.

220
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,880
Among the kings, Seon Woo is the best.

221
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,650
Among the Hwarang, Ji Dwi is the best.

222
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:57,470
Among the Kings, Seon Woo is the best.

223
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:01,710
Among the Hwarang, Ji Dwi is the best.

224
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:21,840
It's Han Seong's glass.

225
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:38,610
Among the Hwarang, Ji Dwi is the best. Among the Kings, Seon Woo is the best.

226
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:45,330
Among the Hwarang, the best is Ji Dwi. The King among kings is Seon Woo?

227
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,960
What kind of talk is this...

228
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,210
No way.

229
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,590
How do I look?

230
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,840
You really look like a king.

231
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,550
What happened to that rascal? He's safe, right?

232
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,460
What is it?

233
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,240
I asked you what's the matter.

234
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,440
For the first time, weren't you on your way to supervise

235
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,600
- a meeting? Later—
- Tell me.

236
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,500
Immediately.

237
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,450
Actually, Doctor Ah Ro

238
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:31,230
was hit by an arrow shot by the chief guard.

239
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,730
She didn't die.

240
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,100
I apologize, Your Majesty.

241
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,790
Giddy up!

242
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,960
Do you really have to be so obvious?

243
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,100
What did I make so obvious?

244
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,330
Everyone gets fired at least once in their lifetime.

245
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:16,080
- You're acting as if it's a big deal by yourself.
- It's because you haven't seen me from the beginning.

246
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,750
I'm usually like this.

247
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,930
You don't even know what's going on outside right now.

248
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:29,340
What's going on? Has a faceless king appeared?

249
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,500
Why is that such a big deal?

250
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:37,050
That's not it. It's talk that there will be another king.

251
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,050
Whoa.

252
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,750
What do you mean the king will change?

253
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:46,930
Right now, that song has spread everywhere!

254
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:51,190
Ji Dwi is the best among the Hwarang. Seon Woo is the king of kings.

255
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:55,200
This is the song which is widely rumored all over town.

256
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,070
Oh!

257
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,780
Speak of the devil!

258
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,110
Monk hat... You're Dog-Bird.

259
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:16,220
In any case, you've come.

260
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,420
Welcome, Your Majesty.

261
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,750
What happened? Where are the other officials?

262
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,940
I told them not to come here.

263
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,480
- You told them to not come?
- Yes.

264
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,620
- Because I have something urgent to consult with Your Majesty about.
- Consult?

265
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:55,500
Would it be okay for an old man with aching legs to sit down?

266
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,460
What are you doing right now?!

267
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,620
If I had known it was so comfortable, I would have done it a long time ago.

268
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:22,240
What was it like living in the real world?

269
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,100
Were you able to see justice, loyalty,

270
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:30,040
and compassion for your subjects?

271
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:35,300
A king who is used to that becomes indecisive.

272
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,920
Just like you, Your Majesty.

273
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:49,580
I am going to change who will be king.

274
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,060
What did you just say?

275
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:00,980
I asked if a guy like me became king, would Silla

276
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,090
become a bit better?

277
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:08,690
Does it seem that I have what it takes to become the King?

278
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:14,090
They said there is no wall in the world which will block you.

279
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:17,530
Do you intend to really go out and do it?

280
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:21,560
Please just answer the question.

281
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,690
A king that walks before his people to make a path for them.

282
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:28,830
Do you think it will be possible for me to become such a king?

283
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:37,170
How will Sam Maek Jong be brought down?

284
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,700
Catch the enemy by using the enemy.

285
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:44,570
By saying that, who are you going to use?

286
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,690
If there is no justification,

287
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,990
we will overpower it with justification.

288
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:01,300
Even though I act that way,

289
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,760
I am still weak

290
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,660
and can't do anything.

291
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,660
There is no alternative either.

292
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,390
Who is it? I told them not to let anyone in.

293
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,490
It's me, Sook Myeong.

294
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,840
You became the king on your own.

295
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:48,730
In your eyes, does it look that way?

296
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,260
No.

297
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:55,400
That's right, you've observed it well.

298
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,690
I am not anything yet.

299
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,330
I'm not the only one who knows that.

300
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,690
This entire kingdom of Silla knows and

301
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:07,360
Mother knows.

302
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,830
Mother is in a rush for the marriage.

303
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,100
Marriage? You mean between you and me?

304
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:21,960
This marriage is as horrible to me as it is to you.

305
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,790
To continue the lineage of the sacred bone, to keep the throne, being forced into a disgusting marriage, what on earth...

306
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:30,230
And I

307
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,230
want to have Seon Woo.

308
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:38,820
So, Orabeoni, persuade Mother.

309
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:44,090
Still if you are the King, don't you have to do something?

310
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:54,890
Are you asking me if you can be a good king?

311
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,700
Well, you might.

312
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:06,300
For one out of three people on the street, you might be better than the present king.

313
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,580
Becoming a king without justification is a rebellion.

314
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:16,570
You know very well what that is.

315
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:19,360
Fighting without a cause,

316
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:24,350
in the end, because of that fight, the people become impoverished.

317
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:31,330
Is that the type of king you want?

318
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,920
No.

319
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:38,490
The type of king I want is someone who will able to protect his people

320
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:42,160
and protect those who need protection.

321
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,820
A king who can protect

322
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:51,220
those who are weak, kind, wounded and abandoned. That kind of king.

323
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:58,620
So tell me. If I have the justification or whatever to my name,

324
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:02,300
if I am able to protect those people,

325
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:06,360
I am going to give it a try. Being the king.

326
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:17,230
You've come, Yeong Sil Gong.

327
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:20,030
You aren't even surprised

328
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,970
even though I came here.

329
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,200
Please understand that I cannot rise right now to greet you.

330
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,130
Please have a seat.

331
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,660
Please speak.

332
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:55,920
Did you come here because you wanted to make my son king?

333
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:26,100
Is that child really a sacred bone?

334
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,270
Do you think it's coincidence that your son and mine grew up together?

335
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:36,920
Just as you saved that child, I too did it to save your child.

336
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,290
Ji Soo also, with the world not knowing anything,

337
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:45,340
I wished for him to hide like that.

338
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,330
Wonhwa Joon Jeong.

339
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,440
What is going on?

340
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,360
I am dying right now.

341
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,220
The child...

342
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:17,930
Please save the child.

343
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,560
Joon Jeong.

344
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,610
Fate?

345
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,290
I won't let someone hurt you like this again.

346
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,620
I'll make sure that person will never

347
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,480
be able to harm you again.

348
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,230
I promise.

349
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,940
You did something unnecessarily.

350
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,690
Let go.

351
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:55,400
I know. That you can go alone. However, right now,

352
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,130
I'm here not as a Hwarang but as Your Highness' bodyguard.

353
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,200
So, please allow me to do so.

354
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:10,500
A child like you is going to protect me?

355
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,080
I'm not a child, but young.

356
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:20,160
Enough for my heart to race wildly whenever I look at you.

357
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,890
Until the chief guard recovers, I will protect you.

358
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:40,620
The king that I wish for is one who can protect his people and

359
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,760
the people who need protection.

360
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,940
A king who can protect the weak, the kind, the wounded, the abandoned,

361
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,500
those kinds of people.

362
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:57,500
So tell me. If I have the justification or whatever to my name,

363
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,850
and I can protect those people,

364
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,810
I am thinking of giving it a try. Being the king.

365
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,540
Even though there's a king, you want to become the King?

366
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,850
Ah Ro, it's Father.

367
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,370
Are you alright?

368
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,560
What about Orabeoni?

369
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:13,090
He's alright. He's okay.

370
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,560
I'm sorry, Father.

371
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:32,170
It's alright. Now everything's fine.

372
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,680
Where is he?

373
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,260
Where is Orabeoni?

374
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:50,180
Have you prepared your heart?

375
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:56,360
It seems you haven't yet.

376
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,330
This isn't your choice.

377
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:05,630
Through you, it's Silla's choice.

378
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:10,700
Think about the Cheonin village you lived in with Mak Moon.

379
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:16,170
The choice you're about to make will be the most important and meaningful one.

380
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,400
There's someone who wants to meet you.

381
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:49,090
I heard you quit being Poong Wol Joo so why did you ask me to come here?

382
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:59,280
Were you surprised?

383
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,580
I know you don't have good feelings towards me.

384
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,330
No, you wouldn't know,

385
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:12,140
because it's much worse than what you think.

386
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:16,830
This is why I confuse you as Sam Maek Jong, don't you think?

387
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:21,340
What's the reason you came here? For what reason did you want to meet me?

388
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:26,750
I'm thinking of making you king.

389
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:35,900
What a pity. Haven't you heard from Hwi Gyeong Gong about me?

390
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:41,220
Do you really think that I would accept help from someone like you?

391
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,600
Yes, I do.

392
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:45,560
How so?

393
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,100
Because that's what power is about.

394
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,170
Unless you wield it, you will succumb to it.

395
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:58,560
Until now, haven't you always been the victim?

396
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,330
That's why you want to become king.

397
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:06,000
So, don't you think you should make a decision?

398
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,700
Whether to wield it or succumb to it.

399
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,670
No. The choice is mine to make,

400
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:18,860
because the one who seems desperate because you need me

401
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,230
appears to be you.

402
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:27,760
This must be power. If I don't wield it, succumbing to it.

403
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:44,910
Why don't you stay by my side? Where did you go?

404
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:50,030
So you're still alive.

405
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,170
What brings you here?

406
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,720
Am I scary?

407
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:22,410
If you...

408
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,120
If you trade places with me, you should know.

409
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,400
This isn't the first or second time.

410
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,830
I saved your brother.

411
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:39,960
You only put your brother in danger. I'm the one who saves him.

412
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,050
It seems you hoped that I would die.

413
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:47,970
Yes. I did.

414
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:53,630
More than you think, your brother is a precious person. I could protect him if it weren't for you!

415
00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:01,760
Although I already told you, I will survive

416
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,440
no matter what,

417
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,400
because I know better than anyone else

418
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,350
that is what my brother wishes.

419
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,960
So,

420
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:18,500
no matter what you say, no matter how you try to shake me up,

421
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,640
it's no use.

422
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:25,370
I'll protect my brother.

423
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:31,300
I'll protect my man.

424
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,200
You say everything with your mouth.

425
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,120
But, I can really protect Seon Woo.

426
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:44,160
Wherever, whatever the situation, from whomever!

427
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,310
We'll have to change the king.

428
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:07,930
Then, after taking Jin Heung down from the throne,

429
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:11,270
are you saying you will replace him with a different king?

430
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,530
Your Highness, His Majesty has arrived.

431
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,430
Your complexion is pale.

432
00:49:56,430 --> 00:50:00,400
Did you sit on the throne to be treated in that fashion by Gagkan?

433
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:03,900
You gave them an excuse.

434
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:09,530
It is something which will shake the foundation of the Silla's Sacred Bone System and cause contempt for the royal family.

435
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:13,320
It's because of you. It's all because of you.

436
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,220
I will prevail.

437
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:19,140
Prevail? How can you prevail?

438
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,790
Marry Sook Myeong.

439
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:26,960
I can't do that. That is something I won't do.

440
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,600
Show that you are different.

441
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:34,630
That you and they, in two worlds, even I, can not be the same.

442
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:38,860
The only way to prove that is to marry another sacred bone.

443
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:41,930
I will grow my strength through the Hwarang.

444
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:45,860
Through my Hwarang, I will dominate them.

445
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,100
Hwarang?

446
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:53,540
You haven't the slightest clue what the Hwarang are to you.

447
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:56,530
Seon Woo.

448
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:00,030
Seon Woo is Hwi Gyeong Gong's son.

449
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:04,580
That child also has the blood of the sacred bone.

450
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:08,390
He's another sacred bone who will cause war over the throne!

451
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:12,910
He's your rival who will strangle you!

452
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:28,960
I mean, you still didn't know?

453
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,950
Of course, she woke up. A while ago!

454
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:46,820
I should've just said something to him.

455
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:51,730
But, I have nothing to say.

456
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:59,390
Am I really a burden?

457
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:04,480
No, I'm not!

458
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,240
I almost totally stopped myself.

459
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:15,140
Why isn't Orabeoni coming? I'm awake.

460
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,800
Yoo Beom Gong Gwa?

461
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:28,440
Even if there's someone who comes at you, endure it?

462
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:54,000
You... Are you all right?

463
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,430
♬ Don't look at me with sad eyes ♬

464
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:59,860
What a relief.

465
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:02,740
It's truly a relief.

466
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,570
♬ Your aching heart displays everything ♬

467
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:07,150
Aren't you hurting?

468
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:10,200
That hurts.

469
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:17,010
♬ If you keep doing that you will just leave me ♬

470
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:19,330
Because you are pressing where I was hit by the arrow.
♬ When you only offer me tears, ♬

471
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:23,880
♫  what can I do?  ♫

472
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:32,510
♬ I'm afraid of being suspended a long time somewhere in memory ♬

473
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:39,720
♬ I'm afraid the more I try to wipe it out, the more I will be left yearning ♬

474
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,490
I have something to tell you.

475
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:47,370
♬ So I can't let you go ♬

476
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:49,970
I know who I am.

477
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:54,000
Why I have no name.

478
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,270
Where I came from

479
00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:00,530
and also where I must go.

480
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,740
But then,

481
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:09,650
I'm not sure if this is good for you.

482
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,190
I

483
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:17,790
believe in you more than myself.

484
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:23,670
So believe in yourself.

485
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:27,170
As I know,

486
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:31,930
you're the most trustworthy person in the world,

487
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:37,300
because you'll be able to find your path better than anyone else.

488
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:42,690
♬ colors you also in the dream. ♬

489
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:46,250
Whatever choice you make,

490
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:49,180
no matter what anyone says,

491
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,890
I will be on your side until the end.

492
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:59,860
Go on the path you choose,

493
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:03,030
because that is the right path.

494
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:10,660
♬ I am saying this is not a heart. ♬

495
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:18,500
♬ Although you and I became tears for each other ♬

496
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:33,480
These days, there is a song being sung in the capital.

497
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:38,260
Ji Dwi is the best among the Hwarang, Seon Woo is...

498
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:42,410
Tell me.

499
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:47,810
It's a song that says Seon Woo is the king of kings.

500
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:56,590
I am Silla's king!

501
00:55:56,590 --> 00:56:02,290
That child also has the blood of the sacred bone. He is another who will start a war over the throne!

502
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:06,720
He is your rival who will strangle your neck!

503
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,500
Find Seon Woo.

504
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:31,010
You said you believe in me more than yourself?

505
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:38,290
Now preparations have been made to make you into a king.

506
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:40,930
No one is Silla is as strong as you.

507
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:44,180
No one understands the people's hearts more than you do.

508
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:54,740
Do you want to sit there?

509
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:13,600
Do you really think of yourself as the owner of that throne?

510
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:29,860
♬ Although you and I became tears for each other ♬
