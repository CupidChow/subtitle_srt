00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,630
Episode 20

2
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:28,790
Inside my mind I have killed you over and over countless times.

3
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,800
Because you're the one who killed my one and only friend.

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,900
Because you're someone I can never forgive.

5
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,320
Every time I met you, I couldn't kill you.

6
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,190
Even though I knew for certain that you were the king,

7
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,820
I wanted to believe that you weren't.

8
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,810
If it has to end with my death,

9
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,570
then cut me down.

10
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:22,730
But does it really end only if I die?

11
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,050
How many more do you have to kill for it to end?

12
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,330
If you kill the royal council and the noblemen, will it end?

13
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:40,190
No. Someone will fill that seat and do the same thing again.

14
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,840
Then whom are you going to kill?

15
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:55,100
I wanted to change Silla with you.

16
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:02,370
Because there would no longer be a bone rank system, I thought that there would be no more loss of lives.

17
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:09,050
Beyond the tiny Silla kingdom, I wanted to dream of unifying the three kingdoms.

18
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,370
But if this means the end,

19
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,270
then cut me down.

20
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,290
With this, there is no longer any debt between you and me.

21
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,920
Does it end with this?

22
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,850
Because you and I have different paths to take.

23
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,700
Then when I meet you again,

24
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
you would be my enemy.

25
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,730
We should change the king.

26
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,940
Then, are you saying that you will bring Jin Heung down and place a new king in his position?

27
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:34,780
No. I'm saying that I won't have a king at all.

28
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,020
It wouldn't be a king, but

29
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:44,220
I would establish an illusion of someone with sacred bone rank only in name.

30
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,480
Who is that?

31
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,480
The Hwarang who played the role of king in Baekje. Son of Hwi Gyeong Gong, Seon Woo.

32
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,860
Hwi Gyeong Gong, the castoff sacred bone?

33
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,850
Do you mean he was the son of Hwi Gyeong Gong?

34
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:08,430
No matter how weak she may have become, the Queen Dowager won't sit idly by.

35
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,650
When the prior king died, it was Ji So who protected the Crown Prince by herself.

36
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:19,640
Now, there is justification for a succession of the sacred bone.

37
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,780
That's why we should take it away.

38
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:31,000
Did you obtain your assets, power, and position for free?

39
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,680
The people may think of it as a rebellion.

40
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,680
The people?

41
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,140
No matter how they are dominated and oppressed,

42
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,840
the people will bow their heads while licking our boots.

43
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,330
What are you afraid of?

44
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:56,120
Making this Silla ours is what I am talking about.

45
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,830
That way, your storage rooms will continue to be filled in the future.

46
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,820
Pa Oh.

47
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,810
As soon as dawn breaks, bring Wonhwa Ah Ro to Wolseong (the palace).

48
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,200
Jin Heung is taking Ahn Ji Gong's daughter to the palace?

49
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,200
We got there too late.

50
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:02,280
We have surely missed the chance to use her as bait to control Seon Woo.

51
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,890
The task has gotten complicated.

52
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,300
Yeong Sil Gong, a guest has arrived.

53
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,340
Come in.

54
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,130
This is an interesting picture.

55
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,910
Seeing you here, I think there is also a resemblance.

56
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:57,200
We came like this because I think it's time that we should discuss something important.

57
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:04,260
Have you decided to wield power and not submit to it?

58
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,830
It appears you heard the news that Jin Heung captured Ahn Ji Gong's daughter.

59
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,140
We should change

60
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,030
the owner of Silla.

61
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,170
What help can I offer?

62
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:31,710
There is no help you can offer, because I will be with the Hwarang.

63
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,880
Then what should I do?

64
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,660
From your position together with the other members of the Royal Council, crown me as the king.

65
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,250
Whether you fly or crawl,

66
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,640
in the end, I will be the one to have Silla in my grasp.

67
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:57,560
The owner of Silla has never changed. It will be the same this time as well.

68
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,740
Abdicate? Did you say abdicate?

69
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,110
You must so that I can get power.

70
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,350
Before that, marry Sook Myeong.

71
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:36,570
Is leaving that position that difficult?

72
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,640
Do you still see me only as a mother who covets the throne?

73
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:53,610
To protect the throne you should be cold-blooded.

74
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,040
The king must be able to end a friend's life.

75
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:05,410
A king with ridiculous compassion will throw his country into devastation

76
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,240
in the end, cause the death of all the people. But,

77
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,240
a cold-hearted king will kill when he can kill the least amount of people

78
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,290
most quickly and cruelly.

79
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,560
If you do that, there is no need to kill more.

80
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:29,660
To hold the position, must the king kill someone no matter what?

81
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,620
Do you think the Hwarang are yours?

82
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,710
The Hwarang think of Seon Woo as the Crown Prince.

83
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:44,520
After saying he is the king and risking his life, you watched him saving the people right in front of you.

84
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,890
But, do you think the Hwarang will follow you?

85
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,390
I will make the Hwarang mine.

86
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,460
How?

87
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:01,410
As you said, I should find the fastest method

88
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,920
for me with the least deaths.

89
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,120
You said you'd be king, I guess you haven't become one yet.

90
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,470
"There is no path that pre-existed." Do you remember?

91
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:40,540
There is no path in the world that pre-existed. Someone had to walk on it first for it to become one.

92
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:46,780
Firm soil must be beaten, broken, and paved through so that a waterway can form for the first time.

93
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:53,350
So, you plan to make a waterway by beating, breaking, and paving your way?

94
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,070
Because I can no longer be a horse on a chessboard.

95
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:04,380
Don't allow order created by someone else to become yours by staying silent.

96
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:11,410
You are not a horse on a chessboard. You are Hwarang, freer than anyone else in this world.

97
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,120
I will no longer stay silent.

98
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,240
You won't stay silent? Have you decided on a rebellion?

99
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,290
A king without power cannot do anything. What Silla needs right now

100
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,490
is a strong king with the will to change Silla.

101
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,160
I need your help.

102
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,170
In the end, are you asking me to lead a rebellion?

103
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:43,590
I will leave the decision to you.

104
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:53,720
Please keep the Hwarang together when you return. If they scatter now, we can't end things properly.

105
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,170
Why are you sure that I will help you?

106
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,090
Because you probably have the same heart as I do.

107
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:06,330
Silla's future depends on it, Poong Wol Joo.

108
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,090
It's my goal.

109
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,120
Announce me.

110
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:01,030
That'll be all. You may leave.

111
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,130
I saw her put something in the tea.

112
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,340
- Give it to me.
- It may be poison.

113
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,990
I told you to give it to me.

114
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:27,240
Without knowing what it is, I cannot let you drink it.

115
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,750
It's not a poison that shows symptoms right away. It must build up for a while

116
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,310
for the symptoms to show.

117
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,920
You drank it even though you knew?

118
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,110
I suspected it from the start.

119
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,040
Your Highness!

120
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,810
I will call a doctor.

121
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,480
Don't make a fuss.

122
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,230
Anyway, I've had the symptoms for a while.

123
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,020
I must do this in order to keep you by my side and look at you.

124
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:30,040
I heard you were hurt. Is your wound okay?

125
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,990
It's alright. However,

126
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:40,100
if I hadn't come here, it would've healed faster.

127
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:48,290
It doesn't matter if it heals slowly. Anyway, you won't be able to leave this place.

128
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,680
I took you as a hostage. A hostage so that your brother

129
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,210
can't threaten my throne.

130
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,970
This is unlike you.

131
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,530
Did you forget that I share my Mother's blood?

132
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,670
Perhaps through this opportunity, you may get to know me properly.

133
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:37,110
Are you really going to dominate Seonmoon?

134
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:44,040
They're my Hwarang. I'm not dominating them, they were mine from the beginning.

135
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,470
I must suppress them now. Otherwise, I won't be able to control them.

136
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,960
It is His Majesty, Jin Heung. Open the door!

137
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:22,030
W-Who is...that? Ji Dwi? Hwarang Ji Dwi?

138
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:26,530
If your clothes change, does your personality change too? He's exactly like the Queen Dowager.

139
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:30,160
Cold and heartless.

140
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,340
Hwarang, show your respect to His Majesty.

141
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,550
I'm Hwarang's lord, Jin Heung.

142
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:57,660
What I saw of you while I was in the Hwarang was laziness and weakness.

143
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,860
Not to mention that you were spoiled because you came from families with power.

144
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,730
But now, under the Silla royal family's control, the Hwarang

145
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:12,760
will be reborn as strong warriors from head to toe.

146
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,380
Is something different about the king who's standing over there?

147
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:42,900
Because being weak and having no power seems to be the same for both sides...yo. (indicates formal speech)

148
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,770
Seon Woo, pay your respects.

149
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:58,090
Seon Woo, I told you to pay your respects.

150
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:09,690
In three days, there will be an abdication. You, as the royal family's bodyguards,

151
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,930
- and as Hwarang whose duty is to protect the king, do your utmost!
- The Hwarang!

152
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,970
Must be free.

153
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,990
The Hwarang can dream of Silla's future when they are free to act and think for themselves.

154
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,170
I'm sure you've probably heard this before...yo.(formal speech)

155
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,370
Are you taking a stand against me right now?

156
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:48,390
I'm saying we will decide whether or not to accept you as the King!

157
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:56,070
Do you not have the confidence to be chosen?

158
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,950
There are two kings inside Seonmoon?

159
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,810
What's exactly going on?

160
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,550
Come here.

161
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:17,990
According to someone in the know, the king might change.

162
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,800
- Huh?
- What?

163
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,110
Hey, what does that mean?

164
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,290
Seon Woo, I thought he was a half-blooded Cheonin.

165
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,120
He was a hidden sacred bone.

166
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,930
Hey, I knew he was a superior guy, but

167
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,410
you saw how he was giving Ji Dwi a hard time earlier, right?

168
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:38,090
What do you mean by Ji Dwi? It's His Majesty, Jin Heung.

169
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:47,690
How can he dominate the Hwarang when he has a bad image? That Ji Dwi.

170
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,520
Ah Ro.

171
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,710
Your sister is alright.

172
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,650
Right now, she's at the Wonhwa palace...

173
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,480
I know.

174
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,950
I was thankful for that time.

175
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,620
Also,

176
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,880
I'm sorry.

177
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,790
Because I'm not a suitable man for you.

178
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,350
It's natural to be sorry.

179
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:02,360
Treating a woman like me this way.

180
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,210
Although I'm not a good man for you,

181
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,930
you are a good woman.

182
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,060
So,

183
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,000
meet a man who shares the same heart as you.

184
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,230
Tea?

185
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,000
Did you just say tea?

186
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,980
It seems to have been going on for a long time.

187
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,570
Already,

188
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,260
she's coughing blood...

189
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,900
She told me not to reveal it, but I cannot leave her that way.

190
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,980
What are you doing?

191
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,930
Is it Park Yeong Sil?

192
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:42,470
I asked you if the one who put you up to this

193
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,560
is Park Yeong Sil.

194
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,270
Pa Oh!

195
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,200
Please command me, Your Majesty.

196
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,210
Kill her.

197
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,010
Please spare my life!

198
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,400
Spare my life, Your Majesty!

199
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,790
Your Highness, Queen Dowager!

200
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,680
Your Majesty, please spare my life!

201
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,280
Why did you do that?

202
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,610
What do you mean?

203
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,960
Knowing that it was poison,

204
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,700
exactly why did you drink it?

205
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,900
Why?!

206
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,470
I didn't know.

207
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:51,110
When I knew, it was too late. Even if I had refused the tea,

208
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,540
they would have used a different method.

209
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,680
Why didn't you run away?

210
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,470
Queen Dowager or whatever, and throwing away the throne,

211
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,390
you should've run away instead.

212
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,280
I tried to run away.

213
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,680
I wanted to avoid them.

214
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,070
However,

215
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:21,620
I had to live my fate. If there's something to protect,

216
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,660
become strong.

217
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,010
You have to be strong in order to fight.

218
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:32,580
Don't trust a human's small heart.

219
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,400
A king

220
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,180
must do that, Jin Heung.

221
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,970
Are you asking me to return as Poong Wol Joo again?

222
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,080
That's right.

223
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,880
Then,

224
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,970
are you thinking of going against the Queen Dowager's orders?

225
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:43,210
My will is the Queen Dowager's will. My will is also Silla's will.

226
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,810
It's good to see you again.

227
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,960
Have you all been well?

228
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,080
Yes, Poong Wol Joo!

229
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,370
The reason I'm standing here today

230
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:19,700
is because I heard you were given quite a difficult task.

231
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,700
I trust that this decision

232
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:28,720
will be one that will create a different Silla than before.

233
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,300
Also, I'm certain that you've grown enough

234
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,010
to make that choice.

235
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:42,810
Someone may call this a rebellion.

236
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:47,730
Another may call this a duty.

237
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:51,580
You are the ones who will be making the decision.

238
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:57,190
Whether you'll become Hwarang who will change this kingdom from the roots, or

239
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:03,400
whether you'll remain as useless entities incapable of doing anything, you decide.

240
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:09,640
If you've decided, trust yourselves till the end.

241
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,460
You are Hwarang.

242
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,110
The fact that you are Hwarang,

243
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:20,430
never, ever forget it.

244
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,820
Is something the matter?

245
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,830
Did you ask me why I lived asking myself over and over

246
00:28:54,830 --> 00:29:00,070
why I had to be king?

247
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:04,390
I've never, not even once, given up.

248
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:08,640
Did you say you could tell by looking into my eyes?

249
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,650
Yes.

250
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,800
That's how you appeared.

251
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,980
It would be nice if everything you said was correct.

252
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:32,000
Your heart has never been moved,

253
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,520
I guess I'm the only one who is thrashing about like this.

254
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:46,300
I heard from the Queen Dowager that she will be abdicating today.

255
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,940
That's right.

256
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,210
Today, I'm going to become the real king.

257
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:04,840
Right now, are you looking worried for me?

258
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,370
Because the throne seems like a lonely place,

259
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:18,440
from that kind of place, I'm afraid it'll be more difficult for you to sleep.

260
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,720
I should say thank you.

261
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,610
Because of you, I became stronger.

262
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:32,210
Thanks to you I was able to get here.

263
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,200
♫  Promise me.  ♫

264
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,690
Hwi Gyeong Gong.

265
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,690
Isn't it Hwi Gyeong Gong?

266
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,900
They have to appear at the right time.

267
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:55,100
The reason why we are all gathered here today is

268
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,810
- to lead Silla—
- Halt!

269
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:16,100
Do you really think you're the owner of that position?

270
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:24,340
We members of the Royal Council have a different opinion.

271
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,100
How dare you?! Don't you know where you are?

272
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:31,860
I, Silla's Gakgan, Park Yeong Sil, believe that a different Sacred Bone,

273
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:38,700
Seon Woo, the son of Hwi Gyeong Gong should be crowned king.

274
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,980
Today, the Hwarang has selected a king for the future.

275
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:26,340
We Hwarang, in this place, would like to pledge allegiance

276
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,990
before His Majesty who will listen to his people

277
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:33,200
and make Silla strong.

278
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:52,860
Hwarang pledge your allegiance

279
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,220
for Silla and the Lord of Silla

280
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,150
with the spirit of Silla!

281
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:08,420
Long live Your Majesty, Jin Heung!

282
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:13,220
Long live Your Majesty, Jin Heung! Long live Your Majesty, Jin Heung!

283
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:18,260
Long live Your Majesty, Jin Heung! Long live Your Majesty, Jin Heung!

284
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:23,670
Long live Your Majesty, Jin Heung! Long live Your Majesty, Jin Heung!

285
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:38,630
Traitor Park Yeong Sil, who planned a rebellion aimed at His Majesty's life,

286
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,730
receive punishment for your sin now!

287
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:45,980
Also, if you have the same sentiment as this man, step forward now!

288
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:50,290
The swords of the Hwarang will never forgive!

289
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:37,290
I wanted to change Silla with you.

290
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:40,040
No longer because of the bone rank system

291
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,660
would lives be lost.

292
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:49,670
Beyond this tiny Silla, I wanted to dream of the unification of the Three Kingdoms.

293
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,050
Can your dream

294
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:57,670
become a reality?

295
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,590
It won't be easy.

296
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,920
But if you don't even try and do nothing but breathe,

297
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,990
then even if you survive, that's not living.

298
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,520
What if I

299
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,610
eliminate those who want to kill you.

300
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,230
Can you change Silla?

301
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:26,320
The throne is yours now.

302
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:31,750
So make the change you dream of. Do everything to the best of your ability.

303
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,790
So that I won't disappoint you

304
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:38,960
I will go on that path to the end.

305
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,380
I, Silla's king Jin Heung,

306
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:42,510
together with the Hwarang, will think of the people first

307
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:46,340
and lead a strong Silla with a plan for a thousand years!

308
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:16,940
Then, what kind of qualities does the king you have in mind possess?

309
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:24,310
The people are happy while the king is tormented.

310
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,650
The people don't worry about the kingdom,

311
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:32,540
but it's a kingdom where the king worries about his people.

312
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:36,700
That's the kind of king I have in mind.

313
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,420
These rascals.

314
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:59,390
Whatever it is I caught, I must've done it properly.

315
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,330
I'm sorry.

316
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:14,080
Because I couldn't tell you sooner.

317
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:20,330
If that's your decision, I respect it.

318
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,180
I am proud of you.

319
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:30,050
If your mother also saw you like this, she would be happy.

320
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:46,120
- Why?
- You thief!

321
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,760
What do we do now?

322
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,350
Hurry and get out! Quickly!

323
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,060
Long live His Majesty, Jin Heung!

324
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:39,090
Long live His Majesty, Jin Heung!

325
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:05,290
You really,

326
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:09,290
came all the way here with your own strength.

327
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,450
It's a relief

328
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:15,370
that you weren't late.

329
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:17,780
Now,

330
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:22,500
I will carry the burden. The burden called Silla.

331
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:29,590
Do you

332
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:33,630
think that I hated you?

333
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,830
Do you

334
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:47,340
think that I hated you?

335
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,250
I know that you protected both

336
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:59,310
Silla and me.

337
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,840
I will also protect it.

338
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,060
Although it may be different from your way, but in my own way.

339
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,830
Most certainly,

340
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:17,030
I will make Silla strong.

341
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,010
Your Highness!

342
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:43,870
Your Highness!

343
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,990
How is she?

344
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:02,330
She's no different from a corpse.

345
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:23,490
I have something

346
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,370
to say to you.

347
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:50,970
Please stay by her side.

348
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,450
I beg of you.

349
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:01,170
Thank you to the entire Flower Knight Team.

350
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:05,090
Thank you to managers cgwm808 and Joysprite

351
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:09,100
Thank you to segmenters: dudie, ewilan_89, bagy, ladyvillegas, bjohnsonwong

352
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:13,090

353
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:17,180
Thank you to segmenters, cont.: kpopcolorado_315, AmyPun, shms and serneno

354
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:21,070
Special thanks to Korean subtitler bree1042

355
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:25,080
Thanks to Korean to English subtitlers: peppy210, elisem1902, itsjoo, cgwm808

356
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:29,150
Thank you to Korean to English subtitlers, cont: gripstar_385, jamlesskookiesxo; starjson, hellodramalove

357
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:33,200
Thanks to Korean to English subtitlers, cont: vincy87, vorfelan, misslea05, and kimvely

358
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,270
Thanks to editors cgwm808 (Chief). elisem1902, joysprite, gripstar_385, mirna023_316, jamlesskookiesxo, and bkiss.

359
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:43,860
Rather,

360
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:50,860
it would've been better to die at your hands.

361
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,860
Earlier,

362
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,620
why didn't you tell me not to drink the tea?

363
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,500
For sure,

364
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:22,030
you worried about me.

365
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,480
I tried to let you go.

366
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:33,390
I couldn't let go of you.

367
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:38,260
No matter how hard I tried,

368
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,800
in the end,

369
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,200
I wanted to go by your side.

370
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,890
I tried to hate you.

371
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,720
I tried to kill you.

372
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:09,560
But,

373
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:16,650
I couldn't do so.

374
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,400
I'm sorry.

375
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:27,080
Did everything work out well?

376
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:29,720
Yes.

377
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:36,940
His Majesty told me to give you this.

378
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,510
Did you resent me who locked you up here?

379
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:59,690
It was the only choice I could make to protect you from Gakgan.

380
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:06,500
If I see your face, I think I will not be able to let you go again,

381
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:09,270
because I think I'll become greedy again.

382
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:15,440
Go. Don't make him wait too long.

383
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,300
Go to him.

384
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:26,550
♬ When you only offer me tears, what can I do? ♬

385
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:34,130
♬ I'm afraid of being suspended a long time somewhere in memory ♬

386
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:42,670
♬ I'm afraid the more I try to wipe it out, the more I will be left yearning ♬

387
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:52,970
♬ So I can't let you go ♬

388
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:03,100
♬ Although you and I became tears for each other ♬

389
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:05,310
Was I too late?

390
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:11,660
♬ After time passed on a bright day ♬

391
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:18,430
Now I really won't leave you alone.

392
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,670
I promise.

393
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:27,000
♬ I will remember ♬

394
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:36,150
♬ There is only one person wiping my tears and holding my heart ♬

395
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:42,790
♬ Twelve months will pass and coming again like the seasons ♬

396
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:46,920
♬ You also will return to me ♬

397
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:50,690
If I am to tell you with this,

398
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:54,890
which gives the inside scoop about every nobleman in the capital,

399
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:58,800
"Composite Survey of Nobleman in the Capital", volume two.

400
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,810
So then, a briefing

401
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:12,160
is an extra silver coin. Will you go for it?

402
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,660
Here.

403
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:18,500
Now my debt is fully paid.

404
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:26,790
It's the legendary woman who received the love of two men of the sacred bone.

405
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:30,770
Her circumstance is the same as it was before.

406
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:33,680
Well, then how was I supposed to change?

407
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:39,380
Ah, well, you know. Dressed luxuriously in silk and gold?

408
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,240
Well, that kind of stuff?

409
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,140
That kind of stuff?

410
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:49,210
You waited long, right? Let's go and have a lot of fun.

411
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:54,310
But why are you always taking someone else's child all the time? If you're bored, why don't you date?

412
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:57,320
But, at one time you said you were a bachelor.

413
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,180
There needs to be someone. Do you do it alone?

414
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,630
He said he wouldn't leave me alone.

415
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:08,330
When am I supposed to date!

416
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,790
Father is in his room.

417
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:22,000
Instead of continuing to hide things like this, wouldn't it be better just to—

418
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,000
After Father Gagkan became like that, you're left without any connections.

419
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,350
Without both a distinguished family and no property, it's natural that he opposes you.

420
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:34,250
Yes, well...

421
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:39,210
Instead, you have my love.

422
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,850
Crown Prince Chang?

423
00:54:55,850 --> 00:55:00,440
In alliance with the Degaya, it seems he's thinking of attacking our Gwansa Fortress.

424
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:07,310
Now we'll be seeing each other only when there's some sort of issue.

425
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:15,100
If I'm here, I'll only cause problems with talk of another sacred bone or whatever being here. Why ask when you already know?

426
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:19,810
Hey, if you were going to be so cool, why didn't you be king?

427
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:25,120
This, looks quite nice.

428
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,490
This Dog-Bird.

429
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:33,760
It's been six months since you've arrived in the capital. Have you seen Ah Ro?

430
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:48,970
He could have written even a bit of news.

431
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,670
He should at least provide some assurance.

432
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:57,710
Just end it! There's nothing to lose.

433
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:03,110
Have you been fine?

434
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:08,630
I've come.

435
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:14,100
Because I have a bad memory, I have no idea who you are.

436
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:18,500
♫ Your cold signs are causing my heart to fall ♫

437
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:24,040
♫ Ever so slowly like a wilting flower ♫

438
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,500
You couldn't have forgotten me.

439
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:31,160
♫ Damn this love only because of you  ♫

440
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,830
♫ Even if it hurts, I can't stop ♫

441
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:35,600
♫ Even if it kills, for me still it is you ♫

442
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,820
You're beautiful. Amazingly so.

443
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:43,880
♫ And falling into a black hell ♫

444
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:47,840
♫ You are that existence to me ♫

445
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:51,270
♫ Don't leave me. Don't leave me. ♫

446
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:53,300
Let's get married.

447
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,590
♫ You who are turning away turn your feet toward me ♫

448
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:58,480
This won't work for me because I miss you.

449
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:03,030
♫ I request and want you, you are everything in my life ♫

450
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:07,800
♫ Please carry me off on the dispersing light ♫

451
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,670
♫ Until the world ends  ♫

452
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:15,470
♫ It’s gonna be you  ♫

453
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:26,120
I missed you.

454
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:53,470
♬ If my harsh fate is a pre-determined path ♬

455
00:57:53,500 --> 00:58:03,600
♬ You are the one answer from the skill of god shining on me ♬

456
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:08,960
♬ If I even try to ask my heart over and over ♬

457
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,220
♬ No matter what anyone says ultimately for me it's you ♬
