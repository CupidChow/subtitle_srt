00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,650
Episode 18

2
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,840
I'm going to make you into a Wonhwa.

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,230
Also, I will make you live according to the fate of one.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,510
You seem to know what happened to the Wonhwa.

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,980
I heard they were jealous of each other and

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,290
killed one another.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,600
I killed them.

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,180
I needed a strong force to assist Silla's king.

9
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,560
So, I had to get rid of annoying impediments like the Wonhwa.

10
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,330
By using you, I will have the Hwarangdo in my hands.

11
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,230
If you become an annoying impediment,

12
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,630
I will also kill you.

13
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,240
You probably want to run away.

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,510
No.

15
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,400
I won't run away.

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,160
Until you end my life,

17
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,320
I will survive.

18
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,370
Somehow, I'll endure and

19
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,120
find a way.

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,600
Useless hopes torment a person.

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,460
No matter how it struggles, a fish caught in a net

22
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,660
will lose it scales and a knife will pierce its throat.

23
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,990
Sometimes,

24
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,110
sometimes,

25
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,960
a struggling fish

26
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,850
can return to the river.

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,230
She got caught.

28
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,820
Wonhwa or whatever, I don't know what that is.

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,090
Please tell me how I can take her out of there.

30
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,560
How can I know if you come here speaking so abruptly?

31
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,370
- You have to tell me in a way that I can understand.
- You know what I'm talking about.

32
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,760
What can I do to take her out of there?!

33
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,830
Ji So is

34
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,040
going to use the Wonhwa to overpower the Hwarang.

35
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,320
Also, when she no longer needs her, she'll probably kill your sister.

36
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,850
Every time Silla's royal family was under a threat, they always had Wonhwa.

37
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,220
When they no longer needed them, they used all kinds of reasons to get rid of them.

38
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,850
Wonhwa were used by the royal family and

39
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,840
in the end, they all died.

40
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,890
That's why I'm asking you. What can I do?!

41
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,490
Do you want to become a real king?

42
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,240
If you become the King, you won't have to worry about your sister being harmed.

43
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,250
You can create the world you want. Also,

44
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,520
unlike your friend, you won't have to worry about losing your life.

45
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,930
Do you want to become the real king?

46
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,460
Exactly,

47
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,000
what are you to be uttering this nonsense?

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,470
Someone

49
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,990
who knows your father well.

50
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,390
Father?

51
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,810
Who's that?

52
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,080
If you're Seon Woo, it'd be Ahn Ji Gong.

53
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,790
Silla's most revered doctor and the epitome of a true bone.

54
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:13,050
If you're Sam Maek Jong, King Beopheung's younger brother would be your father.

55
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,950
But,

56
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:22,580
if you're the nameless Dog-Bird, Moo Myeong, from Cheonin village,

57
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,850
you're my son.

58
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,680
I am

59
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,440
your father.

60
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,940
Wonhwa Joon Jeong

61
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,140
You... I have to kill you.

62
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,520
Y-Your Highness!

63
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,100
You'll continue to be a source of trouble.

64
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,310
Spare my life.

65
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,940
Weren't we the best of friends?

66
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,730
A Wonhwa who only causes chaos in Silla's royal family

67
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,260
is no longer needed.

68
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,580
Just as Nam Mo died, you cannot live either.

69
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,650
You must be framed for everything. For my son,

70
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,240
I have to kill you.

71
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,760
For the sake of my child, if you could just spare my life...

72
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,250
This child also has the blood of the sacred bone.

73
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,950
I will make sure he doesn't have a name. Even though I live, it'll be as if I'm not.

74
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,900
I will have him live so that he doesn't know or acknowledge his existence.

75
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,290
So, please.

76
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:07,020
Please spare my life.

77
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,980
That child must not be born into this world.

78
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,920
The baby is moving.

79
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,160
Ji So.

80
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,860
Why was I chosen as a Wonhwa?

81
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,830
Being a Wonhwa is not a punishment. For you, it's an undeserved honor.

82
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:42,870
I've never wished for something like that nor do I wish for it (now).

83
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:48,860
In your life, has there ever been an incident that occurred because you didn't wish for it?

84
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,430
My mother has already made the decision.

85
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:57,080
So, whether you want to or not, you will become a Wonhwa.

86
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,520
Also, now you'll come to know

87
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,460
what kind of position a Wonhwa is.

88
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,690
I have a favor to ask of you.

89
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,020
Let me go to Seonmoon. It'll only be a moment.

90
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,820
I'll just pay them my respects and return.

91
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,170
Wash her and groom her.

92
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:34,520
Why are you doing this? Don't do this. Why are you doing this!

93
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,250
You, who haven't even soiled your hand with a single drop of blood,

94
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:54,020
are you, who doesn't even have any idea what it means to protect the throne,

95
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,790
Silla's real king?

96
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,090
Your Majesty, you must deal with it all.

97
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,670
Whatever that may be.

98
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:11,230
Whether the place is high, low, dirty, beautiful, dangerous, or peaceful,

99
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,160
if there's something you must do as the King,

100
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,480
you must deal with everything.

101
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:54,010
You must be very busy. Why did you call for me?

102
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,890
Why do you think I asked for you?

103
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,540
Since I'm disciplining the Hwarang well, to praise me for my hard work,

104
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,660
aren't you thinking of giving me a prize?

105
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,660
I'm thinking of bringing back the Wonhwa,

106
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,930
Come in.

107
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,410
In three days, after returning from paying worship to the shrine of Wonhwa Princess Nam Mo,

108
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,110
there will be an appointment ceremony for the two Wonhwa.

109
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,740
The Wonhwa will now become the head of the Hwarangdo and lead the Hwarang.

110
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,980
Poong Wol Joo, you will have to make room for them as the heads at Hwarangdo.

111
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,900
Poong Wol Joo, pay your respects to the two Wonhwa.

112
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,610
Poong Wol Joo, pay your respects to the two Wonhwa!

113
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,240
Your Highness the Queen Dowager, is this what you had wanted from the start?

114
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,180
That's right.

115
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,460
Didn't you train people with outstanding talent for Silla's future?

116
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,800
Now the Hwarang are becoming that kind of outstanding individuals.

117
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,510
What I wished for was to have those individuals kneeling in front of my feet.

118
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,340
That's what I had planned.

119
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,290
It will not turn out the way you want.

120
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:59,780
Because they're already not the type of Hwarang that you think they are.

121
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:48,660
Wonhwa Ah Ro, you're really beautiful

122
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,850
Am I?

123
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,540
Yes.

124
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,940
But I...

125
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,830
am not happy at all.

126
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:22,770
If you're the nameless Dog-Bird, Moo Myeong, from Cheonin village,

127
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,210
you're my son.

128
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,030
I am your father.

129
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,710
She's going to abandon the Hwarang and create the Wonhwa?

130
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:03,630
I heard you went to Wolseong. What about Ah Ro?

131
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:08,770
Your sister seems safe and sound as of now.

132
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:12,490
Rather than being here, she seems to look much better.

133
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,970
Why? Did you come here because you were curious about that?

134
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,680
Why aren't you doing anything? Knowing full well what kind of person the Queen Dowager is!

135
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,770
What do you want from me? Do you want me to take a sword and cut off her head?

136
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:36,070
In the end, the same kind will be using their power to do the same things.

137
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,900
If I obtain power,

138
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:47,300
is the King exempt from this kind of incident?

139
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,770
I'm asking if you're exempt from dealing with this kind of situation if you're the king.

140
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,030
You wait here.

141
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,100
Yeong Sil Gong, I came because there is something I need to tell you.

142
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,270
Did you bring the King's head?

143
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,160
I'm positive I told you to do so.

144
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,450
Let's talk about other things afterward.

145
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,760
The riding block.

146
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,440
What are you doing instead of bringing it over quickly?

147
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,790
Please step on me.

148
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,010
Please get up.

149
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,820
He already left.

150
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:26,310
Did you hear? The king's head.

151
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,970
You'll have to do it.

152
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:35,280
The King who's in the Hwarang. Bring that guy's head.

153
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,980
Seon Woo!

154
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,840
Where are you? In the room?

155
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,210
No one's here.

156
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:12,660
Hey, don't you see me? When I go outside, do you know what kind of person I am?

157
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,130
Did you see where Seon Woo went?

158
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,030
You're always after Seon Woo, seriously!

159
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,360
Where is he?

160
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,360
If you become the King, you don't have to worry about your sister getting harmed.

161
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,390
You can create the world that you want. Also,

162
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,740
unlike your friend, you won't lose your life.

163
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,810
Do you want to be a real king?

164
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,660
Here you were!

165
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,890
There's no such thing as the first path in the world. Someone has to be the first to walk on it for it to become a path.

166
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:14,400
One must thump on firm soil, break it, and dig a hole through it so that

167
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,470
a waterway also forms.

168
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,780
What are you doing?

169
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,980
I'm writing a letter to my grandfather.

170
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,800
This time, I'm really going to tell him everything in my heart.

171
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,620
I'm going to make sure he no longer bothers my older brother because of me.

172
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:46,180
Me being like this, so I mean defying my grandfather,

173
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,490
is my first time.

174
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,700
Why are you doing that all of a sudden?

175
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,720
You're totally cool.

176
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,230
Do you think a scaredy cat like me

177
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,320
can also be like you?

178
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,970
Can I also

179
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,140
make something

180
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,150
like a path?

181
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,330
I'll walk with you.

182
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,870
For real?

183
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:38,400
It's for real. You promised!

184
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,250
It's for real, right? You promised!

185
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,370
- That's right.
- Yes! It's for real, right?

186
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,670
You promised.

187
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:13,180
Before the Wonhwa appointment ceremony, Princess Sook Myeong and Doctor Ah Ro will be going to the shrine of Wonhwa Nam Mo for worship.

188
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:18,230
Are you talking about that Princess Nam Mo who lost her life to Joon Jeong?

189
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,900
That's what the public knows, but there's gossip that Joon Jeong was framed.

190
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,550
Because the body hasn't been found yet, there's also talk that she's still alive.

191
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,810
This is our only chance.

192
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:35,930
- When they return from the shrine of Princess Nam Mo, take Ah Ro.
- What about afterward?

193
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:41,640
Send her anywhere. Whether it's the Western Countries or China. Wherever Mother can't touch her.

194
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,790
Because this seems like the utmost I can do right now.

195
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,000
Stop looking at me.

196
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,440
The more I look at you, I miss you.

197
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,000
Why?

198
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,490
Just looking at you is more than I deserve. If I also touch you, I'm afraid I may be punished.

199
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,490
I'll receive the punishment.

200
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,790
Twice over.

201
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:58,100
You, do you like Soo Yeon?

202
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,300
Yeah. I like her, a lot.

203
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,090
You know you two won't work out, right? Your father and ours

204
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:14,400
won't give you two their blessing. Both of you will only get hurt and that'll be the end of it!

205
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,910
So, give it up.

206
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:23,660
Are you also worrying about me right now?

207
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:28,470
I'm worrying about Soo Yeon because she'll be worrying about you.

208
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,820
I'll walk together with you.

209
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,520
How cool.

210
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,610
Han Seong.

211
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,980
- What is this?
- He told me to give it to you.

212
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,480
- Who?
- I don't know.

213
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,390
♬  was more than I could bear ♬

214
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:07,790
♬  You were there. Like a dream ♬

215
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:12,310
♬ then another world which I came to know♬

216
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,890
♬ and even a shard of my crushed heart ♬

217
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,250
This is Hyung Dan Se's so why did he send it to me?

218
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:25,320
♬  became a light in your breath ♬

219
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,290
Hyung!

220
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,410
What are you doing here?

221
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:39,220
You used to run away every time I asked you to practice swordsmanship. Why did you come?

222
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:44,790
I don't do that anymore. I also have someone to walk with me.

223
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,630
What are you talking about?

224
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,640
This.

225
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:59,290
Why did grandfather send this to me? He could've sent it directly to you. Right?

226
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,430
What is it?

227
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:10,830
Isn't it time for Poong Wol Joo's lecture? If you skip it again, grandfather will scold me again.

228
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,400
Okay.

229
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,590
It's Seon Woo!

230
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:29,100
Why do you look cool today?

231
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,460
Aigoo, you're much better looking, you punk.

232
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,580
- Did you eat?
- Yeah.

233
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:43,610
If our family can't join hands with Yeong Sil Gong this time,

234
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,690
I'm going to take my life along with Han Seong's.

235
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,660
Why Han Seong?

236
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,760
- What sin did he commit?
- Do you speak that way even after seeing the humiliation I've suffered?

237
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,580
If this plan doesn't work out, next time, Han Seong will be the one bending over as a riding block.

238
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:06,520
I can't allow the descendants of the Seok family to live like that.

239
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,220
Are you

240
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,630
threatening me?

241
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:21,690
Apply this poison on your sword. Even the slightest scrape will cause one to be poisoned and die.

242
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:28,210
If you fail to kill the King, Han Seong and I

243
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:32,460
will drink this poison.

244
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:54,200
I plan on keeping your sister beside me as a Wonhwa.

245
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:59,830
She will use the Wonhwa to overpower the Hwarang. Also, when they are no longer needed,

246
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,230
she'll probably kill your sister.

247
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,550
Would you

248
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,310
like to spar with me?

249
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,970
- Let's do it later.
- No.

250
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,520
Now.

251
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:33,270
I apologize.

252
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:37,010
You apologize? For what do you apologize so much?

253
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:41,750
I told you to speak comfortably with me. How many times do I have to tell you? You and I are the same.

254
00:28:55,090 --> 00:29:01,590
If you can avoid me, please do so. Don't let yourself fall behind a single blow. You must not let yourself have the slightest cut.

255
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:05,690
These words are the utmost consideration I can show you.

256
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,380
Anyway, your swordsmanship will be better than mine.

257
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:14,320
- Why are you being so serious?
- If you have the opportunity, you must kill me.

258
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,560
Because I'll do the same.

259
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:41,600
- Exactly what's the matter with you?!
- You talk too much.

260
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,460
Do it in the underworld.

261
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,360
Kill no matter what

262
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,970
No!

263
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:32,040
You... What are you doing?

264
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,880
What are you doing, Hyung? Why are you doing this?!

265
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,290
Let go! Let go of it!

266
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,400
What if I let go?

267
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,270
Then you'll cut Seon Woo again.

268
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,950
Han Seong!

269
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:55,910
Why did you apply the medicine grandfather gave you here?

270
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:14,370
Why did you do it? You're a good older brother.

271
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,520
No!

272
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,490
What did you do, you bastard? What is it that you know?

273
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:27,430
Poison. It's poison. Deadly poison.

274
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,720
Aish, seriously!

275
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,380
I... am okay.

276
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,620
Doctor Ah Ro will heal me.

277
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,900
That's right. Don't lose your consciousness.

278
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:16,290
Us... You said we'd walk together, right?

279
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,510
That's right.

280
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:25,730
My Hyung... Don't hate him.

281
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,860
Alright, I got it.

282
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:03,230
♫  How far will I dream?  ♫

283
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,520
♫  Will it be happy?  ♫

284
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:23,300
♫  My goodbye which leaves behind countless memories seeking you  ♫

285
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,030
♫  One step at a time as the distance increases  ♫

286
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:38,060
♫ While your love becomes more visible ♫

287
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:44,590
What's the matter with this rascal?
♫ Will I forget how much it hurt and  ♫

288
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:49,400
♫  how tightly you were held by my heart ?  ♫

289
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,700
What's the matter with you? What's the matter with you!!

290
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:57,740
♫  Don't worry me any more  ♫

291

00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:49,800
♫  and say that I am the person you will remember  ♫

298
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,620
I know that you don't want to live,

299
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,410
but don't die.

300
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,640
I also know. That heart.

301
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,340
This.

302
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:48,820
He said he was sending it to his grandfather, but somehow it seemed like a letter meant for you.

303
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,320
Also,

304
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:11,620
I'm saying this in case you might want to confirm with me,

305
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,860
you're still my Nangdoo.

306
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:44,380
Grandfather, it's Han Seong. I'm doing well at Seonmoon.

307
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:48,030
Although, at first you placed me here against my will,

308
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:51,600
now I've come to like living here.

309
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:57,690
Starting from a friend that I like, I've learned that a path that doesn't exist can become a reality.

310
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:01,220
One by one, if a person leaves behind their footprint,

311
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:07,550
if one can travel together, I've learned that even a rough path becomes a path.

312
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:12,660
The reason I've writing this letter is because, from now on,

313
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,760
I'd like to tell you that I will receive the punishment I deserve.

314
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:23,560
Hyung hasn't done anything wrong. Social status, bone rank, although I may not know much about those things,

315
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,340
Hyung is just my older brother.

316
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,690
♫  Even if I can't hug you again  ♫

317
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:33,340
He's the most trustworthy person in the world who's on my side.

318
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:44,500
♫  I will follow every familiar step and keep going  ♫

319
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,130
♫ Don't worry me any more  ♫

320
00:37:54,630 --> 00:38:00,770
When tears come out, cry to your heart's content.

321
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:06,740
Still, in Silla, there seems to be those who shake up the Hwarang and

322
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:12,000
believe that it's alright to do things their way.

323
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,080
But, never again,

324
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,020
never lose a friend again.

325
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:26,620
Grandfather, I'm learning how to be an adult in this place.

326
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:33,040
Not leaning on anyone, and taking responsibility for the decisions I made.

327
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:40,790
Don't be silenced by an order created by another.

328
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:47,490
You are not a horse on a chessboard. You are Hwarang who are freer than anyone else in this world.

329
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:50,310
♫  in this life where we laughed and cried together  ♫

330
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:52,150
The fact that you are Hwarang...

331
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:57,500
♫  Without any ugly regret  ♫

332
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,250
Never forget that.

333
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:15,100
♫  My love will breathe forever in your heart  ♫

334
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,680
♫  I loved so that I was blinded  ♫

335
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,420
♫  you were all the world to me ♫

336
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:32,250
Grandfather, I even met a Hwarang hyung who said he'd walk the path together with me.

337
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:35,540
I will live freely.

338
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:42,270
Without thinking of family or power, I will live as a Hwarang.

339
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:48,700
♫  So I will be able to smile. ♫

340
00:39:56,270 --> 00:40:03,320
What a pity. A young and weak life has unfortunately left us.

341
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:10,010
But it isn't a death in vain. Now everyone will believe even more that Seon Woo is the king.

342
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,870
I don't believe it's a matter to be thought of only in that way.

343
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,520
Day by day the number of subjects looking forward to

344
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,890
Seon Woo as the new king here is growing.

345
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:22,200
It's a futile expectation to see a phony.

346
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,230
But, if this continues, it may grow out of control.

347
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,100
Your Highness.

348
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,310
Gakgan has arrived.

349
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,000
Gakgan?

350
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,950
Why have you come before me?

351
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,750
I have lost.

352
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,210
Abdicate.

353
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:58,380
When I considered the future of Silla and listened

354
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,840
and thought carefully about what was said last time,

355
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,970
at this point, abdication is the right idea for Silla's future.

356
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:09,150
What trick exactly is he trying to pull?

357
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:13,330
You Highness the royal council—

358
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,190
What's the meaning of this?

359
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,350
Abdicate!

360
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:27,780
The time to give up is now.

361
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,280
There is His Majesty who did a meritorious deed at Baekje.

362
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:36,700
How will you cope alone with this continuing heavy burden?

363
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,190
There is no reason to delay any further.

364
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:42,720
There is none. Please abdicate.

365
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,050
Step down. Abdicate!

366
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:51,810
We will make the phony you used as Sam Maek Jong's shield

367
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:54,360
into the real king.

368
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,460
Abdicate!

369
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,590
Aigoo, Elder.

370
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,200
Your face is not the bright face of the returning physician who defeated the plague in the Cheonin village.

371
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,290
There aren't any medicinal herbs.

372
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,460
I even fed them poisonous herbs.

373
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:40,910
After watching a patient coughing up blood and dying,

374
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:44,930
I was confused as to whether I was a physician or a murderer.

375
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:49,330
While waging war there, in this place,

376
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,790
everything was too easy going.

377
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:58,190
It's not that there wasn't a war here too.

378
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:05,030
Your daughter has become a Wonhwa.

379
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,260
What do you mean by a Wonhwa?

380
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:12,950
Ah Ro... has become a Wonhwa?

381
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:17,900
For the plague, did you say you used poisonous herbs?

382
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,270
- Just why?
- This is the situation in Silla now.

383
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,540
We are facing a plague epidemic

384
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:27,300
and there is no place to get medicine like Cheonin village.

385
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:34,640
What will you do now?

386
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,810
Will you be expecting herbal medicines to fall from the sky,

387
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:43,030
or will you try to using poisonous herbs?

388
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,130
We should make

389
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,440
your son, no my son, the king.

390
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:02,600
- Do. Do. Do. (In the game of Yut, Do is 1 stick, flat side up and 3 three, round side up.)

391
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,160
Mo. It's Mo! (All sticks round side up).

392
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,350
Do, Gae, Geol, Mo, Eopgo (Teammates moving in Tandem), Eopgo.

393
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:11,820
- Now.
- Geol ( Geol: Three flat side up and one round side up)

394
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,400
Geol.

395
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,610
- Geo-eol! Geol!
Do, Gae, Geol, Capture.(Opponent is sent back to "home" and has to start over)

396
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:21,680
Now, Gae.(  Two spaces forward on the game board )

397
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,500
Do. ( A Do is worth one space forward)

398
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:28,200
Gae! Gae!

399
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,580
Gae.

400
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:33,420
Now, please come here.

401
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,800
Sorry.

402
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,500
Now, how about another game?

403
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,150
One more!

404
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:51,520
Okay.

405
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,150
It seems in the interim you've been getting chummy.

406
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:21,440
Gosh, you have excellent talents.

407
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,760
I'm in the middle of finding a way to endure.

408
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,390
Without even knowing what happened to your orabeoni's life.

409
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:35,490
What are you saying?

410
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:39,200
Did something happen to my Orabeoni?

411
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,210
He was mistaken as the king and Seonmoon was attacked.

412
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:50,710
Aren't you even going to ask what happened?

413
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:55,940
My orabeoni will be safe.

414
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,300
What makes you think that?

415
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,330
Because I believe in him.

416
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:07,620
I'm sure he will be okay.

417
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:12,940
Every time your brother was put in harm's way because of you,

418
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,170
I guess you comforted yourself by thinking that?

419
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:19,930
You may want to use any excuse to provoke me,

420
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:22,540
but I will never fall for it.

421
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,710
Why not?

422
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:26,370
Because I must survive.

423
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:32,320
Because that is the way I will protect my orabeoni.

424
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:43,330
Tomorrow you will go to the shrine of the Wonhwa Nan Mo.

425
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,960
Did you make my daughter into a Wonhwa?

426
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,670
She will be in a position to become head of the Hwarang.

427
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,420
To that child, it is an undeserved honor.

428
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:21,070
Do you think you can still toy with me?

429
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:23,580
I am this nation's Queen Dowager.

430
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:27,770
There isn't anything I won't do to protect the throne.

431
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:35,590
Your son will never sit on the throne.

432
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:38,060
Before that, I intend to make

433
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:43,480
my son the king.

434
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,500
A worthless lineage with Cheonin blood flowing on the throne?

435
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:56,590
Do you think that's possible?

436
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:03,820
It seems you are mistaken.

437
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:11,340
That child is qualified to sit on Silla's throne.

438
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,210
- Qualified?
- Joon Jeong.

439
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:23,030
That child is Joon Jeong's son.

440
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:27,780
The son of Hwi Gyeong Gong, a Silla Sacred Bone.

441
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:26,770
It's time. Let's go.

442
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:34,030
You told me to win someone over? I have to win Park Yeong Sil over?

443
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:35,990
Have you won Park Yeong Sil over?

444
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:40,410
No, because it doesn't suit my taste.

445
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:44,020
Your Majesty, what do you mean by that?

446
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,960
Revenge is sweeter when you prepare hard for it.

447
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,590
You are saying you're going to impose suffering on yourself to toughen up to achieve your goals.

448
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:55,310
I don't want the Hwarang getting hurt any longer.

449
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:58,280
I will need to protect the Hwarang, I will.

450
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:02,760
How will you do it? Because it doesn't suit your taste, you are not taking the hand of the enemy

451
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,080
while you are unable to protect even the friend who is pretending to be king in your place.

452
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:11,580
How would you protect Seonmoon?

453
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:39,350
Wonhwa Princess Nam Mo

454
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:03,960
Because the fact of going to the shrine of Wonhwa Nam Mo is known, they will surely make a move.

455
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:10,340
You must not make any mistakes.

456
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:28,820
Princess Nam Mo and Joon Jeong were just like us.

457
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:37,760
She was the half-blood daughter of a princess and nobleman.

458
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:42,690
Are you consumed with fear?

459
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:47,460
I am curious about something. Is the reason that I became a Wonhwa

460
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:52,550
because I saw His Majesty's esteemed face? Or is it

461
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:59,390
because I am the sister of Seon Woo who pretended to be king in Baekje?

462
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:03,560
You seem to be overestimating yourself.

463
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:07,850
It's not what you did or who you are.

464
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:11,500
It's because you can be used.

465
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:16,890
Did you say that you have to survive in order for your orabeoni to live?

466
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:21,910
No. You are holding your orabeoni back!

467
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:26,700
It's because of you! When he is next to you, Seon Woo is in danger.

468
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:32,700
Even if he wants to go outside to a much bigger world, he can't.

469
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:38,520
♫ Never once did I dream ♫

470
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:44,120
♫ You would be the person on front of me ♫

471
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:49,680
♫ Don't get hurt ♫

472
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:54,490
♫ Don't come any closer ♫

473
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:59,100
If you touch even one strand of her hair, you are dead.

474
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,000
No, right now!

475
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,720
If you're going to kill me, do it now. If she gets hurt before then, I will kill you.

476
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:09,720
♫ A slight sprinkle is falling ♫

477
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,370
♫ Black tears cover me. ♫

478
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:15,020
♫ In my two red eyes ♫

479
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,600
♫ I boxed you up ♫

480
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,230
♫ I want to go back again ♫

481
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,850
♫ to turn the clock back ♫

482
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:28,400
♫ to when it was beautiful ♫

483
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:34,180
I am... Silla's king!

484
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:41,300
If you die... I die too.

485
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:45,150
If you aren't alright, I'm not either.

486
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:49,590
So if you really care for me,

487
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,030
think of yourself more than me.

488
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:56,780
♫ Like a sad dream ♫

489
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:01,970
♫ After falling into a deep slumber ♫

490
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:06,580
♫ Once I erase you  ♫

491
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:12,820
♫ Many cold tears will be left in my heart ♫

492
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:19,260
♫ Frozen in my heart ♫

493
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:22,960
♫ There is still only one person. ♫

494
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,530
♫ Once I erase you ♫

495
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:33,460
♫ My heart will weep  ♫

496
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:36,420
♫ so many sad tears ♫

497
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,730
Is this

498
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:42,650
a dream?

499
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,390
How did you know to come here?

500
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,700
Did you think I wouldn't be able to find you wherever you are?

501
00:54:56,770 --> 00:55:01,820
I am not letting you go anywhere now.

502
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:05,760
I'm going to keep you only by my side.

503
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:39,510
Open your eyes.

504
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:42,820
Ah Ro, open your eyes.

505
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:45,980
Please open them!

506
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:08,900
That child is Joon Jeong's son.

507
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:13,110
The son of Hwi Gyeong Gong, Silla's sacred bone.

508
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:20,310
Now all the subjects know who the king is.

509
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,740
So why are you postponing abdication?

510
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,300
You are too greedy.

511
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:29,240
Until when should the Regent Queen Dowager control the country?

512
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,720
Abdication is the royal family's business.

513
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,670
It's not an issue for you to be debating over.

514
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:40,190
Do you know how many urgent matters Silla faces right now?

515
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:46,400
We need a real king to come out during a war!

516
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:33,920
Who is that?

517
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:10,910
I am Silla's king, Jin Heung.

518
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:22,190
♫ Even if I am leaving far away, don't cry too sorrowfully ♫

519
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:30,030
♫ Promise that there will only be bright memories ♫
