1
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,660
Wh-Why are you doing this?

2
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,230
"Why," you ask?

3
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,960
Because it's dim here, and there are no people here.

4
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,650
And because it is a good place to sleep.

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,780
How does the next part go?

6
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,850
You insolent fool!

7
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,140
Oh, he's pretty good!

8
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,210
If it is your law to kill a Cheonin, who snuck into the capital city,
(Cheonin is the lowest class in Silla society)

9
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,390
my rule is to kill the nobleman who crosses this line.

10
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,920
If you want to beat me up, cross the line first. I'll let you be my opponent.

11
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,430
Episode 2

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,680
Does it make sense that you want to sleep with that kind of atmosphere out there?

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,100
I don't think you understand.

14
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,870
It's impossible to put someone to sleep with my stories.

15
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,570
It will probably just startle them awake.

16
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,790
Will they even remember you were here with all that happening outside?

17
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,490
Even if you die, probably no one would know.

18
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,810
Are you threatening me?

19
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,710
Where are you going to find something of value today?

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,750
Wow.

21
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,000
Even though I'm not well off...

22
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,900
- Silver coins?
- If you don't want it,

23
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,110
I-I'll do it.

24
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,360
Even though you seem like a shameful, dirty pervert,

25
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,840
- I will do it.
- Pervert?

26
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,350
But only until you fall asleep.

27
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,600
That's all I want.

28
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,500
- You're the one who came here.
- This!

29
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,420
Hey!

30
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,940
What are you doing?

31
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,420
Your friend is injured and is emotionally hurt.

32
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,820
I see you lack not only manners but also loyalty toward your friend.

33
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,110
What did you say?!

34
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,360
- Don't interfere.
- But still.

35
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,240
If you interfere in this fight,

36
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,900
you'll only disgrace yourself.

37
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,380
So pathetic.

38
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,770
This insolent Cheonin bastard!

39
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,230
Is there anyone else who wants to come for me?

40
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,570
Let's go.

41
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,190
Do you think you will be let off easily?

42
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,190
The guards will cut your heads off!

43
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,330
Even if you had come a bit later,

44
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,480
they would have been dead by my hands.

45
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,180
I know.

46
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,290
You're actually crazy.

47
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,450
I know.

48
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,440
What's wrong?

49
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,080
I saw something.

50
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,950
Let's just go for now.

51
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,210
You said there is a Cheonin, who saw Sam Maek Jong's face in the capital city.

52
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,490
I apologize.

53
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,480
You can't let him live. Make sure he's dead.

54
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,110
You must find him tonight.

55
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,560
Move quickly. Got it?

56
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,790
Yes!

57
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:04,350
Oh, you're here? You should come in. Why are you just standing there?

58
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,720
Why? Didn't you come because of your back?

59
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,690
I saw something and it seemed weird.

60
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,950
Did you see something?

61
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,180
I feel like I saw that item.

62
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,560
What do you mean by that item?

63
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,960
The necklace that the lady wears.

64
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,680
The thing that your son had with him.

65
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,520
Where did you see it?

66
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,920
In the dark night where the clouds covered the moonlight,

67
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:45,620
a man was secretly heading to his lover's house,

68
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:53,180
but he couldn't reveal himself yet.

69
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:59,510
The man crossed over the fence and snuck into her room like a thief.

70
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:05,230
The surroundings were dark, but the darkness was comforting.

71
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,330
Passing by countless rooms, at last,

72
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,290
he was able to sense the woman's scent.

73
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,310
As he calmed his heart which was bursting, the moment he opened the door,

74
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,270
In front of his eyes was the woman from his dreams.

75
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,090
She stood there with a bright smile.

76
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,750
Why did you come here?

77
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,170
I lost again.

78
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,920
I'm the scared one.

79
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,030
Oh my, Ahn Ji Gong, what are you doing here?

80
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,130
I came because I had something to confirm.

81
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,600
Please tell me what it is.

82
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,130
I heard Cheonin villagers came here. Do you know where they went?

83
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,790
Ah, they left about thirty minutes ago.

84
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:35,010
With the quarrel between Cheonin and the nobles, nobody noticed where they went.

85
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,450
Do you remember what they looked like?

86
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:44,370
One of them covered his face with a bamboo hat, so I'm not sure about him,

87
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,550
but they were both tall, like you.

88
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,730
Thank you.

89
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,190
By chance, do you know this man?

90
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,760
What's happening?

91
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,960
I heard someone who is similar in appearance was headed toward the east gate.

92
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,080
I have something to ask. One of them is wearing a bamboo hat...

93
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,460
Let's just stay hidden around here for today and keep looking tomorrow.

94
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,060
When we come to the capital there is not one day when nothing happens.

95
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,260
What's wrong?

96
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,200
It's nothing.

97
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,840
It doesn't seem like nothing.

98
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,420
Aren't you going to tell me?

99
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,890
I...

100
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,590
I think I saw the same necklace as mine.

101
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,950
But after coming to the capital, there are so many similar necklaces.

102
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,580
I don't know how many more necklaces there are that look like this.

103
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,600
- Stand up.
- Where are we going?

104
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,350
If you even saw some, we'll have to confirm.

105
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,900
Are you stupid? What was the whole point of coming here?

106
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,590
If you saw it, then you should go look.

107
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,870
Aigoo. Stand up.

108
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,430
Why did you come out instead of sleeping?

109
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,630
Because the woman fell asleep on me.

110
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,270
I think I have to see her from time to time.

111
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,160
Do you think she'll do it next time?

112
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,690
Earlier, I definitely heard her call you a pervert...

113
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,900
Don't you think recently we are becoming too close?

114
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,420
I'm starting to think that way.

115
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,870
Even if you don't want to see me, you have no choice for a while.

116
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:20,120
Why? You haven't caught the guy who saw my face yet?

117
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,950
Don't you worry. The guards are handling things.

118
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,710
That's what I'm worried about.

119
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,540
I am afraid the guards will handle it in that way.

120
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,410
Your Maj— Sheesh.

121
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,270
She still will be there, right?

122
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,710
Even if she is not, we can ask someone.

123
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,400
You will be so surprised, really!

124
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,830
Really pretty.

125
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,570
You told me differently before. But she seems to be your sister.

126
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,540
No, not just brother and sister. She is the spitting image of me.

127
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,830
She was cute, and she had a small face.

128
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,340
Tall?

129
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,820
What's wrong?

130
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,140
I'm...

131
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,720
I'm done.

132
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,850
This is crazy, idiot, you can't! If it happens here, what will I do?

133
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,880
You can't! Get back to your senses!

134
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,570
We have to meet my sister!

135
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,320
We have to hide...

136
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,710
What?

137
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,420
Run away...

138
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,750
Shoot!

139
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,550
Dog... Bird!

140
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,990
Dog-Bird. Dog-Bird.

141
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,820
Run away.

142
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,280
Dog-Bird. Dog-Bird.

143
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,090
Stay... Stay still...

144
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,010
That's how you'll survive...

145
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,690
At last,

146
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,880
I killed him.

147
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,820
He's still breathing.

148
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,520
Wake up.

149
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,110
Me...

150
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,170
Leave me... And go.

151
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,090
Shut up.

152
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,070
I'll...

153
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,840
I can't...

154
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,250
I won't leave you.

155
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,910
I can't lose you. Get up.

156
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:27,110
You have to live...

157
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,800
You are just myself.

158
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,940
You...

159
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,820
are my parents,

160
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,180
and my sibling,

161
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,770
and my body itself.

162
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,080
If you live, I live.

163
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,790
If you die, I die too.

164
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,820
Get up.

165
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,210
Get up, be strong.

166
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,320
Get up...

167
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,320
Don't touch that.

168
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,990
This...

169
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,600
Is this yours?

170
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,110
Huh?

171
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,770
Whose necklace is this? It's my child's, right?

172
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,340
Talk to me, please!

173
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,740
Seon Woo...

174
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,790
It's your dad.

175
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,200
Seon Woo!

176
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,030
Your dad is here.

177
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,860
Why are you not doing anything?

178
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,180
Save him.

179
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,570
Save him.

180
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,360
Seon Woo.

181
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,330
Dad...

182
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,810
Fa... Father.

183
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,350
I...

184
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:23,080
I missed you.

185
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,960
I missed you.

186
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,670
Seon Woo.

187
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,210
No way.

188
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,650
No, Mak Moon!

189
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,490
No!

190
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,590
No!

191
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,830
No! Mak Moon!

192
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,740
NO!!

193
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,080
NO!!

194
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,470
No.

195
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,770
No!

196
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,780
Seon Woo!

197
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,530
Have you gotten up?

198
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,060
- But last night Ahn Ji Gong came here—
- Oh, what I am I supposed to do?

199
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,300
I stayed the night here?

200
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,380
Oh, Oh. You should have woken me up.

201
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,930
Seriously! What am I supposed to do!

202
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,110
What am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to do?

203
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,940
I'm dead.

204
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,930
What do I say about not going home yesterday?

205
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:47,040
So you slept with a pervert?

206
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,400
That's not true.

207
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,630
I did sleep but...

208
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,680
We didn't sleep.

209
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,470
All right.

210
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,340
I was here since last night.

211
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,720
For free?

212
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:09,260
If I come out like this, who would be more disadvantaged?

213
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,930
Is it me?

214
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,780
All right.

215
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,460
Oh, nothing is working out.

216
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,140
I only met strange people and couldn't tell my story.

217
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,190
What story?

218
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,190
Don't keep me waiting, tell me quickly.

219
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,310
Actually...

220
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,030
There were two men.

221
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,280
Were they handsome?

222
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,150
What?

223
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,270
One showed up at a moment of despair and rescued the woman before disappearing.

224
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,280
If you aren't alright, it can't be helped.

225
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,880
The other,

226
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,060
offers her something that she cannot refuse.

227
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,470
But only until you fall asleep.

228
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,710
That's all I want.

229
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,440
One is mysterious and the other one is deadly.

230
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,750
Do you suppose so?

231
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,770
What happens afterward? Does the woman get involved with the two men?

232
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,580
I suppose?

233
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,720
Will there be a 'next time' ?

234
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:27,760
What? They should get involved to make it fun.

235
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,210
Queen Dowager, Kakgan Yeong Sil is here.
(Kakgan is the highest officer rank in Silla)

236
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,730
Your Majesty, the subjects and the Royal Council

237
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,000
wish to see you in a golden crown desperately.

238
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,750
Even now, there is an assassin who is chasing after a young nobleman.

239
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,660
I heard sometimes a young man's throat is cut.

240
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,950
That's a ridiculous rumor.

241
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,190
Once King Jin Heung takes his throne back,

242
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,010
the rumor will melt away just like snow does.

243
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,610
It's not the right time yet.

244
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,310
Some day, it will happen.

245
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,980
I mean after killing all the rats lurking around the palace.

246
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,590
Were you waiting for Miss Ah Ro?

247
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:47,600
No, I wouldn't call it waiting.

248
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,590
No, wait.

249
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,890
- Miss?
- Yes.

250
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,850
She is Ahn Ji Gong's daughter.

251
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:01,120
Her family isn't doing so well. So, sometimes we give her some sewing to do.

252
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:07,080
As you know, her talents lie elsewhere.

253
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,490
Ahn Ji Gong?

254
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,720
Does that mean she's a true bone (related to royalty but not the immediate family of the king).

255
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,150
Well...

256
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:18,600
Let me tell you this.

257
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,250
She is half.

258
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,610
Half?

259
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,280
Her mother was the servant of Ahn Ji Gong's house

260
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,110
and was kicked away to a Cheonin village.

261
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:32,080
We can say she's half true bone.

262
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,800
You startled me!

263
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,090
I...

264
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:54,590
Father, about last night...

265
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:57,050
I...

266
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,430
I...

267
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,360
Did something happen?

268
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,960
Father...

269
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,220
There is a serious patient inside.

270
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:21,350
Because the wound is so deep, rest is needed, so you shouldn't go in there.

271
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,260
Are you okay?

272
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,220
I will not be taking any other patients for a while.

273
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,850
If anyone asks, tell them I went far away to see a patient.

274
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,890
What kind of patient could it be?

275
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,880
You must live. You have to live.

276
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,020
DOCTOR

277
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,290
You've gotten up?

278
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,930
It's okay.

279
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,930
This is...my house.

280
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:11,600
You've been unconscious for

281
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,780
five days.

282
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,700
What about Mak Moon?

283
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,760
Seon Woo...

284
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,330
I buried him well.

285
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,660
You should have saved him.

286
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,990
You said you're a doctor.

287
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:37,110
You should have saved him.

288
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,850
Why didn't you do anything?

289
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:47,160
If you hadn't kicked Mak Moon away to the Cheonin village,

290
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,430
if you'd stayed with him, he wouldn't have died.

291
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:54,210
Why didn't you do anything? How could you not save him?

292
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,810
Why did you kill him? Why?

293
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,830
It's not your fault.

294
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,430
How much he missed his family.

295
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,790
He wanted to find them so badly.

296
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,950
He did.

297
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:21,630
I searched and searched for him all over Silla.

298
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,800
It's all because of me.

299
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,590
Even though they took my son, I just watched.

300
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,800
Incapable and powerless.

301
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,730
It's because of his father, me.

302
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:03,780
How did you live with that condition? You must have fainted often.

303
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:08,550
It's none of your business whether I die or not.

304
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,810
If I found Seon Woo,

305
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,330
I was going to give him these clothes and the entrance pass to the capital city.

306
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:23,190
If you plan to go back to the Cheonin village, take these with you. You will pass the gate with ease.

307
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,020
Cheonin.

308
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,780
Do Cheonin have to die like beasts?

309
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:40,410
It is not a crime to kill a Cheonin, who snuck into the capital city.

310
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:45,810
What is the big deal to climb over the wall into the capital?

311
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,870
Why are we nothing? Why?

312
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:53,530
That is the disgusting rule of this country, Silla.

313
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,310
- It's not a simple issue.
- What's not simple?

314
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:02,540
I saw them. I saw who killed Mak Moon.

315
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:06,740
We can get revenge. We can just get revenge for everything!

316
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,720
Um,

317
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,160
I am the daughter of this household.

318
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,740
I'm Ahn Ji Gong's child.

319
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:20,620
It's not much. It seemed like you weren't eating at all.

320
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:26,740
I don't know how bad your body condition is, but it will only get better if you eat.

321
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,280
Did I tell you what my sister looks like?

322
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:38,300
She has pinky chubby cheeks,

323
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:42,330
and her eyes are round and sparkling.

324
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,700
She looks just like me!

325
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,930
She was modest and good.

326
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:50,220
What about a six year old is modest...

327
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:57,730
I wanted to give her a piggyback ride and watch her get married.

328
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:04,350
Okay! When I go to the capital,

329
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,530
I'll give you my sister.

330
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,080
Why?!

331
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,560
- What kind of reaction is that?
- You said she looks like you!

332
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,910
What's wrong with that?!

333
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:18,930
There are things you should and shouldn't say. He only thinks of himself.

334
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:21,960
Are you implying that I'm ugly? Huh?

335
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,650
Did you just diss me?

336
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,200
Hey!

337
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:34,680
Let it go. Let it go.

338
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:50,900
If you drink this, your headache will go away and it will calm down your anger.

339
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,700
It's that type of tea, so . . .

340
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,790
I'll leave it here.

341
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,010
Okay.

342
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,650
You are kind.

343
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,770
What did you just say?

344
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,720
I said thank you.

345
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,660
Please drink it. You'll still have to live.

346
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,740
You did well. He'll decide on his own whether he'll drink it or not.

347
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,160
But still,

348
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,760
I hope he will drink it.

349
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,830
What man's appearance from the rear looks so sad?

350
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,220
But still...

351
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,350
I will have to live.

352
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,590
Why are you here?

353
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,790
I asked why you are here?

354
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,760
Just wait.

355
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:55,750
I will not leave alone

356
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,740
the men who did this to you.

357
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,840
I will get revenge.

358
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,940
The guards were chasing after Cheonin who snuck into the capital.

359
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:20,480
- Was it also surreptitiously?
- Yes.

360
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,690
Yes. Not even in their uniforms. They moved very quietly.

361
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:30,450
The guards were supposed to be with the queen dowager. Instead, they were out of uniform searching for a Cheonin?

362
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,530
They must have seen something?

363
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,900
I have seen those men before.

364
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,320
Just give me an order.

365
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,750
They must have seen something so important that the queen dowager personally intervened.

366
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,850
This is amusing.

367
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:52,570
Then go find them. Those Cheonin.

368
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:06,990
We're not hearing any news from them. Aren't you worried?

369
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,720
Why should I?

370
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:14,920
They ran away from me. No use worrying about them.

371
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,000
Uncle...

372
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,780
Mak Moon died.

373
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:50,920
- Because of me.
- It was destiny.

374
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,950
Why would it be your fault?

375
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:58,620
He was asking for death as soon as he climbed the wall.

376
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,080
Uncle.

377
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:06,000
I need to know why Mak Moon died.

378
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,490
And I will definitely get revenge.

379
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:11,870
It's your fate to just live and stay here.

380
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,970
So just live with me.

381
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,830
You know what kind of person I am.

382
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,550
Hurry up and go inside! And don't start crying because I'm not home.

383
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,300
And make sure you eat!

384
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:50,080
And quit crafting those instruments already. Your back is hurting, too.

385
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,140
If I stay alive,

386
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,290
if I end up staying alive, I promise to come back!

387
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,730
That fate... I can't do anything about it.

388
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,230
Your Majesty, Wi Hwa Gong is here to see you.

389
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,640
The Royal Council will have strong objections.

390
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:31,070
I wouldn't have started it if I was scared of those objections.

391
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,890
If so, please give me total control over this matter.

392
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:37,320
I made up my mind when I went to see you in prison.

393
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:40,510
When do you plan on telling the world?

394
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:45,280
Since you decided to become the master,

395
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,590
I will announce it to the whole country.

396
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:28,470
Hwarang

397
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,820
The new intelligentsia for Silla.

398
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:40,460
Hwarang. Boys who are lovely as flowers.

399
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:45,630
Regardless of their family or clan, they will lay down their lives for the nation and its people,

400
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,090
Loyal soldiers.

401
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:52,030
The wisdom to plan the future of Silla,

402
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,450
wise officers.

403
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:59,400
They will be respected by all of the Silla people.

404
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,240
Beautiful and special beings.

405
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:08,100
This is me making the future of this kingdom.

406
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,410
It's Hwarang.

407
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:17,680
Yes. This kingdom will become stronger with Hwarang.

408
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:38,600
Among the noblemen, only beautiful ones will be selected.

409
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,990
They will study hard together

410
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:47,190
and enjoy the beauty of nature in order to become the intelligentsia of Silla's future

411
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,260
Hwarang.

412
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,280
Wow. That sounds cool!

413
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:57,930
They are pulling out dogs for the queen dowager.

414
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,010
- Is that not it?
- I know right.

415
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:04,670
Who is going to do such crap? Isn't that so, Ban Ryu?

416
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:07,830
I didn't know you would be interested in this.

417
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,980
Why? You want to do it?

418
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,690
Why don't you go and wag your tail?
(figure of speech: sucking up)

419
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,340
Isn't tail wagging your specialty?

420
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,030
It's what you always do to your godfather.

421
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,830
We are speaking so elegantly.

422
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,950
Is that right?

423
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,510
Do you want to compete?

424
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:44,680
The whole capital is shaking up due to the notice from the queen dowager.

425
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,550
Are you still going to do nothing?

426
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,250
That is obviously a hostage, isn't it?

427
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:53,620
Taking our kids and making them to be guards for her.

428
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:56,990
She will keep all her power right under her feet.

429
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:00,250
Collect the noble kids and train them

430
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:04,180
to be future intelligentsia.

431
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,510
Why are you guys so upset?

432
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:08,700
What did you say?

433
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,820
Why don't you say something, Yeong Sil Gong?

434
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,050
Why aren't you saying anything?

435
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:19,670
They'll be training a group for the future of our kingdom.

436
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:23,890
There's no reason to not send our sons.

437
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:25,620
What?

438
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,140
Wait.

439
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:32,950
We can't just send them.

440
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:36,490
I have to get an approval from King Jin Heung?

441
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:42,410
Yes. That's it. You must show us if you are trustworthy.

442
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,560
Trustworthy?

443
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,500
The future of Silla belongs to King Jin Heung.

444
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,860
This kind of big future plan requires the king's approval.

445
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:54,690
If you do, the Royal Council will send their kids with their assurance.

446
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:57,640
Cunning old man.

447
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,660
He is trying to get Sam Maek Jong out of hiding.

448
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,430
Please consider

449
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:07,640
our concerns as parents before being officers for Silla.

450
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:14,400
The intelligentsia for the future of the country... Beautiful appearance?

451
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,500
- That's ME!
- Enjoy the beauty of nature? That's me!

452
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:21,490
For the future of Silla, Hwarang.

453
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,730
You mean Hwarang for yourself, Mother.

454
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:36,760
For now, take seven silver coins.

455
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:42,240
What's up? Paying off the debt?

456
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:50,360
How much was left?

457
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:55,580
I had some work for you...

458
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,730
That's not it.

459
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:02,390
What is it? I asked you what it is.

460
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:06,830
Aren't you going to tell me?

461
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:14,440
This was asked in such a  secret way...

462
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:18,380
It requires observing and prompt abilities.

463
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:23,130
You need to hide well and run away quickly.

464
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:29,390
That is my specialty.

465
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:31,800
What can I do?

466
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:36,520
So,

467
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,650
is the favor I asked of you going well?

468
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,190
Suspicions, really.

469
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:47,960
Don't worry! I did as you said,

470
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,390
and I got someone.

471
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:52,800
Just one?

472
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,350
You have a smaller sized mind than I expected. I thought it was a bowl, but

473
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:00,420
it was a sauce dish.

474
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:05,320
Isn't it important to do this in a secretive and casual way?

475
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,490
Because if the word should get out in the neigborhood, because it's unusual,

476
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:12,500
would you want that? Just look after your part timer well

477
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:17,100
I left it to the best person.

478
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,130
Geez.

479
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:24,770
Why is he acting like that? Who did he get?

480
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:28,200
Who on earth did he hire to be that confident?

481
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,230
No.

482
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,450
It's not right. It's not right.

483
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:50,320
By chance...

484
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,770
Are you the bamboo hat with the necklace? Am I right?

485
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:00,950
Anyway, I told Ahn Ji Gong about you.

486
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:05,120
Did your friend meet his father?

487
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,930
It was all thanks to me.

488
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:11,700
I am not trying to show off.

489
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,050
Is that not it?

490
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:19,590
Or not.

491
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,830
I need a good sword.

492
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,640
Sword?

493
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:29,220
Hmm. I had looked around briefly.

494
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:32,780
Where could a noble man go?

495
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,010
Okta store?

496
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,500
Because I like you.

497
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,820
Leave it out!

498
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,780
Okay, here.

499
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,390
In order to find a guy who likes arrows, I need to go to a carpenter's shop.

500
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:58,660
Good.

501
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:09,770
It's my first time following someone like that.

502
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:14,490
For all day, how fast she runs around.

503
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:17,410
So, where is she now?

504
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,460
Finally, I killed this man.

505
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,470
It is that bastard.

506
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:21,760
It must be difficult to get around like that.

507
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,720
Excuse me...

508
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:10,820
Excuse me...

509
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,360
Mother!

510
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,790
I have no intention to hurt you.

511
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:38,670
If you make a noise, you may be killed by the assassin following me.

512
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:03,810
Come out!

513
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,790
Who is following me?

514
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,600
Is hiding one of your habits?

515
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,760
Are you that afraid of your face being seen?

516
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,510
Go and don't look back and I'll see you again another time.

517
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:44,650
Where exactly is the door?

518
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:52,610
I asked who you were.

519
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:56,380
To you...

520
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,470
I'm someone who is owed a debt from you.

521
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:05,670
Well. I cannot remember owing a debt to anyone.

522
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:10,820
My friend was killed by the sword you brandished.

523
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,770
Does this help you remember?

524
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,990
Stop.

525
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,870
Finally, I

526
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,930
killed this man.

527
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:31,210
He is still breathing.

528
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:35,330
- He was alive.
- Stop hiding and come out you cowardly bastard!

529
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:37,990
Come out right now!

530
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:24,690
There are doors in this world that people like you should not dare to open.

531
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:27,290
It seems like you are in front of that door right now.

532
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:30,380
Do you think it's alright to have roads

533
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:35,380
that people can't cross, doors you can't open?

534
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:40,160
Do you think that is alright?

535
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:46,550
I do not. I think it's all rubbish.

536
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:49,020
So, stop barking and come out!

537
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:54,290
If you leave now,

538
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:56,680
I will spare your life.

539
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,770
There's no need for that.

540
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,900
Because anyway,

541
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,140
I'll kill you.

542
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:28,360
♫  Even though I am leaving  ♫
♫  Don't leave me. Don't leave me. ♫
Thank you to Lee Kwang Soo for his special appearance

543
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:33,400
♫ You who are turning away turn your feet toward me  ♫
