1
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,130
In this world, there are doors that are not meant to be opened.

2
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,640
It seems like you are in front of that door right now.

3
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,720
Do you think it's alright to have roads

4
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,720
that people can't cross and doors that people can't open?

5
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,230
Do you think that is alright?

6
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,990
I don't think so. I think that's all rubbish.

7
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,830
So stop barking and come out!

8
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:08,340
If you leave now, I will spare your life.

9
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,840
There's no need for that because I'm going to kill you anyway.

10
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,560
You. What are you?

11
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,880
I-I'm...

12
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,380
Aish, that idiot.

13
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,960
No, I-I...

14
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,280
You. I said what are you?

15
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,550
I'm n-nothing...

16
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,060
Wake up! Wake up quickly!
~ Episode 3 ~

17
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:12,010
I'm going crazy. How could my legs fall asleep now?

18
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,710
Hey! Let's go!

19
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,980
Stop! No! No! No!

20
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,150
Stop! Stop! No! No! No!

21
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:50,500
They are out of their minds fighting with swords in broad daylight.

22
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,920
I don't think he is an assassin though.

23
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,390
Oh, my notebook, my notebook.

24
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,940
What am I supposed to do? Pi Joo Gyoo must be waiting for me.

25
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,830
Did you lose it?

26
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,950
The bracelet that represents the king.

27
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,920
If someone is not a king without that one bracelet, we should get rid of that system.

28
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,140
Just kill me.

29
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,590
I deserve to die for the sin of giving improper advice.

30
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,890
And if you die, what would happen to me?

31
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,700
If my mother doesn't certify me,

32
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,880
no one will know that I'm the king.

33
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,330
Do you really have to do this?

34
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,260
- What?
- You really are scary.

35
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,230
Aigoo. Aigoo, seriously.

36
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,600
Do you know why the king isn't revealing his face?

37
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:38,250
You know, apparently, he is a eunuch and is the world's biggest idiot.

38
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,170
No wonder, that's why the Queen Dowager does everything.

39
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:49,530
My worry is that that idiot will come out from somewhere, and try and act as the king.

40
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,820
That's right! That's right!

41
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,860
You're not going to do anything again.

42
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,860
I will kill them.

43
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,630
I would rather I were an idiot and a eunuch.

44
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,050
Your Majesty.

45
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,530
I'm going to decide the day you reveal yourself.

46
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,990
Until then, stay quiet as a mouse.

47
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,690
Is hiding your habit? Are you that scared to reveal your face?

48
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:27,760
That's right. I can't make hiding my habit.

49
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,650
Oh, gosh.

50
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,940
From when you came early in the morning...

51
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,330
Surely, you're not angry because I made you make sure people don't steal anything from the store?

52
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,260
No, you eat and stay here for free, but you won't even do this?

53
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,130
Can you be quiet? I have to focus on something.

54
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,610
Focus on what?

55
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:07,830
Then, do you have no interest? It's on its way right now.

56
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,130
What's coming?

57
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,720
It's finally coming.

58
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,130
The private information of the noblemen!

59
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,990
Is that the observer?

60
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,620
She must have been very thirsty.

61
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,720
I had some work that made my legs weak.

62
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,470
Aigoo, I was shocked.

63
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:50,320
These are all the notes on the young noblemen.

64
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,900
Then, are you saying that in this, there is everything on the noblemen?

65
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,920
Why?

66
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,070
There's a small problem with looking at this.

67
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:11,710
I was in a rush, so only I can understand it.

68
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,970
I can't tell whether these are drawings or writings, I could write better with my feet.

69
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,900
That— Usually a calligrapher's (writing) is inferior to my handwriting.

70
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,890
It's like this because I had to do it so secretively.

71
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,450
I don't think so.

72
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,480
What to do... There is an additional cost for a verbal explanation.

73
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,550
Would you like me to do it?

74
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,560
Look at that.

75
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,270
Huh?

76
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:53,640
Since you are confused, if I explain everything

77
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,180
in a dark room where you can't see anything, a briefing

78
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,990
allows you to find out the same as if it was brightly illuminated.

79
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,330
Fie ping?  (Fire-ping is a Korean homonym of briefing.)

80
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,210
It is a briefing.

81
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,170
How shall I determine your level?

82
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,880
Beginner, beginner. He doesn't know anything.

83
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,450
Hey! What do you mean, a beginner?

84
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:24,020
Oh, I wish I could just beat you up.

85
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,590
In Silla, there are three kinds of authority. What are those three types?

86
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,330
To put it simply, there are the queen's men,

87
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,400
men against the queen, and the centrists.

88
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,460
From that time the founders of Silla, Park, Seok, and Kim each in turn, took the king's position.

89
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,760
No, that is how this country was ruled.

90
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,560
For some of the True Bone

91
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,330
it wouldn't be wrong to say that they have enough authority that is comparable to Queen Dowager.

92
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,680
You think I didn't know that?

93
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,010
Then I'll consider that you knew already.

94
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,580
I do know!

95
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:09,850
So, pay attention from now on. I'm going to start.

96
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,090
Firstly, the centrists.

97
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:22,460
If we were to choose the most beautiful man in Silla, 9 out of 10 would say this name.

98
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,210
His deadly charms appeal to both genders.

99
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,430
Yeo Wool

100
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,630
He was given authority, but he wasn't interested in power.

101
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,980
Like the wind, he doesn't stay still.

102
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,090
What do you mean by the wind?

103
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:42,790
His mother is the sister of a former king. She is a Sacred Bone.

104
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:48,350
However, he doesn't know who his father is among the True Bone.

105
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,810
Anyhow, you must be my father.

106
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,310
Can I call you father?

107
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,300
Every time he asks that all the nobles of the capital are surprised.

108
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,710
From now, what I am about to say is very important.

109
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,060
Do you know the uncontrollable horse?

110
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:17,740
A horse is indeed a horse, but he has never been tied down.

111
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:24,960
They have a lot of authority and can get anything they want. They are noblemen who are talented in everything.

112
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,760
Among them, these two.

113
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,230
Ban Ryu

114
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,090
Ban Ryu.

115
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:40,610
He is Silla's most powerful, Park Yeong Sil's godson and Master Hong's biological son.

116
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:45,400
In one word, you can say he was born with two silver spoons.

117
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,280
I'm sorry.

118
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:56,250
He's not lacking in looks and appears friendly, but should I say he's a bit cold?

119
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,280
Somehow girls are attracted to bad boys.

120
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,570
He is the grumpiest.

121
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:08,150
He is a cold-hearted fellow with no interest in women.

122
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,060
Who was that?!

123
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,620
Sorry, I thought you were the ball.

124
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,350
If you say Ban Ryu uses his head,

125
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,630
this person uses his body.

126
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,390
How does it feel to lay on the ground?

127
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,130
Soo Ho

128
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:33,380
He is the son of Master Kim Seup, who is on the queen dowager's side.

129
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:39,130
He is tall. No nobleman can compare to his courage in the kingdom.

130
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,260
- But...
- But?

131
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,390
He is a known flirt.

132
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,420
There are two types of girls in the capital.

133
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,540
Girls that know Soo Ho, and

134
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,590
girls who have been dumped by him, have influenced their fathers, prestigious members of the Royal Council.

135
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:17,390
They like to divide up the group; they like to fight. Doing both are the same.

136
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:24,550
Ah, there is someone who wouldn't know even if they world is turning upside down, if he was focused on something.

137
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,650
He has a lot of curiosity and smiles a lot.

138
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,660
And he has an older brother who always watches over him.

139
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,440
Wait. I have a question.

140
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,960
Han Seong and Dan Seong are in the same household. How are they on different sides?

141
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,940
Well, even if the social status is very different, is it something else?

142
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,470
Their social status is different. How?

143
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:56,100
The father is the same but asking about the mother is asking about the ancestry of a servant of the house.

144
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,750
Even if you say he's in the same blood line as Han Seong, it's different.

145
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:04,010
One is True Bone and one is half.

146
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,290
That can be the case, I guess.

147
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,670
Hey!

148
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,960
So as you promised, you're paying for the alcohol this month.

149
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,030
I'll drink it well.

150
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,680
I'm leaving!

151
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,000
Hey! Hey!!

152
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,380
Why am I in the wrong?!

153
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,400
Swordsmanship, horseback riding, I can beat him in all.

154
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,990
Why do we keep losing at soccer each time?!

155
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,830
And for some reason, my mood gets worse after soccer.

156
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,860
Why?

157
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,140
Isn't it because of them?

158
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,500
You are so handsome!

159
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,150
Good job!

160
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,880
How handsome!

161
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,920
Just you two sword fight in the mountains.

162
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,220
What's the point of winning ten times?

163
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,870
So now, you know almost everything about the sons of the noblemen in the capital.

164
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,960
There's still one person left.

165
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,130
If the atmosphere out there is like that, would they even remember that you are here?

166
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,710
They probably wouldn't even know if you died here.

167
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,040
You don't really need to know about him.

168
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,800
Anyway, this is everything I can tell you for now.

169
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,930
Of course, if you're curious about anything you can always ask me...

170
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,230
Of course, there will be extra silver involved.

171
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,490
The 80 percent remainder of my pay in silver,

172
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,170
I will come get it later on.

173
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,050
I'm taking my leave.

174
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,670
A smart lady with a lot of debt.

175
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,640
Are you curious?

176
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,130
I mean about the girl from some house?

177
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,820
Yeah. Which household is she from?

178
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,650
She's from Ahn Ji Gong's household.

179
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:20,070
That is right. Between a servant mother

180
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,780
and Ahn Ji Gong, she is a half.

181
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,330
The father is Ahn Ji Gong...

182
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,130
However, she looks very similar.

183
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,400
Why is this freak in front of my house?

184
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,220
Why did he come? Was he following me?

185
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,820
What does he want to do with me? This is crazy, seriously.

186
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,560
What is this?

187
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,770
Oh my God!

188
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,230
Were you following me?

189
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,980
No! It's not it...

190
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,520
Then what is it?

191
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,950
Why are you here?!

192
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,720
Do you know that guy from earlier?

193
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,860
Answer me!

194
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:46,510
I'm the one who lives here... It's my house, I swear.

195
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:58,300
Uh... I'm this house's daughter, so I'm Ahn Ji Gong's daughter.

196
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,010
Are you...

197
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,540
Ahn Ji Gong's daughter?

198
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,340
This is...

199
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,730
What are you doing?

200
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:28,090
What are you—

201
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:34,630
I made these clothes. I made this to give to my brother.

202
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,190
Why are you wearing them?

203
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,970
Who are you? Where did you get this outfit?!

204
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,860
You're here.

205
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,040
Father...

206
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,590
If they find a Cheonin in the capital,

207
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,760
the one who hid them will be punished.

208
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,920
Did you know that?

209
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:12,350
Don't worry. I won't bother you once I leave.

210
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:17,170
If someone asks you your name, tell them you're Seon Woo.

211
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,440
Ah Ro, you...

212
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,260
I want her to think that you are her real brother.

213
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,110
What are you talking about?

214
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:33,300
Stay here. As my son and as this child's brother.

215
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,990
Are you crazy? Why would I be your—

216
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,600
Son... And her brother?

217
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,030
Your treatment still hasn't finished yet.

218
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,760
You losing your consciousness will become more and more frequent.

219
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,450
It will be hard for you because the wound is deep.

220
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:58,130
I promise that you will faint again, before the sun sets, if you leave now.

221
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,600
Do you wish to die like that?

222
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,690
You will have to heal completely before doing anything else!

223
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,240
Just stay here at least until you are healed.

224
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,020
This is not my wish.

225
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,220
It will be Seon Woo's wish.

226
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,010
Isn't he that patient from before?

227
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,140
Are you a debtor?

228
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,120
But why is he wearing clothes that I made?

229
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,460
There's no way!

230
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,430
We thought we found him last time, but we did not.

231
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:09,030
I saw that person in the marketplace this morning.

232
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,920
He's a really dangerous person!

233
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,100
This person...

234
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,100
really is your brother.

235
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,030
He had this.

236
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,790
I know that you've been hurting all this time.

237
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,520
How can a father not recognize his own son?

238
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:20,210
- This much?
- No, she was about this tall.

239
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,360
She was really small and pretty.

240
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,730
She probably grew up a lot.

241
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,980
Did she grow that much?

242
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,590
No...

243
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,540
As much as this?

244
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,750
Geez.

245
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,870
Do you like your sister that much?

246
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,920
I'm dying to see her!

247
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,000
Will I meet her before I die?

248
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,090
♫ One step at a time as the distance increases ♫

249
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,760
♫ While your love becomes more visible ♫

250
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,680
There's no scarring. You fell in a stream and had a stone stuck in you,

251
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,090
but there's nothing.

252
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:03,430
♫ Will the pain be forgotten and how tightly will you be held to my heart? ♫

253
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:11,990
There's no trace of when you touched a beehive and almost died.

254
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,240
Why would a bee sting still be here up to now?

255
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,300
Do you have any more scars?

256
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:26,060
If you get a bigger wound on top of them, you can't see old scars.

257
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:34,000
Your eyes, nose, lips...

258
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,230
There's nothing on you that is like me.

259
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,700
♫ Even if I leave far away ♫

260
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,590
Correct. We don't look alike.
♫  don't cry too sorrowfully ♫

261
00:23:52,760 --> 00:24:00,520
♫ Promise that there will only be bright memories ♫

262
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,990
I don't know why I'm crying. I don't even know whether you're real or fake.

263
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:12,760
I don't know if you know, but someone else came saying he was my brother.

264
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,330
Just because you have the necklace

265
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:21,650
I cannot believe that you are my brother, so... so...

266
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:32,200
♫ My love will breathe forever in your heart. ♫

267
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:36,490
But you still have it... The scar.

268
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,590
Everyone has a scar like this from when they were young.

269
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,520
Don't act as my brother by doing things like this.

270
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:54,300
If you are curious about your childhood, ask me.

271
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:59,700
because I can remember everything you can't remember.

272
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:11,200
♫ so that I who am leaving can laugh. ♫

273
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:19,540
You. What are you?

274
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:33,210
But you still have it... The scar.

275
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,740
So this freak is my brother?

276
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,540
He somehow looks familiar...

277
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,580
He looks familiar...

278
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:07,710
You're handsome...

279
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,280
Totally.

280
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,580
No way!

281
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,870
Are you sorry?

282
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,010
Since you're about to sleep in my room,

283
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,980
do you feel sorry?

284
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,990
Yeah.

285
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,710
My sister is pretty, right? And she's nice, huh?

286
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:15,360
It seems that you don't know your sister too well.

287
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:21,070
Your sister is pretty strange.

288
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,480
She cries really easily.

289
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,860
But..

290
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,340
She's pretty, as you said.

291
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,740
You promised me. You promised to protect her.

292
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,780
What am I supposed to do?

293
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:45,380
You're acting as if you didn't know. Just be yourself!

294
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,960
I'm looking at you, but

295
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:53,220
why do I miss you so much?

296
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,540
Alright.

297
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:32,120
He won't know.

298
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,300
Of course, he won't!

299
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,820
Whatever.

300
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,650
It's been awhile since we ate rice. It's delicious. Right, Father?

301
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,340
I don't feel well. I have to stop eating.

302
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,620
- You should eat more.
- Eat up.

303
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,640
Stop staring at me and eat.

304
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,990
Wh-Who was staring?

305
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,760
I don't know if you know that you have an annoying personality.

306
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,170
I don't know if you know that you have a flirtatious personality.

307
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:39,850
You get drunk during the day, and your habits are extreme.

308
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,700
What is your brother like?

309
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,700
I'm doomed. He can't be my brother.

310
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:03,240
He seems like he's my brother, but I wish he weren't, but I also wish he was. I'm going crazy, seriously!

311
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:09,000
That is how brothers are. One day he is a complete jerk.

312
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,980
But if he's not around, you feel uncomfortable as if you didn't clean your behind well after the restroom.

313
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,170
But then you think that this what family is like.

314
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:22,160
But how do you already feel that feeling?

315
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,610
If only I hadn't been a jerk around him.

316
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,620
You being a jerk? Have you met him before?

317
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,500
He remembers everything! Everything! Everything!

318
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,410
What is it? What is it?

319
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,910
I don't know!

320
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:44,050
I'm doomed!

321
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:48,190
Where is Dog-Bird hiding?

322
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,980
How many times did I tell you? He died.

323
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,650
I was born in this small country

324
00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:00,490
After going as far as the countries bordering Western China, I've lived life roaming.

325
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:04,260
I see through all your lies.

326
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:09,010
You crazy guy!

327
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:12,080
He died, then?

328
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:20,190
He's not the kind of person to die.

329
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:28,860
Wait and see. If he died, I will revive him and sell him off for an expensive price.

330
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:45,080
Oh yeah, the necklace. He was looking for the owner of the necklace.

331
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,560
Now all I have to do is find the owner.

332
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,310
Aren't I right?

333
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,940
I have to die quickly. Every time I...

334
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:02,880
I know, right. I won't have to suffer that much.

335
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:06,450
So don't say something you don't mean.

336
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:10,780
You have to get better so you can play with your kid like in the past. Right?

337
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,120
- Thank you.
- Hurry and go.

338
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,330
Oh, my!

339
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,220
The pervert from before?

340
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,220
Why did you come here?

341
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,710
I came to see the doctor. What a coincidence.

342
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,730
Don't I have a fever?

343
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,520
Are you here to sleep again?

344
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,520
Are you that much of a crazy man?

345
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,790
Shouldn't you be thinking that to yourself?

346
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,020
Really, why are you here?

347
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,160
I was worried.

348
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,710
About me?

349
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,900
Why?

350
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:05,170
If you don't understand, then just consider me ill.

351
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,990
What is it that you really want?

352
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,650
Give me some medicine. Something hot and bitter but good for your body.

353
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:23,380
Man, I'm so busy with the ceremonial walk tomorrow. Are you really going to do this?

354
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,700
Hurry and leave so that I can do my work!

355
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,310
You look at the sick for free and work at other places.

356
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,640
You're not smart!

357
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:36,630
And the idiot king that cannot show his face.

358
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,350
Ceremonial procession, what...

359
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,080
Now I see that you're a total scumbag.

360
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:48,970
Having an illness is not a sin and being young and weak is not a sin either.

361
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,620
Imagine how he must feel not being able to stand before you.

362
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:01,160
Not being able to stand forward.

363
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,750
You know that?

364
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,040
If you've been sick before, then you know how a patient feels.

365
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,190
And everyone has been young and weak before.

366
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:13,790
How would it be difficult to know what that feels like?

367
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,410
Hwarang

368
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,670
Ah, they are so noisy. I wish I could just release snakes around them whenever they do this.

369
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,440
Stop oppressing without reason.

370
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,070
This is a matter for the future of Silla.

371
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:56,450
From the beginning, this was all nonsensical work.

372
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:59,430
She wants us to entrust our children as hostages.

373
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,440
Do you expect us to agree?

374
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,600
All of them refuse to let go of their control over Silla.

375
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:12,500
It's because of you that Silla is the weakest and smallest out of the kingdoms,

376
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,050
you stupid and disgusting things.

377
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,290
Why are you so noisy?

378
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:38,320
Are you pushing for Hwarang on your own?

379
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,800
Didn't we advise that we won't follow through without the king's consent?

380
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,190
That is impossible from the king.

381
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,220
Then why don't you give up?

382
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,790
None of us will send our sons to Hwarang.

383
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:55,350
Even so, let's just wait until the ceremonial walk.

384
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,360
It is the year that he is an adult.

385
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,130
This time he might come here.

386
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,650
We can't have a ceremonial walk with an empty seat again

387
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,450
Do you think this makes sense?

388
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:11,390
Why is this matter so difficult?

389
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:20,210
We don't even know if he's already here.

390
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,250
Then, why don't you give up on the ceremonial walk?

391
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,930
It is a once in a lifetime event for the subjects to meet the royal family.

392
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,530
If we stop because the officials do not follow,

393
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:40,070
the royal family's authority will fall to the ground.

394
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,360
If we cannot make Hwarang,

395
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,810
the royal family of Silla may be harmed to the point that it may never again recover.

396
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,160
Just leave it to me.

397
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,770
From the beginning, you gave me full authority.

398
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,530
What are you doing right now?

399
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,420
Be quiet. I'm trying to plan a rebellion.

400
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:21,090
A rebellion? Whatever!

401
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:24,800
But why with your left hand? You're not left-handed.

402
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,360
I have to write with my left hand so they don't know who wrote it.

403
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,020
Yeah, so why?

404
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:39,990
Back in the day, they used to say to start fights and to stop negotiation.

405
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:43,270
With this letter, I plan to change the future of Silla.

406
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,710
What are you talking about?

407
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:51,640
And, isn't the saying "to stop fights and start negotiation"?

408
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,610
Find me a messenger to deliver this letter. Two people.

409
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:16,390
- Is Master Soo Ho here?
- Does Master Ban Ryu live here?

410
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:21,980
- Give this. It is from Soo Ho.
- It is from Master Ban Ryu.

411
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:28,210
Let's meet tomorrow night at Najeong and have a match.

412
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:30,390
He's crazy. Where does he think that is?

413
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,540
At Najeong.

414
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,660
Ah, if I don't go out there, he'll call me a coward for the rest of my life.

415
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,580
Na—

416
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:45,410
It seems the queen dowager will insist on the ceremonial walk this time too.

417
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,950
Do you have any plans?

418
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,730
Will I not have to show that Sam Maek Jong won't be sacrificed and

419
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:56,930
that it's not the Hwarang, but that nothing can "not" be created?

420
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:00,670
Are you saying we should not participate in tomorrow's ceremonial walk?

421
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:06,930
We must teach her that a ceremonial walk with a missing seat is nothing but a show.

422
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,880
That's right.

423
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:51,610
Queen Dowager, the ceremonial walk is ready to begin.

424
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:11,370
We honor His Majesty's birthday.

425
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:17,400
Most of the officials including, Park Yeong Shil,

426
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,570
did not appear as they lie sick in bed.

427
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,720
Are they trying to disrespect me in this way?

428
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,100
I think that they want to stop the creation of Hwarang.

429
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:34,170
There is only one way to cut off those arrogant men.

430
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,400
It is only the Hwarang.

431
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:04,510
So, this an empty ceremonial walk again?

432
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,150
That is right.

433
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,550
The king is not even there. What's the point of that?

434
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,000
How would I know?

435
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,400
I don't understand what they are thinking.

436
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,720
Who cares as long as I sell a lot of alcohol?

437
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,500
There are definitely too many people here.

438
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:36,110
Who would think this? That the King would be walking around the streets of the capital on his birthday.

439
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,530
It's not a sin to be young and weak.

440
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,420
However, that's not the case right now.

441
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,800
Where are you going?

442
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:00,420
I have to find someone.

443
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,190
Don't be too late.

444
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,420
What's going on that is causing so many people to come here?

445
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,900
Let's go. Let's go.

446
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,760
Wait. This is the queen dowager's ceremonial walk.

447
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,200
You cannot cross this street.

448
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:59,350
Just get in.

449
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:04,890
Do you think I want to be here with you?

450
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,740
You better come out today.

451
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,510
If you run away, I will kill you.

452
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,430
According to whom?

453
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:28,000
Anyway, you must be excited to see your beloved Queen Dowager.

454
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,200
I'm being serious, I don't care about the gender.

455
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,810
Rebels like you will never understand, whether dead or alive.

456
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:42,020
You, you've never met the Queen Dowager right?

457
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:45,070
So what?

458
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,100
That is Kim Seup's son.

459
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,090
Gakgan Park Young Shil's godson.  (Gakgan was an extremely high rank).

460
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:44,250
That is the most ideal spot!

461
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:48,400
What do you mean ideal spot?

462
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:53,200
Queen Dowager's ceremonial walk!!

463
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,530
How is that any spectacle?

464
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,810
Acting tough?

465
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:06,660
A marching parade without a king and Hwarangs without their masters.

466
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,060
Because the mother's greed has no end,

467
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:15,550
no wonder the children have no place to stand.
-What is he talking about?

468
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,820
Ah, what are you doing?

469
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,800
Huh?

470
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,420
I am looking for Wi Hwa Gong.

471
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:45,110
I heard to look for you to become a Hwarang.

472
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,770
I think it's courtesy to say your name first.

473
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:50,700
Ah, my name is not important.

474
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:53,630
Just call me Ji Dwi Gong.

475
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:56,150
It is Ji Dwi Gong... Whose son are you?

476
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:58,710
There's nothing about my household to reveal.

477
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:01,280
If you think about it, it's a screwed up family.

478
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:06,130
Your name is an alias, your family is screwed up, and you can't verify your identity.

479
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,650
But you want to become a Hwarang?

480
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:14,180
Actually, I studied in the border countries of Western China and I have connections in that direction.

481
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:20,340
I heard you were hiring people, so I thought I should join to use the connections to become a businessman later.

482
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:24,120
Ah, please understand that I don't use honorifics.

483
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,390
Those children in the household do not use honorifics at all.

484
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:29,460
So you will become a Hwarang to be a businessman?

485
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,430
Why?

486
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:33,130
Can't I?

487
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,340
If you don't intend to speak the truth,

488
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,900
get out of here.

489
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,850
The truth?

490
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:48,920
Do you want the whole truth

491
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,560
or do you want half the truth?

492
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:58,350
Let's hear half the truth first. What is your half truth that made you want to become a Hwarang?

493
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:04,230
To drag down the mistress of the ceremonial walk.

494
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,490
Queen Dowager.

495
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:54,420
It's him.

496
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,530
You can't! No!

497
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,770
Who are you?

498
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:18,100
I asked, who are you?

499
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:24,100
If you wish to die with your mouth shut, die.

500
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,380
Your Highness.

501
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,660
Who is it?

502
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:09,260
Take me and leave the capital.

503
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,790
Please.

504
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:31,000
He is my son.

505
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:34,520
Your son?

506
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:39,370
He's my son whom I lost when he was young and I recently found him.

507
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:42,460
Due to the fact that he had no father or teaching,

508
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:46,310
he has committed a horrible act in front of you, the queen.

509
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:48,480
Punish me instead.

510
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,090
If you tell me to die here,

511
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,240
I will.

512
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,410
You always

513
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:07,990
commit crimes deserving death.

514
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,890
It makes sense

515
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:19,230
for the father to receive his son's punishments.

516
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,180
What are you doing?

517
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,320
He has nothing to do with me!

518
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:28,260
Kill me! Kill me!!

519
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:34,530
Because of the son, the father is dying.

520
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:39,560
Watch closely what happens to your father because of you.

521
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:44,320
Just a bit of the blade will cut off his breath.

522
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,460
No, no!

523
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,800
Where did they go?

524
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,200
Geez.

525
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,900
No, did the ceremonial walk finish?

526
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:19,500
No, forget the ceremonial walk. Some crazy man ruined it all.

527
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,700
Ruined?

528
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,600
Ahn Ji Gong's son or something

529
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,000
brandished a sword at Queen Dowager.

530
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,700
Who did what? What did you say?

531
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:36,500
Was Ahn Ji Gong with them? Where are those people?

532
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,100
Where are those people now?

533
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,500
You will pull down the queen dowager.

534
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,000
I thought you had that much guts. However,

535
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,900
is that not why you planned to create this?

536
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:07,300
What can you do by pulling down Queen Dowager?

537
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:15,400
Is it true that you are half-hearted? You are mistaken.

538
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,500
I'm not trying to ruin Silla but I want to change it.

539
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:25,200
I don't have the desire to accept you as a Hwarang.

540
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,000
Get out.

541
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,000
He's not trying to ruin it but change it.

542
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,500
Aish.

543
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,100
Watch closely

544
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,800
to what happens to your father.

545
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,200
No! No! No!

546
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,400
I

547
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:32,600
I am thinking of killing your sister and father.

548
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,900
Those people have nothing to do with me.

549
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,300
I don't know what sin you committed,

550
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,500
but it's not something that can be repaid by only you.

551
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:46,900
No. I can't make them die because of me.

552
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,800
You can't do that to those people. So, please,

553
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,900
slice my neck! Kill me,

554
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:04,100
and spare their lives! Please!

555
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,600
Kill me! Me!

556
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,100
Child,

557
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,000
you're quite small and weak.

558
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:27,600
Weak people can't die on their own,

559
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,000
or live.

560
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:40,100
Whatever happens to your father and sister, their fate is in your hands.

561
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,300
Go and wait.

562
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:02,100
Naturally, it's normal to punish the father too. They took him into the palace as well.

563
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,300
I didn't even look for you today.

564
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,100
Why are you in front of me?

565
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:08,300
♫  You were so far away  ♫

566
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:13,300
♫ Without being able to see you  ♫

567
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:17,500
♫  I never once dreamed  ♫

568
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:22,100
-What about father? What happened to father?
♫  You would be the person in front of me  ♫

569
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:29,100
♫  Don't get hurt  ♫

570
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:32,900
- Why are you coming out alone? What about Father?
♫ Don't come any closer  ♫

571
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:38,900
♫  My frozen heart  ♫

572
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:43,700
♫  Can't embrace you  ♫

573
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,800
What are you doing?

574
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:51,900
♫  A slight sprinkle is falling, black tears cover me  ♫

575
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:57,200
♫  In my two red eyes, I boxed you up  ♫

576
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:02,400
♫  I want to turn back time  ♫

577
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:10,200
♫ to when it was beautiful  ♫

578
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:15,300
♫  Like a strong wind ♫

579
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:20,700
♫ Which brushes past  ♫

580
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:25,200
♫ It's common type of love ♫

581
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:31,000
♫  I'm just keeping my eyes closed  ♫
