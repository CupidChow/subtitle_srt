00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,750
Episode 11

2
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,580
It can't be like this.

3
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,000
You can't be like this.

4
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,230
I wasn't even able to tell you my thoughts.

5
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:55,260
How can you be like this? Like this?

6
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,740
That I liked you because you weren't my Orabeoni,

7
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,270
I wasn't even able to say it.

8
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,280
That this heart of mine was about to go crazy,

9
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,460
that I hated myself so much, that's why I acted nasty towards you and couldn't tell you.

10
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,530
♬ I'm afraid the more I try to wipe it out, the more I will be left yearning ♬

11
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,850
Because my heart fluttered because of you,

12
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:30,170
that's why my heart felt stifled and I felt like dying.

13
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,470
Only now I can barely breathe.

14
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,800
Because if I look at you, my heart flutters.

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,140
My heart is racing and there were so many days I felt like going crazy.

16
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,070
How can you die like this? What am I supposed to do?

17
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:03,740
♬ Although you and I became tears for each other ♬

18
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:11,400
♬ After time passed on a bright day ♬

19
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,900
♬ when we just held each other and it was just like a dream ♬

20
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:24,950
♬ I remember that time then ♬

21
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,920
Ora...beon...i. I mean,

22
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,350
I... I...

23
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,860
♬ There is only one person ♬

24
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:42,480
♬ Twelve months will pass and coming again like the seasons ♬

25
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:50,270
♬ You also will return to me. ♬

26
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,400
Orabeoni! Orabeoni!

27
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,920
He fell from the horse?

28
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,090
I went because the horse came back by itself and this situation...

29
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,670
But it was good that the doctor was next to him.

30
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,790
The shock must be great

31
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,740
since she saw her brother fall off.

32
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,810
But why did you call me?

33
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,310
That is why you are called rude.

34
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,860
Right now your roommate might die. Is that something you should say?

35
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,160
I feel bad for the woman who will marry someone like you.

36
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,830
Looking at how he is not waking up yet...

37
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,580
Is it here that is the problem?

38
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,320
Your pulse is alright but why won't you wake up?

39
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:07,280
And if you don't wake up, what am I supposed to do by myself?

40
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,910
No way!

41
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,330
He wouldn't forget upon waking up, would he?

42
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,950
No, no. No, it's fine if he doesn't remember anything.

43
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,160
So.

44
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,020
Open your eyes, please.

45
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,270
♬ Just keeps growing wider  ♬

46
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,760
♬  While I'm looking at you all day ♬

47
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,160
♬ Pretending I don't care ♬

48
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,220
♬ Should I approach first? ♬

49
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,040
Why is he so cold?
♬ I'll whisper in your ear ♬

50
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,380
♬ I'm waiting for you ♬

51
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,950
♬ You can sing for my life ♬

52
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,490
♬ Flashing over and over in my eyes ♬

53
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,590
♬ If I just see you my heart pounds ♬

54
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,230
♬ Only the confessions I couldn't say are piling up ♬

55
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,050
♬ What can I do? I'm still not good enough but ♬

56
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,790
♬ I want to express my feelings ♬

57
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,500
This won't do.
♬ My heart must be totally breaking down ♬

58
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,520
♬ I feel like I own the whole world ♬

59
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,800
♬ Should I carefully muster the courage and confess? ♬

60
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,220
♬ You know I do. I love you  ♬

61
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,220
This is just something I can do as a doctor.

62
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,420
Since we have to save a person first.

63
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,080
♬ While I'm only looking at you ♬

64
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,260
♬ Will you also feel the same as I do? ♬

65
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,530
♬ Everything seems like a dream ♬

66
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,090
♬ From the time we first met ♬

67
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,730
♬ I'm waiting for you ♬

68
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:54,060
You should know that I did this much for you.

69
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,280
You're going to have to be really thankful to me later on.

70
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,480
♬ Flashing over and over in my eyes ♬

71
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,820
♬ If I just see you my heart pounds ♬

72
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,480
♬ Only the confessions I couldn't say are piling up ♬

73
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,270
♬ What can I do? I'm still not good enough but ♬

74
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:18,060
♬ I want to express my feelings ♬

75
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,790
♬ My heart must be totally breaking down ♬

76
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,650
♬ I feel like I own the whole world ♬

77
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:33,060
♬ Should I carefully muster the courage and confess? ♬

78
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,410
♬ You know I do. I love you  ♬

79
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,770
Did he look like this?

80
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,850
Hurry and wake up.
♬ You are the only one for me ♬

81
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,090
Wake up and look at me.
♬ After I slyly get closer ♬

82
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,940
♬ Will we gently kiss? ♬

83
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,730
I think we'll have a lot to talk about.
♬ When will I be at your side? ♬

84
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,420
♬ I'm waiting for you ♬

85
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,090
Isn't it so?

86
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,860
♬ This is the first time I've felt this since I was born ♬

87
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,750
♬ I feel like I own the whole world ♬

88
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,330
♬ Even if it happens thousands of times my heart is fluttering ♬

89
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:28,260
♬ I love you as I was fated to ♬

90
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,610
It's hot. It's uncomfortable.

91
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,990
How could this happen!

92
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,660
What are you guys?

93
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,530
Did you wake up?

94
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,150
I saved you.

95
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,510
We saved you together.

96
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,430
- If you are looking for your sister, she's not here.
- Where is she?

97
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,500
Since she wasn't able to sleep for four days and endured it,

98
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,860
I sent her to get some shut eye.

99
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,960
You know her stubbornness. It wasn't easy.

100
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,590
How many days have passed before I woke up?

101
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,520
Four nights and half a day.

102
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,920
What's this? Where did he go?

103
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,800
By any chance, while I was asleep...

104
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:17,560
No, there's no way. No way. Where exactly did he go?

105
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,220
Where did he go? Where is he? Huh?

106
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,010
He's fine, perfectly fine.

107
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,780
Didn't he see me?

108
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:20,060
What the hell? Is this the "breaking off a relationship" that I heard about?

109
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,800
How are you feeling?

110
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,540
Well, I'm okay.

111
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,300
I saved your life. Aren't you going to thank me for it?

112
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,250
Yeah, thanks.

113
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,990
By any chance, can he not remember?

114
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,570
What's wrong with you? Do you know how worried your sister was because of you?

115
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,730
What's with him?

116
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,100
How will you understand the complications between a woman and a man?

117
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,100
Oh, was it a brother and sister relationship?

118
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:31,800
What kind of man can not remember kissing a woman?

119
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,910
Your brother can't remember what happened between you and Ban Ryu last time.

120
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,940
Is that the same as that? It's not something else.

121
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,030
How can a man not remember kissing a woman?

122
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,580
But why is he acting like he doesn't?

123
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,300
Is someone pretending not to know about kissing you?

124
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,610
Or... is it a new erotic story?

125
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,740
Just answer me.

126
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,030
Well... Maybe he doesn't want to take responsibility?

127
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:05,110
He doesn't want to be associated with her? Or after coming to his senses, "This isn't it." That kind of thing?

128
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,830
Men are all like this. If they avoid you, it turns into something that never happened.

129
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,290
That's not it. I said it wasn't!

130
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:18,160
Are you still saying that after watching my brother? He's matchless when it comes to changing his mind a dozen times a day.

131
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,860
When I look at it. In this world, the only man with loyalty is Ban Ryu.

132
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,950
Hey, Dog-Bird!

133
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:43,650
Everyone else calls you that. Did you get any better? How about a match?

134
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,590
Forget it, I won't do it.

135
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,180
Why are you being like this to Ah Ro?

136
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,310
Let go.

137
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,640
Just tell me what's the matter.

138
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,380
I said let go.

139
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,470
- Mind your own business.
- That's too difficult.

140
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:10,210
As you know, I have a lot of interest in your sister. So I just can't mind my own business.

141
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:15,830
If someone makes her cry, I won't forgive anyone.

142
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:23,420
Did you say archery and horsemanship? Let's go then.

143
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,980
That's impressive when it hasn't been that long since you started.

144
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,090
Why do I need to learn something like this? I just need to do it.

145
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,310
Wow, that Dog-Bird.

146
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,960
Don't overdo it. It looks like your hand hasn't mastered the bow.

147
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:27,220
Shut up. Just shoot.

148
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,010
This is the last. Let's finish this with this last arrow.

149
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,850
That Hwarang has no chance of winning against our Ji Dwi.

150
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:23,970
His skills weren't perfected in a day. Already, his form when he shoots the bow is different, right?

151
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,060
He also has good looks.

152
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:34,300
This guy has only a 10-day old form while doing archery and horsemanship. Go ahead and beat him.

153
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:40,240
Why was it Dog-Bird out of all people? Ji Dwi has to have someone good next to him.

154
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,640
How old are you really?

155
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,840
I said 22!

156
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,740
You don't look like it...

157
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,920
Then how old are you?

158
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,680
Twenty-two years old.

159
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:58,990
Even if it is the same age, my birth month is a lot earlier.

160
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:04,950
I'm born in January, what about you?

161
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:09,800
I'm born in January 20 years earlier than you, punk!

162
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:16,420
Drop... your formalities, my friend.

163
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:38,220
Wow, what a tough guy. What's your real identity? You're not scared of anything and there's nothing you can't do.

164
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:45,000
Then what is your identity? You're hiding a lot too. Aren't you the same?

165
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,920
Should I tell you a secret? From the moment I was born till now,

166
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,260
I've never had any friends.

167
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:04,160
And, right now, I think you're my only friend. I like you a lot...

168
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,000
What's that laugh?

169
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,810
Do you know how great of a confession this is? Later you'll be so surprised—

170
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:16,080
Hey, hold on, come here. What great confession?

171
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,350
Hey!

172
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,760
That little!

173
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,000
Leave them be. They're playing around. Don't interfere.

174
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,470
How dare you!

175
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,590
Why are you being like this to your sister?

176
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,960
If you don't want to talk, then don't.

177
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,190
It's because I'm scared.

178
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,730
About what?

179
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,130
Myself.

180
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,950
I'm scared of myself.

181
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:41,110
Can he really not remember?

182
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:46,180
No way. If he didn't remember, he wouldn't deliberately act so cold.

183
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:51,600
He has never done this to me before. Then what is it?

184
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,650
Now that he came back to his senses, does he regret it?

185
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:02,960
Then why did he kiss me?!

186
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,720
Why are you doing this to me, seriously!

187
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,080
Your habit of throwing this, this shoe, anywhere hasn't changed.

188
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,050
And sitting down anywhere... please...

189
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,120
Stop that.

190
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:09,230
If you remember all of that... Don't you remember something else?

191
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,630
I do remember.

192
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,980
Then... Why did you pretend not to see me?

193
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,510
Because when I see you,

194
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,880
I want to embrace you.

195
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,100
When I see you,

196
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:01,950
I want to run away from where the other guys are while holding your wrist.

197
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:07,450
I finally came after holding that in.

198
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,310
♬ Don't look at me with sad eyes ♬

199
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:21,000
I still want to embrace you, but if I do with this heart,

200
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,140
I can't because I'm afraid you'll crumble to pieces.

201
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:34,500
I'm sorry.
♬ When you only offer me tears, what can I do? ♬

202
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:45,190
♬ I'm afraid of being suspended a long time somewhere in memory ♬

203
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:53,670
♬ I'm afraid the more I try to wipe it out, the more I will be left yearning ♬

204
00:22:53,700 --> 00:23:04,200
♬ So I can't let you go  ♬

205
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:15,500
I missed you.
♬ Although you and I became tears for each other ♬

206
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:22,700
It's a face I've seen every day, but I missed you so much.

207
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:30,630
♬ when we just held each other and it was just like a dream ♬

208
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:38,380
♬ I remember that time then ♬

209
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:47,050
♬ The sad longing in a small window of my heart ♬

210
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:54,720
♬ colors you also in the dream ♬

211
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:03,750
Seriously!
♬ By myself I'm saying goodbye. If you even remove two letters ♬

212
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:12,190
♬ By myself I'm saying goodbye. If you even remove two letters ♬

213
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:20,770
♬ I am saying this is not a heart  ♬

214
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,500
There. It fits well here.

215
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:34,060
♬ Although you and I became tears for each other ♬

216
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:41,410
♬ After time passed on a bright day ♬

217
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:48,790
♬ when we just held each other and it was just like a dream ♬

218
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:57,130
♬ I remember that time then ♬

219
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,100
♬ Wiping my tears and holding my heart ♬

220
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,080
♬ There is only one person ♬

221
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:12,870
♬ Twelve months will pass and coming again like the seasons ♬

222
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:20,230
♬ You will return again to me ♬

223
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,880
Is she that happy to see me too?

224
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,210
I may make you uncomfortable over many things. However,

225
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:31,930
hold it in. We don't have any other solutions anyway.

226
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:36,340
Do you know why sacred bone is sacred bone?

227
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:46,730
Because we don't share with others.

228
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:50,720
Because the moment it is divided, it becomes weak.

229
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,300
You take exactly after your mother. You don't beat around the bush.

230
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:00,350
Although I don't know what the Queen Dowager thinks of you,

231
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:03,480
to me, the Hwarang is nothing but a tool.

232
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:10,970
To protect the royal family, they exist to kill or be killed.

233
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:17,220
We'll have to train the Hwarang's martial arts skills. Being this weak and feeble,

234
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,520
we can't call them Silla's warriors.

235
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,220
Ji In Bo is teaching the martial arts skills.

236
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:29,880
Besides something trivial like that, I'm talking about a fight that doesn't end until someone dies.

237
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,880
Where sides are taken and the strong overtake the weak. That's the kind of fight I'm talking about.

238
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,860
Wasn't that your original intent?

239
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,450
Sides are taken, things are taken, where the strong oppress the weak.

240
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:52,050
Tell them to try it all. So what if they kill each other.

241
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:58,060
If they don't kill each other now, they'll kill each other later anyway.

242
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:07,110
- Who is it?
- You knew from the beginning that there is a spy in the Seonmoon.

243
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:12,610
The Queen Dowager has raised you well, Princess.

244
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:18,810
Let's hold it 10 days from now. In the meantime, train them diligently.

245
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:23,420
If possible, so that no one dies.

246
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,110
Exactly where did you lose that?

247
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:38,830
- Shut up!
- Why don't you look harder. Do you know what kind of thing it is?

248
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:45,070
- What kind of thing is it?
- What? I told you it suits my taste.

249
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,920
I really liked it. Do you know how much I treasured it?

250
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:54,820
Ah, look at who's making a ruckus. You're really distracting, so shut your mouth. Aren't you busy? Hurry up and go!

251
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,490
You have to find it.

252
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:00,960
You're really coveting it, aren't you?

253
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,360
This is fun.

254
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:24,820
Oh!

255
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:31,950
Sheesh. You knew who had it all along. Why didn't you tell me? Huh? Why?

256
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,650
Suppose you knew. Would you have killed him and taken it back?

257
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:38,710
- I have to if it comes down to it!
- No.

258
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:43,680
- I owe him a debt.
- A debt? Your Maj...

259
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,910
Are you the someone who would owe a debt to someone?

260
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,480
You are the king of Silla.

261
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,200
Because of me, his friend died.

262
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:03,730
But... I like that guy. And I like his sister even more.

263
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:08,720
If you got it, quickly shut up and find it. Or find the guy who picked it up.

264
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,810
Where did you pick this up?

265
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,420
I picked it up in Seonmoon.

266
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,550
Hwarang?

267
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:34,000
Yes. I didn't think it was an ordinary object.

268
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,020
Who had this with them?

269
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,210
It was one of the Hwarang.

270
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,830
Who is that Hwarang?

271
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,100
It is Seon Woo. Ahn Ji Gong's son.

272
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:18,020
When South Buyeo's (Baekjae) alliance was shaken up,

273
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:21,650
this is a secret letter sent by the late king to the king.

274
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:49,170
The king's symbol came out of the Hwarang. And that's

275
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:53,090
Ahn Ji Gong's half-blooded son, right?

276
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,210
No!

277
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,250
People generally

278
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:37,610
say I'm a cruel mother without blood or tears.

279
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,710
Do you think like that as well?

280
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,570
It's possible you might.

281
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,250
I don't have anything to fear.

282
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,000
As long as I can protect the sacred bone.

283
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,680
Following in my father's footsteps,

284
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,990
if my son and his offspring

285
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,310
can continue the succession and have Silla,

286
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,980
there is nothing I cannot do.

287
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,760
Ahn Ji Gong's daughter...

288
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,060
I cannot lose everything because of her.

289
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,710
I will kill her.

290
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:39,410
It's not such a simple matter.

291
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,080
No one must know.

292
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,170
Not even that child.

293
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,000
She must not know why she has to die.

294
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:16,020
Princess Sook Myeong greets the Queen Dowager.

295
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,510
There is something you must do.

296
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,410
P-Princess.

297
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:50,130
Because I'm not an outstanding doctor,

298
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,120
I may not know everything about your illness, but

299
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,190
your kidneys are weak and a coldness surrounds your lungs.

300
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:59,850
It seems you were in convalescence for a long time.

301
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:05,770
I'm alright now. I've also built up my strength while learning martial arts.

302
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,930
I will give you medicine that will protect your body.

303
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:12,640
Rather than that,

304
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,820
I was hoping you'd be my personal doctor.

305
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,180
But I am Hwarang's...

306
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:26,120
That way, I think the Queen Dowager will also feel reassured that I am here.

307
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:32,970
I was looking for a way to save you. But...

308
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,920
I cannot find it.

309
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,450
Kill her.

310
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:51,900
There isn't much to it. When I call for you, you just have to come to my side.

311
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:59,510
Then I will leave knowing you accepted my request.

312
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,260
I also don't know what you think about the Queen Dowager.

313
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,330
To me, Hwarang is only a tool. In order to protect the Royal family,

314
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:38,410
they exist either to kill or be killed.

315
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:44,860
Let's do it 10 days from now. In the meantime, train them diligently.

316
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,630
If possible, so that no one dies.

317
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,520
She's exactly like young Ji So.

318
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,030
What are you thinking about?

319
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,460
You scared me!

320
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,800
Here, scorched rice.

321
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:19,370
Hey, if you're going to bring some to me, at least make it look appetizing.

322
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,000
You don't know what you're talking about.

323
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,980
You don't even know that eating it like this is the trend.

324
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,510
But...

325
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:35,560
The Princess was ordering this and that from you.

326
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,580
- What?
- A fight or something like that.

327
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:42,590
She even sent men to prepare for that.

328
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,800
She didn't tell you. She didn't tell you, right?

329
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:59,290
You better come to your senses, Poon Wol Joo.

330
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:03,720
You just don't get the Princess. I should switch my allegiance at this point.

331
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,740
Hey, do you want to be trampled with my power? Get out.

332
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:12,290
Anyway, it seems like everything revolves around the Princess.

333
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,550
Why do you have to try so hard to deny it? Sheesh.

334
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:20,140
Hey, Pi Juk, come here.

335
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,640
I have something to say.

336
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,970
Get out!

337
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,780
I really should change my allegiance, seriously.

338
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,600
What was that called? On the day of the banquet, where did you go?

339
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:36,160
Just...I was nearby.

340
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,220
There's no way since there isn't a place I wasn't looking.

341
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,550
It's the truth.

342
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:50,800
We must have passed each other. It figures, there were a lot of people that day.

343
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,520
It's possible for us to have passed by each other, right?

344
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,760
I will go.

345
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,940
Father?

346
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,300
What are you doing here?

347
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,490
I happened to be passing by.

348
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:21,250
I figured it would be about time for you to finish work.

349
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,720
This is the first time you've done this.

350
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,550
You didn't come to pick me up even when I was young.

351
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,780
So I was really sad about it.

352
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,190
Father is sorry.

353
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,100
I didn't say it to hear such things.

354
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,040
Let's go, Father.

355
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:50,320
It'd be nice if you came for me every day.

356
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:54,120
Then should I drop you off here as well?

357
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:58,230
Really? No, it's okay.

358
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:02,440
I wouldn't have a conscience if I kept Silla's most skilled doctor to myself.

359
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,790
It's enough that you came for me today.

360
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,850
Since she couldn't kill her this time, she will definitely make sure to kill your daughter next time.

361
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,900
No matter where she runs away within Silla,

362
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,790
she will not be able to escape Ji So.

363
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:37,850
Anyway, I warned you. Protect her, that child.

364
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,060
What's going on?

365
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:09,290
I don't think it's good.

366
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:15,380
Ten days from now, there will be sparring among the members of the Hwarang.

367
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:21,190
This time Princess Sook Myeong will personally be supervising the sparring.

368
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:25,470
Only the Hwarang who win by sword, archery, and horsemanship will pass.

369
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,220
Sparring?

370
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,650
The Princess is doing what?

371
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,340
She hasn't changed a bit.

372
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,950
This is different from previous assignments.

373
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:39,410
In this sparring, you can lose your life.

374
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:47,480
You must fight with your life on the line. If you are afraid of death,

375
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,640
you cannot protect your subordinates. Keep that in mind.

376
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,510
Sparring where one lays down his life.

377
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:16,290
Did you just say hunting?

378
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:21,420
If there's better training before the fight, please tell me.

379
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:27,400
But, I heard that the royal family prohibited the killing of animals.

380
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:33,540
If a soldier kills someone, is that considered killing an animal?

381
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,460
The Hwarang are soldiers.

382
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,890
To a soldier, it doesn't matter who the opponent is.

383
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,770
As long as I know whose side I'm on.

384
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:46,930
That's all that matters.

385
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:55,540
Right now, we will split into groups and train to hunt.

386
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,570
Hunting?

387
00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:02,410
You know full well that the most effective method to master archery and horsemanship is through hunting.

388
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:05,990
She looks pretty but in many ways, she is the tiring type.

389
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:10,130
You can catch a rabbit or a bird like a pheasant.

390
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:14,250
The person who catches a roe deer or a deer first is the winner.

391
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,190
I think I know...

392
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,360
where the Princess' heart lies.

393
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:35,770
If Sam Maek Jong is in the Hwarang...

394
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:38,450
How can I hunt you?

395
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,480
What can I do

396
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,910
so you will get caught on my fishing hook?

397
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,680
Jin Heung.

398
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,590
Is there something the matter with the Princess?

399
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:55,170
She went to go hunting but she hasn't been feeling well since yesterday. So I was worried.

400
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:57,090
Where and how?

401
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:01,030
She can't sleep, and starting in the early evening she says she has dizziness.

402
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:03,110
She also skipped her meal.

403
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:05,530
By any chance, will you be able to go?

404
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:07,640
Of course. I'll go.

405
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:11,880
It's the grass thicket behind Seonmoon. Go to the biggest fir tree.

406
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:05,690
How can she not resemble her mother, not one bit?

407
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:10,520
When the Queen Dowager is so warm.

408
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,210
What are you saying?

409
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,790
You don't know a real woman.

410
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:19,810
If there's something I realized after meeting all those women,

411
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:25,420
it's that a woman does not expose her heart to anyone so easily.

412
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:31,060
Queen Dowager is the best woman of women in the world.

413
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,790
What?

414
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:39,500
Forget it.

415
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:45,030
- You rascal with consistency.
- Isn't the first person to catch a deer the winner of the hunt?

416
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:49,730
If the Princess catches it first, we become idiots.

417
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:46,870
What the hell? She said the biggest tree...

418
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:49,470
Where is that?

419
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:15,010
Is it here?

420
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,750
Princess?

421
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:23,020
Princess, where are you?

422
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,410
You must get rid of Ah Ro.

423
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:29,620
Do it at Seonmoon without being seen so that no one knows.

424
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:34,840
Do you understand what I am saying?

425
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,580
Princess?

426
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,450
Princess?

427
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:49,470
Where are you, Princess?

428
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:20,500
I think this is the right place. Princess?

429
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,180
Ah Ro? Why is she here?

430
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:29,250
Where are you?

431
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:09,780
Orabeoni! Orabeoni!

432
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:12,440
Look here! Orabeoni!

433
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,030
Look here, is no one here?

434
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:18,350
I said is there no one here?

435
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:25,320
Orabeoni.

436
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,350
I'm okay.

437
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:36,530
Don't cry.

438
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,030
Are you okay?

439
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,530
Pull it.

440
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:56,090
Wh-Wh-What?

441
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:58,370
Pull it out.

442
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:37,000
What should we do? What should we do?

443
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:42,320
Bear it for a while. Bear it for a while.

444
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,800
Why did you do it?

445
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:11,680
You are disrespectful. Do you know who I am?

446
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,570
Why did you do it?

447
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:20,740
Never, never do this again.

448
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:23,270
If you do, I will not tolerate it.

449
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:30,210
The day you touch that child again, I will not let you off.

450
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:33,270
Do you understand?

451
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:08,520
♫ How far will I dream? ♫

452
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,120
Why...

453
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:14,340
Why did you get shot by the arrow instead of me?

454
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:21,430
I told you. This wound is nothing to me.

455
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:25,530
Then how much more do you have to get hurt to get a real wound?

456
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:33,240
Don't cry.
♫ One step at time as the distance increases ♫

457
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:37,240
It hurts me more to see you cry.

458
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:43,090
♫ While your love becomes more visible ♫

459
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:50,700
♫ How firmly will my heart hold on? ♫

460
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:55,300
♫ Will the pain be forgotten? ♫

461
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,770
Why did you come at this time?

462
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:00,100
I have something I have to say to you.

463
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:06,870
Protect Ah Ro.

464
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:13,570
Whatever happens, you must protect Ah Ro. I ask this of you.

465
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:17,310
♫ If there is a way I can take care of you ♫

466
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:26,430
♫ Anywhere is fine ♫

467
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:34,460
♫ Even if I am leaving far away,  ♫

468
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:40,380
♫  Don't cry so sorrowfully ♫

469
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,360
Why did you do that?

470
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:02,820
Never, never do this again.

471
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:08,860
The day you touch that child again, I will not let you off.

472
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:31,380
The place where the arrow hit, is it okay?

473
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,320
I'm sorry.

474
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,840
Why are you?

475
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:46,540
I'm asking why you are sorry.

476
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:54,840
Hwa Joong Jae Wang (There is a King Among Hwarang)

477
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:14,570
Hwa Joong Jae Wang.

478
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:17,320
That means what I am thinking, right?

479
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,520
There's a king among the Hwarang?

480
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,270
No way.

481
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:28,130
There's a king among us. Do you think that makes sense?

482
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:30,080
It's not impossible, I guess.

483
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,320
Move!

484
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,030
Hwa Joong Jae Wang.

485
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:06,530
If this is a joke, I will let it slide once, but

486
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,930
if this was done with a motive,

487
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:15,430
I will not forgive it a second time.

488
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,680
Do you understand?

489
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,060
Yes.

490
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:26,220
Since there's nothing more to see here, go back! Quickly!

491
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:32,910
Let's go.

492
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:33,270
♫ Don't leave me. Don't leave me ♫
