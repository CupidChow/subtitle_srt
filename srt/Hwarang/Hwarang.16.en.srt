1
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,910
Let me take a look.
Episode 16

2
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,200
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,560
For avoiding you.

4
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,680
I know you did that

5
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,380
to protect me.

6
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,040
I thought I was going to die

7
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,520
holding back my desire to run to you.

8
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,700
♫ One step at time as the distance increases ♫

9
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,970
I'm not really sure what to say

10
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,520
in this kind of situation.

11
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:16,280
♫  How much I held onto you with my heart  ♫

12
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,640
♫  Will it have to hurt to forget?  ♫

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,640
I love you.

14
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,300
♫  Don't worry about me anymore  ♫

15
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,040
I love you.

16
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:36,250
♬ Only you can let go of this hand ♬

17
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:43,060
♬ If it's the path that is best for you ♬

18
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:51,340
♬ Wherever that may be, it's alright ♬

19
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:00,290
♬ Even if I go far away ♬

20
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:06,680
♬ Don't cry too sadly ♬

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,910
I am...Silla's King!

22
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,170
The King!

23
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,110
What do you mean by asking a bachelor to take care of a child?

24
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,370
You were a bachelor?

25
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,840
A pure one! From head to toe!

26
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,120
A completely innocent bachelor!

27
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,900
I didn't know you were in that situation.

28
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,790
In any case, please look after her.

29
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,280
Hey, what's with you?

30
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:44,410
By doing this, do you think someone will take care of...

31
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,110
you?

32
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,470
Don't you think the world is really beautiful so far?

33
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,700
Where?

34
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:20,350
The world is drab and depressing.

35
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,020
I don't know why I'm living.

36
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,300
- Gosh, I'm so frustrated!
- What a scare you gave me.

37
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,980
Hey, your brother and Ban Ryu returned safely. What's wrong?

38
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,220
After returning from South Buyeo, Ban Ryu hasn't sent any word.

39
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,250
This means he's changed his mind, right?

40
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,010
Tell me the truth. Didn't he meet another girl in South Buyeo?

41
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,030
Hey, we didn't have that kind of time to spare.

42
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,780
Then why is he acting like this towards me?

43
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,880
By all means, a relationship between a man and a woman

44
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,090
has its good times and bad.

45
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,360
Sometimes the sun shines, sometimes it rains.

46
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,950
That's what it's about.

47
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,690
Trust this unni and wait a little while. Everything will be okay.

48
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,490
Really?

49
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,940
Are you not listening to Yeong Sil Gong?

50
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,050
- Or are you unable to hear him?
- Get lost.

51
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:44,170
This has never happened to me before, but right now, I feel sorry for you.

52
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,330
What are you talking about?

53
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,220
Take a look. I'm also curious.

54
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,510
No Yi Moo Gong.

55
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,730
Although you worked hard, it was all in vain.

56
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,080
Doesn't it seem like your father has abandoned you?

57
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,520
Shut up.

58
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:25,210
You're finished. Yeong Sil Gong no longer has

59
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,020
any expectation from you now.

60
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,290
l told you to shut up!

61
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,810
Our Ban Ryu, this is the first time seeing such a facial expression.

62
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,030
You're totally scared.

63
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,190
Doctor Ah Ro!

64
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,080
How are you feeling?

65
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,020
Thanks to you.

66
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,150
Come in, I'll take a look at your wound.

67
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,870
Are weeds raw vegetables?

68
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,600
That tactless rascal!

69
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,930
This.

70
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,950
It's the arrow that was stuck in your shoulder.

71
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,830
Wow, that one really hurt.

72
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,850
I heard you got hit in place of my brother.

73
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:54,550
Well, I only did what I had to.

74
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,470
Even though you're his friend, I'd rather you had not.

75
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,020
Thank you.

76
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,730
I didn't know the arrow... would hurt...that much.

77
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:15,120
By the way, have we really never dated before?

78
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,590
No, we haven't.

79
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,750
That's strange. I thought I had dated all of Soo Yeon's friends.

80
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,180
Well, even though you're not my type,

81
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,140
you wouldn't make a bad date.

82
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,050
I'm here.

83
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,110
You came... (switching to formal language)

84
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,950
How are you feeling?

85
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,380
I'm...alright. (formal speech)

86
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,450
What's wrong with your speech?

87
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,310
Me?  (Back to informal)

88
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,120
What?

89
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,680
Here, let me have a look.

90
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,100
Does it somehow feel more painful than before?

91
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,720
The doctor is doing a good job. Why are you being a crybaby?

92
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,290
My stamina must have weakened.

93
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,590
Should I exercise more?

94
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:49,420
♬ When the path was more than I could bear ♬

95
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:56,350
♬ You were there. Like a dream ♬

96
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,930
♬ then another world ♬

97
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,920
Thanks.

98
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,820
♬  which I came to know ♬

99
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,680
For what?

100
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,930
This and that.

101
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:16,820
♬ became a light in your breath ♬

102
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,970
♬ I'm fine with you as the only one ♬

103
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,600
♬ I will find the star ♬

104
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,870
Now I feel like we're finally back.

105
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,100
- Then did you think we weren't going to return?
- No.

106
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,900
The truth is...

107
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,710
I thought everything would be okay if you were safe.

108
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,760
There is someone who would put their life on the line for me.

109
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:56,250
I'm happy because there's someone who cherishes me this much.

110
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,580
Even if I died now, I wouldn't have any regrets.

111
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:08,210
So, please stay safe. I had that kind of thought.

112
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,870
If you die, then so do I.

113
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,950
If you're not okay, then I'm not okay either.

114
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:32,860
No matter what situation arises, I will always put you first.

115
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,250
So if you really want to help me,

116
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,040
think about yourself first.

117
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,550
Promise me.

118
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,430
You're a good girl. You are.

119
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,380
But you don't seem like such a kind brother.

120
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,430
You're right. I'm not kind.

121
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,100
What are you doing, kid?

122
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,620
Those two aren't siblings anymore, right?

123
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,880
What are you talking about?

124
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,150
Since when have you been so kind?

125
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:46,100
He's like that because he learned how to treat a sister from Soo Ho.

126
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,580
But they're not siblings.

127
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,360
Wait, if Seon Woo is the King,

128
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,890
they're not siblings.

129
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,640
Is that how it works?

130
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,930
Then what are those two?

131
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,920
What should we do?

132
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,010
Wait! Wait! There's something in your eye...

133
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,800
Ahn Ji Gong's son revealed himself as the King.

134
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,730
He risked his life and fought.

135
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,800
He rescued the citizens and returned, right?

136
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,230
What do you think of that Hwarang?

137
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,240
It's not important what I think about him.

138
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,730
I'm going to decide whether it's important or not.

139
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:26,510
He is righteous and has no fear.

140
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:30,530
He seems to have great leadership.

141
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:35,820
By chance, are you keeping him close to your heart?

142
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,170
Of course not.

143
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,090
You take after me too much.

144
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,840
That makes me nervous.

145
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,750
Before the Hwarang, there were the Won Hwa, two appointed heads of a society of maidens chosen for beauty and filial piety.

146
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,980
The Hwarang has become too strong.

147
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,540
The citizens praise the Hwarang and follow them.

148
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,010
So I can no longer hold the Hwarang in my hands.

149
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,890
So,

150
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,870
I'm planning to make you a Won Hwa.

151
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,370
Do you know what kind of fate the Won Hwa

152
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,180
faced?

153
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:31,460
Both Won Hwa faced death.

154
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,340
You aren't afraid?

155
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:38,370
Since I'm very much like you, Mother.

156
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,400
The subject you are learning about today is the Book of Odes.

157
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:13,800
The Book of Odes is the songs of the people which have been passed down by word of mouth from a long time ago.

158
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,700
Inside are the lamentations of the people's difficult lives

159
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,520
yet positive images.

160
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:27,480
In addition, there is also resentment and pity for the powerless King.

161
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,360
Today, I'm going to show you a poem.

162
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,410
The title is 'Large Rat.'

163
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,250
Who would like to read it?

164
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:53,180
Ji Dwi, try reading it.

165
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:08,090
"Rat, rat, large rat. Don't eat my barley."

166
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:14,500
"I took care of you for a long time, you aren't looking after me."

167
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,460
"Surely, I will leave you"

168
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,730
"and leave to go to that happy nation."

169
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,330
"Happy place, happy place."

170
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,230
"I will find a way to justify myself there."

171
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,890
Here, the rat symbolizes the ruler.

172
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:48,550
In this poem, the King doesn't take care of his people. He's hiding and eating the grain.

173
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,480
Just like someone.

174
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,890
If a big rat eats the people's livelihood, all those people will leave.

175
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,600
A king without his people is no longer a king.

176
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:10,330
- Do you understand the meaning of this poem?
- Yes!

177
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,340
What brings you, the chief guard, here?

178
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:27,770
The Queen Dowager wishes to recognize the distinguished service of the delegation that went to South Buyeo.

179
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,560
Only the delegation?

180
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,970
Yes, that's right.

181
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,140
Then what about me?

182
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,540
I was the one who sent, organized, and returned with the Hwarang.

183
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,990
Does she not know that?

184
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,990
If she doesn't, then I can't do anything about it.

185
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,790
I got it, so you can leave.

186
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,390
There is no one who can withstand an epidemic.

187
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:01,200
In a situation where they're already starving, we can't even obtain medicine.

188
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,630
You should go back.

189
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,160
If you stay here without medicine, you'll also get infected.

190
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,360
Earlier, you told me that there is a way to get medicine.

191
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,000
Where is it?

192
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,490
Even if you are going to get the medicine,

193
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,030
I don't know if you will be able to bring it here.

194
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,390
What do you mean by that?

195
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:33,300
A Cheonin (lowest class in Silla) from the village must not climb over the castle gate.

196
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,960
Do you know why that law exists?

197
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,670
That's because they want to maintain the bone rank system and prevent Cheonin from entering the capital.

198
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,990
You're so naive.

199
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,120
This is Silla's source for gold.

200
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,730
The gold that is stacked up in the royal family and Park Yeong Sil's storage

201
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,330
all comes from here.

202
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,460
People work all day with their backs bent over looking for gold sediment.

203
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:02,000
If they want it in its entirety, the Cheonin must not know

204
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,760
the tremendous worth of that gold.

205
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,090
Then,

206
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:12,500
in order to get gold, they're keeping this place isolated on purpose?

207
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,610
It isn't gold, but power.

208
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,990
In another word, it's also the military.

209
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,510
In the future, it's Silla's supremacy.

210
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:28,010
Just go back. Nothing will be solved by staying here.

211
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,650
Or,

212
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,460
by whatever means,

213
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,150
you can obtain the medicine.

214
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:51,040
I mean, why must I also go?

215
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,010
Seon Woo, please enter the palace.

216
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,790
Before the Hwarang, there were two Won Hwa. (Groups of youth who maintained manners and order in society while training in the martial arts)

217
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,520
Nam Mo and Joon Jeong. The two Won Hwa led the Nangdoo.

218
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:35,380
I heard that your sister comforted the citizens well in South Buyeo.

219
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,170
So,

220
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:42,020
I'm planning to keep your sister beside me as a Won Hwa.

221
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:50,290
Am I not enough?

222
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:54,040
I'm taking advantage of her because I want to use you properly,

223
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,570
because she has the power to move you.

224
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,940
If you declared yourself to be King, continue acting like one.

225
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:08,930
That's what being a monarch is about. You must fool the world, the citizens,

226
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,830
and yourself.

227
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,100
If it means protecting Silla's prince, I am capable of doing anything.

228
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,700
As long as my son can ascend the throne, I'm not afraid of anything.

229
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,250
I am prepared to fool you, my son,

230
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,420
and also the entire world.

231
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,530
So, you do the same

232
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:32,460
if you don't want to lose your sister.

233
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,140
Why isn't he coming? Did something happen?

234
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:51,380
Since you saw him after a long time, I'm sure you have lots of things to say.

235
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,760
I told you it isn't that kind of atmosphere.

236
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:03,960
What's with you having that expression all day? Is something wrong?

237
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,530
- Mind your own business.
- You're being abrasive again.

238
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,950
But where is Ji...

239
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,500
Ji...Ji Dwi. Where did he go?

240
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,020
It's been quite a while for someone to use the outhouse.

241
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,600
How did you come to this place?

242
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,360
This place isn't even well known by the court ladies.

243
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,400
I lost my way.

244
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,440
This is not a place you can get lost in.

245
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,060
Unless you searched for it on purpose.

246
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,490
How would I know the capital?

247
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,200
Seeing that I have difficulty finding the palace outhouse, I just ended up here.

248
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,880
- Then, if you'll excuse me.
- Orabeoni!

249
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,110
You're His Majesty, aren't you?

250
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,710
You're mistaken, Princess.

251
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:55,280
Stop!

252
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,960
Why didn't I recognize you?

253
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,400
How long have you lived like this?

254
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,950
The amount of time is something you can't imagine.

255
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,820
Does it make sense that we came all the way over here and can't even see Her Majesty, the Queen Dowager?

256
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,300
It's Her Majesty, the Queen Dowager.

257
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,620
Are you safe?

258
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:05,020
Are you hurt anywhere?

259
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:09,020
I'm safe, for now.

260
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,480
The more you disobey my commands,

261
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,250
don't you know that things will only become more difficult for you?

262
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,590
I think she saw me. I should go and greet her.

263
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:31,180
That I, Kim Soo Ho, came back alive from South Buyeo.

264
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,740
Why don't we just go.

265
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,170
Your Highness.

266
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,180
You dropped this.

267
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:58,320
Hwarang Kim Soo Ho, upholds Your Highness' command.

268
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,840
I came back safely from South Buyeo.

269
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,720
Please take good care of Seon Woo, Soo Ho.

270
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:38,120
Everyone knows you as the King. I will use you as bait.

271
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,630
You will face the danger that my son has to face.

272
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:46,370
So endure it. If you can survive, do so.

273
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,380
I also hope that you will endure it.

274
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:54,060
That way, I and my son will be able to buy some time.

275
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,790
Exactly what did he talk about with Her Highness, the Queen Dowager?

276
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:25,250
Is it because he said he was the King?

277
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,160
Where on earth is he?

278
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,150
No Yi Moo Gong.

279
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:42,860
Although you worked hard, it was all in vain.

280
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,390
Why didn't I recognize you?

281
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,700
How long have you lived like this?

282
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:31,560
The next time we meet again, at that time,

283
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,500
let's end the hunt. Jin Heung.

284
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,600
What are you thinking about?

285
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,830
It's nothing.

286
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:53,550
"Now this Seonmoon won't be the same as before." Well, something to that effect.

287
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,370
What do you mean?

288
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:03,120
I better go do some fishing because I have things to think about. Here.

289
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,080
Ban Ryu.

290
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:25,290
It's me, Soo Yeon.

291
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,820
♬ went out and searched for the small dream♬

292
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:32,620
I waited for a long time after hearing that you returned safely.

293
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:39,110
I mean, I'm not saying that I resented you, but I thought that at least I should come.

294
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:46,440
From now on, don't like a guy like me.

295
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,270
♫  Like a dream then another world which I came to know ♬

296
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,810
Ban Ryu...

297
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:55,730
I'm not going to see you again.

298
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,860
Ban Ryu!

299
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,270
♬ and even a shard of my crushed heart ♬

300
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,950
Ban Ryu!

301
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,780
♬ became a light ♬

302
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,020
Ban Ryu!

303
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,120
♫  in your breath  ♫

304
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,660
Who's doing what?

305
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,870
What are you doing?

306
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,610
I did wrong.

307
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,510
Is this the answer to "No Yi Moo Gong"?

308
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:34,750
Please don't abandon me.

309
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:38,970
Once more... Please give me one more chance, Father.

310
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:45,270
I thought of you as a king, but now I've changed my mind.

311
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:51,070
I'll have to become king. I can't trust others.

312
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,910
Then, I will help you.

313
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,210
Are you saying that you will help me become king?

314
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,500
Yes. I will do that.

315
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:10,690
Even if I have to grind my bones, I will definitely help.

316
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,970
Are you sure that you will definitely help?

317
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,810
Am I saying I'm the King? The King.

318
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:47,710
Sheesh. Wine tastes the best before it cools. I guess you don't know how to enjoy it yet.

319
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,380
I don't think I ever told you to sit.

320
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:56,610
There's no better friend than a drinking buddy.

321
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:03,060
It turns out that I'm alone, and I want to drink with a young fellow like you. Can't I do that?

322
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,860
Please get lost.

323
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:13,400
From what I heard, you are the King. You beat Baekje's Crown Prince Chang to a pulp.

324
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,480
Is that true?

325
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:22,970
The citizens are joyful because the King showed up among the Hwarang. They're saying the world will change.

326
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:28,030
However, if you don't turn out to be the real king,

327
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,390
the disappointment will also be great.

328
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,820
If you have the power to change the world,

329
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:45,870
don't you have any thoughts of becoming the real king?

330
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,550
I could make you into one.

331
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:07,870
There's a long way to go until the sun will rise.

332
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:16,270
It seems what I'm trying to catch is on the hook.

333
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:34,450
That kind of king cannot become king.

334
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,680
What about the people? What will happen to the people that are here?

335
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,630
They will pay for their sins with their death.

336
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,640
What nonsense is that?!

337
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:09,550
I am..the King!

338
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:16,570
I am...Silla's King!

339
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,360
Who is this?

340
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,870
Isn't he a rat?

341
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,260
I'm talking about the large rat who couldn't open his mouth

342
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:41,610
to say "I'm the King!" in front of the enemy's crown prince.

343
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,440
That's right.

344
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:52,860
I have no qualification to be a king. I'm scared that I will get caught or someone will recognize me.

345
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:57,220
It's bad enough that I've been trembling in fear and living in hiding all my life.

346
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,820
Even when the enemy nation's crown prince asked who the King is,

347
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,510
I couldn't come forward.

348
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:09,520
I'm only a coward. I'm always hiding, and ready to hide my face.

349
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,700
That kind of coward.

350
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:16,600
I don't know if my words will help,

351
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,270
but there are many cowardly kings in the world.

352
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:24,620
But there aren't many kings who would call themselves a coward.

353
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,930
Because calling yourself a coward is another act of bravery.

354
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:34,920
Could a person like that really become a king?

355
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:43,240
Your Majesty, you must deal with it.

356
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,550
Whatever it is,

357
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:51,940
whether it's a high place, a low place, a dirty place, a beautiful place, a dangerous place, or a dark place.

358
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,950
if there is something you must do as a KingI

359
00:36:54,950 --> 00:37:00,260
I'm telling you that you should take charge of it all.

360
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,370
This is my answer.

361
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:13,820
♫ You were so far away ♫

362
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:18,620
♫ Without being able to see you I ♫

363
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:23,530
♫ I have never once dreamed ♫

364
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:29,720
♫ You would be the person in front of me ♫

365
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:34,600
♫ Don't get hurt ♫

366
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,220
♫ Don't come any closer ♫

367
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:43,430
♫ My frozen heart ♫

368
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:47,550
If you have the power to change the world, if that is the right thing to do,

369
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,750
is there any reason to hesitate?

370
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:55,600
Are you going to go over the castle wall and lose another friend?

371
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,560
♫ In my two red eyes I boxed you up ♫

372
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,900
♫ I want to go back again to turn back the clock ♫

373
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,070
♫  to when it was beautiful ♫

374
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:13,160
Ahn Ji Gong, what are you doing here?

375
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,390
I heard there is a cornering and hoarding of the plague medicine.

376
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:22,570
Who said nonsense like that? Do you think that's true?

377
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:26,170
Please donate the white peony, the star anise, fennel, ginseng and the rest of the medicinal herbs.

378
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,530
Even if I have that kind of medicine,

379
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:33,300
do you think I could give it to you for free?

380
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,520
I'm not here as a merchant.

381
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,350
After practicing medicine all of my life, as a doctor who has never received payment,

382
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:46,550
I am sitting in front of you, the Gakgan, who has the duty to take care of the Silla people.

383
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:51,820
If we can't stop the plague from spreading in the Cheonin village, the capital will not be safe.

384
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:55,310
Wait a little longer.

385
00:38:55,850 --> 00:39:02,510
It seems that the people's fear isn't great enough to spend their entire fortune to buy medicine yet.

386
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,620
Once the plague spreads a bit more,

387
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,860
then I will distribute some of the medicine.

388
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,880
In order to raise the price of the medicine,

389
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,450
are you saying now that you will allow the plague to spread?

390
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:27,870
Just wait three more days,

391
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:31,650
and if there isn't an increase, then wait for seven more days.

392
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:35,340
And if there still isn't much happening, then ten days.

393
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:42,320
People don't die that easily.

394
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:16,510
Is the man who just left the one who fooled everyone into thinking his son is Sam Maek Jong and made him into a Hwarang?

395
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,800
The people's unrest is extraordinary.

396
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,940
At this rate, we might be left helplessly watching Jin Heung ascend the throne.

397
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:29,730
It figures that you must be anxious.

398
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:33,580
How many of the true bone are left in the Seok family?

399
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:41,290
Would there be a true bone who would propose marriage to a family that is diminishing day by day?

400
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,340
Just keep your promise.

401
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,040
If things work out well, you must adopt our family

402
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,580
through marriage.

403
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:54,430
As long as things work out, what would be difficult?

404
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:23,320
Nine hundred ninety one. If you do nine more, it will be 1000.

405
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,480
What kind of nonsense is this?

406
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,350
It's unfair. You have great swordsmanship

407
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:33,580
and I don't even like this kind of stuff!

408
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,490
What does fair mean to you?

409
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:48,830
It's 1000 times. If you can't win one match, then I'm going to leave the household for good.

410
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,640
Ah, what... What do you want me to do?

411
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,790
Don't whine. You promised as a man.

412
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,410
Later on, don't say otherwise.

413
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,150
Do it again.

414
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,600
Why do you think Ji So wants to see me?

415
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,430
Perhaps she wants to make a fuss over the bribe you gave to Crown Prince Chang?

416
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,410
What do you mean by bribe?

417
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:03,650
The friendship between South Buyeo's royal family and the Park family extends over 100 years.

418
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:07,530
Between friends, how could a bribe be possible?

419
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,030
I apologize.

420
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,710
What did you just say?

421
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:19,800
I said I will step down from my regency.

422
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,180
Abdicating at this time, why all of a sudden?

423
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:27,990
You always told me to step down from the regency. You don't seem to be welcoming it.

424
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:31,580
What is she planning this time?

425
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:35,700
You must have heard that Jin Heung beat South Buyeo's Crown Prince Chang.

426
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,470
He returned after achieving such a meritorious deed.

427
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:41,920
There is no reason for me to stay in this position any longer.

428
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,370
It's finished, Gakgan. I won and you lost.

429
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:51,120
The young King slowly got stronger without his mother and returned.

430
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,840
Didn't you also see His Majesty's bravery?

431
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,470
The royal family will become stronger now.

432
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:05,700
I'm saying that there is nothing else for you to do.

433
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:18,410
If Sam Maek Jong ascends the throne now, all of your plans will vanish into thin air.

434
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:22,520
Who knew Ji So would make that move?

435
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:27,880
Even though you abdicate, it will be too difficult for His Majesty Jin Heung

436
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,920
to manage political affairs immediately.

437
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,320
Abdication?

438
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,570
There will be no such thing as an abdication.

439
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:41,830
This time, we must make Park Yeong Sil believe Seon Woo is Sam Maek Jong.

440
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:45,800
- That way, no one will suspect Sam Maek Jong again.
- Then...?

441
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:50,000
Sam Maek Jong is only a child. If he ascends the throne now, what can he do?

442
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,080
However, will Ahn Ji Gong's son just stand idly by?

443
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,810
Don't you know full well what type of person he is?

444
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,020
No.

445
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,990
He will not be able to refuse.

446
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:10,990
If I tell him not to make any noise breathing, he will not.

447
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:16,040
Because I'm in control of his lifeline.

448
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,780
Are you feeling alright?

449
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,160
Yeah, I'm fine.

450
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,720
I just have body aches from overworking myself for a few days.

451
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:54,110
By the way, if you can't obtain the medicine,

452
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:57,520
then what will happen to the people there?

453
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,240
I will have to get it, no matter what.

454
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,310
It's a relief that you came back safely.

455
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,750
I was very worried.

456
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:17,910
Father.

457
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:21,800
I am worried about Orabeoni.

458
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:27,170
After saying that he's the King in order to save me,

459
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:31,160
there's a misunderstanding that he's His Majesty, King Jin Heung.

460
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:37,850
It seems that through that incident, he incurred the wrath of the Queen Dowager.

461
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:42,670
He didn't come home during his day off. I'm really worried.

462
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:07,940
What are you doing here?

463
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,290
Then what about you?

464
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:11,480
Because I have nowhere to go.

465
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:14,290
Me too.

466
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,320
I'm more handsome than you thought, right?

467
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,200
For a King.

468
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:25,600
Everyone is saying that you're the King,

469
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,090
but I figured that you're the only one who still thinks I'm the King.

470
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:35,040
Did you live like this all your life?

471
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:43,550
That King. Worrying if someone will harm him,

472
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:48,890
or if the people around him will get hurt. So anxious that he can't fall asleep.

473
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,930
I feel that way.

474
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:54,500
That must not be all.

475
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,430
If it's not all, then what?

476
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:59,360
How can he turn the world upside down?

477
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,220
Can only the King live comfortably?

478
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,490
Would he think those things as well?

479
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,640
There's no way a king who was never treated like one would think that way.

480
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:14,780
That King

481
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,490
knows how the subjects feel?

482
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:20,110
It's not that he knows the subjects...

483
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,460
He must have lived like one.

484
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:33,560
I heard that the King who is like a subject kills anyone who sees his face.

485
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:37,210
That's right.

486
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,320
He probably does.

487
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,470
Whether they found out later,

488
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:50,470
there must have been times when people didn't know and passed by him.

489
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:56,320
But overall, he probably didn't know people died because of him.

490
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,200
He's stupid,

491
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,310
foolish,

492
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:08,060
and he doesn't have the strength...to tell them to stop the killings.

493
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:10,680
Then what can the King do?

494
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,930
Can he change the world?

495
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:16,550
Why does he still have to be alive?

496
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,010
I said why does he have to stay alive?!

497
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:25,490
Do you want to kill him?

498
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:28,420
Then kill him.

499
00:49:55,290 --> 00:50:00,250
Didn't you miss me? I missed you a lot.

500
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,300
My apologies. I thought you were my brother.

501
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:15,240
What brings you here?

502
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,910
I have something I must ask you.

503
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,970
Because I really like you,

504
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:27,470
if we build a farm together, have a baby,

505
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:31,230
and want to live as ordinary citizens,

506
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:38,320
would you want to live with me?

507
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:43,830
I can't do anything for you. I have no treasures or silver coins that you like.

508
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:48,550
There is a chance that we will not have a proper house. However,

509
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:57,010
I'm telling you that I would exchange Silla's throne

510
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:59,450
for you.

511
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,800
Will you go with me? No, let's go.

512
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:18,800
It's okay if that guy is not your brother. Even if you liked him, that's fine. However.

513
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,790
Now, come to me.

514
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:31,440
Because I'll live not as anyone's king, but as your Jin Heung.

515
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,180
♬ Like the brilliant day ♬

516
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:39,570
♬ like when the moonlight lit the space between you and me♬

517
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:43,350
Are you using me as an excuse to run away?

518
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,770
♬ So that all our moments won't disappear♬

519
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:50,870
Your Majesty lived while asking yourself over and over

520
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:55,670
why you have to be the King.

521
00:51:55,670 --> 00:52:02,800
It's because you knew very well why you have to be King, and what you need to do as King,

522
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,900
that you have overcame hardships, tiredness, and fear.

523
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,570
What do you know?

524
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:13,920
If you look into the eyes of someone

525
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,720
who has given up, then you know.

526
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,170
Your Majesty has never given up.

527
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:26,380
♬ somehow I keep being afraid ♬

528
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:33,580
♬ I'm afraid my place will be empty, ♬

529
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:37,930
♬ when standing in front of you ♬

530
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:41,480
♬ Even if my eyes are closed and ♬

531
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,800
♬  if I bring and am filled with you ♬

532
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,770
♬ Because I really can't leave ♬

533
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:37,970
Your Majesty, you have lived too long.

534
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,830
Towards the pond.

535
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:23,360
If you make a noise, your head will go flying off.

536
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,590
- Who are you?
- Me?

537
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:32,160
The real owner of the bracelet. The person you've been looking for.

538
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,370
The faceless King.

539
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:39,870
I thought the King was Ahn Ji Gong's son.

540
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:43,360
No. It's me.

541
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:49,350
I'm your Lord, Jin Heung.

542
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,430
By chance, are you here to kill the King?

543
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:18,910
Attack!

544
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:29,550
Are you okay?

545
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,300
This is Seonmoon where Silla's Hwarang are staying.

546
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,690
How dare you step foot in here so fearlessly?

547
00:56:52,500 --> 00:57:00,010
Poong Wol Joo! Poong Wol Joo! Poong Wol Joo!

548
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:01,620
Aigo, what?!

549
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:02,630
There's big trouble!

550
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:04,460
Ah, what is it, Bu Jae?

551
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:06,740
There's big trouble!

552
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:16,000
There's no need for this. The one they want is me!

553
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:21,120
What are you talking about? If they entered this place, they came to attack us!

554
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:46,210
Dog-Bird!

555
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,140
Protect Seon Woo.

556
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:17,070
♫ A slight sprinkle is falling. Black tears cover me  ♫

557
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:22,190
♫ In my two red eyes, I boxed you up  ♫

558
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,920
♫ I want to go back again  ♫
