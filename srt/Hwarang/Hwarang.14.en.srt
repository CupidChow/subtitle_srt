1
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,750
Go inside.

2
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,940
But still...

3
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,390
Stay inside.

4
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,560
What are they? A new type of assassin?

5
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,720
I don't know what they are, but there are a lot of them.

6
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,760
Episode 14

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,220
Outside, there's a group of robbers...

8
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,960
It's dangerous. Stay here and don't go out.

9
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,470
- What do they want?
- What do you think?

10
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:29,120
Including our lives, they're ready to take everything of value.

11
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,820
It's towards the carriage.

12
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,710
They're gifts we're going to take to the Crown Prince in South Buyeo.

13
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,400
We can't stand idly by and let them take everything.

14
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,270
- What are you doing?!
- They don't even have proper weapons.

15
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,830
We can't harm them.

16
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,890
During the day, they starve. At night, they're robbers.

17
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,790
Are you in your right mind? We're about to lose all the gifts meant for South Buyeo!

18
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,750
Still, we can't kill them.

19
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,330
You're just going to send them off like this?

20
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,150
What are you?

21
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,500
Through this incident, if the Queen Dowager or His Majesty face danger,

22
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,160
I don't think I'll be able to leave you alone.

23
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,800
Even after seeing how the people live, are you siding with the King?

24
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,360
- What?
- An incompetent, foolish, and fearful king?

25
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,650
You really!

26
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,430
Stop it.

27
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,260
Did they come knowing we'd pass by?

28
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,960
They seem like local robbers.

29
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,450
They're just farmers.

30
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,980
Farmers?

31
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,580
People who had farms near the borders starved and became robbers.

32
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,240
Are you saying that ordinary people become robbers?

33
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,330
So, the peace offerings prepared for the royal family in South Buyeo,

34
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,450
and our travel expenses, have all been taken?

35
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,520
I apologize. I'll chase them down now and find them.

36
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,770
It's no use. They can hardly make ends meet.

37
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,860
They've probably already sold it all over the place by now.

38
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,600
If it wasn't for you, this would not have happened.

39
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,210
Why did you go that far?

40
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,750
They're lowly peasants that have nothing to do with you.

41
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,630
What's the reason for going that far to save their lives?

42
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,590
You said they're ordinary farmers.

43
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,630
You said they were the subjects.

44
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,450
Within Silla there isn't a subject who can die for no reason.

45
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,160
I won't return to the capital.

46
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,960
However, you said we're going to make peace. We can't go empty handed.

47
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,940
Since we also lost all our food, going in this state would be difficult.

48
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,480
In three days, it will be the King's birthday.

49
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,900
Because Crown Prince Chang of South Buyeo is hostile,

50
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,880
he could use that day as an excuse to attack Silla.

51
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,960
Before that happens, we must stop him.

52
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,310
Hurry up with the preparations.

53
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,900
I will become strong in the Hwarang. Mother.

54
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,600
Why are you standing there like that instead of coming to take my pulse?

55
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:17,460
I came to tell you that I can no longer take your pulse.

56
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,260
Why?

57
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,950
There's a plague in Cheonin village.

58
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,800
- I must go to treat them.
- Send another doctor.

59
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,890
Does it make sense that you won't treat me because of mere Cheonins? (lowest class in Silla)

60
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:36,530
No. Why don't you let the palace doctor take your pulse from now on.

61
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,720
I can't trust other doctors.

62
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,260
Didn't I tell you?

63
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,360
It's a matter that doesn't involve me.

64
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,100
Do you dare to disobey the Queen Dowager's command?
- So,

65
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,270
are you going to kill me as well?

66
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,690
- You resent me as usual.
- Resentment can only occur when there is something to look forward to.

67
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,730
I do not expect anything from Your Highness. Except,

68
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,260
that I no longer wish to see you anymore.

69
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,830
You can't do this to me now.

70
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,840
Right now...

71
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,780
If you also leave me,

72
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,380
I don't have anyone.

73
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,490
It seems you are mistaken about something.

74
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,030
I'm not leaving you.

75
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,430
Since I've never returned to Your Highness.

76
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,000
Once, there was a time when my world would come crashing down with one word from you. However,

77
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,040
now, even with your tears,

78
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,270
I am so cold.

79
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,190
It seems like we'll have to sleep outdoors today.

80
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,500
You want us to sleep here? When the Princess is also here?

81
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,880
There is no inn in the vicinity. We don't even have silver coins to use.

82
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:36,610
You two bring some firewood. I'll set up something so we can spend the night here.

83
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,590
- Officer, sir.
- Yes.

84
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,500
Please go and obtain some food.

85
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,450
Yes, I will.

86
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,960
- Who are you to order people around?
- Do you have any other idea?

87
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,300
If you don't, follow me.

88
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,540
About the time you kissed me without my permission.

89
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,370
Until I bring that up,

90
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,600
what should I do?

91
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,590
Apologize or confess?

92
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,560
Apologize.

93
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,610
Aigoo! It's young and fresh.

94
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,990
But then, Lady Doctor you're mean.

95
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,120
You should accept him. He's a palace guard about to go to war.

96
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,970
- How can you reject him?
- But,

97
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,980
what do that woman and that palace guard look like?

98
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,670
Do they look like that beautiful lady and that noble over there?

99
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:05,310
I saw the noble but the woman is here.

100
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:13,750
I'm being serious. She looks a lot like me. She looks like me.

101
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,500
Right here.

102
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,370
Whoa.

103
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,650
Give it to me.

104
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,380
Carry it.

105
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,630
You're so clumsy. How could you miss that?

106
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,520
What did you just say?

107
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,690
♬ When the path on which I fearlessly ♬

108
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,530
- You want us to have a go?
- Yes. I want us to have a go.

109
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:24,110
♬ You were there. Like a dream ♬

110
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,710
♬ then another world which I came to know ♬

111
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:33,470
- Don't regret it.
- I'm Kim Soo Ho. What do you mean by regret?

112
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:40,550
♬ became a light in your breath.♬

113
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:50,220
♬ I'm fine with you as the only one. ♬

114
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,530
♬ I will find the star. Until I reach the dream suspended high in the sky ♬

115
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:58,200
♬ Even if darkness surrounds me  ♬

116
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,330
♬ You are the only one I will never throw away ♬

117
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,460
♫  Always be mine  ♫

118
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,490
Now that I look at it, it seems like a familiar incense pouch.

119
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,740
- What?
- By any chance, does Soo Yeon

120
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,890
like you?

121
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:23,190
♬ If my harsh fate ♬

122
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:28,820
That wouldn't happen. But even if it does, don't accept her.

123
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,880
I think we're finally getting close.

124
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,670
That would make things awkward.

125
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,900
♬ You are the one answer from the skill of god, shining on me. ♬

126
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,700
♬  If I even try to ask my heart over and over ♬

127
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,200
This is nice.

128
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,800
♬ No matter what anyone says ultimately for me it's you. ♬

129
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,480
Are you okay, Princess?

130
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,730
Stop it! Stop it!

131
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,470
No?

132
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:19,120
Two people have to take turns keeping a night watch. There might be robbers here.

133
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,620
You just can't do this right...

134
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,370
I.

135
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,500
I apologize.

136
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,770
It seems that we'll be starving today.

137
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,010
I don't think so.

138
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,470
Are you saying that you found all of these in the mountains?

139
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,880
Generosity has no boundaries.

140
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,990
In a place where people live, if you have affection for each other, you should share your food. Don't you think so?

141
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,540
What are you doing not eating?

142
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,580
Please eat. It's food that I got.

143
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,140
I was trying to kill you.

144
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:41,310
But, why are you taking care of me?

145
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,350
I don't know how you've lived,

146
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,470
but the people I know call this affection.

147
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:53,250
No matter how much I hate you. Feeding and caring for someone.

148
00:15:54,210 --> 00:16:00,330
Also, you said I'm your personal doctor. A doctor takes care of their patient. What should I do?

149
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,330
Okay. All done. Try moving it slowly.

150
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,420
Huh, it feels better? That's interesting. You're a healer, a healer.

151
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,090
- I'm not a healer.
- You must be a real healer.

152
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:35,440
Am I a bit like one? Then should I be considered a healer?

153
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,410
You are a healer.

154
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,530
No matter where she goes I'm sure your sister will survive.

155
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,000
Is that why I like her?

156
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,470
I told you I liked her.

157
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,720
I think your game is going on for too long.

158
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,580
I've never toyed with her.

159
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,730
I envy you.

160
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,610
And I also feel bad.

161
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,050
That you have a sister like her, I'm jealous.

162
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,890
And, out of all people, that it has to be your sister, I feel bad.

163
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,450
Why does it have to be Ah Ro?

164
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,020
She's my only person.

165
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,470
The only one in the world.

166
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,820
That's why I desperately need her.

167
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,590
Are you saying you came here because of her?

168
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,500
I told you I was desperate.

169
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,990
Fine. But,

170
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,510
she is everything to me.

171
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,530
Not because I want or need her.

172
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:58,590
She is the reason I'm still alive and breathing.

173
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,570
I think we will have to sleep together tonight.

174
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,440
We'll arrive there by tomorrow anyway,

175
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,650
so please endure it a little bit even if you're uncomfortable.

176
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,630
Excuse me. I keep wondering about this...

177
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,490
Why, out of all people, did you bring me all the way here?

178
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,480
You're not looking for answers.

179
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,950
Should I just say you have to confirm something?

180
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,830
Did you use me

181
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,290
because you wanted to bring my brother?

182
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,890
Whether I want to bring or use someone,

183
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,780
why do I need to tell you?

184
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,860
Your Highness,

185
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,890
what do you remember about your brother?

186
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,060
By any chance,

187
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,270
if you think Seon Woo is your brother,

188
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,630
you are mistaken.

189
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:32,480
My brother is not your brother.

190
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,740
Those things don't matter.

191
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:53,380
I did use you as bait to bring Seon Woo into this delegation.

192
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,300
He's someone I want to keep close by.

193
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,080
Are you born with those things?

194
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:25,460
When I think about it, you have the talent to lead people.

195
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,500
And you're saying that you don't?

196
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,420
What do you think?

197
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,230
Am I able to lead people?

198
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:40,160
If you were the King,

199
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,000
how would you change Silla?

200
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,520
The people can't endure starvation so they're becoming robbers.

201
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,560
What should the King do?

202
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,390
While saying you're not the King,

203
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,990
why are you concerned about that?

204
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,650
I know, right?

205
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,920
What are you doing here?

206
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,880
Are you playing at Kang Tae Gong again?
(Kang Tae Gong was a famous scholar in China who loved fishing.)

207
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,630
There's nothing better than fishing to pass time.

208
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,940
Strangely enough, whatever I do today progresses slowly.

209
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,440
Aigoo.

210
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,530
They say that an empty seat makes its mark compared to an occupied one.

211
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:54,230
It's strangely empty and it makes me uneasy.

212
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,050
That's why I

213
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,000
brought scorched rice.

214
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,010
I gave up my cook's pride. Ba Ba Bak Bak. I pressed it down a lot.

215
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,830
This scorched rice is slightly burnt, so let's just feed it to the fish.

216
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,480
There we go.

217
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,970
Aish. Hey, where are you going?

218
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,530
I'm going to have a drink.

219
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:27,480
I noticed that you always leave me out and go alone.

220
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,110
You didn't even put your fishing pole away!

221
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,120
Geez.

222
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,940
The book on military strategy says that the best tactic

223
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,470
is not going to war.

224
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,810
When is Seon Woo coming?

225
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,400
I wonder.

226
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,580
Well, he'll probably come back after preventing the war.

227
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,320
Where is he?

228
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,630
- Do you like Dog-Bird that much?
- Yeah.

229
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,220
Then, what about me?

230
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,230
- I don't like you.
- Sheesh!

231
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,520
"Sheesh"?

232
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,350
I'll see you later.

233
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,360
Are you...crying?

234
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,760
What do you mean? Who's crying?

235
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,670
I don't know what happened, but

236
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,730
this isn't a place a 22-year-old should shed tears.

237
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,690
Or think of me as a hyung and vent to me.

238
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,780
Ow, gosh darn it.

239
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,370
Two Nangdoos gathered to cry at a place where there are no Hwarang...

240
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:11,230
Well, there's nothing bad about crying in advance.

241
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,410
What are you talking about?

242
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:18,360
Do you guys really think the Hwarang can come back?

243
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,840
Gosh, again!

244
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,820
Tell me properly before I kill you.

245
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:30,500
No matter if they are our masters. Whether one or two Hwarang die or not,

246
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,560
- it doesn't matter to you anyway!
- What do you mean die? Tell me properly!

247
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,960
Do you think Yeong Sil Gong is going to keep that delegation alive?

248
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,530
Their lives are over. They will never come back!

249
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,590
Hey!

250
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,290
I think he has some difficulty catching up with the others.

251
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:18,200
Useless bastard.

252
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:24,290
Han Seong isn't your younger brother, he's the master you must serve. How many times have I told you?

253
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:28,590
However, you make him into an idiot who can't do anything?

254
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:44,400
He's the only descendant of the Seok family.

255
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,580
Train Han Seong until your bones break.

256
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:53,180
Make him into the best Hwarang. Do you understand?

257
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,680
Yes.

258
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,620
I hit Dan Se instead of you.

259
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,350
Come to your senses.

260
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,510
Yes, Grandfather.

261
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,490
Grandfather has also grown old.

262
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,190
He's weaker than in the past.

263
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,360
Hyung...

264
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,760
- Move it.
- Yes.

265
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,830
The items are here.

266
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,430
All of the items here are going to be sent to the Crown Prince of South Buyeo.

267
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,490
Take them to him

268
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,680
so that they arrive before the King's birthday.

269
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,060
Yes.

270
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,590
I wonder if Ban Ryu will be okay...

271
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:24,140
Since I requested it of him, he'll probably succeed.

272
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:42,290
So, you've captured another Silla citizen who crossed the border?

273
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,560
Yes, Your Highness. (South Buyeo's Crown Prince Chang)

274
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,830
Haven't we run out of jails to put them in?

275
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:52,420
Therefore, I made a temporary jail and incarcerated them there.

276
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:58,570
At this point, isn't it better to go to war?

277
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:02,530
What about persuading His Majesty?

278
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:08,360
I have confidence that we will win.

279
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:14,640
The delegation from Shilla that was sent to make peace will arrive shortly.

280
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:21,410
Farming and hunting on someone else's territory. What is this "making peace"?

281
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,560
Crown Prince, the delegation from Silla arrived.

282
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,070
Silla Princess, Sook Myeong is my name.

283
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:16,690
I came to smooth over the misunderstanding with South Buyeo.

284
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,720
What is this? Are they blatantly ignoring us?

285
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,520
This isn't right.

286
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,460
Hold it in.

287
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,710
Until you're done eating, I'll wait for you.

288
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,070
If that's what you want.

289
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:19,620
Okay. What did you come with?

290
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:26,550
In order to make peace, did you bring a gift that will convince me,

291
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,680
or did you not?

292
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,460
I came as a representative of Silla.

293
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,600
I am asking for a private meeting with you.

294
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,480
Is this all?

295
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:06,410
It's a memento on behalf of making peace. It's not a tribute.

296
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:11,390
Do you wish Buddha's mercy from me?

297
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:17,090
South Buyeo and Shilla have forged an alliance for a long time.

298
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:23,610
Breaking that alliance means that we are volunteering to become subject states to Goguryeo.

299
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,470
How old are you?

300
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:52,170
Don't you know how countries solidify peace?

301
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,830
Marriage.

302
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,860
Don't misunderstand me. It's not that as a man I desire you.

303
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:08,090
That's the conventional means of cementing an alliance.

304
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:12,950
However, I already have many wives.

305
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,770
Did you also come from Silla?

306
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,960
Way over there.

307
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,520
Did you come from Silla?

308
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,880
How hungry you must have been that you came all the way over here.

309
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:27,450
No. I can't accept this.

310
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:33,230
But where did you get this from?

311
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,150
I don't think this is a trivial item.

312
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:51,050
Then I'll put it in my hair for a moment and return it to you.

313
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:58,540
- Hey!
- Why are you doing this? Wait!

314
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,510
Why are you doing this?

315
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:04,780
He is a thief and he tried to sell stolen items and came all the way over here.

316
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:09,420
He's just a child who can't speak. He's not someone who can steal!

317
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,930
What is this? Look at this.

318
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:15,870
So you're teamed with him. Aren't you?

319
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,860
No, I'm not. I came from Silla...

320
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,580
I'm not. I'm an envoy from Silla! Why are you doing this?
Please let go!

321
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:27,500
I'm not a thief! Orabeoni!

322
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:41,410
I'm not a thief! Orabeoni! Orabeoni!

323
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,800
What?

324
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,780
Didn't you hear sounds?

325
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,420
Sounds?

326
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,770
Please let go. I said please let go!

327
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,250
I'm not a thief. I am an envoy from Silla who escorted the Princess!

328
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:12,510
Look here! Look here!

329
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,510
Orabeoni...

330
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,720
Since you're so flustered,

331
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,610
I'm even more flustered.

332
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:51,700
Are you just naive, or are you a fool?

333
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:59,630
If they sent a prince, I would have thought you were going to war,

334
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,500
but they sent a princess.

335
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,690
What does it mean?

336
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:10,370
If you don't like the gift, I will prepare another one.

337
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:16,790
However, please discard the desire to go to war with Silla.

338
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,920
Gift?

339
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,320
There must have been silk and gold.

340
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,420
But you must have gotten robbed.

341
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:34,530
We captured Silla thieves who were selling those items on South Buyeo's land.

342
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:38,630
The Princess is working hard to prevent a war, but

343
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:45,680
the subjects are stealing peace offerings from you. It appears the Silla subjects don't even have a sense of honor.

344
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,150
Forget the gift because I have it in my hand already.

345
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:59,650
Instead of making peace with South Buyeo, what I told you about

346
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:03,270
is making peace. But

347
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:06,000
it could turn into a war.

348
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,870
After two days,

349
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:16,560
on the King's birthday

350
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:24,210
I am intending to give the gift of the expansion of South Buyeo's territory.

351
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:33,300
If you need time, I'll give you as much as you need.

352
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:43,040
We're in big trouble! Doctor Ah Ro got dragged away by soldiers!

353
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,360
Stop right there!

354
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,200
You can't use swords.

355
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,950
We can't? Why not?

356
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:15,570
If you take your swords out, it will start a war.

357
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:18,040
What crazy bastard would go for a war with so few people?

358
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:22,740
If you wield a sword, the peace-making is over.

359
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:25,810
Catch them!

360
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,790
What is the matter?

361
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:34,560
I think there is a misunderstanding.

362
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,080
- Get them!
- Yes!

363
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,920
Don't cause more conflicts.

364
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:19,970
The Hwarang started a conflict?

365
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:26,790
It seems that the doctor who accompanied them is temporarily in jail due to a misunderstanding by our troops.

366
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:36,070
That's strange. All the Hwarang started this because of that one doctor?

367
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,980
What shall we do?

368
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,020
Take them and lock them up!

369
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,770
Yes!

370
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:56,050
It's the Crown Prince's order. Quietly stay here.

371
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,250
Aish.

372
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,120
All of them are ill.

373
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,880
I didn't bring much medicine with me.

374
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,950
Excuse me...

375
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:03,140
I'm a doctor. Come over here. I can take a look at that for you.

376
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:13,870
Are...are you scared that it will be painful?

377
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:20,650
This can hurt a little bit, but the effects are amazing!

378
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:25,500
Because it's medicine made by my father who is the most skilled doctor in the three kingdoms of Korea.

379
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,110
Have you been well?

380
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,720
Is that the item I mentioned last time?

381
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,380
Yes.

382
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:49,500
It's a small token sent to Crown Prince Chang from my master, Park Yeong Sil.

383
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,490
Open it.

384
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:03,810
This time, I have something to tell His Majesty directly.

385
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:22,570
Your Highness, Hwi Gyeong Gong is...Hwi Gyeong Gong is...

386
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:36,660
You really look as if you've seen a ghost.

387
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:43,390
Are you not going to tell your brother to sit down when his legs are uncomfortable?

388
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:46,530
Sit down.

389
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,640
Why are you here?

390
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:05,060
After chasing your son outside of the palace and taking the throne,

391
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,700
even though you send the Princess into a deadly situation, you seem very comfortable.

392
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,230
It figures.

393
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:18,940
You framed your one and only companion and violently got rid of him.

394
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,840
What is it that you want to say?

395
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:32,580
I heard that you hid the King in Hwarang.

396
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:37,260
That Ahn Ji Gong's son Seon Woo is Jin Heung.

397
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:43,070
If Seon Woo comes back alive from South Buyeo,

398
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:50,200
you should abdicate. I will help you.

399
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:55,450
You appear after 10 years, and you're telling me to make Ahn Ji Gong's son the King?

400
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:58,780
I don't know what you're talking about.

401
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:08,590
Hwa Joong Jae Wang (There is a King among Hwarang). Was I mistaken?

402
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,980
They say Silla has many kings. It must be true.

403
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:27,940
Okay. What is it that you want?

404
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:32,460
He said that he will tell you by contacting you separately.

405
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,100
Contacting me separately?

406
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,510
Yes.

407
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:44,170
How dare you look at his face?

408
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:51,690
If it wasn't for the gold you brought,

409
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:55,480
I would have pulled out your eyeballs with my hands.

410
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,570
Aigoo. I apologize.

411
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:59,590
- Get out.
- Yes.

412
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:20,290
Yeong Sil Gong asked me to secretly relay this to you.

413
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:40,760
I almost got my eyeballs pulled out.

414
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:44,290
But I still saw the face of South Buyeo's Crown Prince.

415
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,090
Let's go.

416
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:53,090
"The faceless King is there."

417
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:57,690
"Therefore, do as you wish".

418
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:06,530
He wants me to kill him?

419
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,210
Does he want me

420
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:14,520
to kill the King?

421
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:28,530
Rather than the Princess,

422
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:33,190
it would be better to go against the King.

423
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:43,980
I apologize.

424
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:48,320
They locked up Doctor Ah Ro and we couldn't stand idly by.

425
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:53,590
What does it matter if that half-blood doctor gets locked up or dies?

426
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,830
For the sake of Silla's people,

427
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:01,490
do you know the loneliness and unfair treatment I'm going through?

428
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:06,290
But Hwarang are who are supposed to help me when I need them the most.

429
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:08,800
Just look at you!

430
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:21,580
If you think that it's unfair, wouldn't fighting solve matters?

431
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:27,100
Especially if that fight is on behalf of the people,

432
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:31,280
it seems like we wouldn't have to face this kind of incident ever again.

433
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,480
Injustice is not to be tolerated but corrected.

434
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,360
You said you came on behalf of Silla.

435
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:41,250
Then don't be afraid, don't blame anyone,

436
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,890
and say it yourself!

437
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,840
Princess!

438
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,090
General.

439
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,630
Even if Silla's citizens crossed South Buyeo's land and built farms,

440
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:05,520
beheading and killing them is cruel treatment!

441
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,580
They are not soldiers holding swords, but only farmers!

442
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:12,030
Don't you think seizing someone's land without a war

443
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:13,990
is crueler treatment?

444
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:16,630
Although it's wrong of my people to have crossed the border,

445
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:20,810
what kind of father would watch and leave his child to die of starvation!

446
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:25,070
This isn't something to have a war over. It's a matter to be solved through diplomacy!

447
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,870
Since you came to make peace, then...

448
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:32,770
how about solving it through marriage?

449
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:35,670
I am already betrothed.

450
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:40,390
They said that those of the sacred bone marry each other.

451
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:45,200
Are you speaking of that faceless king?

452
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:49,520
According to what I heard today,

453
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,890
one of the Hwarang is that King.

454
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:02,480
If I kill all of them, your betrothed will also cease to exist.

455
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,820
Isn't that so?

456
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,590
Princess!

457
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:23,060
I will say it again. There will be no marriage.

458
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:30,800
Also, you killing Silla's King will also not happen.

459
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:55,210
Bind them and drag them out.

460
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:00,250
Aigoo, Oh my!

461
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:46,040
I heard that Silla's King is here.

462
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:51,520
Therefore, whoever he is, I will have him reveal his identity,

463
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,440
and make him take responsibility for this matter.

464
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:39,880
If there's a king amongst you, reveal your kinghood.

465
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,390
If not, every fifteen minutes,

466
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:48,910
I will chop off a head to send to Silla.

467
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:06,360
- Aunt, give us two bowls of rice soup.
- Yes.

468
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:17,590
I've never asked for a drinking buddy.

469
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,420
Hwi Gyeong Gong.

470
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:34,000
I heard that in Seonmoon, a poster saying "Hwa Joong Jae Wang"(There is a king among Hwarang) was posted.

471
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,310
Is there really a king in there?

472
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:42,520
How would I know a faceless king?

473
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:50,160
Father thought I would die early. A prince who inherited the perfect blood of the sacred bone

474
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,560
being born in this state.

475
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,260
It was something that shouldn't have happened.

476
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:59,700
Father took me, wrapped in swaddling clothes, and

477
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:03,320
left me in a cold, empty room to die.

478
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:08,350
However, as three days, four days passed, I didn't die.

479
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:12,440
And I'm hiding somewhere in the capital

480
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,470
like this and living like a ghost.

481
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:23,520
Do you think Jin Heung is the answer?

482
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:29,680
If there is someone more suitable, wouldn't it be nice if the king changed?

483
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:34,760
Surpassing the bone rank system, a new and better king who can uphold Silla.

484
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,220
If there is a prince like that,

485
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:41,650
even if it's not necessarily Jin Heung, wouldn't it be alright?

486
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:46,620
Couldn't the faceless king be that kind of king?

487
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:53,020
The reason I'm against a regency is because the mother doesn't trust her son.

488
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:56,680
Taking possession of the bone rank system's throne would be against reason.

489
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:01,440
However, there will never be an incident that will treat the royal family unfairly

490
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,450
or throw Silla into chaos.

491
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,750
Father! No, Father!

492
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:23,030
No! Please save us!

493
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:28,720
When fifteen minutes pass, I will behead them.

494
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:36,600
So before then, Silla's King should affirm his own kinghood.

495
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:40,350
What a pity, fifteen minutes hasn't passed yet.

496
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,850
Was it a bit too soon?

497
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:15,720
Now, you've wasted half of fifteen minutes.

498
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:36,970
I am..

499
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,020
the King.

500
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,270
I am

501
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:04,780
Silla's King!
