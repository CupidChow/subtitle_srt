Episode 4

17
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,300
The wound is deep.

18
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:10,900
Among the many wounds I've received from you, Queen Dowager, this is the least.

19
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:17,440
Looks like you're much better, to be talking with poison on your tongue.

20
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,640
I thought I trapped you in hell.

21
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,810
After my wife and son were taken, for twelve years,

22
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,380
I've been trapped in hell.

23
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:40,450
And, are you saying that you will save your child, but let me get threatened by a sword?

24
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,670
I will teach him the order of the capital.

25
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,620
How rotten, ridiculous and crazy that is!

26
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,290
I'm planning to let him know that.

27
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,700
I see you're still evil.

28
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,170
Apologize.

29
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,470
Do I have to do that?

30
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,040
My wife's life was taken away and my son...

31
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,700
was kicked away to the Cheonin village.

32
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:22,470
You made me and my daughter live in hell. Is that still not enough for you? You can't!

33
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,700
You can't do that to us anymore.

34
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,320
You can't take him away from me again.

35
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,400
We will see if I can take him or not eventually.

36
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,400
Come on! Take this man away and lock him up!

37
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,700
Aigoo.

38
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,770
I wish I could throw him away.

39
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,020
Why is he this long?

40
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,510
Shall we start?

41
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,520
Najeong

42
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,380
Hey! Did you really come here just because he asked you to?

43
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,680
It's crazy to come here at this time.

44
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,330
Right. I should have told him to come out first!

45
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,200
I should have sent the message first!

46
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,570
I feel like I got punched in the face. So annoying. Let's go.

47
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,550
What should we do?

48
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,750
You're late.

49
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,560
You're the one who came earlier.

50
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,740
You're bolder than I thought. You have the nerve to come here.

51
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,200
That's what I should be saying.

52
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,920
Make sure you grit your teeth.

53
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,360
You're confident with your fist when your handwriting is terrible?

54
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,030
How dare you point out my handwriting?

55
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,020
Your hand is trembling.

56
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,120
What?

57
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,860
Let's make this short.

58
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,300
That hurt.

59
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,870
You have offended Silla's sacred Najeong, capture the criminals!

60
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,630
Yes!

61
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,600
Go!

62
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,720
- Let go.
- Let me go!!

63
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,280
Let go!

64
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,160
Let go!

65
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,860
Let go!

66
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,570
Let go!

67
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,460
Tie them all up!

68
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,280
Tie them!

69
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,960
Who was arrested, where?

70
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,490
What do you mean Najeong? They started a fight at Najeong?

71
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,860
If Queen Dowager decides to kill them, we have nothing to say.

72
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,290
What do you mean kill? How can you say that?

73
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,160
Do you know where Najeong is?

74
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,030
It was where King Park Hyeokgeose (Founder of Silla) was born. It's a sacred place.

75
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,720
I, Park Young Shil, am trying to become king

76
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,130
because Silla originally belonged to the Park family. But he dared to have a brawl there?

77
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,960
He is none other than Park Yeong Sil's adopted son?

78
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,550
Without Ban Ryu, the Park family will have no king.

79
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,840
Did you forget why you came here?

80
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:39,400
Are you really going to end everything here?

81
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,690
It's all because of you!

82
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,870
This poop guy is so annoying.

83
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,620
D-Did you just call me poop?

84
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,730
If you hadn't sent that message, then we wouldn't be in this mess!

85
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,130
What do you mean that message? You're the one—

86
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,790
What is the commotion over here?!

87
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,560
Look here. I want to say something to my father. My father is—

88
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,300
You...

89
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,400
are still clueless, right?

90
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,430
If you enter here alive, you will leave here dead.

91
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,000
Even if you came here dead, you would leave as bones.

92
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,630
Don't be ill-mannered and wait quietly.

93
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,590
The queen dowager is in the middle of wondering what to do with you guys.

94
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,100
Have they always left offenders

95
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,400
to die without a sip of water?

96
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,540
Ah, such a naïve guy.

97
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,490
How are you sleepy and thirsty in the middle of all this?

98
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,430
Let's stop this in this situation, please!

99
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:38,430
Hey. Hey!

100
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,550
I'll need to wake him up to know what happened to Father.

101
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,460
He'll be okay. Your father.

102
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,310
Where is he is right now?

103
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,430
Did he not get hurt? Where is he right now?

104
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:16,300
How can I believe you? We haven't heard from him yet.

105
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,400
I heard you interrupted the ceremonial walk and made a scene.

106
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,140
How can I believe that?

107
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,220
I...

108
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,770
I won't allow anyone else to die in my place.

109
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,680
So,

110
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,150
don't cry.

111
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:24,310
You must be thirsty and you must feel like your legs will fall off.

112
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:30,330
But the bad news is we haven't even started the torture yet.

113
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,410
As you are here for committing high treason at Sacred Najeong.

114
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,990
You will be killed with a terrible punishment.

115
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,620
This is the queen dowager's final command.

116
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,640
Tie these people to the chairs!

117
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,210
Yes!

118
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:02,550
We have nothing to say from our mouths.

119
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:09,500
Please review our foolish children with your magnanimous tolerance.

120
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,200
No way. Is your son amongst those criminals?

121
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:22,500
I sincerely apologize. I have been an incompetent father.

122
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,460
Please spare their lives.

123
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,830
Even if the queen dowager kills our children, we can't say anything!

124
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:36,430
I don't understand this. How can they do that in Najeong?

125
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,700
How did the palace guards know?

126
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,510
It was as if they were waiting there for it to happen, isn't it so?

127
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,720
What is this?

128
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,000
It's a message that Ban Ryu received.

129
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,420
Kim Seup's son, Soo Ho, received it too.

130
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,840
- Then does this mean—
- Our children were caught in a trap.

131
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,310
What is this?

132
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:07,350
The queen dowager is determined to make Hwarang, this is why...

133
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:12,230
This time, we lost.

134
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:18,480
Let us make Hwarang just as the queen dowager expects.

135
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,090
Gakgan. (Park Yeong Sil's title)

136
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,490
Firstly, after we make it, we can make it our own, am I right?

137
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,930
Your great fathers have requested and acquired

138
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,980
a way for you to live.

139
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,840
To avoid torture, you must instead pledge allegiance to become a Hwarang.

140
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,340
All you have to do is sign this and go back home. Simple, right?

141
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,870
Or, experience what the

142
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,360
next step is for yourself.

143
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,090
Excuse me!

144
00:13:55,090 --> 00:14:00,080
So, if we write the oath, can we leave?

145
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,050
That's right.

146
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:05,080
Ah, you should have told us sooner. I was going to do that anyway.

147
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,570
Here, untie me.

148
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,220
If you are willing to sign, tell me right away.

149
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,510
Untie me too!

150
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,930
Me too!

151
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,250
Untie me as well!

152
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,800
Untie me too!

153
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,000
There is no way you aren't signing the oath just out of fear, right?

154
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,020
Why? You don't want to write the oath?

155
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,770
I want to do it.

156
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,920
It looks like it will be fun.

157
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,520
Then ask them to untie you quickly.

158
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,730
But I'm not going to.

159
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:54,200
- Why?
- Because I...

160
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,340
I am the grandson of Seok Hyun Jae.

161
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,040
Untie him too!

162
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,330
Hyung, what are you doing?

163
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,190
I'm half, so even if I write the oath, I can't become a Hwarang.

164
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:14,310
But you're telling me that you're not going to be a Hwarang even if you want to?

165
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,520
- Hyung.
- You're the Seok family's last True Bone.

166
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,160
And Grandfather wouldn't want you to die here.

167
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,510
♬ I will find the star.♬

168
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,310
♬ Until I reach the dream♬

169
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:29,840
Untie me too!
♬ suspended high in the sky♬

170
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,330
♬ Even if darkness surrounds me ♬

171
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,040
♬ You are the only one ♬

172
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,490
♬ I will never throw away.♬

173
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:43,400
♫ You'll always be mine ♫

174
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,000
- What do you mean, you can't?
- To me...

175
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You gave me full authority over the Hwarang.

176
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,800
I did it so everything worked out the way we wanted.

177
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,620
The arrogant officials who didn't show up during the ceremonial walk

178
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,190
had to lower their tails like this.

179
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,230
I knew you would do it.

180
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,240
But, how come

181
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,640
you are now asking me to accept any new Hwarang uncondtionally without quibbling, ?

182
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:28,600
Exactly what kind of noblemen do you have in mind?

183
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:34,020
Whoever I say, will you be able to accept them?

184
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,900
How about this. Bring the one that you want.

185
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,440
A Hwarang who doesn't question any condition.

186
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,190
Then I will also not question it and just accept it as it is.

187
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,290
What do you think?

188
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,060
Come on!

189
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,460
Please show courtesy as you receive the queen dowager's command.

190
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,390
Ahn Ji Gong's son, Seon Woo,

191
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,320
will be recruited as a Hwarang according to the queen dowager's orders.

192
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,490
After ten days, come to Jowonjeon in Weolseong palace at noon

193
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,890
to attend the Hwarang ceremony.

194
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,720
Now...

195
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,350
- will he be released?
- Wait.

196
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,900
Let's go.

197
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,800
Hwarang?

198
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,080
You're becoming a Hwarang. What are they talking about?

199
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,780
I don't want to.

200
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:11,330
I have no desire to become a Hwarang under Queen Dowager Ji Soo even if I die.

201
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,670
If you act like this is front of Yeong Sil, I will not let you go easily.

202
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:31,040
Do you still think I'm a fearful, small child?

203
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,170
Hit me as much as you want.

204
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,980
You don't want to become a Hwarang?

205
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,560
You shouldn't have made trouble.

206
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,570
I sincerely apologize. He is very stubborn.

207
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,820
Are you miserable?

208
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,080
That is how power is.

209
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,000
If you cannot wield power, you can't do anything except submit.

210
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,390
What can you do? You have to choose.

211
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,160
Will you wield it?

212
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,600
Don't think this is miserable?

213
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,160
The world is different from what you imagine.

214
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,120
It's much dirtier.

215
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,470
Become a Hwarang!

216
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,240
Go and get power!

217
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,100
I'm going to make your son a Hwarang.

218
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:09,050
I'm going to raise your son as a dog for my son.

219
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:13,440
If it's Hwarang, I heard it will be the future of Silla.

220
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:19,170
Did you really think Hwarang will be responsible for Silla?

221
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,200
Did you think it was a place to raise talent?

222
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,980
The children of the wolves who are hunting for the king's life

223
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,120
will be locked and tamed as Hwarang.

224
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,880
They will be faithful dogs, who for my son's sake,

225
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,390
will give their lives or hunting dogs that lose their lives.

226
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:38,570
What made you this way, Queen Dowager?

227
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,050
Your son's life

228
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,540
is in my hands.

229
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,940
Don't forget that for a moment.

230
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,540
Father...

231
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,720
It's not a big deal.

232
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,930
Look your father is alright.

233
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,980
You were worried, weren't you?

234
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,680
Where is your brother?

235
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,910
You should leave.

236
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,740
The queen dowager is not sparing your life.

237
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,360
Hwarang is full of shackles to kill you.

238
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,880
So, run away right now.

239
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,700
I can't leave like this.

240
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,450
No.

241
00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:00,380
Going against the queen dowager is just as reckless as dousing yourself in oil and leaping into a fire.

242
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,590
I know that.

243
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,380
I...

244
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,730
If I can protect you, I am fine.

245
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,890
I will do it, Hwarang.

246
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,430
It's not somewhere where you'd want to stay.

247
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,860
It will be worse than anything you are thinking.

248
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,980
I will endure it!

249
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,270
I will go and see whatever there is to the end of this wretched capital.

250
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,930
I will go see. I will go and break everything.

251
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,120
So...

252
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,000
I will join Hwarang.

253
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,670
My horse is outside.

254
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,090
Is Wi Hwa Gong not here yet?

255
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,190
What are you doing and not tying it?

256
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:03,480
What for? You could have tied it before coming inside.

257
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,160
Why are you being like this to me?

258
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:11,060
Can't you at least do that much for a customer? Look at the size of the store.

259
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,440
Ah, do you perhaps have something for me?

260
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,630
Like for example, a letter from the queen dowager?

261
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:23,640
Crazy... Why has he come here looking for something like that?

262
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,990
I can hear everything.

263
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,880
Ah, even his dirty ears can hear.

264
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,970
Ah, Pi Joo Gyoo.

265
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,850
Turn around.

266
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,120
Why?

267
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,740
Turn around.

268
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,960
You all are driving me crazy.

269
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,360
Just follow me for now.

270
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,310
Wait, why?

271
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:07,830
Anyway, Hwarang or whatever is apparently controlled by some crazy old man,

272
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:12,480
and that Hwarang isn't the queen dowager's but that old man's. That's the rumor.

273
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:18,050
I don't think the old man is that crazy.

274
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,870
Let go of me!

275
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,050
Go. Don't touch me!

276
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,500
You said you wanted to change it, not ruin it?

277
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,130
- So?
- You must break it down to change it.

278
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,430
Do you have enough guts for that?

279
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,690
Well, what are you trying to say?

280
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,860
A country with joyous subjects and a suffering king.

281
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,900
The subjects do not worry about the country,

282
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,420
but a country where the king worries about the subjects. This is...

283
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:21,390
the type of country you want?

284
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,760
Because I want to live in that type of country.

285
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,500
Who are you?

286
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,780
Someone who wants Silla to really change.

287
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:39,360
This is my half truth.

288
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,310
Ah...

289
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,480
Oh my goodness!

290
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,580
You don't like it as much as I do.

291
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,450
What do I have to teach?

292
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,970
We can't send him off...

293
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:12,010
to be a Hwarang like that.

294
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:16,460
It's better to learn a bit more than to go not knowing anything.

295
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,520
That way,

296
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,520
somehow he will be able to endure it.

297
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,730
Why?

298
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,540
Is your brother burdensome?

299
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,660
No.

300
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,670
It's just that we are still awkward.

301
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,620
Okay. This is my request.

302
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,790
How much can you write?

303
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,520
I know all the letters on the jooryeonggu.

304
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,730
Ah, that?

305
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,870
What else?

306
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,980
Do I need to know more?

307
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,290
Do you know

308
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:15,570
how many letters there are in the world?

309
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,020
I bet it's no more than 200.

310
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,330
That 200.

311
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:32,170
By 200, you don't mean the number 200, do you?

312
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,030
Seon Woo

313
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,980
Name.

314
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,600
This is brother's—

315
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,660
This is your name.

316
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,210
Seon Woo

317
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,650
Here, write it.

318
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,340
You take this,

319
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,180
hold this at the bottom, and press down.

320
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,880
Like this.

321
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,730
Like this.

322
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,160
Even if you memorized twenty characters a day, it would take you two months to learn a thousand.

323
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,790
I can do it on my own.

324
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:33,960
You don't know what you're doing.

325
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,110
Do you know where you're about to enter?

326
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,520
From childhood, all the noble sons who were taught

327
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,680
by private tutors are going to be gathered there.

328
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,040
- Do you want to go there and be a fool?
- Fool?

329
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,600
So, let's just do it.

330
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,330
Here.

331
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,030
You should relax a bit. This brush is not a big deal.

332
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:02,070
Ah. Forget it. I said I can do it by myself.

333
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:07,800
What do you mean you can do it? You need to learn how to hold it, so you have practice on your own!

334
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,260
Now. Again to the lower part...

335
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,450
♫ I think of you any moment. It gets bigger and bigger ♫

336
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:27,190
♫ You're the reason I smile, it's only you all day ♫

337
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:31,960
♫ You're acting like nothing is happening, should I make the first move? ♫

338
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,860
♫  There are whispers in my ear. I'm waiting for you.  ♫

339
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:43,920
♫  Oh oh oh eh oh~ Oh oh oh eh oh  ♫

340
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,300
♫  You can sing for my life  ♫

341
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:51,230
♫  You shine bright in my eyes. My heart thumps when I see you ♫

342
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,880
♫  The confessions I couldn't make keep piling up  ♫

343
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,060
♫  What should I do? I am still so ♫

344
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,790
Don't you hear a drum beating somewhere?

345
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,420
No.

346
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,850
That's weird.

347
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:09,470
I hear something ringing.

348
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:13,970
♬ I feel like I own the whole world ♬

349
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:18,060
♫  Should I carefully muster the courage and confess ♫

350
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,040
♫  Should I carefully muster the courage and confess ♫

351
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,030
Why are you doing this to me?

352
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,290
♫  I love you  ♫

353
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:31,380
♫  Oh, oh oh eh oh~ Oh oh oh eh oh~  ♫

354
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,700
Well, that's pretty good for your first time.

355
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:39,230
♫  After I slyly get closer will we gently kiss?  ♫

356
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,590
♫  When will I be by your side

357
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,430
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

358
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,750
What? When did I?

359
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,970
Hey,

360
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,780
do I look uglier from when I was younger?

361
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,400
You do look different from what I thought.

362
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,870
What is this situation?

363
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,570
Who are you?

364
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,850
Why does this keep happening only to you?

365
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,770
I told you that my brother came back.

366
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,940
When did you? When did you?

367
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,790
You did not tell me he had a face and a body like that.

368
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,430
Don't other people envy your brother?

369
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:29,490
Writing together with his sister, such a setting.

370
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,700
- I'm so jealous.
- That's how you saw it?

371
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:37,800
How much rice cake do I have to give you to become part of your family?

372
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,060
The fact that you're my friend is so

373
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,390
much like rice cake.
(means it's not very good)

374
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:47,610
But where did your brother go?

375
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:50,170
Oh, you're right.

376
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:52,380
There's more to teach him.

377
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,510
What do you mean by teach? Teach what?

378
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,870
That's right. You have a horse at your house, right?

379
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,960
Seon

380
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,620
Seon Woo

381
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,870
They say this is your name.

382
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,160
Is it okay if I use your name?

383
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,430
Ahem. Over there.

384
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,140
You haven't ridden a horse, have you?

385
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,970
If you see the faces of those who said they'd never join Hwarang,

386
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,450
it must be fun.

387
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,670
Soo Ho, Ban Ryu probably isn't coming, right?

388
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,280
He's here.

389
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,640
Wow, this is a disappointment.

390
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,850
You said you don't want to become a Hwarang.

391
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,660
But you must have ended up writing the oath since you're here.

392
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,850
I think I told you.

393
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,250
That I have no desire to be a dog for the queen dowager.

394
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,820
Ah, then did your father write it?

395
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,400
Which father? The Gakgan father? Or the other father?

396
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,690
Shall we complete the match we couldn't the other day?

397
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,690
Let's do it today. How does soccer sound?

398
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,780
Do you think we can do it with just soccer?

399
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,870
Oh! You want to do that?

400
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:26,150
Hey, refuse. We always lose.

401
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,420
Let's do it!

402
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:36,570
Get more people. You have two fewer than us. Do you think you will be a match for us?

403
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,090
I can just find people to make it even.

404
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:43,010
Wait right here. If you go anywhere, you're dead!

405
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,730
Aigoo. I said to make your back straight.

406
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:12,440
Don't lean forward like this. I said lift it like this. Lift it.

407
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,430
Oh, my. I said make your back straight.

408
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,980
Horses can tell right away if the rider is scared.

409
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:25,250
So they get more nervous.

410
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,910
You need to believe in him so he can believe in you.

411
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:32,430
How can a grown man have that much fear?

412
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:34,550
Now, let's go.

413
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:38,600
Look, like this. Slowly.

414
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:44,020
Now, if you want to stop, hold the reigns lower and pull like this.

415
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:49,210
If you want to stop a running horse, you lean back and say, "Whoa, whoa, whoa."

416
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:55,480
But for now, you won't have instances where you have to stop a running horse. Let's go!

417
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,830
Whoa! See, it works.

418
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,820
Oh! It works!

419
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,990
What is this? You know how to laugh.

420
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:10,290
- Whoa, whoa.
- You become serious after I mentioned that.

421
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,600
Let's go!

422
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,560
Then, should we slowly start heading out?

423
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,490
Let's go.

424
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,640
Oh, my!

425
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:05,810
What is he doing, that guy?

426
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:20,090
Why are there so few useless noblemen today?

427
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:23,820
I need to make that smile disappear off that jerk's face.

428
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,520
Ban Ryu originally had no smile.

429
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,420
It's a challenge we've never won. Do we have to do it?

430
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,700
Over there.

431
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,000
It's fast!

432
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,590
Are you okay?

433
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:57,910
He was so fast! I thought I was going to die!

434
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:03,010
That bastard, I will never ride with him again.

435
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,160
It's okay. It's okay.

436
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,510
It's okay. It's okay.

437
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,160
Don't hide and come out, you pathetic bastard!

438
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,970
Why is he...

439
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:42,100
Why is he with her?

440
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:50,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

441
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,620
It's a relief that you're safe.

442
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:57,100
It's a bit awkward to be saying this now, but

443
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,280
do you want to join a match with us?

444
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:05,230
Hey, we're not weird people. We're Hwarang.

445
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:16,490
Who made the statement that a person killing another person isn't a crime?

446
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,150
Was it you?

447
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,850
Have we met each other somewhere before?

448
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:27,460
You guys are Hwarang?

449
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,290
If not, whatever. Let's do it, the game.

450
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,520
He'll do it!

451
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,820
Of course, he has to do it.

452
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:41,460
- Are you crazy?
- They said they're Hwarang. This is a good opportunity.

453
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,050
What about him?

454
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,800
I'll do it. If he agrees.

455
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,650
But why is that pervert not leaving?

456
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,890
But... What kind of game is it?

457
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,870
They are the guys from that place.

458
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,900
Alright.

459
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,230
Nice, let's see how it goes.

460
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,340
Do well!

461
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:44,540
Where would you find a class like this? It's great if you use this opportunity to get along with them. Isn't that right?

462
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,750
I don't have those kinds of thoughts.

463
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:48,920
The capital is all about making connections.

464
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,460
I know those young noblemen and they're all sons of well-off households.

465
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,800
If you get along with them, it will benefit you.

466
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,450
I don't expect you to score a lot of points.

467
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:04,130
Just don't interfere too much. Do the best you can. You can do that, right?

468
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,040
What about you?

469
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,250
Are you really okay with this?

470
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:15,160
Me? Well, I'm okay.

471
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,850
It's enough then.

472
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,720
What in the world are you?

473
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,770
The young noblemen are going to have a match! It's not just soccer.

474
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,230
It's going to be that! That!

475
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,990
The noblemen are going to have a match! It's not just football! It's going to be that! That!

476
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:41,460
Let's go!

477
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,810
Beautiful football?

478
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:45,380
Let's go!

479
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,800
Hurry and come! Hurry!

480
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:55,160
If it's football, it must be just football. Why are they acting like that?

481
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,260
It's not just a football game. It's a very hot football game.

482
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,440
Beautiful football.

483
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:07,550
Beautiful, Mi. Technique, Sik. A beautifully created match, so it's called

484
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:10,870
Beautiful football!

485
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:25,050
Ban Ryu!

486
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,470
Red

487
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,090
Blue

488
00:42:55,830 --> 00:43:00,090
I know you were in a rush, but don't you think you recruited carelessly?

489
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:02,270
He doesn't seem to understand what this match is about.

490
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:06,020
Don't worry because he knows how to use his body.

491
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:23,960
There isn't much to it. You just win the match by scoring the ball.

492
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,550
If you get a hold of the ball, just pass it to me. Can you do it?

493
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,830
Run!

494
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:54,900
What the hell?

495
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,890
Ah, what the hell?

496
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,530
Over here!

497
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:08,790
But that was incorrect information.

498
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:13,360
It's not just beautiful young noblemen doing soccer.

499
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,650
Mi, meaning no. Sik, meaning rules.

500
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:20,060
Doing it without both structure and rules, it is no-holds-barred football.

501
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,470
In other words, it's a fight until the end.

502
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:40,490
Ban Ryu!

503
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,200
Block him!

504
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:51,530
Block him!

505
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:02,130
Ban Ryu!

How dare you...?

507
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:15,920
Are you okay? If you stand waiting like that, you will end up falling down.

508
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,800
It is not enough to say you will withstand.

509
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,500
You need to calculate how strong the opponent is and back off.

510
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:27,170
Aren't there rules for this?

511
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:32,160
Yeah. The rule is to just win.

512
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,750
Let's do it that way then.

513
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:38,690
I kinda like you!

514
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,810
Let's go!

515
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:58,730
How handsome!

516
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,670
Huh?

517
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,570
Goal!

518
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:20,330
You are all dead!

Is he totally dumb?

521
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:26,020
Not this side, this one! This side!

522
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:29,630
You scored in our goal!

523
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,970
It was that side?

524
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:33,760
Sheesh.

528
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:04,720
See? What did I tell you?! He's different!

529
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,920
What are you doing?

530
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,190
He's a total monster.

531
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:20,680
We can't ever lose this one.

532
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,800
Let's go.

533
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,450
Hey, hey!

534
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:43,500
You surprised me.

535
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:46,070
"Hey"?

536
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:49,130
Have you ever even held a ball before?

537
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:52,190
You should have let me know if you like these things.

538
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:54,470
It's not like that.

539
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:55,920
I did make an assumption,

540
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,910
but you're worse than I thought, so I was the surprised one as you said.

541
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:04,260
Shut your mouth.

542
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:09,290
What? Do you have a plan?

543
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,420
Don't smile. You annoy me.

544
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:55,540
What the—

545
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,660
What? What's with you?

546
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,900
What are you doing? You're on the same team!

547
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:04,770
You bastard!

548

00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:49,060
You fall so much, but surprisingly you have more physical strength than I expected.

572
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,450
With the horse, too.

573
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:56,530
I am thankful for earlier, for saving me.

574
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,160
But you're not close friends with that young nobleman earlier, are you?

575
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,830
Ah, seriously. He didn't seem like a good person.

576
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:20,640
No, at the Okta Shop. Oh not that, we just slept—

577
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,010
You're crazy. Keep your mouth shut.

578
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,310
Ride my back.

579
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:36,120
You're hurt.

580
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,490
I'm alright though.

581
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:41,320
Then do you want me to carry you?

00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:22,360
Was your personality always rough?

588
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,760
You can't act that way in the capital.

589
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,000
Everything is built upon connections. It's true!

590
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,770
♫ I'm afraid I will be left yearning. ♫

596
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:20,460
I told you to hurry up!

597
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:23,960
We'll be late at this rate.

598
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,770
No way. I came out early. How can I be late?

599
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:35,800
Let's see.

600
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:41,820
Wait a moment.

601
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,160
Aigo. What can we do?

602
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,080
I like this too.

603
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:20,130
Th-Then take it.

604
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:22,520
Are you Ahn Ji Gong's daughter?

605
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:27,410
How do you know me?

606
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,910
Pull like this...

607
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:13,900
Hwarang?

608
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,090
What is this?

609
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:28,130
Is he going to the ceremony right now, wearing that bracelet like that?

610
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,040
How can a Cheonin wear silk like this?

611
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,080
Looks like you've settled well in the capital.

612
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:11,390
Settle the issue with me. Let her go.

613
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:16,860
Wow, it's the first time I've seen Dog-Bird Gong being this scared.

614
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:20,560
I think it's because of that girl.

615
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:29,500
I said let her go.

616
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,620
Stay there.

617
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,820
He was loitering around outside.

618
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:48,990
That girl's life is on the line based on what you do.

619
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:52,320
If you touch one strand of her hair,

620
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,320
you're dead.

621
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,690
Let's see. Before I die,

622
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:02,500
aren't you going to die first?

623
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,890
No, right now!

624
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:15,050
If you want to kill me, kill me. But if she get's hurt before that,

625
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:16,990
you'll die in my hands.

626
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:30,090
♫  A slight sprinkle is falling, black tears cover me ♫

627
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:35,300
♫  In my two red eyes, I boxed you up ♫
