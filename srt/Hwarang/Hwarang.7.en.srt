00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,720
Episode 7

2
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,140
If you keep on being like this, my brother won't stay still.

3
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,000
I told you not to talk about your brother, didn't I?

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,380
My brother will arrive soon—

5
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,580
It's my brother!

6
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,020
You know he will kill you if you even breathe!

7
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,540
Why isn't there any noise?

8
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,590
Did he leave?

9
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,260
Is he gone?

10
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,030
The doctor's room!

11
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,560
The doctor's room!

12
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,920
You...

13
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,620
What did you do to her?

14
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,380
Why do you care?

15
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,880
Because you're an amazing brother?

16
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,990
Don't come close to her,

17
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,850
don't look at her,

18
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,010
and don't talk to her.

19
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,660
I don't think I can do that.

20
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,450
No matter what,

21
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,170
I like your sister.

22
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,800
Ou-Out of nowhere, I...

23
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,550
don't feel really good and I...

24
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,170
So...

25
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,970
Wipe it.

26
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,980
Let's call it a day.

27
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,560
Since it's all new to me, I don't know how to be a good brother.

28
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,810
A guy like me...

29
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,860
To be honest, I've never hesitated to do anything in my life.

30
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,510
You...

31
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,520
keep making me stop.

32
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,550
Wait a bit. I'll soon become a real brother.

33
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,510
I think it's one of two possibilities.

34
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:00,060
Either a girl has a crush on him or the guy has a crush on her.

35
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,580
I said I could go home by myself.

36
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,980
Exactly! I told your brother that he doesn't know a thing about you.

37
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,080
You are the one who can even capture a bull immediately if plenty of silver coins are placed in your hands.

38
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,110
He didn't believe what I said at all.

39
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,370
You mean my brother told you to take me home?

40
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,420
Then, why on earth am I taking you home?

41
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,550
It seems that nobody ever thought about who I am that much.

42
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,010
Hold on.

43
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,930
Wait, did you say just like that?

44
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,390
I could even capture and kill a bull for silver coins?

45
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,530
It is not like I am saying something which is incredible.

46
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,530
Ah, really!

47
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,530
But...

48
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,960
Is he really your brother?

49
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,050
What are you saying?

50
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,220
Ah, something is strange to believe so.

51
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,240
I'm sure he said that the necklace belonged to his friend, not him.

52
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,640
What are you talking about?

53
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,620
What are you doing here alone this late?

54
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,150
Why do you care?

55
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,860
I told you to stay with your roommates at all times, according to Hwarang's rule.

56
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,230
Ah just let it be. I'm not even in the mood to talk about it.

57
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,540
Let it be? The ill-mannered bastard.

58
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,100
I heard your nickname is Gae-Sae, right?

59
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,800
You live like a dog and also like a bird.

60
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,650
A half-crazy total freak.

61
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,680
Do not provoke me. I said.

62
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,980
Do you know that?

63
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,040
I quite like a brat like you.

64
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,720
A freak with enemies at every corner,

65
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,090
and full of explosive non-stop rage inside.

66
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,550
So, he ended up to be the one with a terribly narrow perspective.

67
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,640
When I have a brat like you

68
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,560
I feel challenged to transform such a freak.

69
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,450
♫ Grating grating on my torn heart ♫

70
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:23,080
♫ Your cold sighs ♫

71
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,860
Haven't I told you many times that all roommates should act like one person?

72
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,830
Sleeping together, waking up together...

73
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,940
However, one was wandering around at night by himself.

74
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,280
That is something that should never happen again. Don't you think, Gae-Sae?

75
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,590
You are even worse than I thought.

76
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,690
Look at what we're doing because of you!

77
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:50,070
Just hold it up right! It's leaning towards me because of you!

78
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,910
Also, you should see me when we're done with this.

79
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,870
If Pa Oh sees what I am doing, he will pass out.

80
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,690
Now I can see the top of the mountains.

81
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:04,090
♫ You who are turning away turn your feet toward me ♫

82
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,890
♫ I really want you ♫

83
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:10,050
As the Hwarang of Silla, like the sun,

84
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,020
reborn every day, strengthen yourself every day.

85
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,200
Burn whatever pride and prejudice you have,

86
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,590
burn it and be reborn as a brand new person.

87
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,230
Understood?

88
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,990
Yes!
♫ It's gonna be you ♫

89
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,470
♫ Na na na na ♫

90
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,010
♫ Whoa oh oh, I can't let go. ♫

91
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,220
You should do this much. Think about what we did because of you!

92
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,670
If we're punished one more time because of you, I won't stop there.

93
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,640
What a consistent guy.

94
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,320
It's not that easy to be that rude without missing even one chance.

95
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,320
Shouldn't you do my laundry too?

96
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,170
I suffered a lot from lifting that heavy thing!

97
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:08,240
Whatever. Let's hear the reason why you were wandering around that night.

98
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,300
You have a sister, right?

99
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,350
Did you sleep well? Looks like you did.

100
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,460
I couldn't sleep a wink.

101
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,600
What brings you here?

102
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,390
What brings me here is our lips meeting last night.

103
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,850
It seems that you are too naive to know much about a girl, but

104
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,360
girls aren't contemplating that sort of thing—

105
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,650
Uh, I don't have to explain myself.

106
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,430
If you came to apologize then I will consider you did already.

107
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,430
Apologize? What did I do wrong?

108
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,560
Isn't it natural that you should apologize if you made a mistake?

109
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,630
What if it wasn't a mistake?

110
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:11,370
If kissing me out of your childishness wasn't a mistake, then was it just your tantrum?

111
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,380
Wel, I'm saying this because I don't think you know me well.

112
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,240
If I had been in my right mind yesterday, I would have killed you.

113
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,020
Never mind all of that. Let's just say that it never happened. Agree?

114
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,130
Childishness and tantrum?

115
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,160
Pretend it never happened?

116
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,200
Watch what happens if you take one step closer.

117
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,320
I know a few pressure points that will make you impotent, and I will press one of those!

118
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,320
You won't be able to move for a bit. Next time, I'll press the actual pressure point to make you a useless man.

119
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,460
So don't come closer!

120
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,530
Can you lend me just twenty silver coins?

121
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,620
For what? You always said you don't want to owe me anything.

122
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,710
I have a debt that I would give up shame, sense, and care to repay.

123
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,840
Who do you owe?

124
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,340
There's someone like that. The rude, cruel, nervy punk.

125
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,050
A lender is generally like that.

126
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,290
"I have never hesitated for something in my whole life, but you keep making me stop."

127
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,000
If he's saying that, that must be him being worried, right?

128
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,230
Twenty-silver-coins guy, did he say that?

129
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,720
I'm not talking about that guy, I'm talking about another person.

130
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,410
This is why the person who learned love from a book is hopeless.

131
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,870
My dear, worrying is like if a salt seller worries,

132
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,530
"What if it rains today?" and if a wooden clog trader asks,

133
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:53,350
"What if it doesn't rain today?" Those are real concerns.

134
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,860
"You keep making me hesitate."

135
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,180
Isn't that usually a normal way to show love?

136
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,210
Love?

137
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:07,390
So what you're saying is, you're concerned about the other person because of that guy?

138
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:14,130
A girl who has both your hands full with two men. Yeah, I knew you would accomplish a big thing inside.

139
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,440
Love? My ass.

140
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,390
Just eat the rice cake.

141
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,960
You want to know how to treat your sister?

142
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,490
First, just throw away the thought that she is a girl.

143
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,300
A relationship with your sister grows when you handle her roughly.

144
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,800
You see your sister up ahead! What should you do?

145
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,260
Just run, run to her.

146
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:52,730
Then put her in a headlock. After doing a headlock and stroking her, keep her in a headlock!

147
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,110
Clench your teeth until she surrenders.

148
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,090
And then when you go home?

149
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,720
Don't do anything. Call her over and say, "Hey! Come here!"

150
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,200
- "Come here."
- "Hey." Yeah.

151
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,900
Make your sister do every single thing.

152
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,430
Are you actually close to your sister?

153
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,180
Geez.

154
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,590
Sisters are much stronger beings than we think.

155
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,770
And all brothers of younger sisters in this world,

156
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,120
have the duty to make their sisters stronger. If you don't,

157
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,600
- then how would your sister be able to handle this tough world all alone when you can't protect her?
- Oh.

158
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,640
It seems like you finally understand what I'm saying.

159
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,240
So what do you want me to do?

160
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,040
Ah, it's bothering me. How am I supposed to confront Pervert Gong from now on?

161
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,950
If my brother finds out about this, this situation will get complicated.

162
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:53,160
But still, if I leave here, then I won't be able to pay my debt back. Let's endure. Let's endure it! I have to!

163
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,200
Oh my! You scared me!

164
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,690
It looked like you were avoiding me just now.

165
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:05,920
N-No I wasn't. I had to go check up on Pi Joo Gi, that's why.

166
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,550
Oh!

167
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,280
Go. Even though it was my first time,

168
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,670
I did it pretty naturally.

169
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,830
What is this extreme awkwardness?

170
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,960
Did he massage me?

171
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,780
Did Ahn Ji Gong come yet?

172
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,550
They said he came a while ago.

173
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,320
Your Highness!

174
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:53,220
The death spot. This pressure point can take someone's life instantly.

175
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,160
I didn't call you here to cure me.

176
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,290
Do not talk. I'm going to begin acupuncture.

177
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,330
This is the pressure point that will allow you to be calm.

178
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,020
This will make your mind and your body relaxed.

179
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,760
Please take me away.

180
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,130
Please.

181
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:48,950
I'm asking you to run away with me out of this country.

182
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,460
I already have my family here.

183
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,770
I know you got married her out of your resentment towards me.

184
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,750
You cannot change back what has happened.

185
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:05,690
Because of the mute woman who used to serve your household like a dog,

186
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,630
you are turning down my request?

187
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,990
She is no longer a servant. She is my wife.

188
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,330
Are you sure of throwing me away?

189
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:22,290
Are you really going to let me marry my sixty-something-year-old uncle?

190
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,300
The person who threw me away...

191
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,370
was you, Princess.

192
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,660
You're going to regret it if you let go of my hand.

193
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,420
I will definitely make it that way.

194
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,870
How can I believe that you won't,

195
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,230
that you won't kill me with this needle?

196
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,700
Bad blood circulation caused your dizziness. So you will be fine after a short rest.

197
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,740
Tell the palace doctor to take out the acupuncture needle in about 15 minutes.

198
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,500
She looks exactly like her mother.

199
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,130
Your girl is in Seonmoon as a doctor.

200
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,810
I have to frighten you this much in order to see your tensed face.

201
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:13,070
And how do you like it—that feeling of clutching everything I care for in your two hands?

202
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,380
Is it true that I have everything you care about in my hands?

203
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:25,210
So from now on, I'm planning to think of what I can take away from you.

204
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:48,760
So how many characters do you think you can write? I think you'll be the first Hwarang to leave here anyway.

205
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,040
You shouldn't waste your energy.

206
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,560
Even though it wasn't him, it'll be hard for you to stay here

207
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:06,460
Please stop caring about me because I don't particularly care for your business either.

208
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,710
It feels like I've been dumped by you.

209
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:16,000
King and water. Where do you think King Jinheung is?

210
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,480
What difference does it make if you know where he is? A king without a face has no power and he is no king.

211
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,440
Have you ever heard that you're like a tree?

212
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,710
You're consistently cheap, like an evergreen tree.

213
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:40,980
Because the mother bird has no intention to step down, the young bird has to get stronger to keep flying up.

214
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,080
I feel bad for the young bird.

215
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:56,590
I... think... I just saw the king.

216
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:03,110
"Your Majesty!" I heard that. He looked

217
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,910
like a very ordinary king.

218
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,640
King, huh?

219
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,340
Wang (King); Mul (Water)

220
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:36,010
Everyone is out of their mind to think that they can just copy the answer out of the textbook. Don't you think so?

221
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:43,580
It's a cheat sheet. When someone gets flustered, it is hard to think through for an answer.

222
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,780
And what were you doing not stopping him?

223
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,140
Han Seong can just copy my paper since he's next to me.

224
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,560
Oh, Geez.

225
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:58,210
Geez. You could have been perfect otherwise.

226
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,230
Why are you calling me perfect to that extent?

227
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,800
It was not what I meant if you think twice.

228
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,430
But if Dog-Bird doesn't pass this time, what's going to happen?

229
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,610
Then one of his three chances will be gone.

230
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:14,890
Then it won't be easy for him to remain here.

231
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,900
♫  In you breath it becomes the light  ♫

232
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:24,520
Do you want to have power? Do you want to become a member of the royal council?

233
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:32,270
Being a member of the royal council is great because you have fewer responsibilities, and unbelievable power to wield.

234
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:38,720
Once you become a member of the royal council, you will become the owners of this new country for the rest of your lives.

235
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,310
If you want to go higher than where you are now, or protect what you have now.

236
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:52,570
Even if your goal is just to survive, you must pass this.

237
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:57,730
That will become the path towards what you all want.

238
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,690
I'm saying this again, discuss how water relates to a king.

239
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:07,510
It must be based on the Tao Te Ching 
(Chinese textbook of principles).

240
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,410
Well, you may start.

241
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:35,380
Hey! You can't look at someone else's.

242
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:30,300
Brother, please pass. Please.

243
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,190
Over there, who is that?

244
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,140
I see you wrote the third chapter of the Tao Te Ching word for word.

245
00:24:55,110 --> 00:25:00,090
It's hard to rule over the subjective because they have a lot of wisdom.

246
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:04,640
therefore, you have to turn the subjective into water.

247
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,900
Like you mix water in water and wine in wine.

248
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,250
Why? Did I do wrong?

249
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,790
Hm...

250
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,950
It's the same.

251
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,830
I don't know what this is talking about.

252
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:45,570
Do you think I wasted this paper to see you write nonsense?

253
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:51,380
I assigned this task to see what kind of world you are dreaming of.

254
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:57,310
But surprisingly, you don't have any thoughts about your world.

255
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:07,920
Nevertheless, who are the owners of this emptiness and this thoughtlessness?

256
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,900
Kim Ji Dwi and Kim Seon Woo. Did you guys plan to fail?

257
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,750
Or is there a more profound answer beyond my imagination?

258
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:25,980
I don't think that old man, Noza (author of Tao Te Ching), would have expressed himself in writing only.

259
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:32,760
"Moo-wi" is not doing something forcefully. Isn't that what it means?

260
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,660
Do you think that too?

261
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,890
I wouldn't be able to write what I think with the limited letters I know,

262
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,370
so I want to say the answer aloud.

263
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,400
Yo. (forgot to use formal tone)

264
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,990
Then, who wants to go first?

265
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,200
- I will...
- I will start first.

266
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,530
Then you who gave me a blank paper, go first.

267
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:08,630
This Silla's law is based on the Bone Rank System.

268
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,490
Water, "Soo." Flow, "Geo."

269
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:16,720
The law follows wherever the water flows. In other words, it shouldn't force its way out. The law flows naturally like water.

270
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,920
But not everything has a waterway.

271
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:26,830
Some land is arid, and some land is rich. To flow and flow along the natural path,

272
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:32,340
it results in a harmony and an appealing power without offending others.

273
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,820
That should be the king's rule and the king's way.

274
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,830
That's bullsh*t.

275
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,990
"The nobility is structured on top of the lowly, and the high class stands up on a base of the low class."

276
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:52,020
I think this is the worse bullsh*t

277
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:58,170
You dare call the Tao Te Ching nonsense?

278
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:03,480
Waterways flow from high to low. Then,

279
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,520
where can water at the bottom find its path?

280
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,070
A road where the low can become the high.

281
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,340
The road is not only for the waterway that flows from above to below,

282
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:20,470
but also for the waterway which must be dampened through tortuous effort.

283
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,660
I couldn't find that answer in the Tao Te Ching.

284
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,780
No path was born to be a path from the beginning.

285
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,780
Someone has had to walk on first to become a path,

286
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:38,680
and after the soil is molded and formed, then a waterway will form for the first time.

287
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,590
If it is law to turn away the dry land (the lowly), and if that's the king's waterway, that king...

288
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:49,130
That king shouldn't continue as king.

289
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,980
Pass, fail,

290
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:08,720
Pass, fail, pass, fail.

291
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:13,650
Pass, fail, pass.

292
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,260
- Hey!
- You startled me.

293
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,990
Do you think he passed?

294
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,930
Don't you think you're asking too much?

295
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:24,420
Have a conscience! He's just started to learn how to write.

296
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,200
Right?

297
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:33,800
Ah, just stop please. Why are you doing that to those poor herbs?

298
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,390
Oh my gosh, I did this?

299
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,260
I'm sorry.

300
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,650
Pass...

301
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,650
Kim Ki Bo, fail.

302
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,600
Kim Shin, fail.

303
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,240
Kim Jang Hyeon, fail.

304
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,050
Seok Han Seong

305
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:02,250
You copied all three chapters of the "Tao Te Ching." It's fail for you too.

306
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,330
Ah, why.

307
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:07,420
Kim Soo Ho, fail.

308
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,440
Kim Yeo Wool, fail.

309
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,030
Park Ban Ryu.

310
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,870
- Pass.
- Wow

311
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,480
Kim Ji Dwi.

312
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,620
You have passed.

313
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:37,320
Not because I like your answer, but because it is based on the "Tao Te Ching."

314
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:42,290
Kim Seon Woo.

315
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,940
You have failed.

316
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:54,670
It isn't that I didn't like your answer, but I asked you to base your answer on the "Tao Te Ching."

317
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:59,700
You called the "Tao Te Ching" rubbish, so because of that, I cannot pass you.

318
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,680
It's a pity that we're left with so much kindling paper.

319
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:11,230
Today's lecture ends here. Everyone may go out.

320
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:31,680
Hey. You only have two chances from now. Didn't I tell you the result would be the same?

321
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,090
You will have to use your vain effort twice and get kicked out.

322
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,510
Go.

323
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:55,570
If it is law to turn away the dry land, and if that's the king's waterway, that king

324
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:59,390
shouldn't continue as king.

325
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:02,120
Ah, he's such a tough cookie.

326
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,930
Why did that guy fail?

327
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:11,140
Aigoo, who is this? Is it my fake nephew?

328
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:16,130
So, you said you would bring down the Queen Dowager. Is that going well?

329
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,640
Originally, did you not have the same thoughts as that guy?

330
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,980
You hate the arrogance of the high officials and think of the subjects first.

331
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,980
What king could look up from below?

332
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,240
The hidden king would be able to, don't you think?

333
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,570
You seem to anticipate a lot from the king who has no face.

334
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:43,090
Did you not as well, Poong Wol Joo? So, isn't that why you oppose the regency?

335
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,720
What would I know about the King?

336
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,140
A child, who couldn't protect his body and was busy hiding,

337
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,960
what can he do once he returns?

338
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:02,690
The young and useless king will not be able to do anything among the deceitful officials.

339
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:09,660
There is no longer a reason for the Queen to stay in power. And the unprepared king

340
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:16,830
will be an anguish for this Silla. So that's why I made Hwarang.

341
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:24,520
Silla's future, the future must be protected.

342
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:36,250
If you figure out a way to protect Silla even with the Queen dragged down,

343
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:43,460
find me again then. Anyway, I was having a hard time catching fish even without you. Now you made it worse.

344
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,550
You can go.

345
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,990
Fail?

346
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,530
Kim Ji Dwi.

347
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,070
What is this?

348
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:16,150
No way. This is a blank sheet. Why is it a pass? But my brother who wrote several, is a fail?

349
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:24,050
Oh! I've got it! This is the so-called corruption in Hwarang.

350
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,360
I just can't let this go.

351
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,610
How could this be? Aigoo.

352
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:37,920
Ah, okay. I heard from Pi Joo Gyoo that you are working here. I'm busy with some personal issue.

353
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,450
How could you really do this?

354
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:43,940
Abuse of powerful one towards the weak. A true bone is innocent! A nobody is guilty.

355
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,390
You pampered your nephew too much.

356
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:49,500
Ah, what are you taking about? Move.

357
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:56,150
When a blank sheet is a pass, how can this be a fail with an elaborate answer written by a beginner in writing?

358
00:34:56,150 --> 00:35:02,150
Ah, that, the assignment was on "Tao Te Ching," but that guy... Anyway, move!

359
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:06,230
Enough! If you are like this, I cannot overlook this.

360
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,420
So what do you want?

361
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:13,330
The research on the young noblemen, you remember that, right?

362
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:19,970
I will tell to each official, how at Poong Wol Joo's request, I conducted a secret investigation.

363
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:22,570
Whatever you want!

364
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:27,010
Ah, ha! You don't know. This isn't a simple issue, is it?

365
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:33,330
They'll say that it is illegal monitoring and that we should annihilate Hwarang. Then, the Queen will be in trouble, too.

366
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,000
Just!

367
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:51,300
So, the girl with 100 talents, what do we want?

368
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,730
Don't do that next time. Do you understand?

369
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,210
It looks like I can finally go...

370
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,290
Ah, I need to go inside.

371
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,300
It's the silver you lent me last time.

372
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,060
Now that there's nothing left, let's not cross paths again.

373
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:44,530
But why were you going to learn how to write from me?

374
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:49,640
Apparently you must have some strong support for you to be able to submit a blank sheet and receive a pass.

375
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,590
I wasn't able to help out my brother because of you and he failed.

376
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:57,360
I should have supported him until the end. It's all ruined because of you.

377
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:02,850
So you're saying that you couldn't be concerned about your brother because you were concerned about me?

378
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,780
Those words make me feel the best out of all the things you have said.

379
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,290
I didn't mean to say it that way.

380
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,370
Well, that can't be considered nothing.

381
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:14,980
That thing happened between the two of us, so it can't be considered nothing.

382
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:20,600
It's not because we kissed. I felt bad for you.

383
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:25,770
You seemed lonely and didn't know where to fit in.

384
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,120
I was like that too...

385
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,380
since I've been lonely before.

386
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:39,290
That's why I was like that. Now there won't be an incident like that ever again.

387
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:45,600
What do I have to do? What do I have to do for you to look at me?

388
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:50,790
When I look at you, I go crazy because I feel like I become nothing.

389
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:55,290
- Don't mess with me—
- I don't know who I am or what I'm doing when I think about you.

390
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,570
I don't.

391
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,760
Can we go inside today?

392
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:30,340
This person, how many times has this been? Call the Chief Officer at once!

393
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,330
Let's have a glass of red wine in thirty years.

394
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:51,870
But this Wi Hwa Gong person!

395
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:56,500
Let's go. There will be another opportunity next time.

396
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,520
- Yeong Sil Gong...
- I only came here to see someone I wanted to see.

397
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:05,250
Please let us in next time.

398
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,590
Let's go.

399
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:12,020
This is not the only place with someone I want to see.

400
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:46,040
It's been a while, Ahn Ji Gong.

401
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:54,320
I heard you found your son. Congratulations.

402
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,420
I heard that he is a Hwarang.

403
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:02,170
He is the Hwarang that the Queen Dowager picked herself?

404
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:06,780
You are weak and your kidney function is getting worse,

405
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:10,600
so you will have to be careful with your regimen.

406
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,620
For now, I will do moxibustion and do acupuncture. I will prescribe medicine.

407
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,090
You should get a servant to get it.

408
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:26,290
It will be something much better than what I have.

409
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:35,520
They say that a woman's jealousy can call for snow, even in summer.

410
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:41,710
A lot of time has passed.

411
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:46,520
But even time failed to resolve the woman's resentment.

412
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,140
Don't you know that fact the best?

413
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,980
I think

414
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,110
we have the same point of view.

415
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,240
Does Pervert Gong really like me?

416
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:10,280
He's not bad. He's the nephew of the Chief Officer, and it doesn't look like he's from a household that has nothing.

417
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,950
If he studied in the West, then he probably has a lot of knowledge.

418
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:16,390
His appearance... Even if I look at him objectively, he's good.

419
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:24,230
What am I saying? Especially on a day like this. I'm definitely crazy to be thinking these things.

420
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,840
- What kind of day is it today?
- You scared me.

421
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,910
It's just well...

422
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,970
Nothing much.

423
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:40,740
Return safely. Only go on big roads, and go with Pi Joo Gyoo.

424
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:49,160
I heard everyone failed, so don't be too upset.

425
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:53,040
It's the Chief Officer's fault for assigning a question like that. It's not your fault.

426
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,120
And in my opinion, you did pretty well.

427
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,280
I got it, so go.

428
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:17,070
It's Mother's memorial day.

429
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,370
I said today is Mother's memorial day.

430
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:30,850
Don't worry. I've prepared her memorial rite by myself every year. I will tell her that I met you during the rite and she'll be happy.

431
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:34,530
You have to be here, so I'll do it.

432
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,710
Is this... a vegetable side dish?

433
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:48,150
It tastes good. It feels like it's homemade.

434
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,470
Why are you here?

435
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:54,670
I'm comfortable here. And it's even. Six.

436
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,520
I warned you that you can't endure staying here, right?

437
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,970
Since you already got a fail, it doesn't seem like you will be able to stay here for long.

438
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:10,850
Are you that happy that you passed? I think Dog-Bird had the best answer out of the right answers.

439
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:11,900
What?

440
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,790
Everyone else thinks that way, no?

441
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,100
Is something called a memorial that important?

442
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,000
Is it that important?

443
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,880
Whose memorial is it?

444
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,450
She said it's my mother's.

445
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:41,660
Then shouldn't you go home? The assignment is over too.

446
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,280
It's her memorial day.

447
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,880
I said today is Mother's memorial day

448
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:09,280
This is no different from prison. The assignment is over, so why do I have to sleep with you guys?

449
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,300
Then you can leave.

450
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:18,990
You said it's like prison. And you'll have to leave for the memorial.

451
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:25,850
I'm warning you guys. Don't do unnecessary things and get me into trouble.

452
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:29,410
What are you cooking up? You're not the type of person to do something without a backup plan.

453
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:33,030
I played little tricks.

454
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,060
What is this?

455
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:42,860
It's something my mother prepared when I came here.

456
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:46,280
It's a precious medicinal wine from the West.

457
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,370
She told me to gift it to the Chief Officer and the Master.

458
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,540
Thank you.

459
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,050
It's not a medicinal wine, but a pass-out wine

460
00:44:57,050 --> 00:45:00,580
It's so strong that just one drink will make the whole body relax

461
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,950
Ah, it's hot!

462
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:06,630
And if you have two drinks, then you wouldn't recognize your parents. "The end" wine.

463
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:10,510
So you're saying this place is completely defenseless?

464
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:13,730
If you want to leave you can leave, and if you want to stay you can stay.

465
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:19,560
But it might be best to leave since everyone is going to be responsible.

466
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,760
Do you think this crazy act makes sense?

467
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,950
If you don't like it, you can tell them, but we'll be outside by then.

468
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,090
What do you want to do?

469
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,880
I'll have to leave.

470
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:37,560
Don't you have a reason to leave?

471
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:57,550
What is this? Did the wine not work?

472
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,450
Did it not go through? I definitely gave him a bottle.

473
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:07,470
It's a wine that you can't resist even if you smell it.

474
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:16,010
Instead of it being the end for the wine, it's going to be the end for us!

475
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,740
What is this?

476
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:41,180
What did I tell you? I said it's "The End" wine.

477
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,230
- Let's go.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

478
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,910
These guys, seriously!

479
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:20,320
Let's meet here at dawn and go back in together.

480
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,960
Let's go, let's go.

481
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,790
Location sponsored by Korean Folk Village

482
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:54,260
You scared me to death. Now are you going to be wandering at night?

483
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:58,090
Please don't play around with those kids. You still have your royal position.

484
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,770
Stop nagging and just lead my way.

485
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:02,720
Where are you going in the middle of the night?

486
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:06,330
Home.

487
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:30,470
Your Highness, it's that flower again.

488
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:33,530
It's a flower that doesn't bloom within the palace.

489
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:56,490
What do you think you're doing?

490
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,920
I'm just sitting in my seat for a bit.

491
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,430
Do you think you have the strength to be in that seat?

492
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:11,530
No. Just as you said, I'm too small and weak.

493
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:17,180
It's a relief that you realized that. Then, leave the Hwarang immediately.

494
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:22,630
Once you leave Hwarang quietly, I'll take care of the rest.

495
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:27,620
The more I wait for it, the stronger you get.

496
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,180
A small child can't walk from the beginning.

497
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:36,220
Step by step. He has to get strength in his legs and experience what it's like to fall

498
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,610
to finally know how to walk.

499
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:41,800
No path was born to be a path from the beginning..

500
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,090
Someone has had to walk there first for it to become a path,

501
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:51,250
and after the soil is molded and formed, then a waterway will form for the first time.

502
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:57,480
I need to walk in order to

503
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:01,930
go on the King's path.

504
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:09,690
I will become stronger by being in Hwarang, Mother.

505
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:39,590
I met my brother whom I have been searching for all that time.

506
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:42,530
But it's still just the two of us for the memorial, Father.

507
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:44,200
♬ Your aching heart displays everything♬

508
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,520
But since we found Brother,

509
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,720
don't feel sorry towards mother anymore.

510
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,840
Okay. I'll do that.

511
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,910
I'm curious about something.

512
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:02,320
Did something happen to Brother?

513
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:09,420
You see, when Brother first came here, he barely survived after almost dying.

514
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:15,950
He definitely went through something tough, but it's a bit much to ask him about it directly.

515
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:22,640
♬ I'm afraid the more I try to wipe it out, the more I will be left yearning♬

516
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:33,550
♬ So I can't let it go ♬

517
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:44,040
♬ Although you and I became tears for each other♬

518
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:51,630
♬ After time passed on a bright day♬

519
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:56,940
♬ when we just held each other and it was just like a dream♬

520
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,550
In the end, you end up here?

521
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:06,940
♬ I remember that time then.♬

522
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

523
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,070
Wait here. I'll go get the servant.

524
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:27,310
It's late, so why call a servant?

525
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,760
Let's not make a scene.

526
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,800
Yes.

527
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:56,180
Oh, they're so handsome! So handsome!

528
00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:01,490
You said you missed the outside air. What's your reaction to those women?

529
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,650
Each one of those is half-ripe,

530
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:10,080
like a flower with no grace.

531
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:27,980
Oh my, look at him! He looks so handsome!

532
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,850
Aish!

533
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:53,770
He's so crazy. He left and is walking around at this time of night?

534
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:04,480
Is it today? The day when I get pay-back?

535
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,320
Look forward to it,

536
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,260
and experience it yourself!

537
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:29,800
How is this feeling? You always put me in a headlock, what a sight!

538
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:49,580
Isn't she your sister?

539
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,630
What?

540
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,110
Why are you doing this to me?

541
00:54:56,110 --> 00:55:00,540
What is this? Did Ban Ryu violate that girl?

542
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:05,330
Is it okay for Hwarang to act that way? He just touched as he pleased!

543
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:10,380
I-I did what?

544
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,740
The truth is, you looked like him from behind...

545
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,530
Hey! Come out!

546
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:26,290
Ban Ryu! Ban Ryu! You! What did you do to my sister?!

547
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:32,740
Tell me! What did this jerk do to you?!

548
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:35,590
No, it's not that...

549
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:39,340
You knew she was my sister, so you did this on purpose, didn't you?

550
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,730
Hold it in, okay?

551
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:44,100
Brother, the truth is—

552
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:49,440
Don't speak. I'll handle everything, so stay still.

553
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:54,250
Today, I am going to kill you.

554
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,680
Oh! Aigo.

555
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,860
Aigo.

556
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,190
Sorry.

557
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:20,110
Are you okay?

558
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,260
Are you really okay?

559
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,170
How did you get out?

560
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,600
By climbing over the wall.

561
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,880
What is this? Did you just leave because you got a fail?

562
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,690
I didn't just leave. I will go back in before I get caught.

563
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,370
If you're going in so soon, why did you even leave?

564
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:52,820
It's her memorial. You said that.

565
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:55,640
It's her birthday.

566
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:59,260
Mother's birthday.

567
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:03,940
♫  That path that I have found  ♫

568
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:08,460
I don't know Mother's memorial day because we don't know when she passed away.

569
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:12,350
♫  Like a dream  ♫

570
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:16,300
Since you're here, I feel reassured.

571
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:20,830
So whether you get in trouble or not, I don't want to think about that now.

572
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:26,350
Right now, I just like that you're next to me.

573
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:34,570
♫  In your breath it became light ♫

574
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:38,890
Ah, I miss Mother's scent.

575
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:44,010
On a day like this, Mother would touch my hair.

576
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:50,420
And the sound of wind and mountain birds were my lullaby.

577
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:54,550
What, why? Was Mother's lullaby nothing much?

578
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:56,470
♫ I will never  ♫

579
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:57,520
Brother.

580
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:03,300
♫  I won't let you go. You're my everything.  ♫

581
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,860
Mother couldn't sing lullabies

582
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:12,960
because she couldn't speak.

583
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:26,760
♬ Although you and I became tears for each other♬

584
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:34,270
♬ After time passed on a bright day♬
