1
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,850
Fifteen hundred years ago, for 12 years Jin Heung has been

2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,450
the uneasy ruler of Silla, the smallest and weakest of the Three Kingdoms.

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:27,950
The young Jin Heung, whose life was threatened, has been in exile without revealing his identity.

4
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,660
The queen mother, who has been the regent, in order to enhance her royal authority

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:37,150
would like to gather the flower of Silla manhood for Silla's future.

6
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,800
It's bribing day so I am busy. Can't you just go?
Mangmang (Bark Bark) Village In the twelfth year of Jin Heung's reign

7
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,930
There can't be two heads in one village.

8
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,870
You do it. Head.

9
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,990
- What is this funny business?
- It's not funny business, I'm nervous, punk.

10
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,210
If I make trouble one more time the old man said to go ahead and kill me.

11
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,660
Isn't that great? I don't have to beat you up...

12
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,710
And the head or whatever, you can do it.

13
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,900
So, go.

14
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,330
While your mother threw you away, I heard she didn't even want to name you?

15
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,260
Then you should live as if dead. Why do you keep bugging me?

16
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,800
I'll become relaxed if I keep this up.

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,240
Hey, hey, hey. He took it out.
~ Episode 1 ~

18
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,580
- What is that?
A Jooryeongoo. (A 14 sided die used to determine a drinking penalty during the Silla dynasty).

19
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,130
He makes a choice with that.

20
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,880
This person's nose. (Reading the Chinese character on the die.)

21
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,780
Hit the nose.

22
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,590
You guys... are lucky today.

23
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,340
- Hey, Seon Bang, Seon Bang! ("Hit first" in Korean)
- Hey!

24
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,480
Did I hit him? I did, huh?

25
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,190
You did!

26
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,330
- What the heck?
- Hey!

27
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,410
Don't touch him. Fight with me, huh?

28
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,070
Hey!

29
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,690
Aish!

30
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,610
You little!

31
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,040
Really...!

32
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,810
I'm sorry! I was wrong!

33
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,930
Guys...

34
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,370
You guys,

35
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,850
what are you doing?

36
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,000
You should have woken up earlier. I got hit already.

37
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,160
Are you hurt a lot?

38
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,400
Yeah, but don't kill them though.

39
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,470
You jerks.

40
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,360
Run.

41
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,410
R-U-N!

42
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,250
I'm okay!

43
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,600
Here!

44
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,320
Whatcha gonna do now?!

45
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,840
Come at us! Try it!

46
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,880
Come at us!

47
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,890
Hey, but what was his nickname?

48
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,290
- Dog-bird-gong.
- Why?

49
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,250
He's like a dog.

50
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,470
Also like a bird.

51
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,520
This Dog-Bird.

52
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:51,010
Queen Ji So (mother of King Jin Heung)

53
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,330
- Put on your best behavior before the Queen.
- Yes.

54
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,530
How can the prior king's close friend

55
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,470
be locked up here?

56
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,030
I didn't like the deceased majesty at the end.

57
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,410
Because I had sexual relations with his concubine,

58
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,040
they all said I had played around.

59
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,760
You must not like this sacred kingdom.

60
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,640
This is the country where a mother kicked out her own son.

61
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,080
A mother who couldn't get rid of her greed even after being regent for ten years.

62
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,210
So, I have no choice but to not like it.

63
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,870
- Have you thought about it?
- I have heard

64
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,430
Queen Dowager had a keen intellect. Suppose that's so, that's all.

65
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,460
But I think those rumors were false.

66
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,240
I'm a very exhausted person.

67
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,520
Why do you keep saying the same thing?

68
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,170
Yes, what? What? What will you do?

69
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:26,970
I plan to make a group of guards that will give up their lives for the king.

70
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,370
A group of guards. Sounds good.

71
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,970
But all the soldiers are being used by officials.

72
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,970
Who else would hold weapons and shoot arrows for the king?

73
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,620
Will you get them from Baekje dynasty? Or Goguryeo dynasty?

74
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,200
I'm planning to recruit the sons of the officials.

75
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,910
Please teach them.

76
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,410
Instead of their parents and families, they need to

77
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,340
become loyal to the king and the country.

78
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,760
Do you think I will do that?

79
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,990
Did you not want me to give up my regency?

80
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,530
If you achieve this work...

81
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,150
I will step down cleanly.

82
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,300
Aish.

83
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,710
What did I tell you? I used to live in the capital.

84
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,490
But can you smile in moments like these?

85
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,370
If I can get to the capital, I think I will be able to find it with this.

86
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,060
So no matter what, we're going over there. Okay?

87
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,570
And don't chicken out again.

88
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:46,110
If a villager like me goes over there, they'll be shot by arrows and die from being stabbed by spears.

89
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,580
A-A-And get their n-neck sliced.

90
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,680
Then why don't you just not go?

91
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,270
But it's my home.

92
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:56,710
It's my hometown where my father, mother and also my younger sister lived together.

93
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,070
I'll find my father with this,

94
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,200
and I will find out my identity too.

95
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,860
I bet you won't find anything.

96
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,510
People usually find that that stuff with these things.

97
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,110
You don't even know anything.

98
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,780
But pointlessly...

99
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,260
Will you be okay because of me?

100
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,930
You're going to the city gate alone; it's going to take you several days.

101
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,710
And I wanted to go to this place, so I will go.

102
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,170
All people are the same. Because I'm Cheonin (peasant, lowest rank in Silla society), does it make sense saying I can't go?

103
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,310
Dog-Bird.

104
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,520
Why are you so fearless?

105
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,640
He who has a lot is the one with fear.

106
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,680
There's nothing I'm scared of.

107
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,070
Pament!!

108
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,880
- Huh?
- We're dead meat!

109
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,680
Hey, payment!

110
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,480
Hey... It looks like they're not here yet.

111
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,340
Let's go.

112
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,010
It's not here.

113
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,000
Oh, my.

114
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,520
Whoa...

115
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,990
Here. Take this.

116
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,860
When you don't know when or where you'll fall.

117
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,050
You almost killed me!

118
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,460
It's your fate to live here quietly and die.

119
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,070
How many times have I told you?

120
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,910
Wait. That guy—

121
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,670
You fool.

122
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,960
Why do you think your mother abandoned you here?

123
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,770
Your jokes—your jokes are too much.

124
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,340
There isn't anyone in the world who would welcome you.

125
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,420
That's why you don't even have names.

126
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,270
Ah, you've been saying that for ten years now!

127
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,650
Stop it! Do you really want to see me dead?

128
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,480
If there isn't enough gold to pay, don't you know the villagers will get beat up?

129
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,080
I do. But I also had a reason to—

130
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,800
Did you have a reason to fight with innocent kids?

131
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,670
Ah, seriously!

132
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,040
It's a message from Pa Oh.

133
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,750
Tomorrow evening in the hour of the ghosts (2 am) he will pass through the East Gate.

134
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,300
Without my order, he came into the capital?

135
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,640
I will bring him back quietly.

136
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,250
Is that guy really the king?

137
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,510
I never knew I would be able to see him like this even in my dreams.

138
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,890
His Majesty's manliness is truly impressive.

139
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,050
Ah scary, that scared me.

140
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,110
Dog-Bird!

141
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:15,340
Hey! What's wrong? Did you see something?

142
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,620
No.

143
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,760
Are you sure we only have this?

144
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,670
You're not doing this to me on purpose, right?

145
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,210
Shut your mouth and come up quickly.

146
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,930
Hurry.

147
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,320
Careful. Careful.

148
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,590
We did it.

149
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,160
Breathe. Breathe.

150
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,470
- Breathe and then take a look.
- Why?

151
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,280
Be quiet! Be quiet!

152
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,500
Quiet! Be quiet!

153
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,250
Are those real heads?

154
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,970
Are we also going to become like that?

155
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,340
Hush! Hush!

156
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,390
Hey! Hey!

157
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,330
You said seeing your sister is your wish. Do you not want to see her?

158
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,310
I-I have to see her.

159
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,450
Then don't get scared and let's just look forward and go. What's the problem?

160
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,620
There is no problem.

161
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,800
I'm okay. Are you okay?

162
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,220
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

163
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,780
Let's go. Hurry in.

164
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,350
Don't look. Yes, don't look.

165
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,420
Don't look.

166
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,700
Don't look!

167
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,590
- Hurry.
- Hey.

168
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,870
Hurry.

169
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,140
How does it look?

170
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,230
Let's see.

171
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,260
Turn around.

172
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,430
Hey! You look so different!

173
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,710
Hey, being in the capital is not a big deal. We freaked out for nothing, right?

174
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:15,050
In the end, it's exactly the same.

175
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,050
We look even better.

176
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,050
There was a world like this.

177
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,170
What do we do now?

178
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:38,640
What do you mean? You said we'd find your father and sister with that necklace.

179
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,050
Was it me?

180
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,510
So embarrassing.

181
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,650
Are you hungry?

182
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,700
People don't die so easily.

183
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,670
So, what happened?

184
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,040
The woman who survived death...

185
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,950
is really marked precisely with a mole, right here.

186
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,170
Mole?

187
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,100
And then?

188
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,970
No one could recognize her.

189
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,300
How could that be?

190
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,430
If you haven't done it, don't say it. This mole...really.

191
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:30,640
If you look at it like this...

192
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,080
A person's face can change.

193
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,480
Faces change.

194
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,430
And so? Did that woman kill that man?

195
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:47,570
Deep at night, having the boy who was going to kill her pinned to the ground,

196
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,900
staring at him, she said to him.

197
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,970
Why did you meet me just to hurt me?

198
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,660
I— Do I love you?

199
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,580
Inside me, there's you.

200
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,270
Were you possibly asleep?

201
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,210
Me?

202
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,730
Yes.

203
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,600
Excuse me.

204
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,150
Where did the woman telling the story earlier go?

205
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,310
No. Where can I meet her?

206
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:27,160
Ah. What am I going to do? I feel so sorry. One more round?

207
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,750
Would we be able to find someone using this?

208
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,360
It's a rare thing. So if you go to Daiso or Okta shops

209
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,340
you might be able to meet someone who knows where it's from.

210
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,580
DaiI what? Tagook?

211
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,640
- What's that?
- You're not from here, huh?

212
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,240
Where are you from?

213
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,010
I'm— I'm from around here!

214
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,140
I'm a person from this kingdom!

215
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,840
Sang!

216
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,330
I put everything on the line.

217
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,610
Ta-da.

218
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,150
It's Sang. Aigoo.

219
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,540
Aigoo.

220
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,710
Wait. That's all I've got. Just one more time, please.

221
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,410
One more time!

222
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,080
What are you going to put on the line this time?

223
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,290
How about your neck?

224
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,920
Why, why, why?

225
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,650
In Capital City, there are some people who want other's necks.

226
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:55,330
Well, her neck is fine too.

227
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,970
Bet with me.

228
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,390
Do... Do you have anything to bet?

229
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,660
I thought you wanted heads.

230
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,890
This is what I'm betting.

231
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,930
Crazy guy.

232
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,730
It's one round, will you be okay?

233
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,960
Fine.

234
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,210
If you win, all that I've got today, I'll leave it all.

235
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,250
I don't want that, though.

236
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,000
If I win, you lay down your neck too.

237
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,930
It's one round, will you be okay?

238
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,830
Sang!

239
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,540
Hey, you suicidal idiot.

240
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,290
Do wish to die so badly?

241
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,340
Did you know?

242
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,460
If a dog is scared, he barks for a long time.

243
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,670
Stop barking and shall we reveal it?

244
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,950
Who exactly are you?

245
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,400
Me?

246
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,940
Dog-Bird.

247
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,630
Are you perhaps...

248
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,730
Dog-Bird...

249
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,660
Jerk from Mang Mang Village! (Barking sounds)

250
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,850
- How did you end up here?
- What are you doing?

251
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,990
Hurry and leave. You all heard, right?

252
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,440
What you're betting is your head.

253
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,900
If you give up now, I will let you go nicely.

254
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,020
No way.

255
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,270
Life is about either living or dying, anyway.

256
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,630
We don't know the winner. Why are you stopping me?

257
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,450
Are you saying you cheated?

258
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,700
If you're confident, then open it!

259
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,870
Hey, is this a scam?

260
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,620
After him!

261
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,570
Catch him!

262
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,900
- Go that way.
- Will you be okay?

263
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,710
Let's meet at the closest inn near the gate.

264
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,830
Go quickly!

265
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,440
Hey, I'm here. I'm going this way.

266
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,650
Catch him!!

267
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,690
Catch him!

268
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,490
He disappeared like a ghost.

269
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,070
Dog-Bird.

270
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:42,080
Catch him! No matter what, catch him!

271
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:08,570
Table 3, one Chrysanthemum tea and one omija (five taste tea).

272
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,240
What's wrong with him?

273
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,420
Does he have a cramp in his finger?

274
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,480
Do I have to go over there?

275
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,880
What is the matter?

276
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,400
Is this your shop?

277
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,600
It is.

278
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,600
Looking in front, there is a place similar to a whore house.

279
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,800
Ah, that's one of our association.

280
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:59,670
For direct transaction. The general merchandise shop right next to it is our headquarters.

281
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,010
This place is a branch.

282
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,020
Your face reading reads "poor," but

283
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,850
you were able to grow such a business? Your skills are really good.

284
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:12,870
Are you praising or cursing me?

285
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,420
Why?

286
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,090
Why are you doing this?

287
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,790
I'm looking for something very special.

288
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:22,690
By special you mean...

289
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,590
That?

290
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,100
What is your preference?

291
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,310
Not a woman.

292
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,270
Then?

293
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,030
A young man.

294
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,170
A youthful and beautiful man would do.

295
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,600
This is Daiso, with all the trendy things in Silla.

296
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,600
If someone is doing well in their own way, they will stop by here for sure.

297
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:10,000
Hold on. How did you think of that?

298
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,240
What do you call this?

299
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,730
Since it's made of Al (gem), you can call it Alba.

300
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:21,850
Alba because it's made of Al.

301
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:27,110
So are you saying that you want the delayed payment?

302
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:33,580
I'm also in a bad situation. Please give it to me today.

303
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:39,020
Here is your payment.

304
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,610
This—

305
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,690
This is my payment after three months?

306
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,740
You've been taking and drinking everything anyway.

307
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,350
- Whether you ate it or sold it.
- I never did anything like that.

308
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,050
Let's go to Si-Jun to ask right and wrong.
(Si-Jun is the office which controls the marketplace)

309
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,700
Si-Jun?

310
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:03,980
Because I've been calling you "my lady," you really think you're one.

311
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,700
Even though your father is the most loyal man in the country,

312
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,940
if your mother is a Cheonin, there is no difference between you and me.

313
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,620
Where did this thieving girl come from?

314
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,720
Thief?

315
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,540
I gave you that so get out quickly.

316
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,410
Get out quickly!

317
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,880
It is what you caused.

318
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:51,130
What do you think you're doing?

319
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,150
Are you crazy?

320
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,140
Hey! Do you know how much this is? How much do you want?

321
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,510
This is worth a lot.

322
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,220
The payments from now on,

323
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,680
I'll keep it in my stomach.

324
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,020
Consuming liquor jars one by one per month.

325
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,960
Three jars.

326
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,550
Lady, buy some rice cake.

327
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,370
How can he see me as a thief?

328
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:41,050
Man, why is the ground so close to me since earlier?

329
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,970
Go away.

330
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:47,380
Go away.

331
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,580
Aigo, you there! Stop! Those bastards!

332
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:06,420
Didn't I tell you to stop stealing? I told you to stop!

333
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,340
Shoe...

334
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:32,530
Shoe, shoe!

335
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:39,120
Please get my shoe for me. I can't get up.

336
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,410
Over there. Over there.

337
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,340
Let go.

338
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,810
I only have one pair of shoes.

339
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:52,700
Why can't you? It's not a hard task.

340
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,960
How cruel! Why doesn't he pick it for me?

341
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,680
My shoe...

342
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:14,520
Move! Move!

343
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,960
♫ I think of you any moment. It gets bigger and bigger ♫

344
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,570
♫ You're the reason I smile, it's only you all day ♫

345
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:42,810
♫ You're acting as nothing is happening, should I make the first move? ♫

346
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:47,290
Is this why you shouldn't drink on an empty stomach? (It can cause hallucinations.)

347
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,030
- Are you okay?
- You're very good looking.

348
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,290
Totally.

349
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:03,490
Well, if you're not okay I can't help either.

350
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:17,650
You could have picked up my shoe. Not kind.

351
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,960
Ah, that guy.

352
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,460
What's wrong with her?

353
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:55,710
It's done. It's done.

354
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:11,860
It's healed well. We might have been in trouble if the wound had been deeper.

355
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:20,930
A homeless guy, like me... It's a routine to get beaten up.

356
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,790
You always look after me like this.

357
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:33,590
And the child from last time?

358
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,830
It's not him this time either.

359
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:41,550
He's younger than your child, and never lived in the capital city.

360
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:45,780
Really? I see.

361
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,690
Anyway, thank you for your concern.

362
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:54,380
You will find him. You've looked everywhere these past ten years.

363
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,750
He will soon appear.

364
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,940
He has to.

365
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:43,130
King Jin Heung, Sam Maek Jong - King of the 24th generation of Silla

366
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,200
Why did you come here?

367
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:05,540
27th years of King Beop Heung's reign - 11 years ago

368
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:16,830
Your Highness, His Majesty has passed away.

369
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,320
We have to protect the last Sacred Bone of the kingdowm tonight with whatever it takes. ("Sacred Bone" -- someone of royal lineage maternally and paternally)

370
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,270
- Hurry and call Pa Oh!
- Yes.

371
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:56,680
Please protect the crown prince. He must survive.

372
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,200
You haven't changed one bit.

373
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,920
I asked why you are here? Did you come here because you did not trust me?

374
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,140
Is it strange that I am here? It should be strange that I am not here.

375
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,930
There are still a lot of people who are after your life.

376
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:23,850
We can't trust any of our soldiers or eunuchs in the palace.

377
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:27,590
- Do you not know the situation?
- How can I not know?

378
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:31,280
To live out here so freely

379
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:35,350
is all thanks to you.

380
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:40,400
But do you know these words?

381
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:47,830
Even if I catch ten thieves out in the mountains, I can't even catch the one thief that is in my heart.

382
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:55,510
It seems like I've spent a lot of time around the wrong people, and I'm now suspecting a lot of people.

383
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:59,610
Are you afraid I will steal your throne?

384
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,340
Do you not trust me?

385
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,080
What is so important about trusting or not?

386
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:09,470
I am just checking to see if my throne is doing well.

387
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,680
I merely came to just to check on that.

388
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:16,850
If I didn't do this, I felt I would have forgotten who I was.

389
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,480
You weak bastard.

390
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,270
I decide when you re-enter this world.

391
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:28,810
Until then, live as if you are a dead mouse.

392
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:40,310
So, last night the doors to the palace opened?

393
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:43,860
There was no guard on duty between 1 and 3 am.

394
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,680
And during that time, someone went into the palace.

395
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:55,660
Is it someone Queen Ji So brought? I think I know.

396
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,830
Are you saying Sam Maek Dong was here?

397
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:03,240
Is it possible it was something else? What should we do?

398
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,380
I will ask the guards to look for an assassin.

399
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:12,470
Let's see whose head will be cut.

400
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,740
Come quickly.

401
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,770
Why is he taking so long?

402
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:29,020
Are you a thief?

403
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,480
If you're not a thief, are you an assassin?

404
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,130
You have no experience in using a knife.

405
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:55,580
Sheesh. Your knife blade is all worn out.

406
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:00,410
You have to drink because you're too scared to kill someone.

407
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:06,040
I see. How much is my life worth?

408
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,580
Who knows? I can pay you more than what it's worth!

409
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:15,900
They said that if I killed a True Bone they'd give me three bags of rice! ( "True Bone" - royalty but not the immediate family of the King)

410
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,270
Three bags of rice?

411
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,770
They'll give you three bags of rice? Did you hear that, Pa Oh?

412
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:44,250
Are you okay, Your Majesty?

413
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,800
He was an ignorant lad who knew nothing. Did you really have to kill him?

414
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,720
He saw your face.

415
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,680
What kind of man attempts to kill the king for three bags of rice?

416
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,410
It was the queen dowager's command.

417
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,630
Queen Dowager's command?

418
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,070
Then it can't be helped.

419
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:47,040
This city is hers.

420
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,630
Your Majesty.

421
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,560
Your Majesty.

422
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,810
The fugitive is me.

423
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:21,310
I-I-I think I just saw the king.

424
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,490
What?

425
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:28,290
His Majesty. I said that's exactly what I heard.

426
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:34,480
In the capital, it's just the king.

427
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,080
He sleeps just anywhere.

428
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:42,800
Why would the king leave his palace and sleep in a place like this? You're frustrating me.

429
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,050
Hey! Ahh, I am telling you the truth.

430
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,810
He looks like, what should I say...?

431
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:58,290
He looks like a very ordinary king.

432
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:01,150
Hey! Hey!

433
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:10,310
The thing you heard was probably not, "Your Majesty"

434
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,000
but, "Should I hit you?" (They sound similar in Korean.)

435
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,100
You need a beating.

436
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,550
I'm telling you it's the truth!

437
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:24,160
Forget it. Give me the necklace.

438
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:30,070
- Why?
- They might chase us again. You're so tall, you stand out too much. I'll find out more about the necklace.

439
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:31,690
And what about me?

440
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:36,560
When the sun sets, meet me in front of that store.

441
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,330
Just as I figured, this is it.

442
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:14,600
Sh-shoe. Please get my shoe. You are handsome.

443
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:18,950
Very...

444
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,290
Oh really?!

445
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:27,080
Ah, that! That's my necklace.

446
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:30,040
That is my necklace.

447
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:34,910
Excuse me!

448
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:45,560
I have to ask her about the necklace.

449
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,630
It's Ban Ryu!

450
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,040
It's Soo Ho!

451
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,070
I really don't want to see him.

452
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:06,160
Whenever I see him, I can feel the rice cake soup from three years ago, rising.

453
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,540
Looking at them side by side, Soo Ho is really better looking.

454
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:13,210
Of course. Of course! Why is that even a competition?

455
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:17,640
When all it said and done our Ban Ryu is the best of the true bone (royalty).

456
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,460
- Right, right.
- The highest among the high.
- Right.

457
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,980
Ban Ryu is the best.

458
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,570
That's annoying.

459
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,690
Now it's the time you ladies have all been waiting for.

460
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:49,810
Sewing time!

461
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:56,330
Miss, please start sewing.

462
00:47:56,330 --> 00:48:01,920
Yes. Shall I pick up my needle?

463
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,850
Because of the mother's jealousy, she couldn't see clearly, and her heart was already on fire.

464
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,840
While swallowing the true desire within them,

465
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:46,460
they decided to spend a hot time together in a secret place.

466
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,780
Oh, my.

467
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:53,410
At the hour of the rat (11 pm to 1 am), in Najeong. (Cf. her name in Reply 1994).

468
00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:00,070
Najeong where Bak Hyeokgeose  (the founder of Silla) was born?

469
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:05,530
This is such a surprising plot twist. I can't believe they are using that sacred place like this.

470
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:15,620
Later, I need to have some alcohol poured by her.

471
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,670
Her stories are great,

472
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:21,340
and I saw that her appearance is great too.

473
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,660
Let's have one glass.

474
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:29,390
Ah we are out of alcohol. I'll go get some more.

475
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:32,530
Kang Seong, you go.

476
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,620
Ban Ryu, why are you—

477
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:41,840
What was the color of your father's uniform?

478
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:46,280
It must be dark pink since he's Achan.
(Achan is 6th out of 17 government job ranks in Silla.)

479
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:50,250
My God-father is Gakgan. (1st of 17)
My father is Japchan ( 3rd of 17).

480
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:54,350
The fathers of Gi Bo and Sin Hwi are Daehachan (5th of 17) 
and Pajinchan (4th of 17).

481
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:56,910
Of course, he wore the violet uniform.

482
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:02,240
Just because we hang out together, how can you mistake that we are the same True Bone? (The highest rank, right under the king's immediate family)

483
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:18,180
Have you ever seen something like this?

484
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,410
I have definitely seen that somewhere before.

485
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:23,560
Where have I seen this?

486
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,760
Why don't you think a little harder like a mature adult?

487
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,700
This guy is either very high class or very low class.

488
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:35,150
It's hard to tell.
I'm not sure.

489
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:37,300
Is it not?

490
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:44,680
He's definitely ugly. That's why he's wearing that.

491
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:48,470
If you leave that with me, I can find out for you.

492
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:50,430
Or just leave it here and go.

493
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,850
I lost.

494
00:50:55,850 --> 00:51:00,730
It's not mine. It's my friend's, and his life depends on it, so I can't just leave it and go.

495
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:04,950
So look it over, and if someone who knows this item appears...

496
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,370
While they breathed in the cold air,

497
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:34,940
in the hot atmosphere, their hearts were calming down.

498
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,960
Thump thump, thump thump.

499
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,660
I think that is my necklace.

500
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,350
- Hey...
- Out the way!

501
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:57,350
This...

502
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,650
What are you?

503
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:06,410
I just asked what kind of guy are you?

504
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:12,390
You're not from here, are you?

505
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,880
Show me your authorization.

506
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,860
You don't want to reveal your identity?

507
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:25,840
You do not know where you are, do you?

508
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:28,780
Let go.

509
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:34,950
My mood was already crappy.

510
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,740
It worked out.

511
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:43,590
It felt like a thousand years of waiting.

512
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:49,780
It is so tempting to just jump in.

513
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:54,710
They barely resisted,

514
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:58,440
and resisted.

515
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:03,870
As soon as he met her, he led Na Jeong into the woods

516
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:08,570
and pushed her against the pine tree, with just his hands!

517
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:10,980
And that's how...

518
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,420
Because of you...

519
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:17,300
I'm going to burn up!

520
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:23,560
The two couldn't restrain themselves and wanted each other's lips.

521
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:28,810
Finally, without hesitating...

522
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:30,370
Rip!

523
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:35,780
Do you know where this is?

524
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,880
You!

525
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:45,070
Who is doing this at this crucial moment?

526
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:49,690
It was you? Ban Ryu's trash?

527
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,250
What are you doing right now?

528
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,450
Kang Seong, what is going on?

529
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:58,750
I can't believe this.

530
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:01,810
This is the second time I've seen you today.

531
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:06,170
If you are out of luck, you should have asked for God's blessing at least.

532
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:09,760
Don't mess with me. Unless you want to go back home with that face.

533
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,730
I ought to...

534
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:16,470
Prince Soo Ho and Prince Ban Ryu are about to have another fight.

535
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:19,020
Really? Then I'll have to go watch!

536
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:22,280
There's no way we can miss this fight.

537
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,090
What did I do to make you close your eyes?

538
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:50,020
Wh-who are you?

539
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:54,240
Whoever I am. Is the answer to that question important?

540
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:57,610
Ah, that's a shame.

541
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:58,890
It's only been three days.

542
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:01,850
What... What has?

543
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:05,040
So, it might be best to open your eyes.

544
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,260
Wh-why are you doing this?

545
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,140
Why, you ask?

546
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,590
Because it's dim here.

547
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,450
And no one is here.

548
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,760
And it's good to sleep here.

549
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:28,300
How does the next part go?

550
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:43,180
Ban Ryu, he doesn't even have an entrance pass!

551
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:47,200
It's not a crime to beat up Cheonin without a transit pass in the capital.
(Cheonin was the lowest rank of Silla society)

552
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,150
So it's okay to kill him, right?

553
00:55:55,910 --> 00:56:00,700
You ignored strict Silla Bone Rank System. ( The system was based on how closely related you were to the king.)

554
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:04,530
And you dare crawl into a place like this?

555
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:10,370
People like you are no different from bugs.

556
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:15,050
Farewell.

557
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:23,650
Who did that?

558
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:41,510
What's with that bamboo hat?

559
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:51,450
I think life is all about luck.

560
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,700
But today,

561
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:01,040
you are not lucky.

562
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,240
You, what are you?

563
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,870
Bothersome bastard.

564
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:09,300
I asked you who you are!

565
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,660
There's nothing you need to know.

566
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:13,730
Are you okay?

567
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,310
♫ Little by little, little by little ♫
Yeah.

568
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:19,940
♫ Like a withering flower ♫

569
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,630
I am not okay.

570
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:23,780
Arrogant bastard!

571
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:30,420
Oh, that was good!

572
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,970
If killing a Cheonin who sneaked into the capital is your law,

573
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:48,260
my law is to beat up the royals who cross this line.

574
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:54,280
If you want to cut him, cross the line to do so. I will fight you.

575
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:59,160
♫ Don't run away. Don't leave me alone ♫

576
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:04,270
♫ You who are turning away turn your feet toward me ♫

577
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:09,350
♫ I request and want you, you are everything in my life ♫
