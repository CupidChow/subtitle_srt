1
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,660
Hwa Joong Jae Wang (The King is among Hwarang)

2
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,810
- The King is there?
- Move!

3
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,080
Episode 12

4
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,650
Hwa Joong Jae Wang. (The King is among Hwarang)

5
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,290
If this is s joke, I'll let it go once. However,

6
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,890
if this was done with a motive,

7
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,430
I will never forgive it next time.

8
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,660
Do you understand?

9
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,090
Yes sir.

10
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:15,050
Now, there's nothing to see here, go back. Hurry!

11
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,800
Let's go.

12
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,240
I...

13
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,150
I think I saw the King

14
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,290
I've been looking for you for a while.

15
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,310
You caught me.

16
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,940
I was trying to escape to a place where no one would find me.

17
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:49,100
It is nothing but a paper scroll hung on the wall. Nobody will believe it.

18
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,640
I had imagined this kind of situation many times

19
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,990
It's less of an issue than I thought it would be.

20
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,040
Is it because you are with me?

21
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,340
No matter what, I will not reveal Your Majesty.

22
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,490
- So be assured.
- I'm relieved.

23
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:12,430
- No one will know. Who would even imagine that there would be a king here—
- It's okay.

24
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,060
If it is known that I am the King, one of two things will happen.

25
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,210
I will die at the hands of assassins

26
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,180
or become King.

27
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,820
Die or become King.

28
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,660
I've thought of both of them every day, over and over.

29
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,310
Now that I am facing that situation, I am worried more about what to do

30
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,130
if people ask me to be the King from tomorrow rather than if I might get killed.

31
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,360
That seems like it's more insensible.

32
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,610
Is it not funny?

33
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,330
The King is scared to become the King.

34
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,950
Hwa Joong Jae Wang. There is a king among Hwarang.

35
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,550
- Is it true?
- Why?

36
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,560
You didn't get any tip from your informant about this?

37
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,270
Hey, does that make sense?

38
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,380
- Even Poong Wol Joo, said it was a joke.
- What doesn't make sense?

39
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,220
Anyway, the King who can't appear in front of us

40
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,230
- could be here.
- So, who's the King?

41
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,970
Ji Dwi or

42
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,180
Seon Woo, could it be one of the two?

43
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,490
Why do you keep on eating here? Go to your 'room.'

44
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,760
We all grew up in the capital together.

45
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,230
We saw each other grow up.

46
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:39,390
- But, those two have not.
- Stop talking nonsense.

47
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,950
Ji Dwi is Poong Wol Joo's nephew and Seon Woo is Ahn Ji Gong's son.

48
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,400
That's true.

49
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,260
No. I think what Han Seong is saying isn't wrong.

50
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:55,340
It's true that we don't know about the two of them. If the King is among them two,

51
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,380
I think I might know who it is.

52
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,820
Is Ji Dwi truly your nephew? Can you prove it? Where is his family?

53
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,940
Why did he end up wandering around all alone?

54
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,410
If you can prove even a single thing about him, I will believe you.

55
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:24,130
Which king can look up from the bottom?

56
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,400
Don't you think the hidden king may be able to do that?

57
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,430
You seem to have a big expectation towards the faceless king.

58
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,850
Are you having the same thoughts about the King?

59
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,890
Isn't that why you are objecting to the regency?

60
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:45,260
Dragging down the mistress of that noisy memorial walk.

61
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,070
Queen Dowager.

62
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,020
Queen Dowager.

63
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,320
The King is among Hwarang.

64
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,550
He is the bastard that killed Mak Moon.

65
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,230
King.

66
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,350
Who are you?

67
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,510
Come quickly.

68
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,470
- No way! That's nonsense.
- I am telling you the truth.

69
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,140
- Who?
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

70
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,700
- What?
- I told you so!

71
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,070
Who?

72
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,220
Seon Woo is the King?

73
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,310
It looks like I was not the only one to see that symbol of the King.

74
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:59,830
Is it true that the mark of Dog-Bird's bracelet is the same as the shape on the scrolled paper hung on the wall before?

75
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,650
If Dog-Bird is the King, it is fortunate for you.

76
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,710
- What are you talking about?
- What happened between you and him before.

77
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,830
You got hit by the King, not by a half-Cheonin.

78
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:15,670
- Doesn't it make you feel better?
- Aren't you going to shut up before you get beaten up?

79
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,360
Okay. Okay.

80
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,420
Hey. Let's go. Let's go.

81
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,210
It seems that kids have so much interest in you all of a sudden. Am I only one to think like that?

82
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,360
I became interested in them, too. I have to find someone.

83
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,420
Well, Doctor Ah Ro wouldn't have a clue, either,

84
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,250
because she hasn't lived with her brother from birth to now.

85
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,430
He showed up from nowhere out of the blue to be her brother.

86
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:32,690
How can she know if he is her real brother or not?

87
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:42,460
You got it wrong. My brother is not the King.

88
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,420
How are you so sure about that?

89
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,500
That's because...

90
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,080
Look. You can't convince me.

91
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,110
Gosh!

92
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,120
Seon Woo is definitely not...

93
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,650
Anyway. Anyway he is not the King.

94
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,280
Whoa, you screamed.

95
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,530
He is not the King for real. What should I do?

96
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,190
He is not!

97
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:33,090
The people in Seonmoon are saying that you're my brother?

98
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,740
The mark... Is it on a different part of the arm?

99
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,460
Are you Jin Heung?

100
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,840
Don't lie.

101
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,950
Are you the one who shot the arrow?

102
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:01,170
I said, are you the one who shot an arrow at Ah Ro on the hunting grounds?

103
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,470
I was the person hunting for deer.

104
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,100
I'm not interested in who you are and who you think of me as.

105
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,380
But if you ever hurt her again,

106
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,260
then you will really truly know who I am.

107
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,530
Just exactly who said, "There is a king among the Hwarang"?

108
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,140
Someone who definitely knows about the King's symbol,

109
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,650
because the scroll had the same symbol of the King.

110
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:58,050
The symbol is known only to the royal family and a handful of generals who are guarding the border.

111
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,350
Who dared to find out about it?

112
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,340
This might be beneficial for the King.

113
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,450
Is it beneficial?

114
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,930
What did I say? Because we had been standing by idly and doing nothing,

115
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,560
that is why the Nambuyeo are provoking this country, isn't it? ("Nambuyeo" was another name for the Baekje kingdom. )

116
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,330
The damage is two times worse than the last time.

117
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,650
Even the cattle and horses; we lost more than 100 of them.

118
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,710
-This is all—
- That is because they are looking down on us.

119
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,000
I guess you want to blame it all on

120
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,820
me, who won't step back from the regency and the faceless king.

121
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,570
Stop that at this point!

122
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,500
Isn't it because Her Highness is engaged in other matters right now?

123
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,930
What do you mean another matter? What matter is more urgent now than this?

124
00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:00,010
Is it true that King Jin Heung is in Hwarang?

125
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,390
If not, you should tell us that it's not true.

126
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,840
Is that the truth?

127
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:30,130
I'm saying this, that the King is not in this kingdom.

128
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:34,190
If there is anyone instigating dissension by spreading false rumors

129
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,070
it will not be tolerated any longer.

130
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:52,280
Ahn Ji Gong's son, Seon Woo, is definitely Sam Maek Jong.

131
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,270
I can't say.

132
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:58,940
What do you mean you can't say? Didn't you see Ji So's facial expression?

133
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,830
She sure is something.

134
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:08,000
She picked a Hwarang herself and put him in there. Who would have thought of that?

135
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,810
What are you concerned about?

136
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,080
Everything fits together too well.

137
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,810
Since it was planned from the beginning...

138
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:24,490
Did you say that the crazy guy who stopped Ji So's memorial walk was the son of Ahn Ji Gong?

139
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,130
And Ji So imprisoned that kid and Ahn Ji Gong in the palace.

140
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,430
That's why I'm saying she's scary.

141
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,740
Didn't she calculate every trick?

142
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Let's just wait and see. We'll figure it out.

143
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,930
What wrong with you guys? Having a king as roommate

144
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,050
isn't that a good thing?

145
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,500
- Hey.
- Sorry.

146
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,650
- Are you really the King?
- That's too blatant to ask.

147
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,560
If you're not, then you can say you're not.

148
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,010
If you say you are the king, I won't believe it anyway.

149
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,860
When you don't even want to believe it, why do you bother asking?

150
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,290
You must have something to say for yourself!

151
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,490
Don't do it.

152
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,260
Right. Our day-off is coming up.

153
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,650
You won't want to go home with a fail just because of something like this.

154
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,020
Is Dog-Bird really the King?

155
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,390
Hey! Why are you calling him Dog-Bird?

156
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,080
Hey, you should say King Jin Heung!

157
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,530
King!

158
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,780
Who do you think they're looking at?

159
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,220
I think it's you.

160
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,440
Do I look that fine? To catch the attention of men?

161
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,980
You know how to joke around when you usually don't.

162
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,080
Is your wound from the arrow okay?

163
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,700
That's a relief.

164
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,140
If there is a king among the Hwarang,

165
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,040
who do you think it is?

166
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,360
If you had to pick out one of them, who do you think it is?

167
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,520
- Never mind.
- But why are you looking for the king?

168
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,110
If you find the king, what are you going to do?

169
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,520
If you find the king,

170
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,430
what are you doing to do?

171
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,260
I'm going to kill him.

172
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,480
I said I'm going to kill him.

173
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:43,100
That rumor... It's not true.

174
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,010
I know.

175
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,990
I know that.

176
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:56,350
What is this? So...you can't see me as a king?

177
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,010
No, it's not that.

178
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,630
Just kidding. I wanted you to laugh.

179
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:08,940
But you are not laughing.
♬ I must be a fool♬

180
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:16,350
♬ I really didn't know then. ♬

181
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:21,560
Just a moment.
♬ Everything impossible for me  ♬

182
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:28,040
Just stay for a moment right here.
♬ You would make possible ♬

183
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:34,880
♬ The instant my indiscreet heart faces you and ♬

184
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:42,760
♬ time stops for you ♬

185
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,430
♬ the place where you must be ♬

186
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:53,790
♬ will be filled with my tears ♬

187
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,500
It's been a while since we got a break. Should we go to the Okta store?

188
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,100
Why are you acting so close? You and I aren't that close.

189
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,800
Did I just get rejected? I feel hurt. Comfort me.

190
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,750
You go alone. I'm not in the mood to go there.

191
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,750
Did I just get rejected by two people at the same time?

192
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,930
Was it stuck on a poster at Seonmoon?

193
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:38,770
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Isn't this all your doing?

194
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,600
How is that guy named Seon Woo?

195
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,500
How does he look to you? Does he look like a king?

196
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:55,300
Whether he's the king or not, bring me the answer.

197
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,100
Why do I have to do such things?

198
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,350
I'm thinking of making you the king.

199
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,450
The king has to be gone in order for you to become king.

200
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,200
I'm thinking of making you the king.

201
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:37,300
Why doesn't he appear?

202
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,700
He's definitely inside somewhere.
♬ When the path on which I fearlessly♬

203
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:47,700
♬ went out and searched for the small dream♬

204
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,550
♬ which was concealed in the flickering starlight♬

205
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,000
Excuse me!
♬ was more than I could bear♬

206
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,450
Ban Ryu, I was right in front of you, but I thought maybe you didn't see me.

207
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,800
♬ Like a dream ♬

208
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:12,150
♬ then another world which I came to know♬

209
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,850
What are you doing here?
♬ and even a shard ♬

210
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,100
No. Nothing.
♬  of my crushed heart ♬

211
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,300
♬ became a light in your breath.♬

212
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,330
♬ That's why I can't let you go. ♬

213
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,300
What's the matter with you?

214
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,740
Did that jerk do something to you?
♬ I'm fine with you as the only one.♬

215
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,860
That bastard. I knew this would happen. Ban Ryu! Ban Ryu!

216
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,870
- Ban Ryu!
- No, it's not like that.
- Let go of me. Won't you let go?
♬ I will find the star. ♬

217
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,160
Stop right there!

218
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,260
♬ Until I reach the dream ♬

219
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:52,380
It hurts. It hurts. Oh, it hurts!

220
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,540
- Here too?
- There hurts too.

221
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,060
That hurts. That hurts.

222
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,450
That's strange.

223
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,770
It hurts. Ah...

224
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,910
Ah, it hurts.

225
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:12,010
Ah! It hurts!

226
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:17,570
Oh! This won't do. I have no choice but to do acupuncture.

227
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,600
Acupuncture? I think it will be fine if I just rest.

228
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,650
If you leave it as it is, you will suffer from chronic sprains.

229
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:31,090
So let's really pull out the root.

230
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:46,750
If you get poked 30 times with these needles for 10 days,

231
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,100
you will be healed perfectly.

232
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,490
There's not need for that...

233
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:59,360
And don't be too burdened because you're getting this for free.

234
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,170
I'm okay.

235
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,380
Why are you pretending to be sick all of a sudden?

236
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:13,130
Because I don't like to be compared to Dan Se while we are training together.

237
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:18,370
It would have been better if I was born as my brother and my brother as me.

238
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,050
Come out.

239
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,470
I don't want to leave.

240
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,210
Let's do sword training. I'll help you.

241
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,010
Hurry up.

242
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,400
Bye, Doctor Ah Ro.

243
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,230
Grab it.

244
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,280
That kind of swordsmanship can't do anything.

245
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,980
Do it again!

246
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,320
I'm not going to!

247
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:40,960
That's right. We should have been born switched.

248
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,280
Then, you could have raised our family again.

249
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,330
As for me, I just like looking up the sky for stars and following a solar eclipse.

250
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:53,480
I am poor at dealing with a sword and archery while horse-riding. I am flawed.

251
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,390
But what should I do?

252
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:59,370
Then what should I do? This is just who I am!

253
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:16,070
It's such a relief that it didn't go any deeper, and the wound is healing well.

254
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,690
Ah Ro has become a real doctor, hasn't she?

255
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,920
That day at Seonmoon when you told me to protect Ah Ro.

256
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,900
How did you know that Ah Ro would get into trouble?

257
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:43,250
Who did you hear that from?

258
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:50,400
Protect Ah Ro. That is all I can tell you right now.

259
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,310
Mak Moon said

260
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,360
that he saw the king.

261
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,940
And the guy who wielded the sword had this symbol.

262
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,100
In the end, I kill him.

263
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,340
If this is the king's symbol, then the one who killed Mak Moon is

264
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,320
that faceless king.

265
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,370
So

266
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,860
what are you planning to do?

267
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,880
I'll have to kill him.

268
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,990
I'm going crazy.

269
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:55,450
I can't reveal that Ji Dwi is the King.

270
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:59,230
And I can't prove that Seon Woo isn't the King.

271
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,660
Why is this so hard?

272
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:13,100
The misunderstanding that Ahn Ji Gong's son is Sam Maek Jong. Why is that beneficial to the King?

273
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,820
If Ahn Ji Gong's son pretends to be the king,

274
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,340
then wouldn't it keep His Majesty safe for a while?

275
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,450
To protect the real king

276
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,380
a pretend king?

277
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:33,320
But Ahn Ji Gong will not leave this situation alone.

278
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,900
Then we'll have to make him leave it alone.

279
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,610
Why did you come here?

280
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,770
If the doctor is busy, then isn't the patient supposed to come find him?

281
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:03,330
I risked coming here. Aren't you going to check up on me?

282
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,320
Do you remember?

283
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,310
The forest we ran through together. The smell of the grass.

284
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,000
That wind. When I was next to you,

285
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,370
I wasn't scared of anything.

286
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,480
Let me start acupuncture.

287
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:49,600
You can curse me. You can hate me.

288
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:54,990
Your daughter committed a sin against me and she deserves death, but I will spare her life.

289
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
So in exchange, your son must fulfill my favor.

290
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,610
If he doesn't do my favor,

291
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:14,200
I have no choice but to kill your daughter.

292
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:51,970
Didn't I say that Ji So would stop by in the evening?

293
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:58,010
What... should I do?

294
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,620
What will you do?

295
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,810
She killed my wife and son,

296
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:10,200
and she threatened to kill my daughter.

297
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,800
That woman and her son.

298
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,700
I must kill them.

299
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,260
Why?

300
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:32,540
Why do you have to make me stay here even on my day off? This is totally not cool!

301
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,720
I don't know if you know that

302
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,520
you're a tiring and bothersome person.

303
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,260
Is this all?

304
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,250
You know I really like Nooroongji (Scorched rice) and you only brought this much?

305
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:51,050
- Aren't you even worried?
- About what?

306
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:54,110
Just think for a second!

307
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:58,190
If there is a rumor that the King is in the Seonmoon,

308
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,840
then will this place be safe?

309
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,220
Anyway, I think I should move.

310
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:12,180
Even If an assassin is coming, it's too dangerous.

311
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:17,590
This person! Is that something Poong Wol Joo should say?

312
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,730
If they live, you live and if they die then you die!

313
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:26,050
Hey. Why are you yelling so much?

314
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,840
Or you can be Poong Wol Joo.

315
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,920
Don't eat this!

316
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,430
I said I like it.

317
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,830
Today is your break so why are you here alone and not outside.

318
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,950
Just because I can't be bothered.

319
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,740
There's no benefit from going outside.

320
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,620
I was curious about something from the beginning.

321
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,540
Why is your name Ji Dwi?

322
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,390
There's no particular reason.

323
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:26,240
Even if it's nothing, please explain.

324
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:31,020
I unmercifully stab someone in the back.

325
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,480
That's why I'm Ji Dwi.

326
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:41,420
You don't know anyone in the capital. You don't have anyone related to you.

327
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,850
Your name is an alias and your family is a mess.

328
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,560
And you will unmercifully stab the queen dowager in the back.

329
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:54,940
If I think carefully, I can't agree that you have neither kith nor kin.

330
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,420
And your sister is in Seonmoon.

331
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,820
And your mother is in the palace.

332
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,940
Isn't that so, Your Majesty?

333
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:32,850
Did you just tell me now that you will meet my son?

334
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:38,150
I've heard that among the Hwarang, your son's swordsmanship is daring and skilled.

335
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,580
That is too strong a compliment.

336
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:47,610
I have something special to ask of your son.

337
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,110
When you meet the Queen Dowager,

338
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:00,910
you can never lift your head up high or make eye contact.

339
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,860
You can't go too close,

340
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,150
and whatever she says,

341
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,650
respond only with,

342
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:11,820
"Yes, I will." Got it?

343
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,480
Yes.

344
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,270
Sending you there alone...

345
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,310
I don't know why I feel so uneasy.

346
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:52,460
Thorn flowers? Those are thorn flowers.

347
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,870
- I will carry you.
- What?

348
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:03,830
The ground is filled with thorn flowers and the pathway back is like that as well.

349
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:07,070
They are poisonous flowers, so if you get pricked, it will be hard to walk.

350
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,260
I will go with my own feet.

351
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,560
Your Majesty, are you alright? These shoes...

352
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,910
You must not put shoes on.

353
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,180
When hunting one often encounters a thorny bush.

354
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,550
Do not walk in that area.

355
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:55,370
I apologize for having the nerve to make physical contact.

356
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:59,670
If you punish me, I will accept it gladly.

357
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:02,150
Are you Yi Chan's son?

358
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,440
Yes. My name is Soo Ho.

359
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,720
Do you know Seon Woo?

360
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,740
There is a king among them.

361
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,960
It seems I've sprained my foot.

362
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:01,650
- This way...
- No, I would like to do it in my location.

363
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,690
I will leave knowing that you will come.

364
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:17,580
Wow, she really doesn't have a conscience.

365
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:21,110
To someone she shot an arrow at, she has a sprain?

366
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,480
I ought to break her...

367
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,840
This way.

368
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,990
If you heat them up for a bit, I think they will feel better.

369
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:48,350
What is this? Is she telling me to wash her feet?

370
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,890
That's right. That's what I'm telling you to do.

371
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,980
Please order your maid to do these things.

372
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:01,530
They must have told you that you are my designated doctor.

373
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:08,860
And you, Princess, shot at that designated doctor

374
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,490
and my brother got shot.

375
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,520
I heard you deserve to die because you committed a sin towards the Queen Dowager.

376
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,870
Then you should have been shot and killed.

377
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:20,920
What did you just say?

378
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:25,160
If you didn't die, the next day is the same.

379
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,900
You must do your part to fulfill your duty.

380
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,200
Washing my feet, heating them and healing them

381
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,590
are something a half-blood like you should do.

382
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,300
What are you doing?

383
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:45,320
For the sake of your brother, I was going to keep it in, but I can't do it anymore.

384
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,370
There are these things called situations.

385
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:50,990
No matter how superior your status is, it's never right to thoughtlessly kill people.

386
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:55,110
When you are a princess? Let alone to earn the subjects' praise,

387
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:58,140
does it make sense that you shot an arrow at a person?

388
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:02,410
Even though I am a doctor, I cannot treat a person like you!

389
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:07,530
So you know my brother?

390
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:18,110
This is unjust. You know my brother, but

391
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:21,450
I don't know who my brother is.

392
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,700
This is unjust.

393
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,750
So tell me who my brother is.

394
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,630
I don't know.

395
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:42,120
But even if I did know, I wouldn't tell you.

396
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:01,850
We're seeing each other like this again. Nangdoo to nangdoo.

397
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:07,680
Even though we are both Nangdoo, you don't think we're on the same level, do you?

398
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,140
A half-breed punk with nothing to show off.

399
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,620
Hey, Pa Oh.

400
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:25,230
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yes, I have to do something there.

401
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,270
It's okay if I don't.

402
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,210
Are you feeding the horses?

403
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,020
This is Gang Seong.

404
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,100
Even though he is the same Nangdoo, he is two years younger than us.

405
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,130
But we keep crossing paths.

406
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:43,600
And what are you? An old rag like you.

407
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,040
What is this? Why are you doing this?

408
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,280
Call me hyung from now on.

409
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,570
I can't let you go anymore.

410
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,970
I'm true bone!

411
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:02,560
This dog-bone bastard...

412
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,480
I'm leaving, friend.

413
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:21,900
I saw it. The day when you broke the instruments.

414
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I'm not interested in what you do here or who you are doing it for.

415
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:33,590
I will live my life and you will live yours. That's it.

416
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,810
I'm just asking for one thing.

417
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,340
Don't mess with me.

418
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,620
Hold on tight.

419
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,940
In this world, there are doors that must never be opened by people like you.

420
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,350
And it seems you are right in front of one of those forbidden doors.

421
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:37,200
When did you learn to use the sword? Or are you just winging it as you go?

422
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,250
Should I tell you a secret?

423
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:55,090
From the time I was born until now, I haven't had a single friend.

424
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:59,780
If you knew how big of a confession this is, you would be shocked later!

425
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,400
What's with you? Do you have something to say?

426
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:13,300
We call people like you 'a dog who has to take a sh*t'.

427
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,650
- What?
- I called you a dog who has to take a sh*t, why?

428
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:23,480
What is this. You've been frozen all day and then you react to poop?

429
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,580
Do you like poop because you're Dog-Bird?

430
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,830
Stop it.

431
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:31,530
♫ Dog-Bird said he likes it—

432
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:34,490
- Be quiet!
- ♫ He likes poop—

433
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,000
- What about Han Seong?
- He's not in our room.

434
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:47,770
From now on he's in our room. I heard he got chased out from his other room.

435
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,560
Too bad, already.
♬ became a light in your breath. ♬

436
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:57,600
♬ became a light in your breath. ♬

437
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,600
♬ I'm fine with you as the only one. ♬

438
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,960
♬ I will find the star. ♬

439
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:11,720
♬ Until I reach the dream suspended high in the sky. ♬

440
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,020
Because you are afraid of sparring, are you going to avoid it?

441
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:21,380
The problem is not sparring. When is sparring ever so dangerous?

442
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,240
Then, stop this and come on out.

443
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,600
Seok Hyeon Je's grandson must appear before the Queen Dowager and the royal council.

444
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,770
I don't want to hear that you ran out of there head first.

445
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:38,600
Is it important to listen to what others say? I don't want to fight!

446
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,310
And doing those things is dangerous.

447
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:44,000
Are you going to disappoint Grandfather?

448
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,100
You, it's not you who are only one.

449
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,250
The main line descent. The main line descent. Stop making noise about someone's descent.

450
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:56,430
Was I born into this family because I wanted to be?

451
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:00,650
Why is everyone placing their burdens on me? Why me?! Why!

452
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:04,210
Then you should have been born as a half bone.

453
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:06,730
If you were only going to live like this,

454
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:10,270
then why do you get to have everything?!

455
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:17,800
- Hyung!
- If you have everything, then make yourself deserve everything. Prove it one way or another.

456
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,290
Come out.

457
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:32,400
If you find the King, what are you going to do?

458
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:36,920
If you find the King,

459
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,840
what are you going to do?

460
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,560
I'm going to kill him.

461
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,180
I said, I'm going to kill him.

462
00:45:55,300 --> 00:46:00,860
From the time I was born until now, I haven't had a single friend.

463
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:07,170
And right now, you are my only friend.

464
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:12,310
Well, I don't remember owing a debt to anyone.

465
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:15,800
If you knew how big of a confession this is, you would be shocked later!

466
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,590
In this world, there are doors that must never be opened by people like you.

467
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:22,820
And it seems you are right in front of one of those forbidden doors.

468
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,300
Then you can give it to me. It's my hobby to collect these things.

469
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,720
Sell it to me. I'll give you whatever you ask for.

470
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,400
Well, that's a pity. It's perfectly my style.

471
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:07,000
Must it be the sight of blood that you want?

472
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,100
Someone who fears blood could not become a brave general.

473
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,950
However...

474
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,930
The Queen Dowager and the royal council have arrived.

475
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:43,070
Your Highness, surely while watching to the point of blood, won't this shake Hwarang violently?

476
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:51,650
I am grateful for inviting even old men like us to this Hwarang event.

477
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:56,390
I've heard the Princess personally organized the sparring.

478
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:59,600
So the expectation is even greater.

479
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:04,550
It will be wonderful if the event is not counter to your expectations.

480
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,540
In today's final round of the sparring which faces life and death,

481
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,660
on the palanquin on the journey to the hell of sparring,

482
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:29,780
possibly to become first the Hwarang also

483
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,900
will cause countless injuries and death.

484
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,910
The fight of life and death.

485
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:37,950
Ah, stop talking. I'm getting so confused.

486
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:44,800
Is it a problem if I'm making a little noise? Someone's life is on the line in any minute.

487
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:47,530
By the way, if someone's head gets chopped off,

488
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:51,290
if you hurry and stitch it back to their body, can they still live?

489
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,940
I have cut heads before, but never stitched them back on.

490
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,600
Put your neck right here so I can cut it and try to sew it back on.

491
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:11,300
Why are you like this? I'm only saying this so you can be meticulous.

492
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,510
Haven't I told you many times already that this sparring will be bloody

493
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:20,000
and cutthroat sparring?

494
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Right. I'm worried.

495
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Why are they doing this? Which bastard was crazy enough to—

496
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,170
Maybe it's not bastard but bitch?

497
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,470
You end up being like this in the end.

498
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:58,570
Beg to save your life.

499
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:01,540
Cry out for help holding your mother's hand.

500
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:06,660
Then I will rescue you from this.

501
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:11,860
If there is a sword aiming for me, I will not avoid it.

502
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:18,220
I will face it to win and then climb onto the throne majestically.

503
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,830
Start the sparring.

504
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:03,390
You shouldn't disappoint Yeong Sil this much.

505
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:06,880
Ban Ryu, you were wrong.

506
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:31,380
This sparring is supposed to put their training into practice. How can they be so slack like this?

507
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:37,410
Because they know better things than committing meaningless killing.

508
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,820
Stop!

509
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:55,900
Princess, in any case I think the sparring between the Hwarang

510
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:59,160
doesn't offer much to see.

511
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,920
So could I propose a small suggestion?

512
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,910
Please go ahead.

513
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:12,150
I propose to have a sparring between my skilled bodyguard and one Hwarang who can represent whole Hwarang.

514
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:13,870
Come out.

515
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,580
What do you think?

516
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:25,140
Good.

517
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:31,430
As I expected, Princess is as broad-minded as a general.

518
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:34,390
Since you were so generous to accept my proposal,

519
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:39,990
could I pick out one of the Hwarang to represent Seonmoon?

520
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,660
Please do so.

521
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:58,820
I heard that Seon Woo is good at martial arts.

522
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:08,040
Seon Woo, come forward.

523
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:13,830
I will do it. You aren't capable enough.

524
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,650
I'm fine.

525
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:25,350
He can't. His body hasn't even recovered fully yet.

526
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:29,400
How long has it been since he took the arrow? No.

527
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,870
Princess, give them your assurance that

528
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:48,460
even if one of the two loses his life, regardless of his status,

529
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:52,110
you won't hold anyone responsible.

530
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:54,040
I will do so.

531
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:57,070
I will do so in your honor.

532
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:00,770
In the honor of the Hwarang, I will do so too.

533
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:22,550
It's not committing a disloyalty against King Jin Heung with poor sense, is it?

534
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:29,150
Of course, it is disloyal. What would be more disloyal than making the King's Hwarang endure this?

535
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:34,560
Shouldn't something countlessly heated up and pounded become stronger?

536
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:41,740
It's not disloyalty. I guess it is tempering. Anyway, aren't they all your Hwarang?

537
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:46,700
However much you try to do that, Jin Heung is not here.

538
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,050
We'll see...

539
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:08,380
That's a relief. As the widely discussed rumors say

540
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:15,810
I was worried that Seon Woo was possibly King Jin Heung...

541
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:41,810
It is until the death! It is still not finished.

542
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:50,870
Stop!

543
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,680
Continue.

544
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:22,200
And now I've got the answer I wanted...

545
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,190
Are you okay?

546
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,440
Were you worried?

547
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,970
Yes.

548
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:51,660
Why would you?

549
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:57,850
If you ask why, obviously...

550
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,150
What are you doing?

551
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,760
Is it you?

552
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:15,180
Are you... the King?

553
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:35,000
♫ Don't leave me. Don't leave me. ♫
