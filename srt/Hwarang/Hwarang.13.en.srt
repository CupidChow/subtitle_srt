00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,170
Episode 13

2
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,430
Are you alright?

3
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,720
Were you worried?

4
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,490
Yes.

5
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,960
Why would you?

6
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,620
Since you ask why, obviously...

7
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,660
What are you doing?

8
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,470
Is it you?

9
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,930
Are you...the King?

10
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,830
Tell me. I'm asking if you're the King.

11
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,160
I'm...

12
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,060
What are you doing?

13
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,250
- It's not a matter for you to interfere.
- How can I not, when you're aiming a sword at a person?

14
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,150
- Move.
- Hwa Joong Jae Wang. (There is a King among the Hwarang) Do you believe that poster?

15
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,290
I mean, is the King stupid? Why would he be here?

16
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,050
Why would he be in a place full of his enemies?

17
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,300
I don't know what kind of ill feelings you have towards the King, but it isn't him.

18
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,620
I know. I attest to it.

19
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,510
- So, stop with the nonsense and please stop—
- I said move!

20
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,940
He's not the King. Really.

21
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,060
I told you, he really isn't.

22
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,620
- Why did you do that?
- Then, what was I supposed to do?

23
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,260
What if your identity gets exposed?

24
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:03,070
If you're the King, then so be it. I don't know why he hates you so much.

25
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:09,800
Don't worry too much. If I say you aren't, he'll believe me.

26
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,820
You're hurt.

27
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,310
- Give it to me.
- It's okay.

28
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,810
It's not okay with me.

29
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,060
He's your brother.

30
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,920
Why did you go that far?

31
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,610
Then, should I leave you to die?

32
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,320
I'm angry at myself, because you're continuously put in danger

33
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,980
because of me.

34
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,030
What's the use of being angry at yourself?

35
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:58,430
Even if no one in the world is on my side, I have to be.

36
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:04,500
No matter how worthless or weak, I have to believe in myself.

37
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,660
Don't you think so?

38
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:16,170
That's just how it is. I'm not saying you're worthless...yo. (formal speech)

39
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,000
What are you doing?

40
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,850
I don't know what kind of ill feelings you have towards the King, but it isn't him.

41
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,290
I know. I attest to it.

42
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,190
- So, stop the nonsense and please stop—
- I said move!

43
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:55,410
There's no news from you and your swordsmanship is a mess.

44
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,070
But,

45
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,680
you have the talent to win.

46
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,210
How dare you look at me that way?

47
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,040
Are all members of the royal family that shameless?

48
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,950
For someone who shot me with an arrow not long ago, you don't look sorry at all.

49
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,020
Or maybe even a semblance of it.

50
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,960
Stop. I told you to stop.

51
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,960
I can teach you swordsmanship.

52
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,630
- If you learn a little bit, inside Silla you will—
- After learning swordsmanship,

53
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,990
how do you know who I'd kill?

54
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,960
Exactly where is he? He seemed to be injured earlier.

55
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,790
I have to take care of his wound.

56
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,430
Oh my! You scared me.

57
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,340
Why are you wandering about?

58
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,510
By any chance...

59
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,700
Never mind.

60
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,360
What are you so uncomfortable about asking?

61
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,900
Aren't you going to get off work?

62
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,300
- Why don't you leave work?
- Yeah.

63
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,940
What's causing you to keep looking over there?

64
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,990
It's not because there's something.

65
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,900
I'm looking, because I wish something was there.

66
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,290
What is it? What?

67
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,990
What is it?

68
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:14,160
Always acting independently.

69
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,000
What is the reason for letting Sook Myeong do those things?

70
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,480
Isn't it a good thing that there is a misunderstanding that another Hwarang is the King, and not you?

71
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,230
Whether Ahn Ji Gong's son is suspected to be the King or not, keep your mouth shut.

72
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,770
That is the only thing that will benefit you.

73
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:17,950
So...all of this...was your intention?

74
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,210
I can do anything. In order to get you safely on the throne,

75
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,390
I can kill all the Hwarang in Seonmoon.

76
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,650
Do you... Do you think I want that to happen?

77
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:37,740
I'm not curious about what you want, what you want to do, or what you hate.

78
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,130
I'm only thinking about what I can do.

79
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:47,880
So if you want to survive to be king, don't do anything.

80
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,870
Do you understand?

81
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,390
I asked if you are the King.

82
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:29,630
You killed my friend. You!

83
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,370
King

84
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,720
Dog-Bird, what are you doing here at this hour?

85
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:15,120
Rude bastard. You don't have the manners to greet your teacher whether it's morning or night.

86
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,720
Hwa Joong Jae Wang (There is a king among the Hwarang).
Do you think that's true?

87
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:26,200
As far as you can tell, who do you think is the king here?

88
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,020
Ji Dwi.

89
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,750
Is he really your nephew?

90
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,570
He is truly a distant nephew.

91
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,240
Why do you want to find the King so badly?

92
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,120
I have an unfortunate connection

93
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,070
with that bastard.

94
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,440
When you say 'that bastard', do you mean the King?

95
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,180
Why? If you meet him, are you going to kill him?

96
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,720
Why?

97
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,650
Can't I do that?

98
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,440
Does an abyss speak?

99
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,930
Look at this pond. On the outside, it is calm and has dark waters.

100
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:22,090
Inside, there are countless strong rocks,

101
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:29,890
living fish, aquatic plants and bugs. It is filled with life.

102
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,460
Say it in a way I can understand.

103
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,090
Many see only the outside of this pond and misunderstand it.

104
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:44,870
Can you say you know everything about it, just by looking at the calm and dark water?

105
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:54,280
I just hope you will not make that mistake.

106
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,810
Let's go inside.

107
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,940
An abyss...

108
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,860
You can leave.

109
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,810
This issue that we could have solved easily became more complicated.

110
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,370
Then, what about sending an assassin?

111
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,790
We can't do that now.

112
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,580
Why do you say that?

113
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,630
He's the Hwarang who fought with my warrior and won.

114
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:37,450
Does it make sense to send an assassin, when he is the focus of everyone's attention?

115
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,020
Then...

116
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,240
There will eventually be an opportunity.

117
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,790
Aigoo. Why is a horse wandering around in the new dawn?

118
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:12,940
We will definitely behead those who covet Baekje's land.

119
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,810
Even though this happened, are you planning to just wait and see?

120
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:21,260
If we condone this, they will see Silla as a pushover.

121
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:27,050
However, we can't break the alliance we have with Baekje against Goguryo that's over 100 years old.

122
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:33,730
If our alliance with Baekjae is broken, Goguryo will clearly see us as an immediate target.

123
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:40,270
Alliance my ass. If the situation is already like this, isn't this the end of South Buyeo (Baekje)?

124
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:45,100
What do you mean finished? Say something you can take responsibility for!

125
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,840
If it isn't over, then what is it?

126
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,750
South Buyeo's Crown Prince Chang is infamous for being hostile and vicious.

127
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,150
Then, are you saying we should just sit back and watch?

128
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,760
You should start a war.

129
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:08,000
Since South Buyeo always provokes us, shouldn't we just make it ours?

130
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,540
South Buyeo is a stronger nation than ours. How can we capture it overnight?

131
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:20,750
If we can't go to war, why don't we send the Princess to make peace?

132
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,460
At the least, if we send a delegation accompanied by troops,

133
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,690
it could be a matter solved more easily than we thought.

134
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,730
How can you use the Princess for that?

135
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,190
If not, then we should just go to war.

136
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:43,750
What will you do? Will you start a war, or make peace?

137
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,660
You should quickly make a decision.

138
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:56,870
Then, I will send the Hwarang along with the peace delegation.

139
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,180
If we want to make peace with South Buyeo, it would be better to send the Hwarang instead of the military.

140
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:10,310
That way, they will also think that we came to make peace.

141
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,010
Don't you think so?

142
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:22,040
The Royal Council's worries are great. They're anxious about their children being chosen

143
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,290
and not being able to return.

144
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,010
By chance, don't you think we made the wrong assumption?

145
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:35,850
If Seon Woo is Sam Maek Jong, how could she have said she would send the Hwarang off to war without hesitation?

146
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,000
Didn't you hear what the Queen Dowager said?

147
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,110
They are not going to start a war; they are going to make peace.

148
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,150
No one knows how this will turn out.

149
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:53,970
If they don't accept our offer of peace, the Hwarang could become hostages or be killed.

150
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:59,700
He is definitely Sam Maek Jong. However, in the case he isn't,

151
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,040
there's no doubt that Sam Maek Jong is in the Hwarang.

152
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:10,120
Let's watch the Queen Dowager fall into her own trap.

153
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,560
Do you think I can become King?

154
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,410
Mother will not give me the throne.

155
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,700
The king that Shilla wants is

156
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,100
not the regent Queen Dowager, but a real king.

157
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,700
Even if I became the King, would it be okay?

158
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,850
A nation where the people are happy, but the king is tormented.

159
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,770
The people don't worry about the nation but it's a nation where the king worries about his people.

160
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:03,910
Didn't you say you wanted to live in that kind of nation?

161
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,420
If you want to create that kind of nation,

162
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,850
it's okay to become the king.

163
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,590
I want to become strong.

164
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:22,780
However, for a king who was in hiding for his entire life...

165
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,450
how could he be a source of strength for anyone?

166
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,510
What did you just say?

167
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,790
I will select members from the Hwarang

168
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:41,210
and send them to South Buyeo with the peace delegation.

169
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:46,200
Then, while the royal family and the royal council are fighting in the palace...

170
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,360
To put it nicely, are you saying that it's temporarily effective only to get worse later on?

171
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,630
Have you thought about what a war would do to Silla?

172
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,940
If the alliance with Baekje against Goguryeo is broken, it is the end of a peaceful Silla.

173
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,900
This is the only decision we must make in order to avoid a war.

174
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,150
Prepare a delegation with Park Yeong Sil and the royal council's children.

175
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:12,370
Now you seem like a real king.

176
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:18,170
But that is not Your Majesty's place.

177
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:23,760
This is a decision the King should make.

178
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,920
Right now, I'm Silla's ruler.

179
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,980
What you should be saying to me is, "I'll obey, Your Majesty."

180
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,300
Just these two phrases.

181
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,910
I'll obey, Your Majesty.

182
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:54,140
But, I'll select the Hwarang members.

183
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,550
This is good enough.

184
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,970
Naturally, as coincidentally as possible.

185
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,890
Did he not see me?

186
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,650
What are you doing?

187
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,480
He didn't see me, right?

188
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,880
He did.

189
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:33,550
Dog-Bird saw you and I saw him take a turn all the way over there.

190
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:37,410
No way. He wouldn't.

191
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:41,500
So, you're being avoided by your brother?

192
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,710
- I said it wasn't like that.
- How did you end up like that?

193
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:49,090
If possible, brothers protect their sisters.

194
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,920
Did he betray you?

195
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,250
It's not betrayal... The situation at that time—

196
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,640
So he did.

197
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,420
I said it wasn't that!

198
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:03,050
Why don't you leave and stop goofing around.

199
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:09,910
What is it? Why did he betray you? Because of whom?

200
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,660
Why the hell are you avoiding me?

201
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:25,160
I'm also a doctor. You're wielding a sword in front of me,

202
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,410
but should I always be taking your side no matter what?

203
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,730
What exactly did I do wrong?

204
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,610
Then you should tell me in person. What do you have a mouth for?

205
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:41,030
Why are you avoiding me?

206
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,910
Why are you so narrow-minded?!

207
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,470
You're always doing this.

208
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,690
When things get tough, you avoid me.

209
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,340
But if you're going to avoid me, until when are you going to do so?

210
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,210
Why? Are you never going to see me again because of that?

211
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,630
When you can't even escape.

212
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:02,960
When you're going to stay by my side. I know it.

213
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,810
What does he want me to do?

214
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,600
What am I supposed to do?

215
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,330
Poong Wol Joo, is something the matter?

216
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,400
Assemble the Hwarang.

217
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,130
There's something we need to discuss.

218
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,200
Yes.

219
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,440
Do you still think I'm the king?

220
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,740
Suppose that I'm the King.

221
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,900
You and I, can't we be friends?

222
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:13,120
The moment I'm certain you're the King, I'll kill you.

223
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,840
Then I can continue not being the king.

224
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,350
Because I think it's better being your friend than being the King.

225
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,090
Whether you think of me as an enemy, this is the truth.

226
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,690
You don't know what a friend is.

227
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,090
Since, you've never had one.

228
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,470
There's only one reason why I'm leaving you alone.

229
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,030
Because for some reason, Ah Ro protects you.

230
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:43,850
Don't mess with her. Until I become more certain about you.

231
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,830
What did that bastard say?

232
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,490
- It's nothing.
- Ah, that rascal.

233
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,390
But why are you here?

234
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,260
It's the Queen Dowager's letter.

235
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,050
Jeong

236
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,020
Jeong as in the meaning to stay, remain.

237
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:37,010
What is this? This subtle fixation of stares.

238
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:51,840
Hey, you saw him fighting, right? Wow.

239
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,440
I thought I was going to pee in my pants.

240
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,560
If I had known he was the King, I should've treated him well.

241
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,590
Whether that guy is the King or not, bring me the answer.

242
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:13,170
There has to be no king, so you can become one.

243
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,500
Do you know Seon Woo?

244
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,850
I ask you to take good care of him, Soo Ho.

245
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,290
Haven't you gotten a hole in your face yet? Everyone's looking at you.

246
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:52,700
Today, there is something I want to tell you in particular.

247
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:59,930
What I'm about to tell you is not an assignment that you will pass or fail.

248
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,490
It also isn't a task that you absolutely must do.

249
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:09,320
However, it is a task that someone must do no matter what.

250
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,600
Where did you say I'm going?

251
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,090
You're telling me to go to Baekje, South Buyeo?

252
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,230
Without any troops?

253
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,550
I'm not telling you to go to war.

254
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,340
You're going in order to make peace.

255
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:39,160
If we are the only ones who insist it isn't, is it not a war?

256
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,560
Sook Myeong. If the alliance with Baekje against Goguryeo is broken,

257
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,340
all three nations will fall into chaos.

258
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,050
They of course know this.

259
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,720
You must alert them of that danger and patch up our relations.

260
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,300
Why... do I have to do that?

261
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:05,760
Because this is not war. It's to make peace.

262
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:13,130
If that's so, then I have a condition.

263
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:22,700
What is this? I don't see anything I thought I would be able to.

264
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,150
What are you doing here?

265
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:31,480
I want to ask you, what are you doing? What is over there?

266
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,440
You don't need to know.

267
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:40,990
The person that you want to see, but doesn't leave with you?

268
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:48,580
Are men usually like that? Are they that venomous?

269
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,080
Do their feelings change that easily?

270
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,300
Men do change easily and venomous men are venomous...

271
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:02,610
If you tell me who it is, I could give you an accurate briefing.

272
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,400
Who is it?

273
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,450
Forget it! Forget it!

274
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,310
The Princess is looking for you.

275
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,260
Although it's called a delegation for peace,

276
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,510
I can't guarantee your security nor your life.

277
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,600
That's why...

278
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,360
Jeong
(Hanja meaning to stay, remain.)

279
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,570
I should stay still and not move around.

280
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:46,000
The delegation will leave in three days. Tomorrow in the courtyard, I will accept volunteers.

281
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,900
Until then, think about it deeply.

282
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:56,310
Who would do that? Right?

283
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,410
Why do I have to go there?

284
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:12,090
Did you forget that you are my personal doctor?

285
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:16,680
However, I'm not an official doctor and if I go, then the Hwarang...

286
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,870
It's the Queen Dowager's order.

287
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:24,020
Do you dare refuse the Queen Dowager's order?

288
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:29,910
All you have to do is shut your mouth and follow.

289
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,580
Baekje, South Buyeo...

290
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,770
What should I tell my father? If he knows, then he'll be worried.

291
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,970
Orabeoni...

292
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:01,020
whether he knows or doesn't, isn't going to do anything.

293
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:05,000
That narrow-minded, petty and stingy miser!

294
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:23,520
Why are you taking that doctor with you?

295
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,300
There are much better doctors at Wolseong.

296
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,070
Do you think I'm taking her because I want to?

297
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,640
Then...

298
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,150
Sook Myeong is going to Baekje?

299
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,060
Since making peace is the goal, it seems they're taking the smallest amount of people.

300
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:02,500
Do you think sending the Princess will make peace in this situation?

301
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,290
We'll probably have to pacify and humor them,

302
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,660
with things like gold and silk.

303
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:16,880
Until when will Silla be dragged around by surrounding nations?

304
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,820
It started too early.

305
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,980
What are you talking about?

306
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:40,420
Shaking things up.

307
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,470
What do you mean by shaking? Shake what up?

308
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,890
That time has come faster than I thought.

309
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:53,780
You've been talking to yourself since earlier. What time has come?

310
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:58,710
The time when Hwarang will go out into the world.

311
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,630
So, have you thought it over well?

312
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,100
So, is there no Hwarang who wants to volunteer?

313
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,150
Who would want to do it? Don't you think so, Soo Ho?

314
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,510
Dog-Bird.

315
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,550
We are going with the motive to make peace with South Buyeo.

316
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:53,680
However, I can't guarantee that you will come back alive.

317
00:33:55,270 --> 00:34:00,140
This is the first mission that is assigned to this kingdom's Hwarang, so if you come back safely,

318
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,340
you will receive tremendous honor.

319
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:08,190
However, if you fail, there will be no peace in this kingdom.

320
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:15,800
Including this doctor, I will move with the smallest number of people.

321
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,780
For what reason are you bringing her?

322
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:25,470
I will ask one more time. Who will go to South Buyeo with me?

323
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:37,960
Don't say that you will go. I'm being sincere. Don't do it.

324
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,880
I will go.

325
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,710
Seon Woo, that's great. Is there anyone else?

326
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,210
- I will go as well.
- Soo Ho...

327
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,010
That's great, Soo Ho.

328
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:00,930
- I will go as well.
- Ban Ryu.

329
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,480
Are you really going?

330
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,560
Okay, Ban Ryu.

331
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,670
Is there anyone else?

332
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:17,990
- If there isn't...
- I will go with them also.

333
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,890
That's good. You four

334
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:31,440
are going to protect Princess Sook Myeong and have been appointed as

335
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,330
the delegation leaving for South Buyeo.

336
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:37,850
Protect Princess Sook Myeong well,

337
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:43,130
and succeed in making peace. Do you understand?

338
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,800
Did we run out of rice again?

339
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,950
Bring a plate. Let's eat together.

340
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:11,880
It's not that. I ate outside, so you should eat.

341
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,050
Is something the matter?

342
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:17,280
No. There's nothing like that.

343
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,710
It's very difficult because of me, right?

344
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,690
I'm sorry.

345
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,230
Don't be.

346
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:31,140
Thanks to you, the poor people in the capital are able to get treatment.

347
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,710
If you wait a little longer,

348
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,960
- I will...
- I'm okay.

349
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,520
These days, it's not difficult since I only have work in Seonmoon.

350
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,040
So, you have to be an excellent doctor until the very end.

351
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,130
A doctor who doesn't discriminate based on bone rank or riches.

352
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:53,600
The kind of doctor who will hold the hands of those who are weak and without power.

353
00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:00,160
That way, I can live proudly. It's true, Father.

354
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,320
Don't worry.

355
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,320
I will return safely.

356
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:46,940
In the end, even after receiving my letter he volunteered?

357
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,320
I apologize.

358
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,340
Why is he disobeying me like this?

359
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:58,350
He is making his mother a complete fool. Why? Why?!

360
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:19,720
You should stop. You should stop.

361
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,800
Is he even thinking about me at all?

362
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,920
How can Ban Ryu make that decision without even telling me?

363
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:33,940
Can't you think about me also? I'm going too.

364
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,880
I should give him a memento.

365
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,710
Well, what are you going to give him?

366
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,450
My hair.

367
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:50,080
Hey. Isn't that too burdensome?

368
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,260
You usually give these things to make them feel burdened.

369
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:59,160
If he goes, I don't know if he will come back dead or alive.

370
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,320
I have to do at least this much to leave an impression.

371
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,010
I'm going too! Is this something you should say in front of me?

372
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:10,000
At least you're going with your brother!

373
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,860
Well, we are going together...

374
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,330
Why? Why can't I?

375
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,670
Why are you doing this to me? You should have said something at the time.

376
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:28,890
I didn't know because I was hiding, so take me too.
Tell Poong Wol Joo for me.

377
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:31,090
Wait, wait, wait.

378
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,450
Ask the other guys.

379
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:36,760
I don't like the other guys. I like you.

380
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:42,740
How can you make a confession so suddenly and make the other person flustered?

381
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:48,790
Does Seon Woo see me as a child too? I'm also an adult. I win at everything.

382
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:55,870
Sheesh. Hey, why do you like me?

383
00:39:56,870 --> 00:40:01,300
I don't know. You're just cool.

384
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,910
Aigoo.

385
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,020
Sorry about this, Seon Woo.

386
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,340
Yeah, good thing you came. Hold onto him, so he can't follow me.

387
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,310
Or else he will probably follow us all the way to South Buyeo or Baekje, whatever.

388
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:17,820
What? No! I'm going to follow you.

389
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:24,510
I want to follow you! I want to follow you! I'm going to follow you! Let go! I'm going to follow you!

390
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:27,640
Why? I'm going to follow you!

391
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:41,230
Wow, you won't even stand up anymore?

392
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,060
I apologize.

393
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:50,410
I have no strength in my legs, so just for a moment... I'll be like this for a moment.

394
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:54,860
Just tell me truthfully that you want to be my equal.

395
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:03,510
The Chinese character "Jeong". Meaning to stay. The Queen Dowager already warned you through her letter.

396
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:07,420
In the end, you volunteer?

397
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:14,470
Do you think Your Majesty's life is only yours? If there is no king, there is no Silla.

398
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:20,700
When I escorted you out of the palace, you were seven. I have watched you grow up

399
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,120
and I protected you up until now!

400
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,850
I got it, so calm down and—

401
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:31,140
You can't do this. Without even consulting me...

402
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,560
How can you do something so dangerous?

403
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:41,510
I... can't even follow you... That kind of...

404
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,320
Don't do this.

405
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:47,120
I...

406
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,180
Gosh, seriously!

407
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,110
Please accept this.

408
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,620
I can't go with you, but if this might be burdensome...

409
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:32,170
It's not... burdensome.

410
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:41,190
Then...you should leave now.

411
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:01,650
Please return safely. I will be waiting.

412
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:06,340
Snap out of it.

413
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:12,330
I'm telling you not to disappoint Yeong Sil Gong this time.

414
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:30,620
Your Majesty. Can't you rethink this one more time?

415
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,410
Nope, I can't.

416
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,580
- Your Majesty...
- Hey...

417
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,410
Don't do this. This is an order.

418
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:59,620
If you come back alive, I will think about it.

419
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:03,390
- What?
- If

420
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:06,850
I will really take care of you as my master.

421
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:11,940
Just don't do it. I told you. You're the same as I am.

422
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:16,900
Your duty is to guard Princess Sook Myeong.

423
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:24,950
As a Hwarang, keep yourselves proud. Don't back out of a fight. Keep your loyalty toward your friends.

424
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:33,650
You may find yourself in unexpected situations. At those times, keep this in mind. You are Hwarang!

425
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:37,890
You are the pride of Silla. Do you understand?

426
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:39,490
Yes!

427
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:46,650
♬ When the path on which I fearlessly♬

428
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:53,090
These four Hwarang, as envoys seeking peace with South Buyeo,

429
00:46:53,090 --> 00:47:00,360
will guard Princess Sook Myeong. Further solidify the alliance with Baekje since Nulji of Silla before you return.

430
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,320
Yes!

431
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:08,260
♬ You were there. Like a dream ♬

432
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:13,560
♬ then another world which I came to know ♬

433
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:18,760
♬ and even a shard of my crushed heart ♬

434
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:27,920
♬ became a light in your breath. ♬

435
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,030
Good job.

436
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:35,860
It's about guarding the Princess of Silla. If you're a Hwarang, of course you should step up to the plate.

437
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:44,050
However, what in the world did the Queen Dowager tell you?

438
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:52,650
Father, protecting His Majesty is the same as protecting the Queen Dowager,

439
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,260
Right?

440
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,360
Why do I have to go there?

441
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,970
There is something you must do.

442
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:13,160
Give this secretly to Crown Prince Chang.

443
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:16,070
What is this?

444
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:22,020
It's a gamble. It's a gamble I'm doing with Silla as the wager.

445
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:28,600
You must relay this letter to the Crown Prince, no matter what.

446
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:40,490
Take a look. The harder you try, the more those around you will get hurt.

447
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:45,660
So don't do anything, if you want to protect those close to you.

448
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:56,430
Protect Ah Ro. No matter what, you must protect Ah Ro.

449
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:18,400
On the Queen Dowager's command, I'm going with the Princess as a delegation to South Buyeo.

450
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,430
Since I'm going together with Orabeoni, don't worry too much. I'll return safely.

451
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:26,010
Be healthy, Father.

452
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:34,890
How much longer?

453
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:37,380
Just how much longer!

454
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:45,580
What is the meaning of an empty wine cup at a tavern?

455
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:58,570
You don't even have the desire to fill your wine cup. What brings a doctor to a tavern in broad daylight?

456
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:01,980
I need to know.

457
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,060
How to bring Ji So down.

458
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,710
What's the reason you brought Ah Ro along?

459
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:55,600
It's not that doctor. Rather, I brought along the only Hwarang that I trust.

460
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:03,780
You came, in front of me.

461
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:19,310
You should have said so earlier. Then, you wouldn't have needlessly brought my sister along.

462
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:26,100
It's true that I also need a doctor. As a palace needs court ladies, there's no reason not to.

463
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:51,480
I should've just left it alone. Both the first time,

464
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,620
and now.

465
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,600
Just a moment.

466
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:05,830
What are you thinking about?

467
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:09,310
Hey!

468
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:17,210
You dropped this. What is it?

469
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:20,410
Thanks.

470
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:28,340
Thanks? That's the first time I'm hearing that from him.

471
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:56,240
Tomorrow, we'll be entering Baekje, South Buyeo or whatever.

472
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,520
Even if you can't sleep, get some rest so you can ride a horse.

473
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,330
I'm grateful

474
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,340
for earlier.

475
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,790
I didn't want anyone to see that.

476
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:17,160
You wouldn't know how embarrassing that was.

477
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:23,370
I know. I also know.

478
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:46,160
A nation where the people are happy, but the King is tormented.

479
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,810
If you want to create that kind of nation,

480
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:54,130
it's okay for you to be King.

481
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:20,560
I won't cry. I won't cry.

482
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:51,060
I know these are foolish words, but

483
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:56,190
did you come here not because of me, but the Princess?

484
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:03,880
When I look at you, my heart breaks.

485
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:08,600
Even when I'm looking at you like this, I miss you like crazy.

486
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:14,060
But you, I mean, when you look at me,

487
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:16,800
you don't feel a thing, right?

488
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,300
♫  Don't love  ♫

489
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,310
It's because of me.

490
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:26,360
It's not because of you.

491
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,510
♫  Cover my eyes  ♫

492
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,450
It's because of me.

493
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:37,070
♫  So that I can't see you  ♫

494
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,780
♫ This foolish heart  ♫

495
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:46,130
I was so angry at myself. I felt so sorry.

496
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,590
That's why I couldn't look at you.

497
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:59,810
♫  I love you to death  ♫

498
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:09,830
Then, did you also... long for me? Were you earnest?

499
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,940
♫  I can't stop  ♫

500
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:14,090
I hate myself so much, but

501
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:20,600
my heart that misses you was always just as earnest...
♫ Because you are my love ♫

502
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,250
♫ Because you are my love, if I hold out my hand  ♫

503
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:25,510
enough to prevail.
♫ If I hold out my hand ♫

504
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:30,830
♫ I can reach you ♫

505
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:36,800
♫ Don't go farther away ♫

506
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:43,560
♫  Don't leave me alone  ♫

507
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:54,190
One moment. Let's go to the back.

508
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:34,360
♬ Although you and I became tears for each other ♬
