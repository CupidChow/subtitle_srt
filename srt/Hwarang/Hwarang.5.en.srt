1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,700
If you're going to kill me, do it now. But if she gets hurt before that,

2
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,900
you're going to die by my hands.

3
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,600
~ Episode 5 ~
Why did they have to hit my head?

4
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,300
Ah Ro.

5
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,700
Why is that bastard here?

6
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,700
Huh?! What is this?

7
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,900
It'd be better to stay still. Moving more and hitting something might break your head.

8
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,150
Yah! Why should I—

9
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,670
Why did you follow me?

10
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,990
I did? You?

11
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,890
I must have thought we were on the same side because we wore the same clothing.

12
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:03,900
Ah, it seems like you followed that girl. What was her name? Ah Ro?

13
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,940
I know you're a Hwarang, but watch out.

14
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:12,490
If you hang around with a half breed like her, your bone rank may go lower.

15
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:18,880
I mean since we're in this situation, she must be one hell of a b*tch.

16
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,880
What's wrong with you?

17
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,250
It was you who were disrespectful and had no manners from the beginning.

18
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,660
Come here!

19
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,120
You disrespectful!

20
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,020
Are you not going to come here?

21
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,500
- You stupid bastard
- Ah!!

22
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,830
Even big shot Ban Ryu, who swore not to be a dog for the Queen, seemed to have no choice.

23
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,730
You look good, considering you're a puppy.

24
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,630
- That bastard!
- Stay still.

25
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,180
Just say a word. We'll bring him down immediately.

26
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,460
Shut that mouth!

27
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,770
And stay still.

28
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,500
People says "Soo Hwa Pe Wol" which means

29
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,510
even flowers and the moon would hide from their beauty. To believe that I'm alive to see this.

30
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,310
You like it?

31
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,560
Even here there are two sides, the Queen's group and the Gakgan group.
(Gakgan is the highest officer)

32
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,690
It's making me sick.

33
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,530
Look here, these are my Hwarang.

34
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:17,640
Don't ever forget for a second that from now on, I have your sons' lives in my hands.

35
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,760
Don't let your guard down.

36
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,280
I will first find Sam Maek Jong and steal the crown from him.

37
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,870
What's happening? To that boy?

38
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,650
The thing is... he still hasn't arrived.

39
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,540
Kim Ji Dwi

40
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,520
This boy is going to be screwed. Where in the world is he?

41
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:02,330
She is your sister? Really?

42
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,340
Why do you care that she is my sister?

43
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:14,630
Well first let's figure out how we can get out. Then we can talk about the rest of this outside.

44
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,590
You go that way and I'll go the other way.

45
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,460
What in the world is this place?

46
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,700
It was the blacksmith's before. Now it's a slaughter house.

47
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,210
A place where they kill cows and pigs.

48
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,000
However, I think that today they're going to kill something else.

49
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,240
Wha... What?

50
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,160
We should not kill them right now.

51
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,700
He has to be alive so he can get punished.

52
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,030
- What are we are going to do with the other bastard, there is also that girl too?
- Uh...

53
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,690
Kill them?

54
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,690
The guy looked like a nobleman. Will it be okay to kill him?

55
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:33,460
Then, nobody should know for your safety, right?

56
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,790
Yeo Wool, Yeo Wool. Why are we waiting for? Why aren't we starting?

57
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,460
They want to screw us up by letting us stand like this

58
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,060
What has gone wrong?

59
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,350
It's the Queen Dowager.

60
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:08,300
That kind of love story only happens on the street.

61
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,160
I have no idea what you are talking about.

62
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,600
Your Majesty, we cannot delay it any further.

63
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,640
Your Majesty.

64
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,190
Start the appointment ceremony.

65
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,770
Start the appointment ceremony!

66
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,750
It won't happen in a thousand years.

67
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,910
It must be better than whistling while playing.

68
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,220
It's not that.

69
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,360
Ah.

70
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,340
They're coming.

71
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,940
Well, I know what you're going to do,

72
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,810
but I think it'd be better not to.

73
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,780
I'm someone you can't carelessly mess with!

74
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,820
You bastard!

75
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,180
Help me!

76
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,490
Uh, uh!

77
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,760
- Kick!
- Uh?

78
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,410
- I said to kick.
- What?

79
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,130
Now!

80
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,920
Hurry, hurry.

81
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,890
Wait... Wait... Wait a minute!

82
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,720
Hey, don't come near me.

83
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,790
You don't know me? I hate people with knives.

84
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,130
Good job!

85
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,530
How could it be? Is it like that?

86
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,450
But since you are the girl that Dog-Bird Gong likes,

87
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:10,190
I will treat you properly.

88
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,750
I need to live.

89
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,730
You have a face that Dog-Bird Gong likes.

90
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,510
What are you doing? You have to untie me first.

91
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,130
- Are you always such a jerk?
- How dare this bastard...

92
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,500
What is he saying?

93
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,230
Save me.

94
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,140
Hwarang Kim Wi Hwa is here to be assigned

95
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,200
as the master of Hwarang.

96
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,790
Did you miss your card?

97
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,080
It seems that I am not the only one who missed the card.

98
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,010
Was your card the son of Ahn Ji Gong?

99
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:37,690
Then, where did you hide your card?

100
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,510
Wi Hwarang, submitting to the Queen's decree,

101
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,640
will accept the master position of Hwarang.

102
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,380
Let's go.

103
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,350
Are you sure it's this way? She might not even be here.

104
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,330
Here!

105
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,870
Hold on. Stay still.

106
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,080
It's me. It's me, Ah Ro. Stay still.

107
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,680
Are you alright?

108
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,930
I thought you were dead.

109
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,070
Why would you die? You didn't die.

110
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:54,380
Not me, you!

111
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,850
I thought you were going to die!

112
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,360
I was scared you'd die.

113
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,240
I was scared to death.

114
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,170
I was...

115
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,790
It's all done. So stop that and let's go.

116
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,230
Like this...

117
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,990
Where are those bastards? Find them right now!

118
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,120
They're here. We have to leave.

119
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,110
Mom!!

120
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,820
Come here.

121
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,960
Well, let's go.

122
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,780
It's this way.

123
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,730
Catch them!

124
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,490
- Go ahead, I will stop them.
- What?

125
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:10,960
I said I can take care of things here.

126
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,990
GO!

127
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,560
Ah, I'm believing him.

128
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,940
Why aren't you coming out? Hurry and get out here!

129
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,680
Come out!

130
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,560
What are you doing?

131
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,070
Ah, this...

132
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,380
Wait.

133
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,810
Heed my words.

134
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,910
Go follow this road and go to where a lot of people are.

135
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,160
Don't look back.

136
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,640
Or If you're scared, count to 200.

137
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,690
I'll come within that time.

138
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,180
I'm only going to count to 150.

139
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,200
So, don't get hurt and come back quickly.

140
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,090
I told you to go.

141
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,330
Why are there so many of them?

142
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,180
I see that you made a new friend. Where's the b*tch?

143
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,020
Are we close? Why are you asking me questions?

144
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,730
I'll take the left side and you—

145
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,780
Let me go!

146
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,960
- Hey, these jerks.
- Run.

147
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,600
These fearless bastards.

148
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,700
- Catch them!
- Let's go!

149
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,770
Who are you?

150
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,770
Who are you?!

151
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,660
Hyungnim!

152
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,780
Ban Ryu, you are appointed as the new kingdom's Hwarang.

153
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,560
Hwarang, Ban Ryu. I'll accept the name of Hwarang.

154
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,570
How cool!

155
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,290
Hwarang, Soo Ho! I'll accept the name of Hwarang, too!

156
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,260
Ah, how long do I have to wait for that brat?

157
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,730
It seems that someone you are waiting for hasn't arrived yet.

158
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,700
Queen Dowager.

159
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:34,790
Did he run away, abandoning his father who risked his life for him?

160
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,490
We must finish the appointment ceremony, Your Majesty.

161
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,700
Today, the people who received the sword of Hwarang

162
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,660
are the kingdom's—

163
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,030
Ji Dwi is

164
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,790
appointed the new kingdom's Hwarang.

165
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,240
Hwarang, Ji Dwi.

166
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,420
I'll accept the name

167
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,740
of Hwarang.

168
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,850
How... How can this be?

169
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,160
I have decided the day

170
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,460
when I would be revealed to the world, Mother.

171
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,500
Seon Woo

172
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,430
is appointed the new kingdom's Hwarang.

173
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,640
I...

174
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,780
Can I live as you?

175
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,610
Can I really do that?

176
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,640
Hwarang, Seon Woo!

177
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,990
I'll accept

178
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,750
the name of Hwarang!

179
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,080
Now, we have the new elite of the kingdom.

180
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,170
The new kingdom is not a small nation anymore. Also,

181
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:26,640
we will become the strongest out of all the nations.

182
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,940
For this kingdom and King Jin Heung, Hwarang will

183
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,640
swear loyalty!

184
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,240
Hwarang will swear to the kingdom and

185
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,690
for King Jin Heung...

186
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,590
we will swear loyalty!

187
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,940
Who on earth is Doo Woo, who confined you and Ah Ro?

188
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,340
He is the person who used to collect gold dust tax in Mang Mang village.

189
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:21,050
We have crossed paths a few times, here and there. And we don't have a great relation.

190
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,940
Why did he come after you?

191
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,480
I don't know for sure myself.

192
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,690
I had many bad experiences with him here and there.

193
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,690
Because of me

194
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,510
Ah Ro...

195
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,740
was in danger.

196
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,770
Don't put Ah Ro in danger.

197
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,690
I won't be able to forgive you.

198
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,120
Now, we can't go back.

199
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,980
You're Ahn Ji Gong's son and a Hwarang. Whatever you do

200
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,760
will be associated with me, too.

201
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:07,070
I also know.

202
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,810
I know who I'm living for.

203
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,360
Omo, you scared me!

204
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,790
Why... are you changing your clothes here?

205
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,700
What about it? Do you have something to say?

206
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,570
Oh...

207
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,680
Oh?

208
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,730
Oh...

209
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,530
Do you like duck soup? (오; oh is the beginning sound of duck/ori)

210
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,770
Huh?
♫The smile I have because of you keeps growing wider ♫

216
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,760
I should hurry and go sew.

Orabeoni, Orabeoni!

I can say it so well here, but why can't I say it.

230
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,760
I must do it today, though.

00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,350
It's a relief that you're sleeping.

239
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,090
What would I do if you woke up?

240
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,670
Honestly,

241
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,910
I have something to tell you.

242
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,180
Kill me!

243
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,120
If you're going to kill me, kill me now. If that child gets hurt,

244
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,560
you'll die by my hands.

245
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,680
Please listen carefully to what I'm going to say from now.

246
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,010
Even though you're asleep, you can't hear me.

247
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,870
Orabeoni... ( Older brother )

248
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,160
Thank you for saving me earlier.

249
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:32,680
I have lived in the belief that there will be nobody I can rely on and to look up to.

250
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,240
It's the first time I wanted to do that with someone.

251
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:43,830
I'm happy to have you as a brother.

252
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,900
It's my first time having these feelings.

253
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,970
Honestly, I'm scared and

254
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:59,170
I'm wondering if I can do this.

Get him out of this country now!

How can he do this to me? How?!

295
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:21,350
Do you know how I persevered for him? How I protected him?!

It might be better that he came.

What do you mean better?

298
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,320
There is no safe place for him as long as His Majesty is in the capital.

299
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,050
Even if he hides himself surreptitiously, just like what happened the other day,

300
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,480
- we don't know what will happen in the future.
- So?

301
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,470
No one would imagine that His Majesty is a part of Hwarang.

302
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,640
Everything worked out the way you wanted.

303
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:05,380
What do you have a problem with?

304

Sponsored by Korean Folk Village

305
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:15,420
What is this? Did he not wake yet?

306
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,410
You woke up early, Orabeoni.

307
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:47,750
What do you mean, early? I'm late.

308
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,690
Ah. You're l-late.

309
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:56,230
B-Brother, Father left early because of a patient.

310
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,090
Why are you so awkward?

311
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:02,010
I know, I need to keep doing this.

312
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,890
Why are you so rough? Can't you just accept it?

313
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,420
Why?

314
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,410
I sewed your clothes.

315
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,120
Let's see.

316
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:33,220
You didn't ruin these clothes, right?

317
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,810
Your sewing skills are not that great.

318
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,450
This person, seriously!

319
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,850
Pathetic weaklings. You couldn't even catch one young boy.

320
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:56,440
So you're saying that the Cheonin guy became Ahn Ji Gong's son one morning?

321
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,830
Yes, that's correct.

322
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,990
And he was wearing a Hwarang uniform?

323
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,990
There's no doubt about it.

324
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,600
Alright, you can go.

325
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,430
Hey...

326
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,320
Doesn't everything fit together too nicely?

327
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,940
Sam Maek Jong came into the capital.

328
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:29,510
Then, Queen Dowager Ji So created Hwarang as fast as greased lightning.

329
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:34,740
But the problem is, some people have seen his face.

330
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,880
Must be so uncomfortable and annoying.

331
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,600
- But, this...
- In my eyes,

332
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,770
the person who saw Sam Maek Jong's face is

333
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:50,120
Ahn Ji Gong's son.

334
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,710
Didn't the Queen make the person who saw the King's face,

335
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:58,400
that she was eager to hide, a Hwarang right in front of us?

336
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,430
Huh... This...

337
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,420
How am I supposed to do this?

338
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,370
Ah! So frustrating! Come here.

339
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,680
This way.

340
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,810
Like this...

341
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:30,010
I have no idea who's frustrated. I clearly told you that I'm late.

342
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:33,020
Have you ever been told by anyone that you're spiteful?

343
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,790
You probably have. There's no way that you haven't with this personality.

344
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,760
Can you open your arms wider?

345
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,550
Like this.

346
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,970
It's right, though.

347
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,480
I don't think so.

348
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,270
How can you not remember this?

349
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:03,530
So I think it's because of your terrible sewing...

350
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:08,620
Even though my sewing is a bit lacking, I'm pretty good at stitching people's skin.

351
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,520
Oh, you had that kind of skill?

352
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,230
Alright, all done.

353
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,720
Okay, stay right there.

354
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,250
Well, now that I'm looking at it, you look fine.

355
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:40,090
You knew from the beginning. "He's fine. He's handsome. Very."

356
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,200
You said that, right?

357
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,940
♬ When the path on which I fearlessly♬

358
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:53,640
I'm going to see it too, the Hwarang procession. So wave if you see me.

359
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,550
I don't want to.

360
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:01,140
I guess having a sister is very troublesome and annoying.

361
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,040
I need to wave. Oh my goodness.

362
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,630
♬ You were there. Like a dream♬

363
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:11,740
♬ then another world which I came to know♬

364
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:17,090
♬ and even a shard of my crushed heart ♬

365
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:21,600
♬ became a light in your breath.♬

366
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,100
Their faces are so bright that we don't need a sun.

367
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,650
♬ I'm fine with you as the only one.♬

368
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,380
Did you see that? Did you see Soo Ho lock eyes with me?

369
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,340
What are you talking about? Can't you see?
♬ I will find the star.♬

370
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,740
He obviously fell for me.
♬ Until I reach the dream♬

371
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,680
No, he didn't.
♬ suspended high in the sky♬

372
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,740
I mean, anyone can see that it was me. You saw it earlier.
♬  You are the only one ♬

373
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,360
I pity you.
♬ I will never throw away.♬

374
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,400
- Truthfully, isn't Ban Ryu the only one you can see?
- I know, right?

375
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,500
No, I only see Soo Ho.

376
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,170
- What are you saying?
- They already passed!

377
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,330
Where did our Ban Ryu go?

378
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,160
Over there, over there.

379
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,640
Really? Ah...

380
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:16,370
People say clothes are like wings. He looks like a somebody in such a clothing!

381
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:28,270
He looked like a jerk from the soccer game. How can he be a Hwarang?

382
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:33,560
Anyway, he won't be able to handle it for long. Who in Hwarang would be on his side?

383
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:38,740
Who is that? She is a beauty.

384
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:43,270
What do you mean beauty? She's Jap Chan's daughter.

385
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,490
So, that's Soo Ho's sister?

386
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:49,210
♬ I'm fine with you as the only one.♬

387
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:54,000
♬ I will find the star suspended high in the sky♬

388
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Aren't you scared? I'm talking about keeping all of them in one place.

389
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,610
Are you already scared?

390
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:06,930
Don't consider me as your team. I am going to keep my eyes open for everything.

391
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:14,400
And if you take a wrong path, I will ask the Queen to withdraw the previous appointment.

392
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,480
That is the reason I am here.

393
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,570
You are such a meticulous person.

394
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,540
The Hwarang procession is not over yet.

395
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,390
Why did you come here?

396
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:39,380
What is this place for? Isn't it the one for all the losers?

397
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,550
They said they hated it,

398
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:50,850
but now they are eager to be Hawrang.

399
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:56,270
Until yesterday they swore the loyalty to the Queen.

400
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:59,750
Now they're going to be the guys who hate Ji So (Queen Dowager) the most in this country.

401
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,590
Did you come to see them?

402
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,760
No.

403
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:07,880
I came to buy them.

404
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:13,590
What? Who becomes Hwarang, who becomes Nang Do. How can we become subordinates of our friends?
(Nang Do couldn't be Hwarang, as both parents weren't True Bone.)

405
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:19,160
What's so great about them?!

406
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,590
Just having a great father!

407
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:30,850
Do they have anything else? You guys are the same too. Bugs who don't know how to do anything.

408
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,300
I'm different from you all. Understand?

409
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,410
- How dare you steal?
- Ah! Ah!

410
00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:00,070
You are quite quick to judge. I was going to taste one before I bought it.

411
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,490
Why are you here?

412
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,810
What about the procession?

413
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:05,540
Well...

414
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:08,160
By chance, did you decide not to do it?

415
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,500
Aigoo, you made the right decision.

416
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:17,320
Honestly, I can't believe you thought of being a Hwarang.

417
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,570
Let's go. I know of a very good restaurant nearby—

418
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:24,860
What do you mean, I'm not becoming Hwarang? I'm going to go in there soon.

419
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,860
Then, why aren't you in the procession?

420
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,820
It will hurt my pride to participate in something like that.

421
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:34,750
Even though you did everything else.

422
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:50,520
She shouldn't have said she was coming if she's not showing up.

423
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,900
They are here.

424
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,030
So handsome.

425
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:11,330
Pardon me, excuse me.

426
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,980
Oh, there he is!

427
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:22,720
Here, here, here.

428
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:28,100
Here.

429
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,620
Move! Move!

430
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:39,750
I'm sorry. It was a mistake. I accidentally pushed...

431
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,330
Mistake?

432
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:44,680
If you take it off, I can sew it for you.

433
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,220
Does this look like something you can sew together?

434
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,620
You can't even buy these clothes with 20 silver coins!

435
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:59,060
What are you looking at? Are you sightseeing?

436
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,030
Then, what do you want me to do?

437
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:08,750
I'm the one who wants to ask what you're going to do about this.

438
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:17,420
I'm sorry about what happened to your clothes, but if you hadn't pushed me this wouldn't have happened.

439
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:23,920
If you don't have money just say so. How dare you try to blame me!

440
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,130
Wait a minute.

441
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:34,790
You... You... You're the child from Okta store, aren't you?

442
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:36,600
The girl that tells stories.

443
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,000
Wha... What are you doing?

444
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,540
I realized that if you and I talk secretly, there might be a way for you to pay me back.

445
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:51,080
What are you doing? Let go of me. Let go. Why are you like this?

446
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,210
Why are you doing this?

447
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:55,290
Who did that?

448
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:59,060
Which bastard?

449
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:03,720
Aigoo. I was going to give it to you kindly.

450
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,300
Who are you?

451
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:13,040
Twenty silver coins to pay for her and 20 more because I made the mistake of throwing them at your face.

452
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,450
We shouldn't finish just like this.

453
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:21,060
Is that so? Will you accept thirty as the price for the mistake?

454
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,860
This bastard really...

455
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:34,430
It seems like I will make many mistakes towards you.

456
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:37,350
Just stay there and receive the price of the mistakes.

457
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:03,750
Thank you. I'll repay you, but it's 20 silvers.

458
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,570
Because the mistakes aren't my debt.

459
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:08,800
Speaking of debt, don't you have some from earlier?

460
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:15,040
I was in a panic back then. Thank you... for the previous time.

461
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:20,020
What are you doing?

462
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,320
What is it? This jerk!!

463
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,050
Jerk??

464
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,820
I saved a person and I'm getting nagged at.

465
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,780
What did you do?

466
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,150
A bond of debt.

467
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:42,170
A bond of debt? Did you put a tattoo on me?

468
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:45,070
A tattoo is not that easy to do.

469
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:49,100
It's a paint from a western country. It won't be erased for a while.

470
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:53,130
Repay the debt, then I'll erase it for you.

471
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,290
Why? What were you expecting from me?

472
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:03,190
You already know that the capital is not an easy place.

473
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:07,970
I'll definitely pay back the debt.

474
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:11,210
You have to. Definitely.

475
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:28,390
Silla's Hwarang with new hearts and new bodies

476
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:33,560
will participate in training. Please grant us luck in our future.

477
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,860
I am the head of Hwarang, Kim Wi Hwa.

478
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:43,000
I order you as the chief to open the gates!

479
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:03,560
Three in a row.

480
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:11,120
One.
(Drink the first cup)

481
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,840
Two.
(Drink the second cup)

482
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,240
Stay still, stay still.

483
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,730
Three!
(Drink the third cup)

484
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,840
This is your doorplate.

485
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,980
Those who draw a doorplate of the same color will share one room.

486
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:17,060
Come out and take one out.

487
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,550
You sure are weird looking.

488
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,800
I have this one.

489
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:41,840
Here today, there are no rules or orders.

490
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:45,500
If you don't like your room, take someone else's.

491
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:49,700
And, take the roommate, with whom you sharing the room, as well.

492
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,490
The deadline isn't until tomorrow morning.

493
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:57,430
Only the strong will have a good room

494
00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:00,730
and a roommate of your choice.

495
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:03,850
How can you give them that kind of assessment

496
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:07,800
knowing that the liquor they had was hard?

497
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,810
If you start this way from the first day, how can we tell the children

498
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:15,110
about Lao-Tzu, Confucius, and Mencius (famous Chinese scholars).

499
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:21,380
I never thought about it that far ahead.

500
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,410
Then,

501
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,590
how about just not teaching such things to them?

502
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,510
How irresponsible.

503
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:38,500
How can they know the confusion of the world if they haven't gotten drunk on hard liquor?

504
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:44,190
If the famous Chinese scholar or even his grandfather said they were coming, after they learned about the situation in Silla,

505
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:45,600
they would allow it.

506
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,650
Poong Wol Joo! ( The title of the Master of Hwarang)

507
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:51,920
If the kids who are supposed to kill, die from strong alcohol,

508
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,970
how many people will they kill in the future?

509
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:59,790
Cut the stomachs and steal, the strong ones oppressing the weak.

510
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,130
Tell them try to do it all.

511
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:11,190
If that was your concern, how about teaching the responsibilities?

512
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:14,500
Can't you teach them?

513
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:21,250
A half breed is wearing the clothes of Hwarang?

514
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:25,460
You overcame the sacred Bone Rank system to come as far as here.

515
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,760
We need to give you a proper welcome party.

516
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:32,210
Let's show him how strict the Bone Rank System is.

517
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:35,100
He ought to be freaked out from the beginning.

518
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:44,480
I know what you guys are going to do, but...

519
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,630
- don't do that.
- You half breed!

520
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:57,860
Hey!

521
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:16,620
Here, here, here!

522
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:19,720
It must hurt without proper treatment.

523
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,880
Is he okay?

524
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:32,480
That unlucky bastard.

525
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,640
He deserved it. Let's go!

526
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:40,310
What the...

527
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:42,420
This bastard!

528
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:52,200
You guys... Did you use your feet?

529
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:59,200
Now, I'm sober.

530
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:14,330
Give it to me.

531
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:21,000
You don't want to share a room with me.

532
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:27,520
You give it to me. If I give it to you,

533
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:31,720
it will seem like I lost to you.

534
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,160
I think you already lost.

535
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,080
You should give it.

536
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:41,630
Don't mess with me.

537
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:44,970
This is a warning.

538
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:48,240
Stop acting like you're better than me.

539
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,860
This is advice.

540
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:58,550
They are fighting. What will you do if someone dies?

541
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,840
Do you think there won't be any consequences after you make such a mess as this?

542
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,210
What are you so worried about?

543
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:13,660
Have you started to have affection towards your students already?

544
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,980
Or if that's not a case,

545
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:20,760
what will you report to the Queen?

546
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:24,550
Is that your concern?

547
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:33,790
What if they kill each other?

548
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:40,200
If they don't kill each other now, they'll do it later.

549
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,380
Poong Wol Joo!

550
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:47,070
Ah, it's hot!

551
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:56,500
Hey!

552
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:13,410
You stubborn bastard. If I were you, I would've left because it's so dishonorable.

553
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:17,380
You're just a dirty bastard.

554
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,770
I can't seem to get close with you, jerk.

555
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,440
I really don't pay attention to others, but

556
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,340
did you get beaten up?

557
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:51,880
I must have.

558
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,630
What if you're the Queen's Hwarang?

559
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,880
I don't usually ask these types of questions, but

560
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,810
have you carried someone?

561
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,470
I don't think that situation will ever happen in my life.

562
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:15,700
Don't you think that situation can happen now?

563
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:21,030
Don't even dream about it. Were you hit in the head?

564
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:25,510
Why... am I... doing this?

565
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:45,750
I thought you were the one who got hit.

566
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,530
Did you get hit too?

567
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:53,310
If they want to hate, let them hate. If they want to be hot, let them be.

568
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:57,820
Let them be mixed and melted together without knowing which one is which.

569
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,380
That way,

570
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:05,550
won't we be able to make something new?

571
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:23,100
Why? Have you not seen a pretty boy before?

572
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,080
Wait.

573
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:46,200
♫ In the flickering starlight nothing  ♫

574
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,020
You have black?

575
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:51,580
Then it is us five.

576
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,490
Soo Ho who is a son of Kim Seub.

577
00:57:55,490 --> 00:58:00,050
Ban Ryu who is a son of Ho Gong and a godson of Park Yeong Sil.

578
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:02,780
Ahn Ji Gong's son, Seon Woo.

579
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,860
♫  just like a dream  ♫

580
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,690
Me, Yeo Wool.

581
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:11,180
And, a person that nobody knows where he's from.

582
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,270
Unknown person, you.

583
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,830
Five.

584
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:19,980
We're going to have a lot of fun.

585
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:22,610
Don't you think?

586
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:29,120
♫ I only need you ♫

587
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:34,250
♫ I'm going to chase that star into the sky which has my dreams ♫
