5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,160
It's not just beautiful, you know.

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,120
So cute.

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,800
This is a gift.

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,160
As a symbol of our promise.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,040
If one day I win an award,

10
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,320
and our feelings are still the same,

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,680
let's be together.

12
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,160
You promised, right?

13
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,280
Jun.

14
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,720
Jun.

15
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,160
I really got you that hooked, huh?

16
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,400
Even dream about it?

17
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,040
Akin.

18
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,360
Akin.

19
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,720
Akin.

20
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,200
You're so infatuated with me, huh?

21
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,360
Johnny, are you leaving already?

22
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,840
Yes.

23
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,440
I'm running late.
I need to hurry and go practice.

24
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,520
Okay, see you later.

25
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,000
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

26
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,760
It's already been over an hour.

27
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,640
The lead actor still hasn't arrived?

28
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,640
I apologize to you, Akin.

29
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,360
I'm trying to catch up with him.

30
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,120
Maybe Johnny had
an accident on the way.

31
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,800
What are you doing?

32
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,400
Why are you so late?

33
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,440
Why are you yelling, Tom?

34
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,240
I'm only a little late.

35
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,320
It's just...

36
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,320
Ugh, an hour and a half!

37
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,560
It's not funny.

38
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,240
Other people are wasting their
time because of you.

39
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,400
What's all this fuss?

40
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,280
Why haven't we
started rehearsing yet?

41
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,040
Well, Johnny's late, so...

42
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,920
No more complaints, please.

43
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,680
Go practice now.

44
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,120
Go.

45
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,320
Wait.

46
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,320
And don't let this cause problems
for the producer like me, okay?

47
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,280
Yes.

48
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,600
Go ahead.

49
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,920
I know not
if thou hast ever heard…

50
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,440
I know not...

51
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,960
if thou hast ever heard
whispers of

52
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,560
of my swordsmanship.

53
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,680
Yet, I offer thee fair warning.

54
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,600
Steady thy hand.

55
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,240
Thou, wanderer.

56
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,520
Mark my words.

57
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,880
My mercy

58
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,600
is not wasted upon fools
who dare tempt fate.

59
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,640
Keep...mercy.

60
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,680
Keep thou mercy.

61
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,280
Keep thy mercy

62
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,040
as thou dost keep thy life.

63
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,640
Keep thy mercy

64
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,400
as thou dost keep thy life.

65
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,120
You're late.

66
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,360
You didn't memorize your lines.

67
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,600
Your timing is off.

68
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,720
You think you're the lead actor?

69
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,680
You think you can do anything?

70
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,880
Act like you deserve the lead.

71
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,480
Zero out of ten.

72
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,040
I haven't seen you call at all.

73
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
You really are hard to kill.

74
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,560
Hello?

75
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,600
Have you been thinking about me?

76
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,160
Not thinking about you at all.

77
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,080
Who would be thinking about you?

78
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm just

79
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,840
sitting here reading the script,
sipping beer casually.

80
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,960
When I saw you calling,

81
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,320
I accidentally answered.

82
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,040
That lie is not very convincing.

83
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,200
Do you want to talk?

84
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,240
If not, I'm hanging up.

85
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
No, don't!

86
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,960
We haven't seen each other in weeks.

87
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,560
I miss you so much.

88
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,440
Hello?

89
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,160
Kin?

90
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,640
Hello?

91
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,480
Can you hear me?

92
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,200
Hmm.

93
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,640
I can hear you.

94
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,440
So,

95
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,680
when are you coming
back from abroad?

96
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,600
Probably at the end of next week.

97
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,480
I'll be back with Judy.

98
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,200
Are you jealous of me?

99
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,640
I'm not jealous!

100
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,120
Who would be jealous of you?

101
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,880
Then turn on your camera.

102
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,640
So I can see if you're
telling the truth.

103
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,520
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

104
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,880
That's it.

105
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,520
Okay, okay, no need to turn it on.

106
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,920
I just heard what I thought,
and that's enough for me.

107
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,640
Hello?

108
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,640
You're gone again.

109
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,240
Hello, Kin?

110
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,600
Can you hear me?

111
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,160
We can talk for just
a little while longer, okay?

112
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,360
I have work in the morning.

113
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,640
I'll call you again

114
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,840
tomorrow, Kin.

115
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,040
Do whatever you want.

116
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,360
Kin.

117
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,640
Look up at the sky.

118
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,920
What are you doing?

119
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,880
Sorry.

120
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,160
I didn't expect to
surprise you that much.

121
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,120
It's okay.

122
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
You should change
your clothes quickly.

123
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,040
We have a photo shoot next.

124
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,360
You're running late.

125
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,960
I heard from Mikey that

126
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,360
after this shoot is done,

127
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,480
we're going for drinks to celebrate.

128
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,800
Are you going with us?

129
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,320
Yeah, I'll go.

130
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,600
Okay.

131
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,040
See you at the studio.

132
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,400
♪You made me someone new
With long-distance vision too♪

133
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,760
♪Now all I can do is see
You so far away from me♪

134
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,960
♪All I can do is watch from afar♪

135
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,840
♪That's it♪

136
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,480
Haven't you seen it?

137
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,760
This is the legendary
second form of Akin!

138
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,400
From the King of Showbiz

139
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,200
to the King of Karaoke.

140
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,680
Here comes the bean!

141
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,760
Sister,

142
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,240
over here!

143
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,040
Looks so delicious.

144
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,480
Akin is the real deal, seriously.

145
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,520
The way he looked
at me just now, like…

146
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,600
It was so melting.

147
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,160
You're just being delusional,
he's so drunk.

148
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,280
Of course, his eyes were dreamy.
Can he take any more?

149
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,600
Well, you know, he's so drunk,
maybe he's hurt or something.

150
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,320
Like, from being number one

151
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,120
to suddenly being number two.

152
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,320
How pitiful.

153
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,080
Shut up.

154
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,680
Why are you pitying him now?

155
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,480
Didn't you vote for Jin?

156
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,920
Such a sweet smile.

157
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,440
Hey.

158
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,040
Wanna go next?

159
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,480
Hey, give it to me!

160
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,520
What the hell is this?

161
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,960
Here.

162
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,000
You little fox.

163
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,240
Master Akin has assumed his form.

164
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,960
Master Akin will impart
some knowledge now.

165
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,200
Put your hands together, please.

166
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,920
Put your hands together, come on.

167
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,360
Put your hands together.

168
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,920
Don't think I don't see
through you, you little fox.

169
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,000
You are cunning.

170
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,360
You sly fox.

171
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,680
Smart.

172
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,840
But you don't know
how to use your brain.

173
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,520
You should use your charm.

174
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,120
Nowadays,

175
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,520
you're just living a pathetic life.

176
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,960
You're just getting by day by day.

177
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,760
Mr. Akin, you're really drunk.

178
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,160
If you keep living like this,

179
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,920
without adapting to this world,

180
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,280
one day,

181
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,720
you'll just get overshadowed
by someone else's light.

182
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,120
But let me tell you something,
you little fox...

183
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,640
I, Master Akin,

184
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,120
will save your life.

185
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,920
This play

186
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,200
will change your life forever.

187
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,600
Hey!

188
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,480
You little fox!

189
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,320
You promised before

190
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,360
that you would focus more,

191
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,040
and then I

192
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,080
will let you eat.

193
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,080
Here it is!

194
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,880
With Master Akin
helping us this much,

195
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,280
we're definitely

196
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,880
going to break the box office!

197
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,720
Woo!

198
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,480
What? What the hell?

199
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,920
What time is it now?

200
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,640
Akin!

201
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,160
Akin!

202
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,720
Are you okay?

203
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,880
You fox!

204
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,200
Look at this.

205
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,920
You got Akin drunk to
the point where he's a mess.

206
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,720
How do we get back from here?

207
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,280
I'll call the manager.

208
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,280
Mike.

209
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,480
No need, I'll take him home myself.

210
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,840
But please take care
of Tom for me, okay?

211
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,120
Is that so?

212
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,120
Alright, I'll leave it to you then.

213
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,880
See you.

214
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,320
Let's go, Tom!

215
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,960
Listen,

216
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,640
you came as a guest and ate
without any regard for the host.

217
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,040
Get up. I'll take you home, hurry.

218
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,720
And tomorrow,
we've got more scenes to run.

219
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,560
Are you okay?

220
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,000
Am I okay?

221
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
Let's go home.

222
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,920
You're not being careful,
Master Akin.

223
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,400
You're lying here
teasing me like this.

224
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,080
What man could resist?

225
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,240
It's really raining heavily outside.

226
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,560
That's true.

227
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,560
I didn't hear the rain at all.

228
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,800
Anyway, I'd like to
congratulate you as well.

229
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,600
Being nominated for
Best New Actor for the first time.

230
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,440
Are you excited?

231
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,840
I'm really excited.

232
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,840
I just want the results
to be announced soon.

233
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,440
My dream might finally come true.

234
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,400
Do you have a partner?

235
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,160
Look at your expression.

236
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,080
You're texting someone
and smiling like that.

237
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,480
And you're holding onto
that mint box so much.

238
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,240
It's clear that

239
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,360
it's not just any mint box.

240
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,240
We're not official yet.

241
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,160
We're just...

242
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,040
Talking.

243
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,880
Who could it be that made
our sexiest man,

244
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
fall this much?

245
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,520
It's someone really special.

246
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,360
I could say this person is the
reason I'm standing here right now.

247
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,000
If it's someone this special,

248
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,920
if it were me,
I'd probably call them right away.

249
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,320
I'd be dying to hear
their happy voice.

250
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,520
Well, I'll take my leave now.

251
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,400
Tonight, I'll make you mine.

252
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,480
Jun.

253
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,280
Jun.

254
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,120
Hello, Akin.

255
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,320
Do you know yet?

256
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,600
That I've been nominated
for Best New Actor?

257
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,640
Hello? Hello, Kin?

258
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,680
Akin?

259
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,480
Hello?

260
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,640
Hello?

261
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,200
Who is this?

262
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,320
I don't know.

263
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,440
I just know that

264
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,440
I'm having fun with Akin right now.

265
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,960
Who the hell are you?

266
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,520
Exactly.

267
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
Who am I?

268
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,440
Where is Akin?

269
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,880
Akin?

270
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,520
He's lying here with me right now.

271
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,240
Is there something you need?

272
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,160
Actually,

273
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,880
we're having fun right now.

274
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,680
I don't care who you are.

275
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,200
But if you dare lay a hand on Akin,

276
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,800
you'll have to deal with me.

277
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,720
When Akin is asleep,

278
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,040
he's really cute.

279
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,680
Sorry,

280
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,160
I don't know if
you've seen it before.

281
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,000
But when I see something this beautiful,

282
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,320
I just can't help
but show it off.

283
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,760
What did you do to Akin?

284
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,400
If you get the chance,

285
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,120
why don't you ask him yourself?

286
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
That's all.

287
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,320
(Kin)

288
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,120
Does he have someone already?

289
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,560
Well, whatever.

290
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,800
Who cares anyway?

291
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,440
(23:55 hrs.)

292
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,480
(Kin)

293
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,080
My head hurts like hell.

294
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,560
It's a bit too early, Jun?

295
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,560
Wow, you went all out
last night, huh, bro?

296
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,200
No need to be shy.

297
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,520
It's just a normal thing.

298
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,080
If it were me,

299
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,800
I would go for another round, bro.

300
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,840
Oh, crap.

301
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,160
Hello, Jun?

302
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,880
Is there a problem?

303
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,680
Usually...

304
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,440
You're not the one calling me.

305
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
Nothing.

306
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,080
Actually,

307
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,600
I saw that you got
nominated for the award.

308
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,600
Congrats.

309
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
You just saw it?

310
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,520
Last night,

311
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,640
where were you?

312
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,160
Last night...

313
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,000
Last night...

314
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,960
After the shoot, I...

315
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,960
Went out for a drink with the crew.

316
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,600
Is that what happens?

317
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,360
Just drinking...

318
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,000
with the crew?

319
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,000
Just drinking.

320
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,200
Uh, I'll

321
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,480
read the script for a bit.

322
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,000
Anyway, Jun, just keep
focusing on your work.

323
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,200
I'll see you later.

324
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,360
You go and practice.

325
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,600
See you later.

326
00:29:25,956 --> 00:29:27,177
Come on, think!

327
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,840
Hurry up, Akin.

328
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,960
Think!

329
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,960
What happened last night?

330
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,800
Mikey, everything is done here.
Should I do anything else?

331
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,440
You can go help with
the lights over there.

332
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,840
Master Akin.

333
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,280
You're dressed like a fashionista.

334
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,040
Don't you care about
the Thai weather?

335
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,040
How was last night?

336
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,360
You really overdid it, huh?

337
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,000
Did you get home safely?

338
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,880
This morning,

339
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,960
you disappeared from the room

340
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,360
without telling me.

341
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,800
I was really worried.

342
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,560
I thought you had disappeared.

343
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,000
Don't tell me you guys
stayed together last night?

344
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,040
We happened to stay
in the same hotel room.

345
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,080
Same hotel,

346
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,240
but different rooms.

347
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,400
Oh.

348
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,640
I was really worried too.

349
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,560
Sorry about that.

350
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,080
I made you open another room.

351
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,240
I'll pay for it.

352
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,960
Alright, the actors are here.
Let's rehearse.

353
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,160
Today,

354
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,600
I will do my best as promised.

355
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,200
Master Akin.

356
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,800
Today, you don't need
to pick me up, Tom.

357
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,520
I'll be going for drinks afterward.

358
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,240
Got it.

359
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,920
I've never caused trouble, right?

360
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,040
That's it.

361
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,000
That's it.

362
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,240
Hey, what's the heck?

363
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,760
You're the one who answered
Akin's call last night, right?

364
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,720
Oh, you're Jun, right?

365
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,680
Who are you?

366
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,160
I'm this famous.

367
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,280
How could you not know me?

368
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,880
I know who you are, Johnny.

369
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,280
But what I'm asking is...

370
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,760
Who do you think you are?

371
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,560
Jun.

372
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:04,960
Jun.

373
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,000
I'll give you a ride.

374
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,600
Wait, Jun.

375
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Where are you taking me?

376
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,640
So it's this guy, huh?

377
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,280
Jun.

378
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,800
Hey.

379
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,720
Where have you taken me?

380
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,400
And...

381
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,800
Actually, weren't you supposed
to come back tomorrow?

382
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,600
Why are you back today?

383
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,640
Why?

384
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,920
Does it mess up your plans?

385
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,240
What's wrong, Jun?

386
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,280
It's not like that, Jun.

387
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,200
Did you sleep with him?

388
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,000
Uh...

389
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,640
No, it's not like that.

390
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,840
It's not.

391
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,400
Listen to me first.

392
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,360
If I hadn't come back today.

393
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,320
Would you have gone back with him?

394
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,680
It's not like that.

395
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,240
Nothing happened between us.

396
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,160
Jun.

397
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,960
Why are you trying
to mess with my head?

398
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,320
You were the one who said it,

399
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,080
you told me to wait.

400
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,400
So I waited.

401
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
Believe me.

402
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,760
Nothing happened.

403
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,240
Anyone who gets close to you...

404
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,680
They all fall for you.

405
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,800
It depends on you.

406
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,640
Whether you choose
to play along or not.

407
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,880
Even though we promised each other.

408
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,680
We promised each other.

409
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,320
You allowed him

410
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,480
to do that to you.

411
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,800
You've made me look like a fool,

412
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,760
a crazy person like this.

413
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,920
If you get out of the car now...

414
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,600
I won't chase after you anymore.
