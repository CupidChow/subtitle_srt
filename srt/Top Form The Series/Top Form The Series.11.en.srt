5
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,840
They look good together.

6
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,240
Look.

7
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,240
Even in couple photos,

8
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,320
they still have chemistry,

9
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,800
like they're actually a couple.

10
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,720
How old are you?

11
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,920
Acting like you
know everything about love.

12
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,600
Hey,

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,440
do you have a partner?

14
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,320
- Hey!
- Stop.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,840
Do you really have a partner?

16
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,080
Stop it, Johnny.

17
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
At your age,

18
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,080
why are you starting
to have a partner?

19
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,040
I don't have a partner.

20
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,440
I just ship Akin with Jin.

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,560
But this year,

22
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,360
I still don't know

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,800
who I'll vote for
as The Sexiest Man.

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,520
Well,

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,960
if you don't know who to vote for,

26
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,840
you can vote for me.

27
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,320
If I'm going to vote for you,

28
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,280
I'd rather vote for myself.

29
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,440
You brat.

30
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,840
None for you.

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,560
Hey, that's mine!

32
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,320
Recently, Sigma Company

33
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,640
announced that one of the
masterpieces of the late Maria,

34
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,200
the stage play Flower and Tear,

35
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,920
will be remade into a movie.

36
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,040
What does this mean, Jade?

37
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,880
Well.

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,120
This is really disrespectful,
don't you think?

39
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,320
They're buying the rights right under
the nose of the real grandson.

40
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,560
Is there any way

41
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,680
we can buy the rights back?

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,040
Looking at the current situation,

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,320
no matter how much we beg them,

44
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,080
- they will never give the rights back.
- I'll do it.

45
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,160
Even if I have to kneel and beg,

46
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,120
I'll do it.

47
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,960
I heard that Sigma

48
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,160
bought the rights to Maria's
play to make it into a movie.

49
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,720
What a coincidence!

50
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,280
Me and Akin were just thinking
about making this movie too.

51
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,360
I guess it really
is a coincidence then.

52
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,360
But it's a shame

53
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,560
that the movie rights
are in Sigma's hands.

54
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,760
I apologize

55
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,040
for going ahead and
making the movie before you.

56
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,480
But you have to understand,

57
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,920
right now,

58
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,080
people want to know
about Maria's passing.

59
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,200
If I don't take the opportunity now,

60
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,480
I don't know
when I'll get the chance.

61
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,440
No need to apologize.

62
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,440
Sigma is a big company

63
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,880
with enough funds
to make this movie great.

64
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,840
Akin and I feel the same way.

65
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,880
But wouldn't it be better

66
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,880
if Akin joined in
on making the movie too?

67
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,160
(Flower and Tear)
(Written by Akin)

68
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,880
Since we have the same
purpose in this matter,

69
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,200
I want to make
this movie the best it can be.

70
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,640
Because it's a letter of memory

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,880
for me,

72
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,440
with my grandmother.

73
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,120
Therefore,

74
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,760
there's no one

75
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,160
more suitable to tell

76
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,680
this story than me.

77
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,400
Akin is the true grandson of Maria.

78
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,720
Just think about it,

79
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,360
if Akin is the lead actor in this
movie and also writes the script,

80
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,360
how much more
attention would the movie draw?

81
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,000
Don't you think

82
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,280
it's time for you to step aside?

83
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,280
I think the same thing.

84
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,480
I may not be the right person.

85
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,640
The character that your
grandmother wrote for me back then

86
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,760
doesn't really reflect who I am now.

87
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,200
But if I'm not going to be in it,

88
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,520
may I ask for Jin

89
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,280
to be the lead actor in this movie?

90
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,800
Jin is Sigma's kid.

91
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,560
If Jin plays in this movie,

92
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,920
it will definitely
benefit your company.

93
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,040
I just want you

94
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,680
to take the script about me
and my grandmother

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,840
and make it.

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,280
Do you really think

97
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,280
that this will benefit our company?

98
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,800
My most valuable product

99
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,040
is turning into a bargain bin trash.

100
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,120
Plus, he is defiant, insubordinate,

101
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,360
and won't follow orders,

102
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,600
messing up my work.

103
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,800
All of this is

104
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,720
because of you.

105
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,560
But my situation with Akin

106
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,320
has nothing to do with the movie...

107
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,160
Please,

108
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,960
this movie

109
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,760
really matters to me.

110
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,560
If it matters that much,

111
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,400
then you both should break up.

112
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,040
Boss.

113
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,520
If you two think

114
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,920
that this kind of relationship

115
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,520
will benefit the work and business,

116
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,920
fine.

117
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,560
I also want to know

118
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,120
how society outside

119
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,000
will react

120
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,040
to two actors
who are... what is it?

121
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,400
LGBT or

122
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,280
something?

123
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,440
I'm curious too.

124
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,880
I think right now, you two are

125
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,480
not in a position to negotiate
anything with me anymore.

126
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,480
Just go back.

127
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,320
There's nothing more to discuss.

128
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,280
(Flower and Tear)
(Written by Akin)

129
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,680
Jun.

130
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,520
I'm so tired.

131
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
So tired.

132
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,960
What should I do?

133
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,400
I don't want to give up.

134
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,160
But I don't want to
cry anymore either.

135
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,680
Please don't give up now.

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,440
I'll be by your side.

137
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,000
You're not alone.

138
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,160
(Flower And Tear)

139
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,080
So frustrating.

140
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,640
Today, that kid...

141
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,840
he kept pestering me,

142
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,600
asking for the "Maria" script

143
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,200
to turn it into something else.

144
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,280
It's really annoying.

145
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,040
I don't even know

146
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,240
how far I'll be able to push

147
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,280
this golden-haired kid.

148
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,640
Lately, he's been
getting really bold.

149
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,360
Back when
I first entered the industry,

150
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,920
you managed to push me
to where I am now.

151
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,280
It's not the same, though,
you know, Judy. You know that.

152
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,080
These people are just so bothersome.

153
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,480
Judy.

This is the first time we will be
announcing the results online

156
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,400
with The Sexiest Man
of the Year 2023 award.

157
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,800
In less than twenty minutes,
the voting will be closed.

in real-time in my hands.

As everyone at home can see,

160
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,400
right now, the scores are piling up.

161
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,320
We'll need to quickly
close the voting soon.

162
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,560
This time, we have four young men.

163
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,320
Let's wait and see

164
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,280
who will be
The Sexiest Man of the Year.

165
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,560
Look at all these people.

166
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,000
Johnny! Johnny must win!

167
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
It's tied now.

168
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,320
Oh my god.

169
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,080
Let me check the time.

170
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,640
The studio has just informed me

171
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,000
only a few

172
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,960
seconds left.

173
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,760
Between Jin and Akin, who will be
The Sexiest Man of the Year?

174
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,360
Hurry and vote before it hits ten!

175
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Okay, the numbers are
running now, everyone.

176
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,400
Are you ready?

177
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,720
Alright, let's count down together.

178
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,560
Akin.

179
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,960
The results are
about to be announced.

180
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,880
Ten.

181
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,720
Nine.

182
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,000
Eight.

183
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,840
Seven.

184
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,720
Six.

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,760
Five.

Four.

00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,720
Three.

188
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,600
Two.

189
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,440
One.

190
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
It's a tie now.

191
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,520
Hey!

192
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,800
This is such a surprise, everyone!

193
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,400
I didn't expect it.

194
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,520
Not only is this the company's first
time doing an online live stream,

195
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,040
but our award is also a big surprise!
I'm sure everyone can see that.

196
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,000
Yes, Jade.

197
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,080
I'm watching it now.

198
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,920
And the person who has won
The Sexiest Man of the Year award this year is...

199
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,440
We have

200
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,000
two winners this year!

201
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,040
Jin and Akin both
won the title this year.

202
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,080
Congratulations!

203
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,120
(First time joint winner of)
(The Sexiest Man of the Year)

204
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,040
Oh my god.

205
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,160
This is

206
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,920
really surprising.

207
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,280
But it's also
very exciting and happy!

208
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,320
You again.

209
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,960
Why did you call me here?

210
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,320
What more do you
want with Boss?

211
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,040
It seems like
last time your agreement

212
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,760
with Akin didn't work out too well.

213
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,960
How about we try
to have a frank conversation

214
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,480
like businesspeople today?

215
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,600
You must have seen the results of
The Sexiest Man contest this year, right?

216
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,280
It seems that society outside
isn't quite as you imagined.

217
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,760
To be honest,

218
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,920
I'm surprised too

219
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,640
that people have
accepted them so much.

220
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,160
And since the results are like this,

221
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,040
someone with vision
like you should know well

222
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,040
that if their
names are in this movie,

223
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,120
it will only have a bigger impact.

224
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,960
I propose that Jin

225
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,000
take the lead role.

226
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,080
And I propose that Akin

227
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,680
try directing this movie.

228
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,280
Are you kidding?

229
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,480
Akin?

230
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,760
Even though Akin doesn't
have experience directing a movie,

231
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,320
he is the most suitable

232
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,680
person to direct this film.

233
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,440
Because he is
the real grandson of Maria.

234
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,600
If you read
the script that Akin wrote,

235
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,080
you will see
how well he expressed it.

236
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,360
I've read it.

237
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,360
Well,

238
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,080
it's acceptable.

239
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,960
And if one of my kid

240
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,120
is in this too,

241
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,880
I think

242
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,520
it could easily become
a masterpiece for our company.

243
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,120
But when I do something,

244
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,600
I need to have confidence.

245
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,080
I need to be sure
that our future at Sigma

246
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,440
will

247
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,280
be problem-free

248
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,640
and runs smoothly.

249
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,560
Do you have any proposals?

250
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,640
Akin, my proposal is,

251
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,920
I want you to make way for my kid,

252
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,520
and for you yourself,

253
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,440
to leave the acting industry.

254
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,360
If boss dares to
destroy Akin's dream

255
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,680
I will quit the industry.

256
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,200
And I won't allow myself
to be your tool again.

257
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,240
Do you dare to stake
your own life like that?

258
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,240
Where does your
confidence come from?

259
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,200
Well, isn't this place the one
that taught me to be like this?

260
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,840
You guys invested
in making me this famous.

261
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,720
My value is not insignificant.

262
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,800
Are you really willing to lose me?

263
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,320
Well, listen...

264
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,560
I...

265
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,000
can make a kid

266
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,560
famous.

267
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,160
You're not the first.

268
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,080
And you won't be the last either.

269
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,040
Making someone famous is

270
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,000
not that hard.

271
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,000
But it still takes time, right?

272
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,400
Would boss dare risk
your own company like that?

273
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,280
Please, boss.

274
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,200
Touch.

275
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,680
What are you going to do?

276
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,160
Reconsider their
offer once again, please.

277
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,480
Touch.

278
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,560
Stop.

279
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,400
In the past,
no matter what boss and Ford

280
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
told me to do, no matter how dirty,

281
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,480
I would do it

282
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,640
to help Jin become more famous.

283
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,600
To help Jin follow his dream.

284
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,160
Just like you and Ford taught me.

285
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,640
You have been giving me these
instructions all along, hasn't he?

286
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,280
- But today.
- It's enough.

287
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,600
I know now that Jin

288
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,520
doesn't want this at all.

289
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,360
Jin is not happy doing this.

290
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,880
And I won't let
this happen ever again.

291
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,560
Who do you think you are?

292
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,680
He's never been happy

293
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,120
- being here at all.
- Enough, Touch.

294
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,760
Go, Touch.

295
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,280
- Go, Touch.
- Listen to Jin's proposal again.

296
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,840
Go.

297
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,280
Okay.

298
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,280
Since today

299
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,400
you were going
to speak with me,

300
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,760
as a businessperson, right?

301
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,760
If that's the case,

302
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,080
Akin,

303
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,560
I think you must understand

304
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,320
what my offer actually means?

305
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,120
You want me to choose, right?

306
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,520
Between acting

307
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,480
and love.

308
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,920
No matter how much I love acting,

309
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,560
but right now,

310
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,280
I have something I love even more.

311
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,080
The person who is most suited
to play this role in the world

312
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,880
is Jin.

313
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,480
I will step aside.

314
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,320
I will quit acting.

315
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
I ask that Jin

316
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,320
be the lead actor in this film.

317
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,160
And I'll direct it myself.

318
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,160
I will be the one to help Jin

319
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,000
win the Best Actor award.

320
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,280
It seems that Akin is willing
to sacrifice everything he has.

321
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,240
I hope you will consider this offer.

322
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
(Flower and Tear)
(Written by Akin)

323
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,080
From now on,
the hard work is on you.

324
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,840
Make sure you do it well.

325
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,120
Don't disappoint me.

326
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,120
He agreed to use your script.

327
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,120
Then let's go with the agreement.

328
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,080
Take a break from the industry.

329
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,240
Because you need to focus on
making this movie instead.

330
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,400
I'm fine.

331
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,560
It's the best solution.

332
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,920
Sis.

333
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,640
Sis.

334
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,680
I did the bravest thing

335
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,560
that a small little twink

336
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,560
could ever do.

337
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,840
I'm not afraid of anyone, sis.

338
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,200
Tea's here, Kin.

339
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,840
- Thanks.
- How is it going?

340
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,240
Actually,

341
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,360
I used to watch
my grandmother perform this play

342
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,320
when I was a child.

343
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,080
But back then,

344
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,280
I was very young.

345
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,640
I don't remember anything.

346
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,640
I only remember that

347
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,040
the audience back then

348
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,120
were crying a lot.

349
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,320
But reading it again now,

350
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,960
I don't understand it at all, Jun.

351
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,720
It doesn't seem moving at all.

352
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,280
It's just

353
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,840
a simple story,

354
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,120
about a grandson and his Ma.

355
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,160
How does it feel?

356
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,560
To have won “The Sexiest Man Award”
award together for the first time?

357
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,160
Actually,

358
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,520
winning this award

359
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,440
is not something new
or surprising for me.

360
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,440
This is the second year in
a row that I've won this award.

361
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,440
But it still feels
like the first time.

362
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,640
But this year,

363
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,640
it feels a little different.

364
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,160
I just want to thank
everyone who was involved

365
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,160
that made it possible
for me to win this.

366
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,400
It feels like

367
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,160
I've reached a resting point

368
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,240
during a long journey.

369
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,680
It makes my journey
feel more meaningful.

370
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,480
Which,

371
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,160
I couldn't

372
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,840
have discovered on my own.

373
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,240
Knowing your own
goal from a young age is

374
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,000
a good thing.

375
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,720
But it also made me

376
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,280
not know at all

377
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,560
what the outside

378
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,200
world is really like.

379
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,160
Action!

380
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,160
Acting has never been in my mind.

381
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,040
It was never
something I thought about.

382
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,080
I might be able to do it,
but that doesn't mean

383
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,520
I can do it well.

384
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,320
Until I met someone.

385
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,120
Cut!

386
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,360
I think he saw the flower a bit too soon.

387
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,440
Jin.

388
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,400
Come here.

389
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,800
He made me feel like

390
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,560
I wanted to chase him.

391
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,720
Six out of ten.

392
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,920
You're not breathing properly.

393
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,000
Slow down.

394
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,880
Breathe slowly.

395
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,600
Delicate.

396
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,680
He made me feel like

397
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,840
my efforts

398
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,880
mean more than
they ever have before.

399
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,080
One more time.

400
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,240
One more time.

401
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,520
Come.

402
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,720
Come quickly, the light is fading.

403
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,160
Jin.

404
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,400
Three.

405
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,320
Two.

406
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,000
One.

407
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,840
Action.

408
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,160
I've been an actor
since I was young.

409
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,320
The experience I have

410
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,120
makes me very
confident in my abilities.

411
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,720
Sometimes, maybe

412
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,720
it's even too much.

413
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,640
It made me forget that

414
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,720
what I can do,

415
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,720
if others try,

416
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
they can do it too.

417
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,560
Cut.

418
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,200
How many points?

419
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,720
Ten out of ten.

420
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,560
It made me

421
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,440
step back.

422
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,520
Look from a distance.

423
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,400
Take a break.

424
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,280
Reflect on myself.

425
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,600
And it made me realize that

426
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,320
this world

427
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,680
has other things I can learn

428
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,760
besides being an actor.

429
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,280
Actually, last year,

430
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,280
missing out on this position

431
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,640
did throw me off a bit.

432
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,680
I scored just
a little less than Jin.

433
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
But it doesn't matter.

434
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,840
Because Jin really came on strong.

435
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,240
Come a little closer.

436
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,160
Come a little closer.

437
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,920
Can you make it
look like you came together?

438
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,080
This year, he's back
to claim his award again.

439
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,880
I just want to thank

440
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,080
all the fans who
have supported both of us.

441
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,880
And I hope that

442
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,000
in the coming years,

443
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,520
no artist will

444
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,320
snatch the award away from us.

445
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,240
Hey, Narude.

446
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,080
Don't lose focus.

447
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,120
Just get it over with.

448
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,000
So we can leave.

449
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,840
You little devil.

450
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,040
It's Naru!

451
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,400
Just come here.

452
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,040
Stay on your mark for me.

453
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,880
It's looking great.

454
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,640
Besides all the fans,

455
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,640
I also want to
take this opportunity

456
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,320
to thank

457
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,600
the people who
have been taking care of me,

458
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,920
who have been pushing me.

459
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,120
It gets stranger every day,
that thing in front of the car.

460
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,080
If it weren't for those people,

461
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,840
there wouldn't be Jin today.

462
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,760
And what's this thing here?

463
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,960
You better watch your mouth!

464
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,600
How could you called them "thing"?

465
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,360
This is Nong Kai Dum, you know..

466
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,560
I went to worship him
along with the Nong Kai Yoi.

467
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,240
The master said that
if you worship them together

468
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,000
you'll receive blessings a hundred
times better than normal.

469
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,200
- Hey, you.
- How to do it?

470
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,680
- Sathu.
- Sathu.

471
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,880
(I'm coming back next month.
Are you happy?)

472
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,160
Why should I be happy?

473
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,600
(Why should I care...)

474
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,040
(I missed that cigarette scent — 'My Bunny.')

475
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,640
Jun.

476
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,840
Come help pack up.

477
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,000
Jun.

478
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,640
Kin, come look at this.

479
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,080
Come quickly.

480
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,880
Today,

481
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,360
the sky is so beautiful.

482
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,720
I wonder if

483
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,320
it is already this beautiful.

484
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,720
But we've never
really cared.

485
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,920
Maybe it's because of you, Kin.

486
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,840
Lame.

487
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,040
What are you going to do?

488
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,920
It must be because of you for sure.

489
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,000
You idiot.

490
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,480
Wooden Boy!

491
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,160
Wait a minute!

492
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,360
Wait, wait.

493
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,080
Not now.

494
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,400
Come here, come here.

495
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,560
No, no.

496
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,040
Be careful.

497
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,280
Stay still.

498
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,440
Stay still.

499
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,400
Let's break the
house in together.

500
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,240
Wooden Boy, help!

501
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,680
Kin.

502
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,920
Do you know what day is it?

503
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,720
What...

504
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,640
What day?

505
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,760
You really don't remember?

506
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,320
I'm sad.

507
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,760
What day?

508
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,560
Anniversary.

509
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,240
It's the anniversary
of when we first met.

510
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,960
Shoot!

511
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,760
Who would remember that?

512
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,600
By the way...

513
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,320
How many years has it been?

514
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,160
Three years.

515
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,080
That was fast.

516
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,560
Hmm.

517
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,720
Anyway...

518
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,360
I'll make sure to remember this day.

519
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,840
Kin...

520
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,280
Do you want to marry me?

521
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,720
Go win the Best Actor

522
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,360
award first.

523
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,320
I'll definitely win it.

524
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,240
Make sure you do.

525
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,000
I will.

526
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,960
(Best Actor of the Year)
And the award everyone has been waiting for

527
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,840
has arrived tonight.

528
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,000
The Best Actor Award
of the Year goes to...

529
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,240
Congratulations to...

530
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,760
Jin from the movie Flower And Tear.

531
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,560
Please welcome Jin.

532
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,400
Come up and prepare yourself.

533
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,160
(Best Actor of the Year,
Jin from Flower And Tear)

534
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,560
This award

535
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,760
may not be

536
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,840
the first Best Actor award of mine.

537
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,080
But it's a reminder

538
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,520
that tells me

539
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,280
that my heart is no longer empty.

540
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,240
And it reminds me

541
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,000
how many people are
supporting me behind the scenes.

542
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,400
Thank you to Producer Jade.

543
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,480
Thank you to
the Flower And Tear team.

544
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,480
Thank you to everyone

545
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,480
who worked hard on this project.

546
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,920
Uh...

547
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,960
I almost forgot.

548
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,600
Thank you to Sigma as well.

549
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,840
For always looking
after this kid for all these years.

550
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,840
Liar.

551
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,520
Thank you to everyone, really.

552
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,200
I thank you from
the bottom of my heart.

553
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,480
Can I have the mic again?

554
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,520
Sure.

555
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,720
Please hold on for me.

556
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,200
Sorry, everyone,
for wasting your time.

557
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,360
But there's something important

558
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,480
that I need to
tell one person first.

559
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,360
Until now...

560
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,280
I'm still not breathing properly.

561
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,160
I did it.

562
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,560
I'd like to

563
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,960
remind you of the promise.

564
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,480
Thank you.

565
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,520
Let's give him another
round of applause.

566
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,920
He truly deserves this award.

567
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,280
Very talented.

568
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,440
(Just Married)

569
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,920
Hello.

570
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,080
I just got the rights
to ‘Blood Wedding’.

571
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,320
Do you want to play in it?

572
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,800
Did you forget?

573
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,240
I've left the industry.

574
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,040
I didn't forget.

575
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,400
What's going on?
