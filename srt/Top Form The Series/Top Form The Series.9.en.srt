What are you doing?

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,840
Breakfast.

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,040
Want some?

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,880
Uh... Akin, are you free tomorrow?

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,320
I was thinking of asking you to
go see the new house with me.

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,680
The brochure is on the table.

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,320
Ahhh.

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,880
Is it good?

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,360
Can I have more?

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,840
Of course.

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,720
The brochure is on the table.

16
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,080
I'll bring it to you.

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,040
Let me see.

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,760
What do you think?

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,120
It's nice.

20
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,200
Let's do it.

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
Then

22
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,720
I'll go ahead and set
an appointment for tomorrow.

23
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,280
Mmm-hmm.

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,200
It's really delicious.

25
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,480
Did you see the news
about Judy last night?

26
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,000
Yeah, I saw it.

27
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,440
It's all over the news.

28
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,920
And that crazy page admin…

29
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,720
No idea what's wrong with them.

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,680
Whether they date or break up,

31
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,240
it's their personal business.

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,920
I feel kind of bad for Judy.

33
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,480
Yeah, me too.

34
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,440
She always gets treated like this.

35
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,040
And whoever dates her

36
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,280
gets called “Judy Boy” too.

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,280
People, huh?

38
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,040
Don't they have
anything better to do?

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,680
That they go around giving
people nicknames like that.

40
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,840
And what about you, Akin—
do you want to have one too?

41
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,200
Huh?

42
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,520
“Akin Boy”.

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,360
But I'll only be
that for one person.

44
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,480
So cheesy.

45
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,240
Can I have a bite?

46
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,640
Pretty tasty, eating like this

47
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,760
Next time, I won't
bother bringing a fork.

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,720
Do you want to eat more?

49
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,920
Why did you move away?

50
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,520
These are all the photos

51
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,400
that sasaeng fan
managed to take.

52
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,720
The reason I called you here today…

53
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,600
is because I want you
to help spread the news.

54
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,480
Let's take a picture first.

55
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,400
Sure.

56
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
Thank you.

57
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,920
Tired?

58
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,680
A little bit.

59
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,840
The team really liked you today.

60
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,480
Really?

61
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,200
They said it'll probably
sell out for sure.

62
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,680
- That's good.
- Touch, we'd like to borrow Jin

63
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,680
for a quick magazine shoot.

64
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,600
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.

65
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,440
Let me say hi to the fans first.

66
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,400
Sure.

67
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,000
Johnny, come stand
a little closer to your friend.

68
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,080
Akin, we'd like you

69
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,800
to say a few words
to greet the magazine's fans,

70
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,000
and invite them
to check out this issue.

71
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,640
You'll see all four of us featured…

72
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,080
in this month's issue

73
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,160
of N-ASH magazine.

74
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,600
Alright, let's gather
over at that corner.

75
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,040
Let me quickly check the pictures.

76
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,960
Sure.

77
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,080
Jin, are you tired?

78
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,360
Just a little. Are you tired?

79
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,240
Have you seen the leaked photos?

80
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,920
What leaked photos?

81
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,120
The leaked photos of Akin.

82
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,200
Hang in there, Akin.

83
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,440
Let's go to the bathroom.

84
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,000
What happened, Touch?

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,120
Let's go over there first.

86
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,160
Let's go for a massage.

87
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
Have you seen the leaked photos?

88
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,240
It's so scandalous. Who do
you think the other person is?

89
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,160
Yeah, who is that?

90
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
(Wait is this really Akin)
(Netizens suspect they're the #1 shipper )

91
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,480
(We need answers ASAP.)
(Why does it always come back to Akin?)

92
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,960
(Word on the street is this top actor's
been real busy around town)

93
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,880
(Sigma Entertainment would like to state the following...)

94
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,240
(We denied Jin were involved)
(We would like to cancelled...)

95
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,000
(any current or future project
(involving Akin and Jin)

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,960
(Sigma really is not playing)
(Really looking forward to legend of Gemini)

97
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,000
(Waitttt... If it is akin then the other person is Jin?)
(Careful now Sigma just... threaten to sue any false accusation)

98
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,960
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,120
For...

100
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,560
The sequel project of
"The Legend of Gemini"

101
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,960
and everything...

102
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,160
that you had to go
through because of me.

103
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,360
I'm really sorry.

104
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,680
Let's put aside the "Legend
of Gemini" project for now.

105
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,400
But even so,

106
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,960
please don't cancel this project.

107
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,760
Let Jin

108
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,880
stay in this project.

109
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,760
Right now, it's not
just affecting you anymore.

110
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,560
Jin is also getting
dragged into this mess.

111
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,880
They were smart to blur your face.

112
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
It's making it impossible
for us to file a lawsuit right away.

113
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
Another thing is,

114
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,760
if you go file a lawsuit now,

115
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,040
it's basically admitting that

116
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
you are the person

117
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,280
in those leaked photos.

118
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,920
So...

119
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,640
Does that mean...

120
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,480
Sigma wasn't behind this, right?

121
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,520
Otherwise,

122
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,640
why would they release those photos?

123
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,560
Why would they risk their
own talent becoming the target?

124
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,880
Why would they make
their own talent the target?

125
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,280
But I think the opposite.

126
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,040
They quickly clarified
the other person wasn't Jin.

127
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,080
It's like forcing you to go out
and confirm yourself

128
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,720
and help them confirm
that the other person is not Jin.

129
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,160
What that means is

130
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,560
they planned it

131
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,080
for me to protect Jin, right?

132
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,640
And if you don't
go help them confirm,

133
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,360
or if Jin comes out
and admits it directly

134
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,480
that the person in
the photo is Jin and you,

135
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,160
they're ready to release
even more intense photos

136
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,680
to condemn you both.

137
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,040
And they're also ready to
cut Jin out of the industry too.

138
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,680
But I think Sigma knows well

139
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,200
that someone like
you wouldn't let this happen.

140
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,920
I also made a mistake by
letting the photo leak like this.

141
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,920
Let's put the "Legend of Gemini"
project aside for now.

142
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
I'll try to find a way to fix this.

143
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,520
As for you, don't
do anything for now.

144
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,840
Just be extra careful
for the time being.

145
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,040
Not just for yourself,

146
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,840
but for Jin too.

147
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,160
Do you like eating
when you're stressed?

148
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,520
You must be really stressed, huh?

149
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,200
That photo was pretty scandalous.

150
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,840
And that was just one picture.

151
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,480
The engagement
was already that high.

152
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,840
If the full set got released...

153
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,120
What would happen, I wonder?

154
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,040
It was you, wasn't it?

155
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,320
You're the one
who leaked those photos.

156
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,520
Where did you even get them from?

157
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,440
Can't spill the tea on that one.

158
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,280
Oh, so now you can't talk, huh?

159
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,240
But when it came to my business,

160
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,280
you spread it all over social media.

161
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,760
Oh.

162
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,520
Well, the engagement
was too good to pass up.

163
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,280
Would've been

164
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,000
a waste not to post it.

165
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,080
Pathetic, isn't it?

166
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,520
Selling out someone's personal
life for a few scraps of money.

167
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,600
If it's leaked photos
of two “sexiest” guys,

168
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,120
the engagement must be sky-high.

169
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,880
Maybe high enough that I could quit
profiting off other people's misery, right?

170
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Are you trying to threaten me?

171
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,720
Sigma would never
let you get away with that.

172
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,120
You're right.

173
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,960
They wouldn't

174
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,120
want me to do something like that.

175
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,320
But if I “accidentally” hit post...

176
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,960
I'd just get sued.

177
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,080
Worst case? I lose some money.

178
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,440
But you and
that rising star actor...

179
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,560
You'll be left with nothing.

180
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,960
What do you actually want?

181
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,320
But if you, Akin,

182
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,920
are willing to trade me
something spicier than this photo…

183
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,960
my finger might not
"accidentally" slip,

184
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,360
and post a picture showing
your boyfriend's face, for example.

185
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,000
You already know what I want.

186
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,800
Think it over.

187
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,680
I'll come back for your answer.

188
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,320
Jin,

189
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,560
what are your thoughts on
working with Judy again?

190
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
First of all, I'd like to thank
the higher-ups for trusting me.

191
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,480
And lately, I've really
been enjoying my work a lot.

192
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,360
Also, I want to tell
everyone in advance—

193
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,480
This drama—

194
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,880
I promise it won't
disappoint anyone.

195
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,160
Please stay tuned.

196
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,680
We hope you'll watch it!

197
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,440
Thank you.

198
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
It's not just affecting you anymore.

199
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,160
Jin is also being
dragged into suspicion.

200
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,560
Be more careful these days.

201
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,760
Not just for your own sake…

202
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,680
but for Jin's too.

203
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,280
(Telephone)

204
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,920

205
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,280
(Jun)

206
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,200
Hello, Jun?

207
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,640
Kin...

208
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,120
Why didn't you answer when I called?

209
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,360
Sorry.

210
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,280
Calling you out this late...

211
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,320
I called you so many times.

212
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,600
Do you know how worried I was?

213
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,120
I saw the news.

214
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,160
But you're not alone in this.

215
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,720
Let's face this problem together.

216
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,680
I'll be by your side.

217
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,560
Don't disappear on me again.

218
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,200
Let's break up.

219
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,520
Huh?

220
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,280
What kind of joke is that?

221
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,160
Do I look like I'm joking?

222
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,280
Do you really want
to break up with me?

223
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,120
If not today,

224
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,640
then one day...

225
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,200
we'd have to break up anyway.

226
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,560
I never intended to be serious
with you in the first place.

227
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,320
Kin, stop lying.

228
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,320
Tell me the truth.
What are you hiding?

229
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,240
Why?

230
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,440
Just because I said
I want to break up,

231
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
you can't accept it?

232
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,880
Kin, I said stop lying.

233
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,360
We made a promise.

234
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,920
You, too...

235
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,240
Stop lying to yourself.

236
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,640
For the last time...

237
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Tonight...

238
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,360
I'll stay with you.

239
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,120
Let's just get it over with.

240
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
You act like you don't really want this.

241
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,680
Did I mean so little to you?

242
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,640
You were never supposed
to mean anything at all.

243
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,200
Fine.

244
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,040
What's up?

245
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,040
I accept your offer.

246
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,200
But you…

247
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,440
You must not release any more
photos. Absolutely not.

248
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,280
Okay.

249
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,320
See you in two weeks.

250
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,760
Goodbye, Jin.

251
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,440
Goodbye, Jun.

264
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,440
I'll give you one more chance.

265
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,280
I won't let you down.

266
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,000
Isn't this a bit too easy?

267
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,400
Prove yourself.

268
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,640
Prove that you deserve
the chance I'm giving you.

269
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,040
Okay.

270
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,600
I'll prove it to you.

271
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,080
That I won't disappoint you.

272
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,880
Very good. Passed, you passed.

273
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,040
Good. Now let's
go bring out the props.

274
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,040
You did great, Jin.

275
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,560
Thank you.

276
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,360
You're really good at this.

277
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,560
You were amazing too, Judy.

278
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,280
Aw, if I didn't have Jin…

279
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,720
I wouldn't have gotten
into character this much.

280
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,200
Hello, Ford?

281
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,120
Do you have a minute to talk?

282
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,240
Jin and Judy's pairing…

283
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,440
Their chemistry is amazing.

284
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,080
They totally
killed it on set just now.

285
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,520
Seriously.

286
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,120
The photographer even
pinched his own leg…

287
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,120
Almost left a bruise.

288
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,080
Hey—

289
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,120
How did you end up in my room?

290
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
This is my room, idiot.

291
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,520
You came in here, dragged me into
drinking and acting like a mess…

292
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,520
Now look at the state
of my workspace.

293
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,160
Don't you remember?

294
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,760
Ye dafty!

295
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,560
Your room was already messy anyway.

296
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,440
But you look better than I expected.

297
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,840
I thought you'd be crying
your eyes out or something.

298
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,800
Crying about what?

299
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760
I'm a grown-up, you know.

300
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,360
It's just a small thing.

301
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,520
Yeah.

302
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,600
Hey—

303
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,640
About the "Legend
of Gemini" project...

304
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,520
Is it still going?

305
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,920
Yeah, there's still
a chance it'll continue.

306
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,040
But I still haven't found
someone to replace you.

307
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,360
But now that page has
gotten a ton of photos.

308
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,560
There must be one that
shows Jin's face for sure.

309
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,960
And even now, they still
haven't released anything.

310
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,080
Did you make some
kind of deal with them?

311
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,120
No.

312
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,040
Heh.

313
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
I just said...

314
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,920
That I'd give them
something juicier instead.

315
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,360
Are you out of your mind, Akin?

316
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,440
It's fine, really.

317
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,880
At most...

318
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:20,960
I might

319
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,680
not be the lead actor anymore.

320
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,040
But I've got nothing to lose anyway.

321
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,040
With skills like mine...

322
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,840
I can still get work easily.

323
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,000
As for that page owner...

324
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,200
At most...

325
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,880
He'll just...

326
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,800
Maybe just shoot some nudes.

327
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,880
And what if he does that to you?

328
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,200
I want to know.
Are you prepared for what's coming?

329
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,160
Go ahead.

330
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,000
Do it.

331
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,200
Come on then.

332
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,600
Go ahead.

333
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,760
With you shaking like that, I don't
think I can go through with it.

334
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,720
You idiot.

335
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,360
This is such a serious issue and you're
still trying to solve it all by yourself?

336
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,240
Why didn't you
just tell Jin the truth?

337
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,120
Jin's future is
looking really bright.

338
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,680
I don't want him to get
dragged into something like this.

339
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,000
And what about your future?

340
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,120
Mine's over, bro.

341
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,320
I'm done.

342
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,520
But Jin...

343
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,720
He's just getting started.

344
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,080
You feel the same, don't you?

345
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,320
Does love really make people blind?

346
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:40,960
You talk like...

347
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,400
You've actually been in love before.

348
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
That's my business.

349
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,040
But you...

350
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,720
With all the dumb stuff
you've done up till now,

351
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,160
I've never stopped you.

352
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,360
Just this one thing—please.

353
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,560
Your time is not over.

354
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,080
Trust me.

355
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,040
Want something to eat?

356
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,600
Good evening, Master Akin.

357
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,080
Do you have a few moments...

358
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,280
just to talk to a lowlife like me?

359
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,480
Just five minutes?

360
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,160
Being this close to me...

361
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,080
You better watch out people might
saying we're sleeping together.

362
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,000
Honestly, I wouldn't mind.

363
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,360
Just afraid...

364
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,880
That the real one
will come punch me.

365
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,040
It's Jin, isn't it?

366
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,160
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

367
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,000
The guy who wants it...

368
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,280
But doesn't know the right time.

369
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,680
How many guys like that
do you think there are?

370
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,440
I'm only saying this because...

371
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,000
I care about you, Akin.

372
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,240
Someone I love
and respect, that's all.

373
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,240
I get it—desire...

374
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,960
It's hard to control.

375
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
But try to keep it in check, okay?

376
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,560
Don't worry.

377
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,800
From now on...

378
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,920
There won't be any
more of those photos.

379
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,280
What do you mean?

380
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,120
Because he and I...

381
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,240
will never see each other again.

382
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Can you really do that?

383
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,160
Hey.

384
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,560
Worry about yourself instead.

385
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,360
This Akin...

386
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
Isn't that weak, you know.

387
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,800
Ouch.

388
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,000
What was that for?

389
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,680
Acting all tough, huh?

390
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,120
Hey.

391
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,680
You and Master Akin—

392
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,880
what's going on between you two?

393
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,320
None of your business.

394
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,040
So you really broke up, huh?

395
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,720
Guess it's finally my turn then.

396
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,600
I said stay out of it.

397
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,440
Is your car here
to pick you up, Jin?

398
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,680
Yes.

399
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,240
Did you change your perfume?

400
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,240
Do you like it?

401
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,400
I'm so jealous of that couple.

402
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,400
Your perfume smells nice too, Judy.

403
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,120
Hey, Narude.

404
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,160
You knew about them too?

405
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,120
There's nothing good on TV lately.

406
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,680
I'll prove it to you—

407
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,480
That I won't let you down.

408
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,040
Seriously, nothing worth watching.

409
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,920
Hey, why'd you turn off the TV?

410
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,840
Jin and Judy's drama
was getting good!

411
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,160
Akin, time to eat!

412
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,880
So tasty!

413
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,120
Hey, Akin.

414
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,880
Eat as much as you want.

415
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,200
Lyn really took her time
marinating the pork today.

416
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,880
She even boiled it herself.

417
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,640
Thank you.

418
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,120
Eat a lot, okay?

419
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,520
You know...

420
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,360
Wait a sec.

421
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,120
You eat like a kid—

422
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,240
Made a mess all over your face.

423
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,640
Still as tender as ever.

424
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,800
Oh, stop exaggerating.

425
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,800
Seriously, you're all messy now.

426
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,080
Akin, why do you look so down?

427
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,880
Did Sine usually wear a ring?

428
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,080
I've never seen him wear one before.

429
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,160
He tends to lose things a lot.

430
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,240
So when he goes out...

431
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,680
he usually takes the ring
off to keep it safe.

432
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,320
It's a wedding ring, after all.

433
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,960
Wouldn't be worth it if it got lost.

434
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,560
There's only one in the world.

435
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,680
That's true.

436
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,920
Even if you make a new one...

437
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,200
the feeling of wearing it—

438
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,280
it just wouldn't be the same.

439
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,560
Wait, what?

440
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,800
Why are you suddenly so
interested in wedding rings?

441
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,400
Are you planning to
marry someone already?

442
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,640
No, it's not like that.

443
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,160
I just...

444
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,480
was curious, that's all.

445
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,960
Oh, really?

446
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,600
I've been wondering…

447
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,920
what kind of person truly
captures your heart?

448
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,000
Ever since I've known you—

449
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,000
I've never seen you
show interest in anyone.

450
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,640
I'm still enjoying
my career in the industry.

451
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,840
And right now...

452
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,480
there's no one I'm serious about.

453
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,120
Probably won't be for a while.

454
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,880
Oh, please.

455
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,320
Back then, I was still enjoying
my career in the industry too.

456
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,400
But now...

457
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,640
I think I made the right decision.

458
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,200
You could say...
I was preparing my heart.

459
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,280
Preparing your heart?

460
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
Wearing this ring—

461
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,880
It's not just to show others that

462
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,280
we're married.

463
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,360
It's also to remind ourselves

464
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,320
that from now on...

465
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,760
our lives will be filled with
both joy and hardship—

466
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,760
together with this one person,
for the rest of our lives.

467
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,760
That's how I wear this ring.

468
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,280
Hey, Akin...

469
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,320
Love isn't

470
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,720
just about the pretty side.

471
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,960
Today might be
filled with happiness,

472
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,800
but tomorrow could bring sorrow.

473
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,000
Still, no matter what problems come,

474
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,160
we have to face them together.

475
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,760
Not let one person

476
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,920
carry the burden alone.

477
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,640
Mom.

478
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,720
Want some snacks, sweetie?

479
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,880
No.

480
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,840
Already full?

481
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,000
Thanks a lot, Sine.

482
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,280
Nana, you strangling me!

483
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,440
Nana!

484
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,680
Are you teasing mommy?

485
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,320
(Don't forget our date,
I'm picking you up tomorrow)

486
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,120
Anyway, I'll be
counting on you, Judy.

487
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,200
Of course.

488
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,320
But I want a reward...

489
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,400
Do you have a shoot today?

490
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,920
No.

491
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,400
I'm running an errand.

492
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,360
What about you, Judy?

493
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,760
Jin and I have a live
interview together today.

494
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,320
Then I'll take my reward in advance.

495
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,600
You really think
I'd do something, huh?

496
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,040
I... I...

497
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,840
Welcome to Midnight Matter tonight!

498
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,480
We're live right now, folks.

499
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,240
And tonight—at this very moment—

500
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,440
- Are you nervous?
- No one's hotter than this pair.

501
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,000
- Yes.
- As our special guests today!

502
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,960
- It's my turn now!
- Let's enjoy this live broadcast together!

503
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,240
Without further ado...

504
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,280
Please welcome Jin and Judy!

505
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,400
- Hello.
- Hello!

506
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,680
Please, have a seat.

507
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,240
Such a gentleman!

508
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,760
Thank you so much...

509
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,960
for honoring our show.

510
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,280
- It's our pleasure.
- We're glad to be here.

511
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,560
Jin has been on
the show once before.

512
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,800
And Judy — well, I feel
like we meet all the time!

513
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,000
(I made it to the front already.)

514
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,200
(I hope you
haven't forgotten our deal.)

515
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,640
You're in the front, right?

516
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,720
I'm starting to wonder...

517
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,520
maybe this couple isn't
just "fan-shipped" anymore?

518
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,120
We saw Jin wearing

519
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,120
a ring on his pinky finger.

520
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,200
So what's the deal with that?

521
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,240
Whoa, kicking things
off with the spicy question?

522
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,480
Well, our show is
known for being bold.

523
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,280
And tonight's
no different — brace yourselves!

524
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,400
You heard that,
everyone watching at home.

525
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,680
Send us your juiciest questions!

526
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,240
Let's take a peek at a few,

527
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,320
shall we?

528
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,160
We'll go with a rapid-fire round.

529
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,040
Quick questions,
quick answers. Ready?

530
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,640
Are you two actually a couple?

531
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,120
No, we're not.

532
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,960
But who knows what the future holds?

533
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,040
Smooth answer.

534
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,720
So charming.
I feel pretty just hearing that!

535
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,200
Alright viewers,
keep the questions coming!

536
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,120
Let's take a look
at a few more, shall we?

537
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,160
You idiot...

538
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,200
Even now, you're still trying to fix
this whole mess by yourself?

539
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,960
Let me read this next
comment out loud...

540
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,720
Jin and Judy are 100% cake!

541
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,880
Jin probably acts this way
with everyone he works with.

542
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,640
Just look at Jin and Akin…

543
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,760
They used to seem super close!

544
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,560
Jin seemed really close to Akin.

545
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,880
But after Akin's scandal,

546
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,200
they don't seem as close anymore.

547
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,560
Mr. Akin,

548
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,280
don't keep me waiting too long.

549
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,440
Or that photo will be
out before you know it.

550
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,160
I don't have time, bro.

551
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,000
Wait—

552
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,000
How long are you planning to carry
this burden all by yourself, Akin?

553
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:11,760
I said I don't have time!

554
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,000
Is this about
the leaked photo of Akin?

555
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,040
Because I was just
about to clear that up.

556
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,480
There's been
a huge misunderstanding.

557
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,760
Actually, the person in that photo…

558
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,040
wasn't Akin.

559
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,160
The person in that photo

560
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:34,920
it was me.

561
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,080
Wait—hold on.

562
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,200
Are you saying...

563
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,360
the leaked photo...

564
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,800
the one where people were
getting handsy—that was you?

565
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,680
So then... who were
you with in that photo?

566
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,200
You wanted to talk to me, Jin?

567
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,560
Yes, I'll get straight to the point.

568
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,160
You know who

569
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,360
leaked Akin's photo, don't you?

570
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,400
Jade told me...

571
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,680
that you might be able to help.

572
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,160
Why do you want to know this, Jin?

573
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,880
Even if you find out,
it won't change anything.

574
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,280
What if...

575
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,640
you and I work together?

576
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,960
But it's risky.

577
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,960
What do you have
to offer in return, Jin?

578
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,800
So... who was Jin with in the photo?

579
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,480
It was me—Judy.

580
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,480
Huh?

581
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,480
Wait, what?

582
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,680
But it was just
a scene from a drama.

583
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,880
Yeah, it was from
a drama we were filming.

584
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,320
You don't have to carry
this burden alone anymore.

585
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,480
(Come on, hurry up!)

586
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,080
(Are you even listening?)

587
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,600
- Take a look at both these photos.
- (It's from a drama!!)

588
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,080
It's a scene from a drama.

589
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,080
Just looked at all the details.

590
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,880
Okay, all netizens show's over,
please disperse!

591
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,960
What a shame.

592
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,760
Why did it turn out like this?

593
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,480
Your kid messed everything up.

594
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,440
My page got mass-reported
and removed completely.

595
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,440
Are you done talking?

596
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,600
Come here.

597
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,400
If I were you,

598
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,000
I'd keep my mouth shut.

599
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,480
Because you're not in a position
to bargain with me about anything.

600
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,680
These days…

601
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,680
Don't forget...

602
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,200
You only have what you
have now because of me.

603
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,200
I'm sorry, Judy,

604
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,400
for dragging you into this mess.

605
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,920
Getting the chance to have a ship with
the "Sexiest Man of the Year"?

606
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,600
If I didn't grab
that chance, I'd be a fool.

607
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,520
If the day ever comes when you want
to wear that ring again for real…

608
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,720
Just let me know.

609
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,040
I'll be waiting.

610
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,520
You don't have to wait anymore.

611
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,000
Kin.

612
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,120
Let's go home, Jun.

613
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,040
Hey!

614
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:33,480
(Jun)
