00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,120
Oh my God!

2
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,720
So many fans here!

3
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,800
Let's welcome them now—

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Akin,

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,920
Johnny, and Mikey!

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,280
- Hello!
- Hello!

7
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,200
How are you doing?

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,320
After performing in
the recent stage play?

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,360
We really put our
hearts into this stage play.

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,080
Because of love,

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,240
and the amazing
support from everyone,

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,880
we've come this far.

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,600
Thank you all so much.

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,920
Oh my God...

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,880
That was so sweet and endearing!

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,960
Everyone, get your
screenshots ready!

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,560
Exactly!

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,920
Who wouldn't fall
for that level of charm?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,200
I'm falling for it too!

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,120
So what brings you here today?
Surely it's not just—

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,320
to charm your fans?

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,400
Do you have a surprise for us or
something you want to announce—

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,520
to your fans?

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,040
Yes!

25
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,480
Because of the amazing
response from the fans,

26
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,520
we've decided—

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,120
to bring you a surprise!

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,560
Right?

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,240
-... Johnny.
-Yes, that's right.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,560
Our stage play—

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,320
will open two more
showings for ticket purchase.

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,360
Don't forget to grab
your tickets, everyone!

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,880
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

34
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,680
And what's the show called again?

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,240
"Lyche."

36
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,000
We'll take a short
break for commercials.

37
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Wooo!

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,640
Thank you so much!

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,720
- See you next time!
- Thank you!

40
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,920
Ahh!

41
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,360
Akin!!

42
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,760
Akin, do you remember me?

43
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,120
I go to every one of your events!

44
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,520
What's my name?

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,040
Move out of the way!

46
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,120
What's my name?

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,280
Do you remember me?

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,480
- Do you remember me?!
- Security! Help, please!

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,440
Excuse me, please.

50
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,240
- Akin!!
- Sorry, please step back.

51
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,240
Excuse me.

52
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,440
Johnny, let's go—Johnny.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,920
Sorry, please move.

54
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,480
Excuse us.

Since we're free today anyway...

00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,040
Shall we go find ...

59
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,320
something fun to do?

60
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,640
Hey, you sly fox...

61
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,320
I haven't settled the score
with you about that night yet.

62
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,680
Whoa...

63
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,680
Now we have a score to settle?

64
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,400
Funny... you don't seem nearly as cute sober.

65
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,560
Take this!

66
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,440
Ouch!

67
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,000
Hey!

68
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,240
That's for messing
with me!

69
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,280
Still feel like messing with me... ?

70
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,120
Akin...

71
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,600
Jin!

72
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,920
This is Naru, my junior.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,840
Hello.

74
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,320
I came to audition for the remake
of Boys Over Whiteboards.

75
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,960
I didn't expect to get
to meet Akin and—

76
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,320
You...

77
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,280
Johnny!

78
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,760
I remember you!

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You acted in the play with Akin.

80
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,760
Johnny!

81
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,080
Jin has a surprise for you!

82
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,600
Ugh...

83
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,920
I've sold myself for
roles in every show already.

84
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,240
What now?

85
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,360
Are you trying to use
that to threaten me?

86
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,240
Wow. That really hit the spot, huh?

87
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Are you nuts?

88
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,440
Who's nuts?

89
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,120
Johnny...

90
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,920
What do you mean by “sold yourself”?

91
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,600
What are you selling?

92
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,200
Like selling smoothies?

93
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,520
Or like selling brewed drinks?

94
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,360
How did you get here?

95
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,040
I brought Naru for an audition.

96
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,960
Don't mess with me.

97
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,360
Seeing that uniform...

98
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,200
makes me think of the old days.

99
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Yeah, true.

100
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,520
You once...

101
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,440
acted in a series—

102
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,720
with the same outfit
Naru's wearing, right?

103
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,040
Yeah.

104
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,880
I was super hot back then.

105
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,560
Just saying.

106
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,840
I believe it!

107
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
Don't you even think about it.

108
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,960
Naru...

109
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,480
I need your help.

110
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,960
Anything, sensei.

111
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,600
Can I borrow your outfit?

112
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,640
Uh...

113
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,360
What do you want it for?

114
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
Is that a no?

115
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,040
Hey, are you sure you
brought me to the right place?

116
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,840
This is...

117
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,320
the Boys Over
Whiteboards uniform!

118
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,680
So what am I supposed to do?

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,240
Take promo pics
with the remake cast?

120
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,000
Where?

121
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,560
Where's Naru?

122
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,240
There's no one else here.

123
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,680
Just you and me.

124
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,480
No way.

125
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,240
Please, Kin...

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,600
- Please?
- No.

127
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,320
- Pretty please?
- Still no.

128
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,800
I just want to see you in
that outfit one more time.

129
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,720
If you want to see it,
just go watch the series.

130
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,320
Why bother me?

131
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,320
What are you doing?

132
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,280
I just want to see
you from back then...

133
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,120
not just through a screen.

134
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,920
Back then?

135
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,760
What do you mean, "back then"?

136
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,840
Like this.

137
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,040
Akin's iconic hairstyle!

138
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,320
Aahhh!!

139
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
Turn it off!

140
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,480
Turn it off right now!

141
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,200
I don't want to see it!

142
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,680
Why not?

143
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,600
No.

144
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,160
It's okay if you
don't want to wear it.

145
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,400
I just...

146
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,120
wanted to ask.

147
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,280
Because...

148
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,120
when I saw this uniform...

149
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,240
it reminded me of high school.

150
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,520
Back then, I almost became an actor.

151
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,080
A drama production
came to my school.

152
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
When they entered my classroom...

153
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,720
they stared at me for a long time.

154
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,960
A bunch of my friends
volunteered to audition.

155
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,040
Said they wanted
to try out for the role.

156
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,840
But in the end...

157
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,520
they pointed at me.

158
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,360
But at the time, I felt like...

159
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,760
it wasn't really my thing, so...

160
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,760
I turned them down.

161
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,080
But now, thinking back...

162
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,080
I kinda regret it.

163
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,640
Regret it? Why?

164
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,760
It's not a big deal.

165
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,920
No need to get dramatic.

166
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,080
I just regret the time
I missed out on.

167
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,120
If I had known...

168
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,760
that saying no

169
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,640
would make me live
without a purpose for ten years...

170
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,280
before I met you.

171
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,920
And when I finally...

172
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
met you,

173
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
I realized...

174
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,760
I wanted to be part of
every moment of your life.

175
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,200
I want to know...

176
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,840
what you were when you're younger.

177
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,120
What you were like in school.

178
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,560
Were you anything like me?

179
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,520
Do you know...

180
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,840
how jealous I am of others?

181
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,600
Those who had the chance...

182
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,920
to know you back then.

183
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
Why be jealous?

184
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,920
Even if they met me first...

185
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,960
No one else...

186
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,320
got to know me the way you do, Jun.

187
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,960
Give it to me.

188
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,320
Didn't you want to see?

189
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,560
You're really going to wear it?

190
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,480
Why not?

191
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,880
So you won't keep regretting...

192
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,560
that someone else saw me first.

193
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,960
Alright, time to change.

194
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,880
Just a sec.

195
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,600
And also...

196
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,280
Don't turn around.

197
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,360
Until I say so.

198
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,480
Got it?

199
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,720
Got it.

200
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,280
Hey...

201
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,520
If you laugh at me...

202
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,760
You're dead.

203
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,640
Even if it doesn't suit me now...

204
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,720
Back then...

205
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,440
When I wore this uniform...

206
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,800
I was so hot.

207
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,520
Girls were chasing me everywhere.

208
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,600
But

209
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,000
now...

210
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,600
It's a bit tight.

211
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,440
Now I get it...

212
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,800
Why the girls used
to chase after you.

213
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,440
Hey, I just thought
of a funny story.

214
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,080
Do you know...?

215
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,200
That Boys Over Whiteboards

216
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,880
was my first kiss ever?

217
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,800
And what's so funny about that?

218
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,600
A first kiss should
be romantic, right?

219
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,200
Well, my first kiss...

220
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,920
It was full of the taste
of fish sauce!

221
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,280
The female lead had
just eaten som tam.

222
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,720
And then she kissed me.

223
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,240
Now, whenever someone
asks me about my first kiss...

224
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,680
I always answer that...

225
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,560
My first kiss

226
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,320
was with a cat at home.

227
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,600
How about this, is it better?

228
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,960
Now that's more like it!

229
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,240
So I'll take it that...

230
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,640
I'm your first kiss then?

231
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,440
I need to take
this call for a second.

232
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,920
What do we have here?

233
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,560
The best actor winner, I see!

234
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,760
Don't jinx it just yet.

235
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,400
The award hasn't even been announced.

236
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,040
About the Legend
of Gemini, you know,

237
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,240
I'm a big fan.

238
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,600
You were amazing!

239
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,880
That award is as
good as yours.

240
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,720
Trust me.

241
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,760
Thanks so much.

242
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,760
Well, ‘Mr. Kham Ake' also acted well.

243
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,720
I still can't say it's me for sure.

244
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,920
You'll win.

245
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,080
Anyway, I'm cheering for you.

246
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,920
Fight on!

247
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,680
- Can we take a selfie?
- Sure.

248
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,760
Thank you, I'll go now.

249
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,200
Sorry.

250
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,720
Be confident in yourself.

251
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,760
See you again.

252
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,480
What a coincidence!

253
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,040
Do you like this as well?

254
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,480
Yes.

255
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,560
Do you like it too?

256
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,040
Where did you go today?

257
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,440
Just went to work as usual.

258
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,000
And after work,
where did you go?

259
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,640
Uh...

260
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,680
Personal matter.

261
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,080
I'm sorry,
I'll have to keep it to myself.

262
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,280
Well, right?

263
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,760
But...

264
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,520
There's nothing
you're hiding, right?

265
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,720
I'm cheering for you,

266
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,680
for Best Actor.

267
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,520
I've liked you
since your first drama.

268
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,960
I've always liked you, Akin.

269
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,400
And I'll probably

270
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,040
like you forever.

271
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,720
Thank you.

272
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,880
Akin.

273
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,880
I'll follow you

274
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,880
through every moment of your life.

275
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,760
It's okay.

276
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,240
Do you think

277
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,040
we've been hanging out
together too often?

278
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,720
Well, we are...

279
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,120
We're boyfriends, right?

280
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,680
Not yet,

281
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,480
Not so fast.

282
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,080
We're practically like that now,

283
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,800
it's the same thing.

284
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,280
What are you worried about?

285
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,520
I'm not worried.

286
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,440
I'm just afraid that...

287
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,720
If anyone sees us...

288
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,800
It might look bad.

289
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,240
Why?

290
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,800
Did something happen to you, Akin,

291
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,520
that made you feel uneasy?

292
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,360
Hmm...

293
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,600
It's nothing.

294
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,000
Well then, I'll go take
a shower and sleep now.

295
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,720
Good night.

296
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,440
Goodbye.

297
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,320
Love you.

298
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,960
(A golden stag brooch)

299
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,520
You can find these
everywhere.

300
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,560
Akin.

301
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,760
If there's anything,
you can talk to me.

302
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
It's nothing, really.

303
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,200
Yesterday, I met some weird fans.

304
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,640
So it's been bothering me a bit.

305
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,400
Akin.

306
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,800
Don't think it's a small thing.

307
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,800
Do you remember the ‘sasaeng'
incident five years ago?

308
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,000
It's lucky that Ning managed to
catch them before it got worse.

309
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,000
Let's do this instead.

310
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,800
I'll ask Ning to
add security for you.

311
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,680
Thank you, Sine.

312
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,480
Hey, by the way.

313
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,440
Has Grandma sent a reply letter yet?

314
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,520
Not yet.

315
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,800
Why don't you buy her a phone?

316
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,840
She doesn't want one.

317
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,240
She says

318
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
writing a letter

319
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,440
makes her feel like
she's having a real conversation.

320
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,520
Both you and Grandma,

321
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,600
are so artistic.

322
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,080
Alright then.

323
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,080
If you miss Grandma, let me know
when you want to visit her.

324
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,240
Just tell me.

325
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,800
Akin.

326
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,360
Do you remember me?

327
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,840
I go to every event
where you're there.

328
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,440
What's my name?

329
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
What's my name?

330
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,080
Do you remember me?

331
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,440
Sorry, I don't remember.

332
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,880
Where did you go today, Akin?

333
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,240
Personal matter,
I'm sorry, I can't tell you.

334
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,760
There's nothing to hide, right?

335
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,880
Excuse me miss.

336
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,640
- Akin's hand is still as soft as ever.
- Please step back.

337
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,320
I have

338
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,400
a letter for you.

339
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
A letter?

340
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,400
You must be so happy!

341
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,840
Grandma...

342
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,320
Your grandma is really sweet.

343
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,440
(To my dear grandson, Akin)

344
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,400
What the hell is this?

345
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
Akin!

346
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,520
Go inside first.

347
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,960
I'll call the police.

348
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,800
Go, Akin!

349
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,680
Akin!

350
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,320
Akin!

351
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,120
Get inside, quick!

352
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,280
How long are you going to
keep staring at those photos?

353
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,400
Then how did those pictures get
here? What happened?

354
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,440
She came to
the front of the building.

355
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,160
We followed her,
but couldn't find her.

356
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,720
She must know all
the escape routes very well.

357
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,160
Just based on the CCTV footage,

358
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,440
we could report her
for trespassing and assault.

359
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,920
But what if she gets mad...

360
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,600
and leaks those private photos?

361
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,840
What would we do then?

362
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,560
Is it worth the risk?

363
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,240
But if we let her
go just because of that,

364
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,680
we'll be at
a disadvantage right away.

365
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,280
And she could use that
card against us anytime.

366
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,560
We have to find a way to fight back.

367
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,160
I think I might have a way…

368
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,120
But now I don't even know
where that person disappeared to.

369
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,240
And what if she tries
to pull some crazy stunt?

370
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,880
Right now…

371
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,920
The news about Akin being
stalked is already spreading online.

372
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,920
She'll probably have to
go into hiding for a while.

373
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,280
With behavior like that,
no fandom will accept her.

374
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,040
She's going to be
hunted by other fans,

375
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,160
for quite a while.

376
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,760
Then let's go ahead and
prepare for a press conference.

377
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,360
Jun…

378
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,040
Why are you here?

379
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,640
Finished your shoot already?

380
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,720
You still have the energy
to worry about someone else?

381
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,320
To me…

382
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,320
nothing is more important than you.

383
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,920
I'm sorry.

384
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
If I hadn't come up
with that stupid idea…

385
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,720
this wouldn't have happened.

386
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,760
It's okay.

387
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,760
No one wanted any of this to happen.

388
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,480
I'll fix this myself.

389
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,040
You don't have to be afraid.

390
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,520
I'll protect you.

391
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,920
Jin insists on taking a
three-day break from work.

392
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,520
As for the last-minute
cancellation of the job…

393
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,040
The client…

394
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,440
is currently calculating the damages.

395
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,520
And they also requested…

396
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,480
that we personally
apologize to them.

397
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,920
It seems lately…

398
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,240
you haven't been able to keep
your talents under control, Ford.

399
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,760
With a product this valuable…

400
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,960
if there's any damage…

401
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,360
can you really take
responsibility for it?

402
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,840
Maybe it's time someone
faced the consequences.

403
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,720
On behalf of Nitto Entertainment…

404
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,160
we would like to
protect our talent…

405
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,880
and we assure everyone…

406
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,720
that we won't allow this kind
of incident to happen again.

407
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,680
Mr. Akin—

408
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,800
May we get an interview?

409
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,040
Mr. Akin?

410
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,800
Mr. Akin, can we ask—

411
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,240
How do you feel about
everything that's happened?

412
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,200
What happened…

413
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,160
No matter who it happens to…

414
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,760
no one would ever want something
like that to happen to them.

415
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,800
Why do you think that
sasaeng acted that way?

416
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,160
And what about Jin?

417
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,800
Was he involved in any of this?

418
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,680
Is it true that the reason
behind the harassment…

419
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,800
is related to the relationship
between Akin and Jin?

420
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,840
Do you really have something
going on between you two?

421
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,680
- Is it true?
- How are things really?

422
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,320
As everyone already knows…

423
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,920
Akin and Jin…

424
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,120
are close colleagues
in the same industry.

425
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,040
But there's definitely nothing…

426
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,160
beyond that.

427
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,400
Jin and I…

428
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,240
we're really like brothers.

429
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,800
I'd like to…

430
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,400
say something to that fan.

431
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,520
At first, I was very upset
by what happened…

432
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,040
I both understood…

433
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,040
and didn't understand.

434
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,720
Thank you…

435
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,120
for admiring me.

436
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,960
Thank you…

437
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,720
for always supporting me.

438
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,640
And I…

439
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,280
will always support you too.

440
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,920
(JinAkin leak is real—
Netizens suspect a sasaeng is behind it.)

441
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,400
(Worried for them. If this hurts
their relationship, that sasaeng's done.)

442
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:10,960
(Cute, sure—
but no one deserves a privacy breach.)

443
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,000
(I will hunt you down, sasaeng.)

444
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,960
(Everyone! I found
the sasaeng's account!)

445
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,880
(Not saying we should cancel anyone...
just kindly vanish from existence.)

446
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,920
Guess life's getting a lot
harder now, huh?

447
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,800
What do you want?

448
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,120
Delete all the pictures.

449
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,880
Then go back to
living your normal life.

450
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,160
Or you can keep the pictures…

451
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,240
And live in hiding, constantly
looking over your shoulder…

452
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,280
While my lawyer and
I prepare to file charges…

453
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,040
With evidence that will convict you.

454
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,720
Charges for harassment
and invasion of privacy.

455
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,960
Then…

456
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,000
You can prepare your
money for the fine…

457
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,720
And prepare to sleep in jail.

458
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,600
Decide for yourself.

459
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,480
And the cloud.

460
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,440
Good.

461
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,480
Someone else wants
to have a word with you.

462
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,520
Can I talk for a bit?

463
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,840
Why did you do this?

464
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,800
Thank you…

465
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,720
For always coming to see me…

466
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,720
For always cheering me on…

467
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,640
But I still don't understand…

468
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,040
How you could
do something like this.

469
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,080
But I've thought it over…

470
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,920
I'm going to drop the charges.

471
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,960
All this time…

472
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,880
I've had you, Akin…

473
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,120
As the only source
of happiness in my life.

474
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,040
I followed everything you did…

475
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,640
Everything.

476
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,680
I came to every event you attended…

477
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,280
Bought every magazine
you were featured in…

478
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,960
Akin, do you know?

479
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,560
I supported you…

480
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,080
In every way I could.

481
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
I just wanted you to see me…

482
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,320
To remember me…

483
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,080
To talk to me

484
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,400
like we're doing now.

485
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,320
But now that we are talking…

486
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,680
Why do your eyes…

487
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,640
Look different from
the person I used to know?

488
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,360
Even if you can't forgive me yet…

489
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,160
You, will…

490
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,320
Will always be my light.

491
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,440
You...

492
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,920
will also be my light.

493
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,800
Good evening, distinguished
guests and viewers at home.

494
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,120
Welcome to the announcement of…

495
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,800
the most prestigious award
in the entertainment industry…

496
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,760
Golden Mask Award 2022.

497
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,360
Thank you…

498
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,360
for helping me.

499
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,960
If you're okay, then I'm okay.

500
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,440
So…

501
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,560
What's the reason

502
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,360
you asked to see me?

503
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,880
It's about “The Legend of Gemini.”

504
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,440
I want to build on
the momentum from the series…

505
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,560
And I want Channel S to
grow more in the film division.

506
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,480
So I had the idea to
make a sequel a movie.

507
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,120
And I'd like you to
reprise your lead role.

508
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,240
No problem.

509
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,440
But judging by your tone…

510
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,880
I'm guessing this isn't

511
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,400
just about
“The Legend of Gemini,” is it?

512
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,680
About the photos
the sasaeng took of you two…

513
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,680
After that day, we combed
through everything thoroughly.

514
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,000
To make sure no backups
of the files exist anywhere.

515
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,520
Still, it's possible…

516
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,720
That someone else

517
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,640
got hold of
the photos before we did.

518
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,440
Someone…

519
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,160
Whose data we can't access easily.

520
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,400
So just be careful for now, okay?

521
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,920
This is just my hunch…

522
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,440
In the meantime,
I'll prepare a contingency plan.

523
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,600
Now we're about to present the award
everyone's been waiting for...

524
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,320
The Best New Actor Award!

525
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,960
Are you nervous?

526
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,240
So much, yes!

527
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,520
All this time...

528
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,800
Thank you so much, Akin.

529
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,520
Why are you thanking me?

530
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,840
I didn't do anything.

531
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,120
I'm the one...

532
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,960
who should be thanking you.

533
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,800
You found a great lawyer for me.

534
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,280
You took care of me.

535
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,280
Handled so many things for me.

536
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,760
But all along…

537
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,760
You've always been
the one protecting me.

538
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,160
You always take all the
negative onto yourself.

539
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,320
What I did for you...

540
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,960
it's not even close to enough.

541
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,040
Hey now…

542
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,560
Protecting you…

543
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,960
That's my job as
your Sensei, isn't it?

544
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,560
I can't let

545
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,240
you have any flaws…

546
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,800
Because today…

547
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,240
Today is your day.

548
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,000
Can I have a kiss on the lips?

549
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,320
Let's go.

550
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,640
Please welcome Akin,

551
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,120
our guest presenter for this award.

552
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,600
I'm truly honored

553
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,440
to be here to present this award.

554
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,200
The award I received when I was 22.

555
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,160
So, if we round the number,

556
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,880
that was about seven years ago.

557
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
This award...

558
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,400
was basically
the beginning of it all for me.

559
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,400
My success...

560
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,560
my ambition...

561
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,440
my passion...

562
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,320
and my love.

563
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,520
I hope

564
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,440
this award...

565
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,000
will also mark a grand beginning

566
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,280
for whoever receives it tonight.

567
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,080
The Best New Actor
Award this year goes to...

568
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,160
Jin, from the drama
The Legend of Gemini!

569
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,320
(Golden Mask Award)

570
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,960
Please allow me to set
the award down for a moment.

571
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,400
I've prepared a little speech.

572
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,440
First and foremost,
I'd like to thank Sigma

573
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,880
for always giving me opportunities.

574
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,640
From just an ordinary kid
who was never in the spotlight,

575
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,440
to someone who now

576
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,960
has enough light to take on

577
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,080
the lead role in
The Legend of Gemini.

578
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,680
Thank you to Producer Jade,

579
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,080
to Director Hong Tē,

580
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,640
and to every single team
member of The Legend of Gemini,

581
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,880
for working together

582
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,880
to create this incredible series,

583
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,000
which, tonight,

584
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,520
has helped me become a star.

585
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,000
Most importantly,

586
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,800
I want to thank Akin

587
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,800
for always guiding and teaching me.

588
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,480
And I hope

589
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,720
this award

590
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,440
will be the beginning
of my hopes and dreams.

591
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,840
And now, the next award—

592
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,240
Best Actor

593
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,120
is...

594
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,240
Congratulations to
Mr. Kham Ake!

595
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,720
Here you go.

596
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,040
Watch me.

597
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,760
Next year...

598
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,760
I'm going to win that award
for sure. Just wait and see!

599
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,080
Kin, don't talk

600
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,640
while you're eating.
You might choke.

601
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Yeah, yeah. I know.

602
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,960
But the drama
Mr. Kham Ake starred in...

603
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,320
It was the channel T's
masterpiece too, right?

604
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,640
I heard the script
was really intense.

605
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,680
So it's not surprising he won.

606
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:48,880
This year...

607
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,520
I'm okay with letting
that old man have it first.

608
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,560
There's always next year.

609
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,960
It's not like I'm quitting
acting next year or anything.

610
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:08,920
But still...

611
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,640
Congratulations, Jun.

612
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,120
So now...

613
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,680
Am I your number one

614
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,240
Sexiest guy yet, Kin?

615
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,600
What did you say?

616
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,160
I didn't hear that.

617
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,160
Hmm...

618
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,000
You are.

619
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,200
Hey! Where are you going?

620
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,040
Get back here!

621
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,280
Nooo!

622
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,320
I'm really number one, right?

623
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,080
I'm really your number
one now, aren't I?

624
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,080
Yeah.

625
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,280
Help!

626
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,520
See you.
