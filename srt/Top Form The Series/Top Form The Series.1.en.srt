1
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,080
He just keeps on rising!

2
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,920
That's right,

3
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,080
Akin has been nominated
for this year's Best Actor.

4
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,680
He's also won "Sexist Man Awards"

5
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,240
for four consecutive years.

6
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,800
Now, this talented actor will star

7
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,280
in a highly anticipated crime drama,

8
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,440
"Akina".

9
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,040
Akin plays a Police Captain

10
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,920
battling dark powers,

11
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,240
corruption,

12
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,680
and betrayal in the justice system.

13
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,760
The drama features actress Tangmay

14
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,560
and fresh faced actor, Jin.

15
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,040
Who'll shine the brightest
in this showdown?

16
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,560
Jin, hon! Get up!

17
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,840
Girl, what was that?

18
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,680
People are looking.

19
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,840
Jin, quick!

20
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,000
Get in the car!

21
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,880
I'm gonna order some drinks.

22
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,080
You want something, hon?

23
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,880
Sure. Anything.

24
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,880
- Anything?
- Anything's cool.

25
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,600
Let's do an orange juice coffee
with two extra shots.

26
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,360
Your usual. Okay?

27
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,440
As for you,

28
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,480
feel free to choose!

29
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,840
Urgh, it's this Akin guy again!

30
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,800
I DO NOT like him.

31
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,760
Let's order elsewhere, hon?

32
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,600
It's giving me bad vibes.
Urgh, bleh.

33
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,320
Girl, don't be so dramatic.

34
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,440
This Akin,

35
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,560
he's everywhere, isn't he?

36
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,920
Hon, he's number one in showbiz.

37
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,160
Now let us manifest

38
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,120
good fortune and pray

39
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,680
that Runny Eggs God

40
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,320
will protect us!

41
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,240
What God?

42
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,920
Runny Eggs God.

43
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,880
She's the real deal.

44
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,080
Limited edition, too.
Only 99 of these in the world!

45
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
Correct.

46
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,040
Here.

47
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,760
Take this.

48
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,880
Jin, hon, pray with us.

49
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,680
Oh, Runny Eggs God~

50
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,520
Oh, Runny Eggs God~

51
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,040
Yolk divine-say with us!

52
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,080
Do it!

53
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,280
Oh, Runny Eggs God~

54
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,680
Oh, yolk divine,
bless us with your shine!

55
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,920
Oh, yolk divine,
bless us with your shine!

56
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,720
I, Mr. Mildy.

57
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,200
I, Mr. Mildy.

58
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,680
You gotta be kidding.
Hon, do you even know how to pray?

59
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,680
Don't say my name,
say your own name.

60
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,800
Just-just watch me.

61
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,040
I'll show you how it's done.

62
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,320
Oh, Runny Eggs God~

63
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,160
Please let today be blessed

64
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,680
with good fortune.

65
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,000
Please let our honey Jin's acting debut

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,480
slay the house boots down.

67
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,720
Let nothing and noone stand in
our honey Jin's first day on set.

68
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,120
Sathu~

69
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,680
Sure, please let me get more work.

70
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,000
Anything's cool. I'll do it.

71
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,520
A man of action!

72
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,400
Jin, honey, let's get ready to change.

73
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,160
We'll just grab some stuff,
you go on ahead.

74
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,360
See you upstairs.

75
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,160
Just grabbing some stuff.

76
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,040
Okay?

77
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,240
We'll be there soon!

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,880
Girl,

79
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,840
you think Jin can handle this job?

80
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,360
I dunno about honey Jin,

81
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,200
but I can't take it anymore!

82
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,600
His heart isn't in this,
he has zero passion!

83
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,960
If we could just
break through to him

84
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,760
and see what the kid's thinking.

85
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,920
He's the type to say "sure sis"

86
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,800
“anything sis" and "cool sis."

87
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,840
Even if we managed to
break through to him,

88
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,880
nothing would change.

89
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,080
Jin's heart is

90
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,760
like totally empty.

91
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,160
But if we give up on him now,

92
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,080
we'd be wasting his talents
and good looks.

93
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,680
Oh, Runny Eggs God~

94
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,240
If it's not too much to ask,

95
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,840
please let the emptiness

96
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,000
inside Jin's heart be filled!

97
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,280
Sathu~

98
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,040
- Oh, P' Jo.
- Mildy. Hi there.

99
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,760
Jin, hon, come over here!

100
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,560
Jin, this is director Jo.

101
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,640
- Hello.
- Jo, this is Jin.

102
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,520
You're more handsome in person
than in pictures.

103
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,920
Mildy's got sharp eyes.

104
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,520
Alrighty, rest for now.
I gotta get to work.

105
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,880
- Okay.
- Thank you.

106
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,440
- Nice to meet you!
- Thank you.

107
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,400
Remember Jo's the director.

108
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,760
Be considerate of him.

109
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,480
If he asks you
to do anything, just do it.

110
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,280
He's very well-known
in the industry.

111
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,280
Are you ready?

112
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,840
Sure!

113
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,040
You can do it, right?

114
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
You ready?

115
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,320
You can do it, right?
Keep telling yourself that.

116
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,480
There's some time
before the shoot.

117
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,840
Do you want a break or get changed?

118
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,400
Oh, um...

119
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,440
I'll go get changed.

120
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,400
Was that the newbie?

121
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,040
That's right.

122
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,880
This should be good.

123
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,800
I haven't worked
with a newbie for a while.

124
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,280
Is that the newbie?

125
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,080
He's quite the looker.

126
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,560
(Newbie: 7/10)
He's a seven, at most.

127
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,080
Seven out of ten is solid.

128
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,160
Action!

129
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,760
So, James, feeling nervous
for your first day on the job?

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Cut!

131
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,600
Let's do another take. Reset!

132
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,200
Jin, remember your mark.

133
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,240
Walk to it.

134
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,600
Okay.

135
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,080
(Newbie: 6/10)

136
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,120
Clear the set and
move out of the way.

137
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,960
We're starting.

138
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,880
Come on, clear the set!

139
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,000
Take two.

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,480
Ready? Action!

141
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,680
So, James, feeling nervous
for your first day on the job?

142
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,840
Cut!

143
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,800
Let's do another take.

144
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,320
Jin, your mark.

145
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
Reset! Let's go!

146
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,880
Reset!

147
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,600
Action!

148
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,000
(Newbie: 5/10)

149
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,600
So, James, feeling nervous
for your first day on the job?

150
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,480
So nervous.

151
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,600
(Wooden Boy: 4/10)

152
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,160
(Woah, he acts as stiff as wood.)

153
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,480
That's your desk.

154
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,920
You're in luck, you get to be
so close to Captain Ken.

155
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,320
Do you like him?

156
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,160
Yeah.

157
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,240
"Captain Ken is my idol."

158
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,680
Captain Ken is my idol.

159
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,160
"No matter how-"

160
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,920
No matter how tough the case is,

161
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,640
"...he can solve it all."

162
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,000
he can solve it all.

163
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,600
- He's really-
- "talented"

164
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,160
- and so-
- "handsome too!"

165
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,640
"I wish"

166
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,160
"I could be talented like
Captain Ken."

167
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,520
What kind of person
is the Captain?

168
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,600
I'd like to get to know him more.

169
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,480
(Did he just improvise?)

170
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,560
Cut! Next!

171
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,240
P' Jo, I changed the script.
Is that okay?

172
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,520
It's perfect, I love it!

173
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,760
For the next scene,

174
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,920
move with more confidence

175
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,920
since you're actually the mole...

176
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,320
(Wooden Boy: 5/10)

177
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,920
So in the next scene, Akin
catches Jin as the mole.

178
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,080
Everyone, let's move outdoors.

179
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,200
Cut! Mei, get the actors to change.

180
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,800
Mr. Aof is here.

181
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,800
Move it! It's getting warm!

182
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,800
Akin, great job!
You can change costumes, now.

183
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,160
Tell the crew to get ready.

184
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,400
Hello, Mr. Aof.

185
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,440
Akin.

186
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,560
Hello.

187
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,520
Oh, hello.

188
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,880
Do you know him?

189
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,520
I do,

190
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,920
but I wish I didn't.

191
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,440
He's pretty well-known, this one.

192
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,280
Yeah?

193
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,560
Mr. Aof is the owner of XOXO Juice.

194
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,720
You're shooting a tie-in ad
for his brand.

195
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,520
Every drama XOXO Juice is in
becomes a hit.

196
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,280
Mr. Aof is loaded.

197
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,120
He's picky and very much icky.
So do you best, Jin!

198
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,960
Time?

199
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,320
Almost 5 o'clock.

200
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,560
Get the product.

201
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,000
Follow me up the bridge.

202
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,680
P' Jo, sunlight is fading!

203
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,040
Ready the set.

204
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,920
Client's coming!

205
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,880
Everyone, we're changing the set!

206
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,920
Up the bridge, now!

207
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,520
(XOXO Juice)

208
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,960
Action!

209
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,920
James, I know
what you're planning to do.

210
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,840
What do you mean by that?

211
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,280
How could you do this to us?

212
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,240
It's not working.

213
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,080
Cut, cut.

214
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,200
What's the problem?

215
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
The product label's facing away
from the camera.

216
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Go adjust it.

217
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,200
Hurry up, Art Team!

218
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,520
Make it face the right way.

219
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,280
Can you

220
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,920
block the sun to
create shadows?

221
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,360
Quick.

222
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,280
Okay, okay.

223
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,880
Hold it.

224
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,120
Still not working.

225
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,880
The right one looks better.

226
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,520
The color stands out
and matches the lighting.

227
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,400
Okay, we can
go with the left one.

228
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,440
I don't want the product
to stand out too much.

229
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,920
The left?

230
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,160
- The left.
- The left on the screen?

231
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,480
- The left.
- Ah, okay.

232
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,600
Take out the green one.

233
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
Clear the set.

234
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,560
Hurry.

235
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,240
- Ready?
- Let's go!

236
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,440
Action!

237
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,800
I trusted you.
Captain Ken trusted you.

238
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,560
How could you do this to us?

239
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,280
I still believe
you're not a bad person.

240
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,960
This is not it.

241
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,480
Yes?

242
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,640
The right one was better.

243
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,000
You were correct.

244
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,880
The right one.

245
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,760
What?

246
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,640
Cut.

247
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
The one before.
We're using the blue one.

248
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,520
How do you want it?

249
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,600
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Like this?

250
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,880
Yeah. We good?

251
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
- Okay. Ready?
- Yes.

252
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,320
Clear the set.

253
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,800
Ready?

254
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,240
Light's fading.

255
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
Okay, let's go.

256
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,920
Action!

257
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,680
The logo is tilted.

258
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,040
Do it again!

259
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,680
But there's nothing we can do!

260
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,480
Just go.

261
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,080
P' Jo, the light!

262
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,040
I know, but just go

263
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,080
and fix the product.

264
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,520
Action!

265
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,200
You can always start over,

266
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,600
like drinking this juice box, and...

267
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,760
It's a no from me.

268
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,600
Cut! Stop for now.

269
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,760
You can always start over...

270
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,600
I'm not feeling it.

271
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Come on.

272
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,800
Light's running out.

273
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,120
Let's focus, hmm?

274
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,920
Like drinking this juice box...

275
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,600
The logo is titled AGAIN.

276
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,480
Cut.

277
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,040
Action!

278
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,240
You can always start over...

279
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,400
No.

280
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,080
You can always start over...

281
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,000
Nah.

282
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,760
You can always start over...
You can always start over...

283
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,000
Like drinking this juice box,

284
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,840
and begin fresh every time.

285
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,480
The tears aren't coming.
He can't act.

286
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,760
Cut! Stop for now.

287
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
Oh my gosh.

288
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,520
What do we do?

289
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,480
- Let's practice.
- The light, the light!

290
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,520
I'll handle this.
Please wait.

291
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,640
Practice.

292
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,200
- Practice?
- Yeah.

293
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,800
Let's have a go.

294
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,240
Okay and action!

295
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,680
You can always start over,

296
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,600
like drinking this juice box,

297
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,720
and begin fresh every time.

298
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,080
I want another take.

299
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
Okay. Cut!

300
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,080
What now?

301
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,600
Let me talk to him.

302
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,640
Mr. Aof?

303
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,360
It's the delivery of the lines.

304
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,480
I want more authentic emotions.

305
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,480
And the actor,

306
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,520
when he's crying,

307
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,720
I want his tears
falling onto my product.

308
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,560
Tears falling onto..

309
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,000
Can it be done?

310
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,760
I'll give it a try.

311
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,840
Okay.

312
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,080
The actor, he's not..

313
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,080
Just come here.

314
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,960
I'll take care of it.

315
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,600
Never mind then.

316
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,880
Hey, you.

317
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,160
What's your name?

318
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,840
Jin.

319
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,280
Right, Jin.

320
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,560
Look at me.

321
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,400
Breathe...

322
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,280
Slowly.

323
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,720
Here...

324
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,880
you're not breathing properly.

325
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,560
Breathe...

326
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,600
Slowly.

327
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,320
He's ready.

328
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,080
Action!

329
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,120
You can always start over,

330
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,720
like drinking this juice box,

331
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,120
and begin fresh every time.

332
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,120
Beautiful.

333
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,960
Cut. It's a wrap.

334
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,600
Good job, everyone.

335
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,800
Sine, could you order a large dinner
for the crew?

336
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,520
Throw in some cakes

337
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,520
and desserts, just order everything.

338
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,000
It's been a long day.
With a client like that,

339
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,320
everyone's got to be exhausted.

340
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah,

341
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,440
the delay is because of
that Mr. Aof again.

342
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,800
And that awful briefing...

343
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,760
The script was supposed
to be gut-wrenching,

344
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,120
but those silly slogans ruined it.

345
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,400
Good thing I kept my cool today,

346
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,040
but next time I might really lose it.

347
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,160
I swear I'll traumatize him for life

348
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,840
he wouldn't dare show his face again!

349
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,680
Is Mr. Aof trying to get back at me?

350
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,960
Today sucked, Sine.

351
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,720
I had to meet that Mr. Aof
and that..

352
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,800
that newbie too.

353
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,840
I don't know,

354
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,640
I got so worked up
just looking at him.

355
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,240
It's so rare meeting

356
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,440
someone who bothers me like that.

357
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,160
Fine.

358
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,280
I know, I know.

359
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,560
Do you like chocolate?

360
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,960
Yeah, sure do.

361
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,440
Hey...

362
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,840
When did you get here?

363
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,400
Just now.

364
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,960
When exactly was

365
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,480
"just now"?

366
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,040
Well, just now.
I was here just now.

367
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,360
Was it like 5 minutes ago?

368
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,920
Like a second ago.

369
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,240
Okay.

370
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Did you hear anything I said?

371
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,080
I didn't hear anything.

372
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,480
I wanted to thank you

373
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,680
for helping me out earlier.

374
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,440
I was a clueless mess.

375
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,920
I appreciate you
being patient with me.

376
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,400
And...

377
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,200
One day,

378
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,720
I hope to be as skilled as you are.

379
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,320
Is that all?

380
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,400
If there's nothing else,
then I'll get going.

381
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
Hey, you.

382
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,200
I got you a new one.

383
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,320
Thank you.

384
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,240
Bye.

385
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,000
After the camera started rolling on "Akina",

386
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,560
the buzz on set was electric—

387
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,960
This drama is bound for massive ratings!

388
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,960
Why? Because a new star is born,

389
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,160
with his killer performance

390
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,240
and a promising career on the horizon.

391
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,040
That's right, we're talking about Jin!

392
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,880
Hello. Thank you for being punctual.

393
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,800
Hello.

394
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,320
This place is huge!

395
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,160
Jin, hon, come.

396
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,520
Touch, take this.

397
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,360
What now, girl?

398
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,200
I'm putting on makeup.

399
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,560
- More?
- Duh, I'm meeting people.

400
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,680
Bring the documents over.

401
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,120
Hurry up, Mr. Jade's here.

402
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,120
Have some makeup,
your face looks pale.

403
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,680
Please come in.

404
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,880
Mr. Jade likes
punctual people.

405
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,640
You say that a lot.

406
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,960
Everyone knows Mr. Jade as the
"Star-maker Producer of Channel S".

407
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,280
Check out his trophies.

408
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,440
Where's the lie?

409
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,160
This is the person
who made Akin

410
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,320
into one of Asia's best actors.

411
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

412
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,760
Hello.

413
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,880
I heard Director Jo
was quite impressed with Jin.

414
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,040
It's rare to see him
acknowledge anyone.

415
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,240
We'd like to thank you
on Jin's behalf.

416
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,720
It's Jin's first project,
and he's already crushing it.

417
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,280
He sure has a bright future in showbiz.

418
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,080
Mr. Jade, you really have
an eye for talent!

419
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,320
To be honest,

420
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,440
I wasn't very good on set,

421
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,440
but because Akin helped me,

422
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,360
I understood the script and
the character better.

423
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,520
Akin is a great actor.

424
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,680
A rare talent.
Other actors are out of his league.

425
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,840
Someone like Akin
doesn't come around often.

426
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,640
Many newbies
aren't very responsible

427
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,200
or exceptional enough

428
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,800
to stand out

429
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,600
like the industry's veterans.

430
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,520
But when I heard Jo
say there's a talented newbie.

431
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,480
I had to meet him and see

432
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,280
if he could measure up to Akin.

433
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,480
I'm out of Akin's league.

434
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,400
I have a lot to learn from him.

435
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,080
Good,

436
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,160
you do that: learn from Akin.

437
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,640
He may seem cold on the outside,

438
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,680
but really, Akin just cares deeply
about his work.

439
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,680
He's also very considerate of
everyone in the team.

440
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,800
Actors need to work together

441
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,160
and help each other.

442
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,480
But don't forget,

443
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,960
at the end of the day,
you're rivals.

444
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,680
The lead role and the Best Actor Awards

445
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,280
goes to one actor only.

446
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,160
Akin's been at the top for nearly 10 years.

447
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,480
I say it's time for

448
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,480
someone to step up
and challenge him.

449
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,680
And you, Jin?
Now you have to decide

450
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,680
whether you rise up

451
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,600
and claim his spot,

452
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,200
or let him keep outshining you

453
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,440
and watch yourself
fade into nothing.

454
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,480
Do forgive me,

455
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,200
I may sound harsh,

456
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,960
but that's show business.

457
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,520
Is there any way

458
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,160
for me to stand beside Akin?

459
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,760
Receiving praise
from a well-known director

460
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,600
is a solid first step.

461
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,360
Then, you have
to make your own way into

462
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,880
the hearts of the audience
across the country.

463
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,440
Remember,

464
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,520
a true professional actor

465
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,880
always knows what
the audience wants.

466
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,480
That's how they win
them over.

467
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,520
Thank you.

468
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,040
Meeting you

469
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,000
is something I'll never forget.

470
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,480
I never knew.

471
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,440
After that day....

472
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,360
We'll never meet again.

473
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,840
If I get another chance,

474
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,760
I want to give it my all,

475
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,320
put in the work,

476
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,840
and make sure that

477
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,360
I'll never disappoint

478
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,280
you ever again.

479
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,880
Akin and Sine,
right this way.

480
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,720
Thanks.

481
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,200
Hello, Sensei.

482
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,120
What did you just say?

483
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,920
"Sensei"?

484
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,800
When did I become your "Sensei"?

485
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,680
Sorry for being rude, Sensei.

486
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,360
Just.. stop calling me "Sensei."

487
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,320
Alright, Sensei.

488
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,120
I'll try my best today.

489
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,520
I hope

490
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,640
you recognize my efforts.

491
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,920
See you!

492
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,320
Has the wooden boy lost his mind?

493
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,320
(First time acting beside Akin.)

494
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,160
(Gotta focus.)

495
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,720
Jin and Akin, are you ready?

496
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,400
(It's now or never.)

497
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,440
Okay,

498
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,040
and... action!

499
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,640
(Just give it your all.)

500
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,600
So it's you...

501
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,960
the new cop
everyone's been talking about.

502
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,280
Didn't you just join?

503
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,480
Why are you quitting already?

504
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,200
People are saying

505
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,720
that you're so good that

506
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,880
you could replace me.

507
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
You must be proud, huh?

508
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,880
No!

509
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,360
I have no desire

510
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,160
to replace you, Sir!

511
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,520
I know where I stand.

512
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,960
Where is your focus?

513
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,560
Cut! Next!

514
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,600
(Wooden Boy: 1/10)

515
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,960
You sure we got it?

516
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,560
Jin messed up a lot of lines.

517
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,280
We'll deal with it in post.

518
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,800
Change of set.

519
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,320
Moving on to the next scene.

520
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,680
Why would someone like you quit

521
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,440
over something this insignificant?

522
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,520
Someone like me isn't cut out

523
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,280
to be the kind of cop

524
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,600
you're looking for.

525
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,440
Others

526
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,720
see so much potential in you,

527
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,000
to the point they believe

528
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,360
you could even take my place.

529
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,960
But you...

530
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,400
just gonna keep putting
yourself down?

531
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,520
I don't know

532
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,240
what you've been through,

533
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,720
but I want you

534
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,000
to come back and work with us.

535
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,200
If you're the real deal,

536
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,400
you've got to prove yourself

537
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,960
as a cop.

538
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,320
I thought

539
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,760
you hated me, Captain.

540
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,360
If I'm not here,

541
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,240
you'd probably feel more at ease,

542
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,360
wouldn't you?

543
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,520
If I really hated you,

544
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,000
I wouldn't have asked you
to come back.

545
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,640
You've really made me

546
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,360
want to know you even better.

547
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,800
Cat..tain.. there's still so much-

548
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,880
Captain, there's still so much
I need to learn from you.

549
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,840
Are you...

550
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,960
even serious about acting?

551
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,040
Cut!

552
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,840
Jo,

553
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,200
look at this guy.

554
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,600
He's just messing around.

555
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,800
So this is the one

556
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,400
who wanted to get to know me?

557
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,120
Let's take a break.
We'll come back to this.

558
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,160
Is that okay?

559
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,400
Also... Jin, listen.

560
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,320
I know you're still new to this,

561
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,880
but don't let Akin carry all the acting.

562
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,440
Acting isn't just

563
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,040
reciting your lines,
it's about...

564
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,240
delivering emotions.

565
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,240
Okay?
One more time.

566
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,640
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah, it's fine.

567
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
Start over.

568
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,560
Stop stressing out.

569
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,400
That last take was good, yeah?

570
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,280
We're behind schedule
because of me.

571
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,160
How about this.

572
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,800
I'll just go grab my bag.

573
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,560
You go wait for me
in the van, okay?

574
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,760
Just getting my bag,
be right back.

575
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,520
- Can you be by yourself?
- Sure can.

576
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,240
Hop in there so those
vampire bugs can't bite you.

577
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,360
Hurry back.

578
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,040
Pretty spacious in here, huh?

579
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,160
Plenty of seats, too.

580
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,040
Do...

581
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,600
Do you dislike me that much?

582
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,760
I didn't say that.

583
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,760
Sit wherever.

584
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,240
I just...

585
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,680
wanted to apologize about...

586
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,080
"If I really hated you,"

587
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,600
"I wouldn't have asked you
to come back."

588
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Don't just recite lines.

589
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,040
Be truthful with your emotions.

590
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,640
If you want to get to know me,

591
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,560
prove it.

592
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,880
But if you don't,

593
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,640
keep quiet.

594
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,480
"You know, Captain...
you're kinder than you seem."

595
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,760
"What exactly"

596
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,080
"makes you think I'm kind?"

597
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,880
"If you didn't like me,"

598
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,400
"or weren't interested in me,"

599
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,440
"what you said back then,"

600
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,680
"would've just been
good advice from a senior."

601
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,480
"I must be out of my mind,"

602
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,680
"giving advice to someone"

603
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,720
"trying to take over my place."

604
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,720
"It'll probably be a while"

605
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,600
"before I catch up to you, Captain."

606
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,480
"Until that day comes,"

607
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,920
"please continue
to give me good advice."

608
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,640
That's how it should be.

609
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,440
Be truthful with your emotions.

610
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,680
Suits you.

611
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,640
Why force your acting into a box.

612
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,440
It's not you.

613
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,240
Seeing my acting now,

614
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,480
is it clear that I want to
get to know you better?

615
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,200
Stop!

616
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,720
You've caught me, Captain.

617
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,280
Since when?

618
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,320
Why don't you ask yourself?

619
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,880
Ask myself?

620
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,720
What's the matter?

621
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,720
You really don't know?

622
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,000
Since the day

623
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,200
I allowed you to get to know me.

624
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,280
The more an actor

625
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,480
knows themselves,
the bigger the advantage;

626
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,640
their strengths
and weaknesses;

627
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,640
where they want to go;

628
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,480
what they need;

629
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,920
and how their body responds.

630
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,960
You might not know what
you want from yourself,

631
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,040
but do you know what
you want from me?

632
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,400
I'm not the only one

633
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,560
getting to know you, am I, Captain?

634
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,280
And you? Do you want
something from me?

635
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,320
I want your instincts.

636
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,080
Why is his heartbeat so loud?

637
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,880
Akin's breath

638
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,680
is uneven.

639
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,680
That's everything.

640
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,120
I'll take this one too.

641
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,000
Thank you.
