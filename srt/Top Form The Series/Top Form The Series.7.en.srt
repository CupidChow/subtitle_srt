00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,520
If I hadn't come back today.

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,480
Would you have gone back with him?

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,880
When the day I win the award comes,

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,720
let's be together, okay?

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,280
Even though we had already
promised each other.

10
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,440
You went back and let him do that.

11
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,880
I don't know why I can't do it.

12
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,960
I also don't know

13
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,880
if I like you.

14
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,160
You might be a beginner.

15
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,160
You still can't
separate the character's

16
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,200
feelings from reality.

17
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,440
I like you, Kin.

18
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,360
No matter what
anyone says about you,

19
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,800
I'll never hate you.

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,800
Please, I beg thee—don't.

22
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,400
Please,

23
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,800
trust me, just this once. I...

24
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,720
I mean no harm to
thee or thy kin.

25
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,200
I'm Gopo.

26
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,880
But I swear

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,640
I will make things right, Monté the indomitable.

28
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,480
Monté the Indomitable, huh?

29
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,200
So long as I draw breath...

30
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,960
Thou hast disappointed
me deeply, Gopo.

31
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,120
Thou knowest

32
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,640
I had no wish to see her again.

33
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,080
I only did it so
thou might understand.

34
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,760
Anger

35
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,120
cannot be undone by more anger.

36
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,960
Revenge

37
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,760
solves nothing, it only deepens the wound.

38
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,320
If thou holdest on to this...

39
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,240
thou shalt carry the
weight of hatred forever.

40
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,520
Were thou in my place,

41
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,120
thou would not say this.

42
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,120
Merced, wedded to another man

43
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,640
just months

44
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,600
after my death.

45
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,480
Is this the one who claimed to love me?

46
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,080
Is this the soul
I'm meant to forgive?

47
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,040
I know,

48
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,120
I know the pain thou bearest is great.

49
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,200
But I believe this

50
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,080
that Merced herself...

51
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,600
suffereth just as thou dost.

52
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,560
She loveth thee still.

53
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,080
No matter whom she hath married,

54
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,280
for whatever cause,

55
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,720
Merced...

56
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,520
waiteth for thee still.

57
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,280
Let go thy rage, thy bitterness.

58
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,600
Please,

59
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,600
forgive me.

60
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,880
Whoo!

61
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,800
In two days, there's
a big rehearsal again.

62
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Get plenty of rest, okay?

63
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,400
Avoid alcohol for now,
just take it easy.

64
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,360
I know, I know.

65
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,200
I'm not that reckless, huh?

66
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,400
Honestly, Johnny.

67
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,560
You've been looking unusually serious lately.

68
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,280
What happened to you this time?

69
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,040
I've been serious
like this for a long time.

70
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,200
Johnny,

71
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,080
do you want to grab a drink?

72
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,720
Wow, it's been
a while since we last met.

73
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,000
Superstar, Johnny,

74
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,560
I thought I wouldn't
get to see you again.

75
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,080
You're exaggerating.

76
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm not that famous yet.

77
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,160
So, do you want the usual today?

78
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,960
Let's go with two of
‘The Johnny'.

79
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,280
Please make it
a special one for him.

80
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,120
My cocktail recipe, you know,

81
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,720
it's especially strong.

82
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,680
Do you think you can handle it?

83
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,440
What mood is this that you're
asking me out for drinks?

84
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,400
Did you sleep with him yet?

85
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,120
Ah.

86
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,920
Starting with
something serious, huh?

87
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,360
I don't know,
I can't really remember.

88
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,560
So,

89
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,880
what do you think, Jin?

90
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,800
Not yet, huh?

91
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,160
Why do you think that?

92
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,080
Well, he's mine.

93
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,960
Why wouldn't I know?

94
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,960
Yeah, I won't go for it.

95
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,320
His voices sound
so harsh like a dog.

96
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,120
Do you have an owner now?

97
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,720
Whatever.

98
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
Who cares?

99
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,280
Jun.

100
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,120
Jun.

101
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
Jun.

102
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,920
I couldn't

103
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,080
go for someone who is mumbling

104
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
someone else's name.

105
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,640
I'm not that shameless.

106
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,000
But if I just leave
without doing anything,

107
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,800
isn't that a waste?

108
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,000
So I just made
a little scene, pretending.

109
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,320
I can't tell if he's just naive
… or plain stupid.

110
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,920
He believes everything.

111
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,720
Seriously though,

112
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,440
if I really did sleep with him...

113
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,200
He wouldn't have run off
from my room like that.

114
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,440
And after that, what happened?

115
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,480
Did you guys have a big fight?

116
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,040
But still, be careful.

117
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,520
Because the agency

118
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,520
seems like they're
trying to push you.

119
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,600
If they find out

120
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,200
you're with someone
outside the agency...

121
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
I think you'd be done for.

122
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,600
But whatever.

123
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,480
Anyway, it's between you two.

124
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,520
But if you break up one day...

125
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,960
Let me know.

126
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,520
I'm always ready to step in.

127
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,840
He's totally my type.

128
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,040
I heard

129
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,520
you're selling
your body to get the part,

130
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,000
is that true?

131
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,680
You did your homework well.

132
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,920
So what?

133
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,640
Are you trying to
blackmail me with this?

134
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,640
With that face of yours...

135
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,080
You look scared yourself.

136
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,600
I'm curious,

137
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,880
how did someone with your
pathetic excuse for acting skills

138
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,080
get the main role?

139
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,640
Ha.

140
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,440
Do you think this will hurt me?

141
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,040
I'll tell you something...

142
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,040
Every role I've played,

143
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,440
I've sold myself,

144
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,320
I traded my body for the roles

145
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,720
with all the producers.

146
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,560
Are you really going to expose me?

147
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,080
By the way...

148
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,560
All those rich women
are pretty high up.

149
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,360
It would be pretty
tough to expose me.

150
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,800
Getting Master Akin drunk and

151
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,200
taking him to a room is even easier.

152
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,280
You're lucky...

153
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,440
That you got to play the lead role
in the drama that Akin is in.

154
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,960
But if you have
another chance at this...

155
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,680
I won't let you go next time.

156
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,120
But I do thank you...

157
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,760
For taking the time to talk to me.

158
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,640
But I want to tell you something...

159
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,520
That little bit of alcohol?

160
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,160
You won't be able to drug me.

161
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,840
Good for you, I guess.

162
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,160
Hey, you.

163
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,440
I brought it back for you.

164
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,000
Do you want a candy?

165
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,840
Since that day...

166
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,240
You've

167
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,040
become my little dog.

168
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,840
What does this mean?

169
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,600
Here, take it back.

170
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,680
Sorry.

171
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,520
I'm probably not right for it.

172
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,560
Did you call me here

173
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,440
for this?

174
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,760
Are you asking me
to tell you that...

175
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,080
I miss you.

176
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,320
That I want to hug you?

177
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,960
I was just asking.

178
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,080
Is this why you wanted to meet?

179
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,720
Just to return something?

180
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,520
Yes.

181
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,480
Are you sure?

182
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,400
Sorry.

183
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,680
I'm the one who
should be apologizing.

184
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,200
I should be the one apologizing.

185
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,840
I'm sorry for making you sad.

186
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,560
I'm sorry for leaving you that day.

187
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,400
I'm sorry.

188
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,920
You're not wrong.

189
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,440
Akin, listen to me.

190
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,720
Akin, listen to me.

191
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,720
Listen to me.

192
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,200
I love you.

193
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,560
I'll never

194
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,200
let anyone take you away from me.

195
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,160
That's why...

196
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,520
I had to break up with you.

197
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,480
Do you understand?

198
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,720
Listen to me first, Kin.

199
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,160
Calm down and listen to me first.

200
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,120
You didn't sleep with Johnny.

201
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,880
Look at this.

202
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,760
(I won't go for
someone who is mumbling)

203
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,800
(someone else's name.)

204
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,760
(I'm not that shameless.)

205
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,320
(But if I just go back
without doing anything,)

206
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,840
(isn't that a waste?)

207
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,200
(So I just)

208
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,320
(made a little scene, pretending.)

209
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,880
You didn't do anything wrong.

210
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,520
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

211
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,320
You don't have to
apologize for anything.

212
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,480
Come here.

213
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,360
You didn't do anything wrong.

214
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,440
You don't have to apologize.
You didn't make a mistake.

215
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,760
(Let me tell you something.)

216
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,960
(Every role I've played,)

217
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,280
(I've sold myself for the part.)

218
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,760
(I traded my body for the roles
with all the producers.)

219
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,200
Jun is really evil.

220
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,280
He came to mess
with you first, right?

221
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,800
How could I just let
him get away?

222
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,400
I love you, Jun.

223
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,360
I never thought

224
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,760
I could love someone this much.

225
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,520
Here.

226
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,400
Next time, don't take it off.

227
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,520
Come here.

228
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,440
Where to?

229
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,080
Come here.

230
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,480
I'll remove this mark for you.

231
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,560
Wait a second.

232
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,280
Why are you making the mark darker?

233
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,600
But if it's right where...

234
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,320
you can't see it?

235
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,320
What?

236
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,360

Jun. Jun.

248
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,080
Are you sleeping?

249
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,560
Hey.

250
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,480
How about moving in together?

251
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,000
What you said earlier,

252
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,360
is it true?

253
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,720
Hey, Wooden Boy!

254
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,920
Hey!

255
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,800
Are you pretending to be asleep?

256
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,440
Don't come closer!

257
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,560
- Get out.
- Where are you going?

258
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,040
Hey!

259
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,160
Go ahead.

260
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,240
Come live with me.

261
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,320
No, I don't want to anymore.

262
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,440
Get out.

263
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,880
It's too late now.

264
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,120
I'll find a room for you.

265
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,800
What kind of room do you like?

266
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,720
Kin.

267
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,400
Kin.

268
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,320
I can go live with you.

269
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,200
Really?

270
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,040
Yeah.

271
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,160
You haven't forgotten
the promise, right?

272
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,560
You just wait for the announcement.

273
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,480
I'll get both the award

274
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,120
and you as my boyfriend.

275
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,480
Then we'll live together.

276
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,880
Just thinking about it
makes me happy.

277
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,040
You better wait
until it happens first.

278
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,720
Then can I put down
a deposit for now?

279
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,680
So I can be sure
that you won't back out.

280
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,760
And you won't
run away from me again.

281
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,760
What else?

282
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,040
Can you tell me you love me again?

283
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,640
Hmmm.

284
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,240
Give me a thousand first.

285
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,520
What bag is it in.

286
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,520
Here it is, a thousand.

287
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,520
Don't joke around.

288
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,440
Come here.

289
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,480
What are you going to do?

290
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,760
Go out.

291
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,720
Play with me then.

292
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,840
It hurts.

293
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,600
Help!

294
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,000
Mom,

295
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,920
Akin sent a letter to you.

296
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,440
Thank you, dear.

297
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,440
(To Grandma Maria,
the most wonderful in the world)

298
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,680
To Grandma Maria,

299
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,160
me at the age of 29,

300
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,080
I have just realized that

301
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,480
when we feel so much for someone,

302
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:31,015
it makes our life so complicated.

303
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,680
Oh, little one.

304
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,400
It's not like when I act in a drama.

305
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,720
It's uncontrollable,

306
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,120
and confusing.

307
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,440
It feels like I am not
the same Akin anymore.

308
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,280
But even so,

309
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,520
I don't want to run away.

310
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,120
I still want him by my side,

311
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,640
and always hold me tight.

312
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,640
Are you hungry?

313
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,480
Not hungry.

314
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,200
Are you hungry?

315
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,440
What do you want to eat?

316
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,000
Because since I met him,

317
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,720
it made me realize that

318
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,160
my happiness

319
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,920
isn't just about acting.

320
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,080
Jin is both the one who matters
most to me and my rival.

321
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,920
What's that?

322
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,800
But when work is over.

323
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,760
- Are you too drunk?
- Jin takes care of me in everything.

324
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,560
I think I've met the one,

325
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,040
that you always
told me about.

326
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,560
I don't know what the future holds,

327
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,960
how long this happiness will last,

328
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,880
I want to freeze
this moment forever.

329
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,760
Do you think forever

330
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,400
is possible?

331
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,560
Akin.

332
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,800
Your dearly beloved and
forever missed grandson.

333
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,600
I'll take Jin to see you very soon.

334
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,440
Thank you all very much today.

335
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,360
Everyone did so well.

336
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,240
Thank you very much.

337
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,680
Bring me the strap.

338
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,640
This is the punishment for the person
who made the most mistakes.

339
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,680
Me?

340
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,520
Yes.

341
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,120
Head over and sell merch
right in front of the stage.

342
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,040
What do I have to sell?

343
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,840
Sell everything.

344
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,200
I just warned you a moment ago

345
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,360
not to drink anymore

346
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,960
and to hurry back home soon.

347
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,920
I didn't go drink though.

348
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,240
I'm New Johnny now.

349
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,400
I just got stressed about my lines
and didn't sleep much.

350
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,240
Even though you made
the most mistakes today.

351
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,040
Overall,

352
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,600
you've been much more focused.

353
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,880
Alright, everyone.
You can all take a break now.

354
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
Well done,

355
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,320
Monté.

356
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,800
You played really
well today, Johnny.

357
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,440
Especially the scene where
Gopo stabs the knife into his heart.

358
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,760
I was so into it, I felt like
stabbing you too.

359
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,200
Thanks, but you don't have to
congratulate me that much.

360
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,240
Well done.

361
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,960
It's my pleasure.

362
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,000
Oh, okay, okay.

363
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,800
Uh, I think we should all
go change our clothes first.

364
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,080
Then we can go eat something.

365
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,360
Jin, do you want to come with us?

366
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,840
If you want to, it's fine.

367
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,560
I'd be happy to.

368
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,560
I'll also get to
keep an eye on Akin.

369
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,000
Hey, how can you go?

370
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,400
He's not even
part of the theater crew.

371
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,520
So do I need permission
from you, Johnny?

372
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,360
Not really.

373
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,440
No.

374
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,880
So, should we go now?

375
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,960
Let's go.

376
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,640
Oh, but Johnny has
to sell everything first.

377
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,600
Hurry up.

378
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,040
Hey, Kin, wait for me!

379
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,280
Hurry back once you're done selling.

380
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,120
Let me help you.

381
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,760
You?

382
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,640
Why are you following me in here?

383
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,480
Come here, I'll help you.

384
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
I just wanted to see you for myself.

385
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,920
What you did just now.

386
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,080
It was amazing.

387
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,280
I...

388
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,320
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

389
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,080
When you were on stage.

390
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,080
At that moment,

391
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,640
I wanted to keep looking
at you like that forever.

392
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,360
About that...

393
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,880
I know already.

394
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,960
Ouch!

395
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,960
What's wrong with you?

396
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,160
Hey!

397
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,320
Enough already.

398
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,240
Where did you come from,
starving like this?

399
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,280
I'll be working out of town
for several days soon.

400
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,520
Can't I keep something for myself?

401
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Three days.

402
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,400
You're acting like
you're going for a month.

403
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,280
It's just three
hours without you, Kin.

404
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,440
It already feels like a month to me.

405
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,320
Really?

406
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,240
What are you doing?

407
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,680
Nothing.

408
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,960
I want a souvenir.

409
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,400
Wait for me.

410
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
What are you doing?

411
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
You idiot!

412
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,200
What's wrong with you?

413
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,400
Running after me

414
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,720
like a crazy person.
What do you want?

415
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,960
What?

416
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,080
Hmm.

417
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,760
You wanna buy it?

418
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,360
Why didn't you just say that
from the start? Here, take it.

419
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,440
Yeah.

420
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,360
Next time, just say it nicely.

421
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,680
Don't run after me
like a crazy person.

422
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,280
Sorry.

423
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,360
Hmm, it's okay.

424
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,360
Wait a minute.

425
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,960
What now?

426
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,440
Can I take a photo, please?

427
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,760
Sure, sure.

428
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,400
Hmm.

429
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,400
Come closer to me, please.

430
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,840
A little more.

431
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,000
You're too close now.

432
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,240
Smile.

433
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,040
Smile a little.

434
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,840
Okay, one, two, three.

435
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,360
One, two, three.

436
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,560
Wait a sec, bro.

437
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,680
Cheeks.

438
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,320
One, two, three.

439
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,320
Smile.

440
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,960
Yeah, great.

441
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,000
One, two, three.

442
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,600
So much fuss.

443
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,280
Thank you.

444
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,680
(Akin)
