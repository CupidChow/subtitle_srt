Yi Chen...

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,320
I am truly delighted
to see you again.

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,000
This disciple of yours has grown up

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,440
and become much
stronger than before.

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,040
It is all because of your teachings.

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,920
Are you pleased?

(jin.jin_x)

(Unfollow)

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,400
Hello.

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,840
I have someone
I want you to work with.

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,200
(Twin Stars The Project)

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,840
A remake project based
on a famous Chinese novel.

16
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,720
This is a major project in
collaboration between Channel S

17
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,720
and the big studio, SIGMA.

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,360
Plus, it's the channel's
10th-anniversary project,

19
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,240
so they have
high expectations for it.

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,760
So far, the script has
been revised for two episodes.

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,520
It's a story about
two main characters.

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,560
Two main characters?

23
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,600
Don't tell me you're asking me
to pair up with Jin.

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,560
You've been in
the industry for over ten years,

25
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,320
you should know well

26
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,240
that if you don't do something,

27
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,480
both you and the studio will be
in an even worse situation.

28
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,000
Jin hasn't been in
the industry for long,

29
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,880
yet he's already
about to surpass you.

30
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,120
Plus, he has a big
studio backing him.

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,240
Your story is interesting,

32
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,600
and if you two take
this project together,

33
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,200
the negative opinions people
have about you will decrease.

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,960
Are you trying to tell me that

35
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,520
if I don't accept your offer,

36
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,040
my time

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,160
will be running out soon?

38
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,360
Akin,

39
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,200
you need to understand that

40
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,840
the entertainment industry is

41
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,840
a competitive field where
everyone fights for the spotlight.

42
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,440
No one can escape this.

43
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,240
If you're not happy
with the rising stars,

44
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,960
then show your skills
on set so that kid can see it.

45
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,000
Or are you afraid of losing?

46
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,520
Has the kid who once
shouted that he would be

47
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,560
the number one actor
of all time disappeared?

48
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,680
After Akin,

49
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,800
Secured the Sexiest Man Award for the fifth year

50
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,040
And with Jin closing in

51
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,600
Their star power is undeniable.

52
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,680
Channel S presents a brand-new series

53
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,880
The Legend of Gemini

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,240
Hey.

55
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,960
I don't think the actor you like is

56
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,160
handsome at all.

57
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,960
Who are you referring to?

58
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,840
I talk about this Akin and Jin.

59
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,040
They look average to me.

60
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,480
Honestly,

61
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,880
I'm even more handsome than them.

62
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,960
Don't be that confident.

63
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,440
Akin is way more handsome than you.

64
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,360
Hey! Can you lower your voice?

65
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,840
Akin isn't just handsome, you know.

66
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,360
He genuinely cares about others.

67
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,320
Even someone like Jin,

68
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,200
who only met him for a short while,
is already so attached.

69
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,000
He must be that charming.

70
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,680
You shipper girls.

71
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,440
Hey,

72
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,120
calm down.

73
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,040
The two of them are

74
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,920
acting together,

75
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,560
so they have to create a buzz
and make the audience believe it.

76
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,520
You ended up believing it too.

77
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,440
You're the one who doesn't
understand anything!

78
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,880
Good-looking, kind
men who are together —

79
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,880
what else could they possibly be,

80
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,320
except a couple?

81
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,480
Shoot! Very Handsome!

82
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,040
Hello.

83
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,200
The total is 132 baht.

84
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,880
Would you like to add Akin to that?

85
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,400
Would you like to add anything else?

86
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,080
Just one Akin... is more than enough.

87
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
Okay.

88
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,600
- I'll go ahead now.
- Okay.

89
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,440
- Can I have the bill, please?
- Okay.

90
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,960
- Yes, he's so cute.
- He's so cute.

91
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,320
Would you like to add more Akin?

92
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,960
Would you like to add anything else?

93
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,600
Just one Akin... is enough for me.

94
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,200
Jin?

95
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,960
Jin, don't play yet.

96
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,000
Listen to Ford first.

97
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,080
You go down alone first

98
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,200
because normally,

99
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,480
Akin goes down alone as well.

100
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,840
Go down and create
a moment with him,

101
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,680
and

102
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,000
don't spend too much
time with the fans.

103
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,520
Mr. Jade doesn't like
people who are late.

104
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,520
Okay.

105
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,680
Is it?

106
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,680
Yes, it really is!

107
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,760
Yeah, yeah!

108
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,600
[Screaming]

109
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,680
Touch.

110
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,760
Yes?

111
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,240
You go down with Jin first, okay?

112
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,600
Okay.

113
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,400
I'll go talk to the director first.

114
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,600
Okay, sure. I'll wait for Jin first.

115
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,080
Hey!

116
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,560
This year, you're still the number one
"Sexiest Man Awards"

117
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,600
A year has 365 days,

118
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,080
and I've worked over 400 days.

119
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,960
If I drop from the rankings,
let it be known!

120
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,040
But Jin is also
gaining a lot of attention.

121
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,000
He hasn't been in
the industry for long,

122
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,840
and he's already right behind,
almost at number two!

123
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,520
The fame of celebrities

124
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,880
will fade eventually.

125
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,400
Things like this are only temporary.

126
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,600
You can't measure
success by rankings like this,

127
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,720
it's all just fleeting.

128
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,080
Hey.

129
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,160
But he still looks up
to you as an idol.

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He probably wants to catch up to me.

131
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,600
But in the end,

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,760
he'll just get bought
by the investors

133
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,080
and become nothing
more than a celebrity.

134
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,120
Hey!

135
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,440
If you dislike him that much,

136
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,600
then why are you taking this job?

137
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,440
Oh my god!

138
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,040
Sine.

139
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,240
I want to eat this.

140
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,760
- Take me to buy it.
- I can't anymore, I can't.

141
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,240
No, you can't. What time is it?

142
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,600
It's already past 10 o'clock.

143
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,280
- Sine, it looks so delicious!
- It's too late.

144
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,920
We have to go now.
Let's go, let's go. Not waiting anymore!

145
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,000
Hey.

146
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,040
Have you been waiting long?

147
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,880
If it's Akin, no matter how long, I can wait!

148
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,880
So cute!

149
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,880
(Jin: What do you want it for?)

150
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,040
(To register our marriage certificate?)

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,200
Oh! But wait, hold on!

152
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,200
I'll go tell them for you!

153
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,080
Akin, hello! How have you been?

154
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,640
Akin, wait for me!

155
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,840
Congratulations on being

156
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,720
named "The Sexiest Man of the Year"
for the 5th year in a row.

157
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,400
It's amazing.

158
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,960
How you've maintained
the title for so long.

159
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,800
If it were me, I definitely
wouldn't be able to do it like you.

160
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,960
But next year,
I'll be rooting for you!

161
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,440
You'll definitely get first place!

162
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,920
What time did you
wake up this morning?

163
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
Jin, come sit down.

164
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,880
All the actors are here now,

165
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,280
but let's wait for
Director Hong Tē for a moment.

166
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,400
Sine.

167
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,800
Just now.

168
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,120
- Take me to buy it. It looks so delicious!
- I can't anymore, I can't.

169
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
Let's go now! Hurry up!

170
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,000
Smells nice.

171
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,280
Touch! This is really delicious.

172
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,200
It's really delicious!

173
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,560
Thank you.

174
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,440
Hello, everyone.

175
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,200
Hello.

176
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,600
I'm sorry for making you wait.

177
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,960
Okay.

178
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,480
Alright, then I'll start now.

179
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,800
Everyone is here.

180
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,000
As you all know,

181
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,440
this series is our
major project of the year.

182
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,520
Therefore, we don't just
aim to target the Thai market,

183
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,960
but we hope to break into
the Asian market as well.

184
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,240
First of all, let me introduce
Director Hong Tē,

185
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,600
the director of this series.

186
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,440
Many of you may
have seen his previous works,

187
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,080
as his film 'Love Destination 2' was incredibly
popular and earned hundreds of millions.

188
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,480
Please give a round of
applause for Director Hong Tē.

189
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,960
Thank you.

190
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,560
Ah, it's not that much,

191
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,760
just 500 million.

192
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,960
Okay.

193
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,400
Make yourself comfortable.

194
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,680
Working with me,
no need to be tense—just relax!

195
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,960
Let's continue.

196
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,280
As for our two lead actors,

197
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,840
Akin and Jin,

198
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,520
the number 1 and number 2
‘Sexiest Men’,

199
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,040
they are playing the main roles
together for the first time.

200
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,520
I'm sure that with these two leads,
we've got the Thai market covered.

201
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,600
Gentlemen,

202
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,240
please greet everyone!

203
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,640
Hello everyone,

204
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,640
I'm Jin.
I'm playing the role of Mu Yang,

205
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,160
the beloved disciple
of Master Yi Chen.

206
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,160
I look forward to working
with all of you!

207
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,200
I feel honored

208
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,720
and excited

209
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,840
to work with Akin again,

210
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,480
who feels like my first mentor,

211
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,680
after we haven't seen each other for

212
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,280
1 year, 3 months, and 15 days.

213
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,640
And in the next 6 months,

214
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,120
I promise

215
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,840
I won't make Akin worried anymore.

216
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,760
Thank you.

217
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
I am Akin,

218
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,120
playing the role of Master Yi Chen.

219
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,480
I'm very pleased

220
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,120
to be working again
with Producer Jade,

221
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,080
Director Hong Tē,

222
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,000
and Jin in this project.

223
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,720
After 1 year, 3 months, and 15 days,

224
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,240
I hope that in the 325 scenes

225
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,920
we will work together from now on,

226
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,240
I won't have to worry
as much as Jin said.

227
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,960
I look forward to
working with all of you!

228
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,760
Okay then!

229
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,200
I think we're ready to

230
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,320
read through together.

231
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,560
Please, go ahead.

232
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,200
Mu Yang stood face-to-face
with Yi Chen,

233
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,800
his expression full of
excitement that he couldn't hide,

234
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,760
as he finally met
the master he had longed to see.

235
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,640
Mu Yang quickly bowed in
respect to his master.

236
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,280
Master Yi Chen...

237
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,240
I am truly delighted

238
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,160
to meet you again.

239
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,040
Five hundred years...

240
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,400
Five hundred years
that I have known you.

241
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,400
You have never been this nervous.

242
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,040
What do you have to
say for yourself?

243
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,080
What more do you want from me?

244
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,760
That's not it, Master.

245
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,400
I'm just...

246
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,320
happy to see you again.

247
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,160
My disciple has grown stronger

248
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,720
and more powerful than before.

249
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,240
All of this is

250
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,480
thanks to your teachings.

251
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,600
Are you pleased with me, Master?

252
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,240
Do you want me to say that

253
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,720
I'm pleased

254
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,400
to see you betray and
join the demonic side?

255
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,120
How pitiful.

256
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,280
If you've become like this
because of my teachings,

257
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,920
I can truly say

258
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,280
you've never understood
my teachings at all.

259
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,160
You've changed so much, Mu Yang.

260
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,520
You've changed into someone that...

261
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,160
I am deeply disappointed in.

262
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
From now on,

263
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,920
you and I

264
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,600
are severed.

265
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,880
I have no disciple like you.

266
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,120
Cut!

267
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,920
Good! Thank you.

268
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,280
I think we're all set for today.

269
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,360
Let's wrap it up here for now,

270
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,760
and we'll schedule our next session later.

271
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,960
But after the meeting
finishes, may I speak

272
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,160
with you, Akin and Jade,
for a moment?

273
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,680
I have a personal matter
I'd like to discuss.

274
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,600
Sure.

275
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,160
Thank you, everyone!
Thank you so much.

276
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,320
When Akin and Jin were

277
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,480
exchanging lines just now

278
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,480
I came up with a great idea.

279
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,120
What idea do you have?
Feel free to propose it!

280
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,520
Think about it with me.

281
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,080
The novel 'The Legend of Gemini'

282
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,360
has been remade 4-5 times already,

283
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,120
and every time,

284
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,920
it's been told from
Yi Chen's perspective.

285
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,680
Are we just going to
do the same thing?

286
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,760
If we try something new

287
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,400
and tell the story from
Mu Yang's perspective,

288
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,840
I think something
fresh could happen.

289
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,880
Just like

290
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,480
the story of Nang Nak,

291
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,520
when it was told from
Phee Maak's perspective,

292
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,160
instantly fresh,

293
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,400
instantly impactful.

294
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,720
So here's the thing.

295
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,760
I have an initial idea.

296
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,240
I want to start by
changing the storyline.

297
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,840
I want to make Yi Chen

298
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,440
a vengeful spirit at
the beginning of the story.

299
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,080
Hold on,

300
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,840
a malevolent spirit?

301
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,360
Is a small adjustment?

302
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,320
Yes,

303
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
think about it.

304
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,960
When Yi Chen becomes
a malevolent spirit,

305
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,440
he will only be able to communicate
with one person—Mu Yang.

306
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,200
This pairing of characters

307
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,120
will have a significant bond,

308
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,440
creating moments of deep deep friendship.

309
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,840
But I think if we're
making such a big change,

310
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,400
we should consult with
the IP owner first, right?

311
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,960
So here's the thing,

312
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,840
making such a big change
in the direction of the story

313
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,720
requires thorough discussions
with multiple teams.

314
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,840
How about this?
You can try writing it first

315
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,960
and then present it to me.

316
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,440
If I'm okay with it,

317
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,520
I'll go talk to them for you. Okay?

318
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,680
Okay.

319
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,960
What does Mr. Akin think?

320
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,160
For

321
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,120
a 500 million director, like you,

322
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,040
you can do,

323
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,320
whatever you want!

324
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,640
I promise I won't disappoint you.

325
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,200
Thank you for believing in my ideas.

326
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,120
Hong Tē!
Immediately cut my scene, huh?

327
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,120
You plan to make me die and become
a ghost, following Jin like a fool?

328
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,600
Just wait...

329
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,200
I'll make sure to leave
them speechless!

330
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,520
You're not getting away, Hong Tē!

331
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,200
What the hell are you doing?!

332
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,920
I was just kidding a little.

333
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,760
When did I ever become
your playmate?

334
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,800
I just saw you looking stressed,
so I thought I'd buy this for you.

335
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,960
Where did you get this from?

336
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,160
It's not even sold here.

337
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,600
Not telling. Am I a good boy?

338
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,880
I'll tell you.

339
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,680
I bought it from outside.

340
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,840
That's all.

341
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,760
By the way,
about what you asked earlier...

342
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,480
Would you like to add more Akin?

343
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,080
No, not that.

344
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,880
What else do you want to add?

345
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,840
Having fun?

346
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,240
I'm going now.

347
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,440
Someone like Mu Yang?

348
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,040
Master Fei Long.
Why should I be afraid?

349
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,560
How could a teacher be
afraid of their disciple?

350
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,080
True.

351
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,920
What's there to be afraid of?

352
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,480
I have more skills

353
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,640
and more experience.

354
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,600
That child is driven
only by a thirst for power,

355
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,920
doing anything for it,

356
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,160
even studying dark arts.

357
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,240
But he lacks understanding of
the world in the martial realm.

358
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,720
A person like this can
never achieve greatness.

359
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,480
Exactly!

360
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,520
People who just follow
trends like that wooden boy,

361
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,520
Wait ... Mu Yang,

362
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,640
how can they ever
compete with Master Yi Chen?

363
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,080
(Hold on.)

364
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,800
(You're not afraid,)

365
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,680
(but what about the common people?)

366
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,400
(What do they think about that kid?)

367
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,920
Fei Long.

368
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,680
You should be
cautious, Master Yi Chen.

369
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,680
No one is immortal.

370
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,480
One day, the time
of change will come.

371
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
Who is your acting idol?

372
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,560
Akin. I just like him.

373
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,640
He's a nice person.

374
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,400
Ah. Um.

375
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,080
(The chemistry between
Jin and Akin is amazing!)

376
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,280
(I can't wait to watch
The Legend of Gemini' soon!)

377
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,680
(Akin is amazing!)

378
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,440
(He's such a talented actor and
a great senior in the industry.)

379
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,880
(He takes really good care
of even new actors)

380
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,040
(so attentive Akin
is truly outstanding!)

381
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,240
(Does Akin still have his shine?)

382
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,600
(Ever since Jin came along,)

383
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,160
(Akin's had fewer jobs.)

384
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,520
(He just has to ride
the kid's wave.)

385
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,240
(Just look at
the drama AKINA, you can tell.)

386
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,000
He's the main lead,

387
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,840
(yet Jin keeps
stealing the spotlight.)

388
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,080
(I'm an Akin fan,)

389
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,840
(but I might have
to accept the truth—)

390
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,240
(next year, Jin is definitely
taking the number one spot.)

391
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,680
(Next year, he'll definitely be
overshadowed. He's so arrogant)

392
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,480
(and never interacts with his fans.)

393
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,680
(Jin is so much better—)

394
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,000
(Akin doesn't even compare.)

395
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,280
(Everything Jin said on
the show was scripted.)

396
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,680
(Even if Akin really
treated him like shite,)

397
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,720
(no rookie actor would dare
call out a senior publicly.)

398
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,000
(Agreed)

399
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,680
(Yes, that's correct!)

400
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,960
(Yeah, exactly! So true!)

401
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,760
(Jin: There was no script.)

402
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,640
(Everything I said was)

403
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,800
(truly how I feel about Akin.)

404
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,280
Will he be okay?

405
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,120
(Look, the moon is smiling.)

406
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,400
(Anyone who sees this story,)

407
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,800
(bad things will pass,)

408
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,680
(and good things will come.
Keep fighting!)

409
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,720
(Look, the moon is smiling.
Anyone who sees this story.)

410
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,200
(bad things will pass, and good things will come.
Keep fighting!)

411
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,480
Mr. Jade.

412
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,160
Today, will there be an opportunity
to interview Jin and Akin

413
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,560
about the topic where Jin responded
to the fans' comments last night?

414
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,960
I apologize to everyone,

415
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,080
but we have a filming schedule
in another province,

416
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,680
so it won't be convenient to
interview them today.

417
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,240
But…

418
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,640
We really not available. We need to hurry.

419
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,200
They're here, they're here!

420
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,800
What are you doing?

421
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
It's cold.

422
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,520
Stop making that face already!

423
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,160
(Sorry, and thank you to the fans as well.)

424
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,720
Alright, since we're already here,

425
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,320
let's go for the interview quickly.

426
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,400
Okay.

427
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,440
(Jin and Akin,)

428
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,040
(may I ask for an interview
about last night?)

429
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,600
When you replied to

430
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,640
the fan's message,
defending Akin like that,

431
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,480
does it mean there's a chance
that your on-screen pairing

432
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,240
could turn into a real couple?

433
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,520
Will it be true?

434
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,760
And how do you feel about
working with Jin again this time?

435
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,880
I'm very happy.

436
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,480
I have to say that

437
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,120
I've been impressed with Jin since
we worked together on AKINA.

438
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,240
Now that

439
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,840
we're back together on this project,

440
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,680
it feels reassuring

441
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,520
(to work with someone familiar.)

442
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,440
(Oh, Akin, you've been eagerly waiting to...)

443
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,280
Akin.

444
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,320
Do you want to watch
the interview of yourself?

445
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,480
This is the tenth time,

446
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,040
aren't you getting tired of it?

447
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,480
No,

448
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,000
I think it's cute. I like it.

449
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,920
But I don't like it.

450
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,800
If you're going to keep listening,

451
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,280
go get your headphones
and put them on!

452
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
I forgot to bring them.

453
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
Thank you.

454
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,560
Well, my team and I have already approved
the script before filming.

455
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,720
But didn't you just
adjust the script on set?

456
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,880
Well,

457
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,320
I'm the director.

458
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,880
I have the right to make changes on set.

459
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,000
Akin.

460
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,200
Akin.

461
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,360
Did you know? Director Hong Tē
changed the script again!

462
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,360
Your part got cut down quite a bit.

463
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,520
This isn't fair! How can you just

464
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,240
cut Akin's lines like this all of a sudden?

465
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,760
It's okay, Akin.

466
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,280
I'll handle it myself.

467
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,440
Let me think for a moment.

468
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,760
Akin.

469
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,400
I have something
I need your help with.

470
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,560
Have you already thought of a plan?

471
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,840
Yes.

472
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,480
Master Yi Chen...

473
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,160
I am truly glad

474
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,800
to meet you again.

475
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
Your disciple has grown and

476
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,960
become stronger than before.

477
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,760
All of this is

478
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,200
thanks to your teachings.

479
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,440
Are you pleased with this?

480
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,120
I have never had
a disciple like you.

481
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,920
Is there no disciple like me, then!

482
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,040
Then who is it

483
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,800
that made me yearn for success,

484
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,160
so that I could be worthy of you!

485
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,240
Why...

486
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,080
even though I've tried so hard,

487
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,840
why won't you accept me?

488
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,760
Actors are the characters,

489
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,240
and they can interpret
the character their way, right?

490
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,320
It ruins the main line of the story.
Do you understand, Jade?

491
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,320
And the problem is,

492
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,920
it will cause damage
that continues on and on, Jade.

493
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,320
If Akin improvises and it ruins the storyline
or the key message,

494
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,640
I'll take full responsibility
for both the time and the money.

495
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,640
(He adjusts his piece's placement.)

496
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,000
Even until this very moment…

497
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,000
I still have to prove
myself to you, don't I?

498
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,600
I'm really afraid that
if it turns out that way,

499
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,720
the relationship between

500
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,680
the disciple and the
master—which is very important.

501
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,040
Please trust me.

502
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,000
What Akin is doing,

503
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,680
he's not doing it for himself—

504
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,280
he's doing it for this series.

505
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,160
He wants to make it
the best it can be.

506
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,120
(Is he improvising?)

507
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,920
I have lost to you.

508
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,640
Not yet.

509
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,840
If he doesn't walk out,
then how is he going to act?

510
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,760
Let's wait and see.

511
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,880
I trust Akin.

512
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,600
I believe there will definitely

513
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,000
be a magic moment.

514
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,880
What are you going to do?

515
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,400
It has been a long time

516
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,960
since the evil sect have
tried to attack me,

517
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,680
but they have never succeeded.

518
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,880
But now,

519
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,760
it seems they have figured out

520
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,720
what tool can

521
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,160
destroy me.

522
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,200
I have never been a tool for them.

523
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,880
The reason I have
come back to you is

524
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,840
because of my own desire.

525
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,240
I can protect you!

526
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,880
No matter what happens,

527
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,320
I will protect you!

528
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,560
My time has run out,

529
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,680
Mu Yang.

530
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,840
Thank you

531
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,520
for playing Go
with me one last time.

532
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,680
Thank you

533
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,280
for not using dirty
tactics to defeat me.

534
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,120
I am so proud...

535
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,480
to have you as my disciple.

536
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,280
My time is up, Mu Yang.

537
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,600
Master!

538
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,360
Master!

539
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,360
Master!

540
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,880
Don't leave me.

541
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,400
Master!

542
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,880
Master!

543
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,280
Master Yi Chen!

544
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,080
Cut!

545
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,440
It's even better than what I wrote.

546
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,800
Amazing, amazing!

547
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,360
- They're really something, Jade!
- Correct.

548
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,480
I think these
two could really go far.

549
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,240
Thank you so much for helping
me with the negotiation.

550
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
Because of you.

551
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,760
Why because of me?

552
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,160
Because of you.

553
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,880
I don't know if you realize this,

554
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,400
but your performance just now

555
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,000
really added depth to your character.

556
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,480
Yes,

557
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,760
it was crazy.

558
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,360
Especially the way you played
your moves just now. I think

559
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,360
it was amazing.

560
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,440
Since you're brave enough to risk
changing the script,

561
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,720
I'm brave enough to play along.

562
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,840
If anything is better than before,
I'm okay with it.

563
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,680
Thank you.

564
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,800
- You're welcome!
- Akin.

565
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,080
What's up?

566
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,600
Are you free today?

567
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,840
I want to invite you for a drink

568
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
and then...

569
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,560
I think I'll rest today.

570
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,280
I've been filming all day.

571
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,120
Anyway, I...

572
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,760
I think you should go, Master.

573
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,440
That disciple probably has

574
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,320
something special to discuss
with you, Akin.

575
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,240
Go ahead.

576
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,040
Um.

577
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,320
But anyway, we'll have to meet
tomorrow anyway.

578
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,600
- We'll talk then...
- Go ahead, Akin.

579
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,480
Maybe you'll find out what caused

580
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,040
the change in your performance.

581
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,800
I think Akin is probably tired.

582
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,040
Let him rest.

583
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,080
Alright,

584
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,560
anyway, my scene is
getting cut tomorrow.

585
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,720
The next filming is in the evening.

586
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,760
It'd be nice to have a drink.

587
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,720
Enjoy.

588
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,960
See you soon. Good luck!

589
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,760
Are you okay?

590
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,040
Hello! Please, come in.

591
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,320
Would you like to have
something else?

592
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,600
Do you like Judy?

593
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,280
Oh, it's not that.

594
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,240
I bought it because...

595
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,040
of this.

596
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,600
Oh,

597
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,480
Akin.

598
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,440
Akin is so enviable, isn't he?

599
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,280
Why is that?

600
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,240
Well, he's the number one
Sexiest Man.

601
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,240
It's not something

602
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,240
just anyone can be.

603
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,040
Please come again next time.
