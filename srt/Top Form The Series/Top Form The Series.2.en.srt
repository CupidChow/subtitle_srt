00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,600
(Why is his heartbeat so loud?)

2
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,040
(Akin's breath is uneven.)

3
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,800
Cut! Go check on them.

4
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,840
What happened?

5
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,440
- Are you injured?
- We're okay.

6
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,560
I'm sorry for

7
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,440
what I've done.

8
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,440
I know it's unforgivable.

9
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,360
What good does it do,

10
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,040
admitting it now?

11
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,480
Captain Ken was kidnapped

12
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,520
because of you!

13
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,400
I'm the one at fault.

14
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,720
Since I got here,

15
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,640
Captain Ken's taught me so much.

16
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,720
He taught me to be a better,

17
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,520
to improve...

18
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,120
just like him.

19
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,720
He must be disappointed in me.

20
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,640
Everything that happened,
it's all on me.

21
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,040
Cut! Moving on!

22
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,440
Great job, Jin.

23
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,920
What acting secret did you pick up?

24
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,480
You're on another level
since the rooftop scene.

25
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,360
Don't just recite lines.

26
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,600
Be truthful with your emotions.

27
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,480
There's no acting secret, P' Jo.

28
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,280
I just try my best, like always.

29
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,400
(AKINA)

30
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,200
This is the last semester

31
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,240
we'll be together.

32
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,520
Take good care of my gift.

33
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,640
I need to tell you something.

34
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,640
I actually...

35
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,960
really hate you.

36
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,360
You use people to get what you want.

37
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,840
You don't deserve my kindness.

38
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,920
You've been taking on a lot of
projects these days.

39
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,240
Is something happening
in your life behind the scenes?

40
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,520
Truthfully, I've been working
this hard since day one.

41
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,040
It's been a bit hectic lately
with the drama shoot

42
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,280
and a few brand deals on the table.

43
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,440
When the higher-ups offer something,
you go for it.

44
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,400
All your hard work and good looks—

45
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,600
What about your heart?
Is anyone taking care of that?

46
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,080
I'm good.
Don't need help with this one.

47
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,720
The show's starting,
please excuse me.

48
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,640
Akin's taking on so much work—

49
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,320
is he doing okay financially?

50
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,800
He could end up sick
if he's not careful.

51
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,600
I just don't know why...

52
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,000
the more I hate you,

53
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,200
the more I find myself
falling for you.

54
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,040
Akin!

55
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,800
Sorry for scaring you.

56
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,560
What do you want?

57
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,160
Are you feeling unwell?

58
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,360
I'm fine.

59
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,200
But you seem to have a fever.

60
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,440
Is everything alright?

61
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,880
It's nothing.

62
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,200
The chair fell over.

63
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,320
Calm your nerves.

64
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,800
We're meeting so many people.

65
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,640
We're adults now.

66
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,640
- One sec.
- Who is it?

67
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,440
It's Jin.

68
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,720
Can you answer this for me?
Be right back.

69
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,200
Sure, sure.

70
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,600
- [Touch] Hello, we'll be there soon.
- Jin. What's up?

71
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,560
Um, it's nothing.

72
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,840
Hold it, please.

73
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,080
Mind if I join?

74
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,480
Your hand...

75
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,000
Just a scratch,

76
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
Nothing fatal.

77
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,880
That's good.

78
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,320
Are you alri...

79
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
See you then.

80
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,600
Are you awake, Akin?

81
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,720
How did I end up here, Sine?

82
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,640
You don't remember?

83
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,520
Jin brought you here.

84
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,080
Jin?

85
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,400
Akin, we'll get help soon.

86
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,720
Mr. Akin is showing signs of
fatigue and has a high fever.

87
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,080
The doctor has started an IV drip

88
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,480
and gave him medication
to reduce the fever.

89
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,160
His condition is stable,

90
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,520
and there's no cause for concern
at the moment.

91
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,560
Thank you.

92
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,280
Akin.

Keep your furry friend strong and healthy.

96
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,280
C'mon, good boy, come get your treat!

97
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,360

Hello, P' Sine.

100
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
(Sine: Akin is awake and well.)

101
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,040
(Sine: Thanks a lot, Jin.)

102
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,960
(I'll need a new car soon)

103
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,040
(so I can drive Akin around
whenever he needs.)

104
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,560
Akin,

105
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,560
I heard you've been
juggling so many projects lately,

106
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,760
you ended up in the hospital?

107
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,600
It's nothing, really.

108
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,560
I guess I'm getting older,

109
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,400
so my health isn't
what it used to be.

110
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,960
But you bounced back pretty quickly.

111
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,000
Must be some top-notched medical service~?

112
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,960
That's me.
Sick today, strong tomorrow.

113
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,200
Akin,

114
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,480
your next scene is where you get held hostage.

115
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,840
P' Aoi, can you help Akin
with the blindfold?

116
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,000
- Gladly!
- Careful with his hair.

117
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,400
Okay, thanks.

118
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,800
We can put that on now.

119
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,680
It'll help me focus before we shoot.

120
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,160
Aoi, you're needed at the set.

121
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
Sure.

122
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,240
Be back soon.

123
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,280
One day,

124
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,200
I'll catch up to you

125
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,800
and be by your side, no matter what.

126
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,800
(It's the day of the wrap,)

127
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,440
(should I go thank Wooden Boy
for what he did for me?)

128
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,800
Ah, forget it.

(SIGMA ENTERTAINMENT)

130
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,240
We really appreciate SIGMA for this.

131
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,280
I decline.

132
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,280
Mildy, thanks for everything.

133
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,560
(Ning: SIGMA's made several offers for Akin)

134
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,800
(Ning: but I haven't given them a response.)

135
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,120
SIGMA is a pro

136
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,680
at media manipulation—

137
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,600
they know how to drive trends,
generate award buzz,

138
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,200
and stir up tabloid drama.

139
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,520
More than half of today's
top stars owe their fame

140
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,880
to the hype SIGMA's manipulated
into existence.

141
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,440
Jin's left us!

142
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,480
Girl,

143
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,840
don't be so dramatic!

144
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,240
Leave me alone.

145
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,240
I've looked after Jin
since he was this small.

146
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,400
Let me grieve!

147
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,800
Didn't you get paid for it?

148
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,200
Money is good and all.

149
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,960
But it's Honey Jin we're talking about.

150
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,480
There's nothing wrong
with celebs chasing the spotlight.

151
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,400
But SIGMA's way of using their talents

152
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,440
without nurturing their skills

153
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,160
is hurting the talent's career.

154
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,880
What made you do it?

155
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,120
Take a look.
Jin's changed so much—

156
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,280
his look,
his eyes, his whole vibe.

157
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,200
The kid we used to worry about
isn't here anymore.

158
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,600
You do realize,
if we reject SIGMA,

159
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,640
it's like declaring war with them.

160
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,840
If they're only after my popularity,

161
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,120
then

162
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,160
I'd rather not tie myself to an agency

163
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,400
that only thrives on hype

164
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,400
to push their talent.

165
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,320
I'm an actor,

166
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,560
not a celebrity.

167
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,560
(Akin, I'm one step closer to you now.)

168
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,800
Looks like the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree—

169
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,520
You're just like your grandma.

170
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,840
I respect your decision, Akin.

171
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,680
From now on,

172
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,600
they'll be watching you.

173
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,320
Life's about to get tough.

174
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,120
Sure you're up for it?

175
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Let's just say,

176
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,080
I'm not one to back down.

177
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,600

(Fresh-faced Actor Jin Joins SIGMA after Mildy)

179

We're meeting with
my team of personal stylists.

180
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,680
You're getting some new looks.

181
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,040

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,560
Hello, Mr. Ford.

183
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,000
Hello.

184
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,960
Come this way, Jin.
Let's try some outfits.

185
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,960
Plagrim, we need Jin
for a quick light test.

186
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,120
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

187
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,040
We're shooting now?

188
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,680
Just testing the lights.

189
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,280
(MILLÉ MILLÉ )

190
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,720
"MULE MULE"

191
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,000
I guess the brand owner
likes mules?

192
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,240
What "MULE MULE"?

193
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,760
It's "MILLÉ MILLÉ".

194
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,720
This brand's as big as JENINE,

195
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,320
the one Akin represents.

196
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,080
Each piece costs thousands.

197
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,360
Alright, it's show time.

198
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,000
Gotta say "MULE MULE"
is pretty cute.

199
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,600
I love mules!

200
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,960
(Ford: MILLÉ MILLÉ is a powerhouse brand.)

201
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,480
(If they pick you as their ambassador,)

202
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,000
(it's going to be a game-changer
for your career.)

203
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,600
(Jin: In what way?)

204
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,240
(Ford: You could rise to the global stage.)

205
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,080
(Jin: Global stage?)

206
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,800
(Ford: In showbiz, competition is sky-high.)

207
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,560
(Keep pushing,)

208
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,520
(keep growing your skills,)

209
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,120
(and opportunities will come running your way.)

210
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,640
You're saying I'll get to work with Akin again?

211
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,400
If you rise high enough.

212
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,120
Clients won't get to choose you—

213
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,840
'cause you'll be choosing who to work with.

214
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,200
When he's done with this gig,
he's got another one at five.

215
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,560
Five?

216
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,800
Got it.

217
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,160
Let's start.

218
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,400
(If Akin's the King of Showbiz,)

219
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,760
(then Judy's the Queen of the Screen.)

220
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,320
Partnering with a top-tier talent

221
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,120
will elevate your profile

222
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,960
and add to your image.

223
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,520
You're making me melt.

224
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,520
I haven't felt this way
since I first met Akin.

225
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,840
You've worked with Akin before?

226
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,520
Yeah,

227
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,480
but you're way cuter.

228
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,120
Touch, hurry!

229
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,400
- What is it, sis?
- Look!

230
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,560
Wait, I'm busy with
Jin's schedule.

231
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,120
Hurry!

232
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,640
Jin ate and left no crumbs
in this shoot.

233
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,840
My hon, my angel boy!

234
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,200
- I made sure he slayed on that set!
- Thank you, queen!

235
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,400
A year and 2 months later:

236
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,720
Hi everyone, welcome to
Midnight Matter!

237
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,000
It's so hot today,

238
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,400
not because the AC is broken,

239
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,680
but because we have a hot
young actor

240
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,560
visiting our show!

241
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,960
Are you ready?

242
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,120
Let's give it to... Jin!

243
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,560
Hello, hello.

244
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,480
Hello.

245
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,320
- How's it going?
- I'm good.

246
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,400
So glad to meet you.

247
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,200
Likewise, so honored to have you here.

248
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,520
Please, have a seat.

249
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,920
Let us give Jin another
round of applause!

250
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,880
Our show feels so much livelier today

251
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,920
with this beautiful man with us.

252
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,280
Do you even realize how
famous you are right now?

253
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,400
I don't know...

254
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,400
I'm just living my life,
everything feels pretty normal..

255
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,080
"Pretty normal" you say?

256
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,320
Let's see what
Jin's "pretty normal" looks like!

257
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,040
Viewers, are you ready?

258
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,800
Your Instagram following just hit 3.5 million!

259
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,760
That's not "pretty normal," dear.

260
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,200
You're popular overseas too—

261
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,760
in China, Japan, and Korea—
they're all crazy about you!

262
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,960
Our show is going live right now,

263
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,880
and I can't even find a single Thai comment!

264
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,720
You're practically too hot to handle!

265
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,640
Recently, he was featured on a

266
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,040
magazine cover with Queen Judy!

267
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,600
I'm starting to think a
"pretty normal" life like yours

268
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,120
actually sounds pretty amazing!

269
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,840
Wow, look at that—Jin's already made it this big?

270
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,640
That was quick!

271
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,920
With SIGMA pushing him that hard,

272
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,960
it'd be strange if he hadn't made it.

273
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,080
Sources tell me it wasn't an easy road

274
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,800
to becoming the Jin we know today.

275
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,920
You've done it all—

276
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,840
from working at a convenience store to...

277
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,240
Check this photo out.

278
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,600
What photo?

279
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,480
There, a pizza shop employee!

280
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,440
Which branch did you work at?

281
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,120
I've never seen a more handsome
employee.

282
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,200
It was near my house.

283
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,040
Right.

284
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,360
It was a time when I was

285
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,640
figuring out I wanted to do.

286
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,760
I took whatever job came my way.

287
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,920
That's actually

288
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,160
how I met P' Mildy,

289
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,280
the owner of my old agency.

290
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,960
Pizza delivery!

291
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,920
Pizza's here.

292
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,000
Can you get it?

293
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,520
Coming~

294
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,040
That'll be 399 baht.

295
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,480
Girl, get here quick!

296
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,200
Why?

297
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,200
- I'm starving.
- Just come!

298
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,880
- Fine.
- Look at him.

299
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,800
It's 399 baht.

300
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,480
Take 500. Keep the change.

301
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,960
How tall are you, hon?

302
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,000
185 cm.

303
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,680
Ooh, 185?
Mind if I take a look at your face?

304
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,760
Are you biracial?

305
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,160
I am.

306
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,520
If they hadn't called to order pizza that day,

307
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,080
there'd be no me today.

308
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,720
Aw, Jin, honey...

309
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,080
Your laugh sounds like a mule.

310
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,240
So, you didn't plan on
being an actor from the get-go,

311
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,440
but wow, you're just really good at it!

312
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,000
Who do you look up to as an actor?

313
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,040
P' Akin.

314
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,960
[Host] You're smiling a lot.

315
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,920
[Host] What's going on...

316
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,320
Akin! Akin!

317
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,840
- [Jin] Well... because he's kind.
- Jin's talking about you.

318
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,120
- [Jin] I mean...
- Come sit down.

319
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,560
He's going on about you non-stop!

320
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,680
[Jin] Akin and I were in the same
drama called "Akina."

321
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,760
[Jin] When I first met him,

322
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,400
[Jin] it was intimidating

323
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,200
because I was just a newbie,

324
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,280
while he was this famous actor.

325
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,440
I didn't want to be a burden to him.

326
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,680
The last thing I wanted was to annoy him.

327
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,520
When I got to know him,
he's actually really kind.

328
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,680
Wait...

329
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,920
You're not bringing Akin in
to surprise me, are you?

330
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,280
[Host] You caught me!
Can't be too careful these days.

331
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,720
[Host] Please welcome... Akin!

332
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,040
I'm messing with you.

333
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,800
He couldn't make it.
The man's busy!

334
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,960
Now you've done it.

335
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,480
I'm just kidding,
but really,

336
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,400
if you're a real fan of Jin or Akin,

337
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,680
you'd know just how much Jin looks up to Akin.

338
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,240
Just check Instagram—

339
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,960
Jin literally likes every single one of Akin's posts!

340
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,240
[Jin] That's true.

341
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,480
[Host] Spill the tea.

342
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,960
Oh, comments are pouring in live!

343
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,640
Let's read some of them.

344
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,200
"Omigosh, JIN x AKIN...
JIN x AKIN.. I am so FIN."

345
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,040
"They should work together again~"

346
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,880
"JIN x AKIN has so many fans."

347
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,400
"Producers better give this pair a show soon!"

348
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,040
What the..

349
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,200
"We're begging you"

350
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,360
"Shippers need this ship to sail"

351
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,320
Next comment.

352
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,120
"Is this a one-sided thing for Jin?"

353
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,200
"Akin's not even following him on IG"

354
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,360
Your thoughts?

355
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,080
It's understandable

356
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,120
because Akin isn't really

357
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,240
active on social media.

358
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,800
He might not have
noticed that I followed him.

359
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,320
You really do admire him!

360
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,640
Are there any stories with Akin
that you wanna share with us?

361
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,680
So, we shot a scene—

362
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,120
and what Akin did really stuck with me.

363
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,400
I'll never forget it.

364
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,840
I had to cry,

365
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,200
but I just couldn't do it.

366
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,000
Akin came up to me.

367
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,120
He said "you're not breathing properly,"

368
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,040
then,

369
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,400
he did this.

370
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,640
You there.

371
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,440
What's your name?

372
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,120
Akin.

373
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,640
You're not breathing properly.

374
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,280
Focus…

375
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,160
and look into my eyes.

376
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,800
Breathe slowly,

377
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,800
follow my lead.

378
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,240
Whoa, viewers!

379
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,720
Akin followed Jin just now!

380
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,560
What the—

381
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,640
Never knew random comments
could have such an effect on you.

382
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,360
So you do have a soft side, Akin.

383
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,560
What just happened?

384
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,120
What have I done?!

385
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,440
So, what's the takeaway, dear viewers?

386
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,240
Remember, anything can happen
on a special night like tonight.

387
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,480
Midnight Matter has been lucky
to have Jin with us.

388
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,240
Let's give him a big round of applause!

389
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,360
I want to take a photo for the thumbnail..

390
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,480
Sure thing.

391
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,000
I'll just make room for you.

392
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,400
- But you'll be in it too!
- Oh yeah, okay.

393
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,840
Alright, 5, 4, 3, 2.

394
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,960
- Midnight Matter, bye!
- Bye.

395
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,440
This wooden boy.

396
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,800
He's leveling up.

397
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,680
It's alright, Sine.

398
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,840
If they don't want to renew
the contract, that's fine by me.

399
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,240
I don't beg.

400
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,080
I've been representing
their brand for 3 years now.

401
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,680
If they want someone new,

402
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,200
they can go ahead and find one.

403
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,720
[Ad] "An unchanged perfection."

404
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,760
[Ad] "Berkey Original, always your go-to."

405
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,920
[Ad] "In a new world, change is everything."

406
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,760
[Ad] "Robin Coffee, a better brew for you."

407
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,000
What's this nonsense?!

408
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,120
[Ad] "...a better brew for you."

409
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,520
Luck's still on my side.

410
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,400
Never mind.

411
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,720
No drinks for me.

412
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,480
[Jin] "Today I'm picking up my new car."

413
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,480
Show-off!

414
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,600
[Jin] "I've put up a poll.
Please help me decide which one to get!"

415
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,960
[Jin] "Don't forget to vote, I know you're watching~"

416
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:32,680
Whoops.

417
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,080
[Jin] "Do you like green?"

418
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,880
[Akin] "Not really."

419
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,160
[Jin] "How come you voted green then?"

420
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,840
[Akin] "That wasn't on purpose."

421
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,280
[Jin] "If you could choose properly,"

422
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,560
"what color would you pick?"

423
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,240
I'm not telling.

424
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,360
If I had to guess,

425
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,240
it's white, right?

426
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,800
So basic.

427
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,560
So... sand?

428
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,360
This kid!

429
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,720
Sand is nice.

430
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,720
When I wrap up getting the car,

431
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,120
I'll come pick you up right away.

432
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,920
Did I ask you to pick me up?

433
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,720
You chose the color for me,

434
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,320
I thought you should be the
first to see the car.

435
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,480
Don't act like
I'm the only one who voted.

436
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,800
Where are you now?

437
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,040
Are all clout-chasing celebs dumb?

438
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,440
Akin, P' Akin.

439
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,680
Akin!

440
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,560
HelloOoO?

441
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,440
Urghh

442
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,720
So annoying.

443
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,040
I was just asking where you're at.

444
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,720
A park near my house.

445
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,800
My schedule's free today,
so I'm out for a walk.

446
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,560
The park with the vending machines

447
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,760
selling your favorite chocolate milk?

448
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,480
How does he know?

449
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,520
"Are you a stalker?"

450
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,080
"Hey, where did you go?"

451
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:20,280
(Jin: Sorry, I got a last-minute work call from Ford.)

452
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,280
(Jin: Looks like I can't make it today.)

453
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,080
He comes and goes as he pleases.

454
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,560
(UNFOLLOW)

455
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,840
Hello.

456
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,160
[Jade] "Hello yourself.
Why do you sound annoyed?"

457
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,480
It's nothing. Why did you call?

458
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,560
[Jade] "Are you fee tomorrow? Let's meet."

459
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,400
[Jade] "There's this project
I think you'd be perfect for."

460
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,960
[Jade] "We can talk details later
to see if you're down to join."

461
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,280
Of course I'm down to join.
Why wouldn't I be?

462
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,400
[Jade] It's about your co-star.

463
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,280
Just like Akin's face when he's on set.

464
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,600
Wonder if he likes sweets.

465
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,280
It's Akin!

466
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,480
And that's me!
