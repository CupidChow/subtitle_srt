1
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,200
This is the first time...

2
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,000
That I've kissed someone like this.

3
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,000
Not because it's
required by the character.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,680
Or playing a role.

5
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,800
But it's the first time...

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,920
That I've kissed someone...

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,640
As myself.

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,720
As Akin.

9
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,440
Once morning comes...

10
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,440
Everything will probably be over.

11
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,600
Just like every time
the director calls 'cut'...

12
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,520
Then all the actors
will discard the roles...

13
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,560
that they've been playing.

14
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,240
It has always been that way.

15
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,960
When I wake up...

16
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,680
Everything...

17
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,720
...will disappear.

18
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:52,299
No fever.

19
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,080
You're awake?

20
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,480
Kin, you don't have any fever.

21
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,440
Are you hungry?

22
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,920
I feel like I don't have
a fever anymore either.

23
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,280
Must be good medicine.

24
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,760
Give me your hand.

25
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,480
Be my boyfriend, okay?

26
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,560
Idiot!

27
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,480
Since that day,

28
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,920
you've

29
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,720
always been...

30
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,160
always been my little sharky.

31
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,400
He acts as stiff as a rock.

32
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,120
I think

33
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,280
he's trying.

34
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,920
It's his first project, after all.

35
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,160
The series

36
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,440
focuses more on the couple chemistry.

37
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,040
This pairing has decent chemistry.

38
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,440
It's understandable
for a first project.

39
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,760
But acting like this—

40
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,600
He's not putting in enough effort.

41
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,480
At the very least,

42
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,320
can he say the dialogue
with real emotions?

43
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,080
Like this—

44
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,120
Since that day,

45
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,880
you've

46
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,600
been my little puppy.

47
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,360
You recall it
after watching just once?

48
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,520
Because I'm Akin.

49
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,920
Then I'm your little puppy.

50
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,120
Woof woof.

51
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,800
There, that's the North Star.

52
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,680
Kin,

53
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,840
if you had to compare the North
Star to someone in your life,

54
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,920
who would it be?

55
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,160
I won't tell you.

56
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,880
But for me,

57
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,800
it's you, Kin.

58
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,960
Because you,

59
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,720
are like the light in my life.

60
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,720
You're the one

61
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,840
who guided me here.

62
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,320
And...

63
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,240
What about us?

64
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,280
Have you made up your mind yet?

65
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,760
I already told you.

66
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,480
Go win the Best New
Actor award first.

67
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,800
I'll definitely win it
this year.

68
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,440
Keep gloating.

69
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,920
Hey, Kin,

70
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,920
tomorrow ‘The Sexiest Man'
award will be announced.

71
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,760
I think you will
definitely get first place.

72
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,360
And what if you get first place?

73
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,360
Whatever happens,

74
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,000
you're always first

75
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,120
in my heart.

76
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,480
Personally, I just want to be

77
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,800
your sexiest guy.

78
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,040
Hold on, let me try again.

79
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,280
Is this right?

80
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,360
Isn't it okay?

81
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,800
- Yes, but can I try again?
- No.

82
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,120
(Number 1 Akin - 170,902 Votes)
(Number 2 Jin - 170,740 Votes)

83
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,360
Jin.

84
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,440
Congratulations,
go ahead and sit down.

85
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,640
You don't know yet, do you?

86
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,560
The Sexiest Man.

87
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,400
Yay, yay!

88
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Congratulations!

89
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,800
Thank you, thank you everyone.

90
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,480
Thank you so much, thank you.

91
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,600
Yay, yay!

92
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,240
This is the first time Akin has
received the "Most Huggable Man" award

93
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,120
for 2017.

94
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,120
How do you feel about this award?

95
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,080
I'm always happy
with every award I receive.

96
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,560
I feel like this is

97
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,240
a reminder of

98
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,720
all the hard work I've put in.

99
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,560
And it is like another step

100
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,880
towards reaching my greater goals.

101
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,600
Akin is about to say that

102
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,960
the "The Sexiest Man" award is

103
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,960
just the first step.

104
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,880
Then, what is the next,
greater step for Akin?

105
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,720
I am an actor.

106
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
I want to be,

107
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,320
the best actor in the world.

108
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,160
Why do you want to be
the best in the world?

109
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,560
It sounds so grand.

110
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,240
I have my grandmother as my idol.

111
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,200
Akin.

112
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,600
Akin.

113
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,400
My grandmother

114
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,680
always told me that

115
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,440
people often compare actors

116
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,800
to stars.

117
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,400
Because no matter where they are,

118
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,200
they shine brightly,

119
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
standing out

120
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,520
like stars in the night sky.

121
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,520
But those stars

122
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,600
also lose their shine,

123
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,800
break apart,

124
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,320
and fade away into space.

125
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,440
Sexiest Man! Sexiest Man!

126
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,080
So, I've

127
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,680
never really

128
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,640
wanted to be called a star.

129
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,360
This

130
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,880
serves as a reminder for me

131
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,000
not to get lost in momentary success

132
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,040
that may come into my life.

133
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,120
Being called 'The Sexiest Man'
is truly amazing,

134
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,120
but I don't want to think that

135
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,520
this is the peak of my career.

136
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,840
Because next year,

137
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,600
this title might not
be mine anymore.

138
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,920
Even if next year

139
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,880
I don't get
‘The Sexiest Man' title,

140
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,480
or I come in fifth or tenth place,

141
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,120
or not ranked at all.

142
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,360
The role of the lead actor,
the 'Sexiest Man' title,

143
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,560
might not last long.

144
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,400
But my acting

145
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,400
will stay forever.

146
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,960
And here is Akin, everyone,
please give him a round of applause.

147
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,040
A major change in the Thai
entertainment industry has arrived.

148
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,040
When the rising star, Jin,

149
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,280
claims the title of
'The Sexiest Man

150
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,160
of the Year 2022' officially.

151
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,000
Hey, baby.

152
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,360
Let me have it first.

153
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,480
Oh, it's the real deal.

154
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,920
Jin,

155
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,280
did you really get first place?

156
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,200
Wow, unbelievable.

157
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,480
Has Touch heard about this yet?

158
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,880
Five-time consecutive winner,

159
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,280
- and now Jin has taken the title?
- It's time for a change of era.

160
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,520
- Jin is really strong.
- Sigma really did it this year.

161
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
- Unbelievable.
- I accept defeat.

162
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,520
Is Akin's reign coming to an end?

163
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,000
What's up, Na-Cha?

164
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,400
(Na-Cha: Mr. Jade.)

165
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,720
(Na-Cha: Sigma wanted Jin backed for an interview.)

166
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
I think it's good too.

167
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,440
Then let's use this opportunity
to promote the series.

168
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,760
(Na-Cha: They only wanted Jin.)

169
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,680
Tell Sigma to maintain their cool.

170
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,800
There will be no
one-on-one interviews.

171
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,600
I'll handle the entire
promotion plan myself.

172
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,240
(Na-Cha: Got it sir.)

173
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,840
(Ning: In today's press conference, I think)

174
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,120
(Ning: the reporters will
definitely focus on you.)

175
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,160
Don't worry about it.

176
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,640
This is nothing.
I've got it covered.

177
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,440
I understand how you feel, Akin.

178
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,240
But don't worry.

179
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,600
No matter what happens,

180
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,080
the team and I

181
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,080
will always stand by your side.

182
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,600
Thank you, Ning.

183
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,480
First of all,
I'd like to congratulate Jin.

184
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,040
For being The Sexiest Man of the year.

185
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,960
Thank you.

186
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,920
Thank you, thank you.

187
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,840
And this is your first year
getting it, how do you feel?

188
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,840
I feel really happy and excited.

189
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,920
This is like my first award

190
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,560
as an actor.

191
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,880
I feel very honored

192
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,680
and really excited.

193
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,320
I'd like to thank everyone

194
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,000
who voted for me. Thank you so much.

195
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,800
Please make way, please make way.

196
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,840
Then, may I interview Akin as well?

197
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
Akin?

198
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,440
After holding The Sexiest Man
title for five years,

199
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,640
you've had to give it up today
to Jin. How do you feel?

200
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,200
Are you sad?

201
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,680
Please answer.

202
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,640
How do you feel?

203
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,080
First of all,

204
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,760
I would like to congratulate Jin.

205
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,480
From his work last year,

206
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,120
he truly deserves this title.

207
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,360
You're good too, it's okay.

208
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
Akin, does this not
disappoint you at all?

209
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,480
Disappoint?

210
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,480
I've been number
one for long enough.

211
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,520
Now that this year,
I've changed my position,

212
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,000
the view isn't bad at all.

213
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,920
Does it mean that
you have stepped aside for Jin?

214
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
And have you had
a conversation with Jin?

215
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,560
- You two aren't fighting off-camera, right?
- Exactly.

216
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,800
Please answer.

217
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,400
Akin, after passing
the torch to Jin,

218
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,920
do you want to say anything to him?

219
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,800
Do you want to say something?

220
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,480
Passing the torch?
What are you talking about?

221
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,720
Me and Akin were

222
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,520
only a few hundred votes apart.

223
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,000
Right?

224
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,240
For me, I think this year

225
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,640
we both shared the first place.

226
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,080
Sharing the crown?

227
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,080
Yes.

228
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,200
Speaking of the crown.

229
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,440
Take the crown, then.

230
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,440
And what about you, Akin?

231
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,080
I agree with Jin.

232
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,560
As for the question earlier,

233
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,800
I don't plan to pass
the torch to anyone.

234
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,440
Congratulations.

235
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,360
On being this year's The Sexiest Man.

236
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,760
But if you're not careful,

237
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,360
next year,
I'll take it back for sure.

238
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
Is this a challenge for the title?

239
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,360
Come on.

240
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,000
Let's do the interview
about the drama instead.

241
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,720
Sure.

242
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,680
I bought it for you.

243
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,440
Thank you.

244
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,400
The magazine N-ASH.

245
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,320
They want you guys
to be on the latest cover.

246
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,880
I'm fine with it.

247
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,200
I'm fine too.

248
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,680
Good.

249
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,680
It's probably because
your series is trending.

250
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,400
People online are
making a fuss about it.

251
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,920
And also,

252
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,840
you did a great job managing the press.

253
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,360
Akin?

254
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,280
Are you okay?

255
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,000
Oh.

256
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,960
It's fine.

257
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,000
Our series is doing better too.

258
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,000
Are you sure?

259
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,360
Yeah, of course.

260
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,560
Stop asking too many questions.

261
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,080
Hey.

262
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,520
When is tomorrow's appointment with N-ASH?

263
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,840
We're scheduled for 7 AM.

264
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,480
Okay, I'll go rest then.

265
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,800
Finally.

266
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,640
We've reached the end of this long journey.

267
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,560
Jin, the number one, Sexiest Man.

268
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,800
Congratulations.

269
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
Thank you, Ford.

270
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,600
Thank you to everyone.

271
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,600
Thank you to the Sigma team.

272
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,160
Thank you, Touch.

273
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,360
And thank you to Mildy as well.

274
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,080
If it weren't for everyone here,

275
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,440
I wouldn't have won this award.

276
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,800
Thank you, everyone.

277
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,840
Great job.

278
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,400
But I want to warn you
with good intentions.

279
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,880
As someone who has been
working here for a long time,

280
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,160
I want you to

281
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,600
keep your distance
from Akin a bit more.

282
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,640
I know that you like Akin.

283
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,760
And I understand that

284
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,720
there are fans who are shipping

285
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
the both of you.

286
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,280
But, but if everyone starts
associating you, a superstar,

287
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,200
with being LGBT,

288
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,440
it's not wrong, of course.

289
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,800
But the range of work you can receive

290
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,040
will no longer be as broad.

291
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,200
Jin.

292
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,720
You're no longer just
a small-time actor.

293
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,320
You've come so far now.

294
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,840
And Sigma believes

295
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,720
that you can go
even further than this.

296
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,920
Let's toast.

297
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,480
Please have makeup
touch up his face.

298
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,080
Please wait here while we move
to the close up.

299
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,320
Dab his face please, dab it.

300
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,720
Once it's dabbed,
get out of the frame.

301
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,240
Come on, clear the frame.

302
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,320
Wait for Meaw to come up.

303
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,360
The picture turned out good.

304
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,440
You two don't have to worry.

305
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,280
I'm watching over it.

306
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,040
The concept this year
doesn't look boring, huh?

307
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,640
The viewers will definitely like it.

308
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,160
Thank you.

309
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,320
Thank you.

310
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,240
Kin.

311
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,520
- I have something I want to talk about.
- Not right now.

312
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,240
- But I really want to talk...
- I'm working right now.

313
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,080
Sorry.

314
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,280
Can we both smoke for the closeup?

315
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,000
The Photographer wants a shot of smoking.

316
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,640
Hold on...

317
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,840
What was agreed upon

318
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,320
they aren't required to smoke.

319
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,040
And usually,
Akin doesn't smoke either.

320
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,320
I understand.

321
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,720
But the photographer requested it.

322
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,320
It can't be done.

323
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,040
I'm ready now.

324
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,480
We can continue shooting.

325
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,280
Normally, you don't smoke,
so why would you smoke ...?

326
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,640
Both you and I

327
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,280
have a work to do.

328
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,560
Please sit together.

329
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,760
Look at the camera.

330
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,640
Both of you, heads close
together for a moment.

331
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,480
Akin, are you okay?

332
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,440
Akin, are you okay?

333
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,520
What do you want to talk about?

334
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,280
Hurry up and say it.

335
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,600
I don't have that
much free time for you.

336
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,640
Is your next project

337
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,000
a stage play?

338
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,560
How did you know?

339
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,720
Because the lead actor
of this stage play is

340
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,960
with Sigma,

341
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,840
that's why I know about it.

342
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
It's a pity though.

343
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,440
I should have auditioned for this,

344
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,400
but I got caught up with
the shoot with Judy first.

345
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,560
It's good to be
acting with Judy.

346
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,520
She's both beautiful

347
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,040
and talented,

348
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,520
and her image is great.

349
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,160
Every actor wants to

350
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,120
work with Judy.

351
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,040
The downside is that

352
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,960
we might not see each
other for a while after this.

353
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,000
What do you want to say?

354
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,760
Hurry up and say it.

355
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,200
I just want to be sure

356
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,880
about your feelings.

357
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,680
Right now I'm scared.

358
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,440
I'm scared that
after this series wraps up,

359
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,880
we might not see
each other again like before.

360
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,160
It had to be that way.

361
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,120
You might be new to this,

362
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,360
so you

363
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,920
still can't separate
the feelings of the character

364
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,600
from reality.

365
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,920
But don't worry.

366
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,200
After we go our separate ways,

367
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,200
you'll eventually forget about it.

368
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,600
If you feel that way,

369
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,040
then please

370
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,320
just tell me to my face.

371
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,720
Tell me that you don't like me.

372
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,120
Once you say those words,

373
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,800
I'll leave you.

374
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,760
Seriously?

375
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,320
Why do people expect
so much from me?

376
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,440
Including you.

377
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,720
I don't know.

378
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,960
I don't know why I can't do it.

379
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,080
I don't know

380
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,080
if I really

381
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,880
like you.

382
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,200
When you asked me
to do something like that,

383
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,880
I really couldn't.

384
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,920
I'm sorry

385
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,160
for being distant

386
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,000
since the day
I found out the results.

387
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,880
At first,

388
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,600
I thought I would get it,

389
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,120
but the result turned out like this.

390
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,160
I really couldn't take it.

391
00:32:02,258 --> 00:32:03,250
I'm sorry.

392
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,880
I'm sorry.

393
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,040
I'm sorry,

394
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,960
I've been too worried
about our relationship.

395
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,440
I'm happy that

396
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,960
you finally shared your feelings.

397
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,200
Listen, Kin,

398
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,960
from now on,
you're not alone anymore.

399
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,480
Do you know?

400
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,680
Since the day I won
“The Sexiest Man" award,

401
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,680
I've never stopped acting.

402
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,520
But today,

403
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,520
I feel like

404
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,480
I am truly myself.

405
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,720
It's good.

406
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,160
Be careful not to fall.

407
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,960
Wow.

408
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,280
So beautiful.

409
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,480
Take it.

410
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,120
It's not just beautiful.

411
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,800
So cute.

412
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,400
This is a gift,

413
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,720
as a token of our promise.

414
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,040
If the day comes,
when I win that award,

415
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,080
and our feelings are still the same,

416
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,600
let's be together.

417
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,480
What? I didn't hear you.

418
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,040
What did you say?

419
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,000
Sure.

420
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,840
What?

421
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,680
Sure.

422
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,080
Happy now?

423
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,640
Wow.

424
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,840
That is lot of stars.

425
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,280
- That.
- Huh?

426
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,480
Is that the North Star?

427
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,280
Oh,

428
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,360
did you really recognize it?

429
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,760
Well,

430
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,680
everyone has to develop, right?

431
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,040
Hey, Kin.

432
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,440
That night,

433
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,680
you never told me

434
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,920
who your North Star is.

435
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,880
It's a woman.

436
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,320
She's beautiful.

437
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,240
Warm.

438
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,640
I'm here today

439
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,440
because of her.

440
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,760
Hey.

441
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,960
She is my grandmother.

442
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,400
Your grandmother?

443
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,720
Yeah.

444
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,840
Thank you.

445
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,640
(My grandson is the cutest in the world)

446
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,360
I want Sun to

447
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,160
grow up

448
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,600
to be a good actor.

449
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,880
I know you can do it.

450
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,320
Can I hug you

451
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,080
one last time?

452
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,920
I won't get to see you again.

453
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,320
I'm sorry.

454
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,440
I have to go now.

455
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,960
Thank you.

456
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,520
Thank you.

457
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,440
Thank you.

458
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,440
Well, when you have some free time,

459
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,520
take me to visit your grandma.

460
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,680
Sure.

461
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,240
If there's a chance,

462
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,960
I'll take you to visit her.

463
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,000
Promise?

464
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,640
You have promised.

465
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:50,960
I know.

466
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,240
Okay, let's go soon.

467
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:29,120
Hello. What's up, Mr. Big Time Producer?

468
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,240
You had to call me?

469
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,400
Haven't heard from you in a while.

470
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,360
Can't I hear your voice?

471
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,960
My...

472
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,320
...Bunny.

473
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,280
Can you come back
and make a song for me?

474
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,200
A song?

475
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,840
What song?

476
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,960
The song for
the series I'm working on.

477
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,280
Hello?

478
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,320
Lit?

479
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,920
Are you still listening?

480
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,640
When's good for you?

481
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,560
The earliest you are available?

482
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,040
You want to see me, huh?

483
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,400
That's good,

484
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,200
we can finally talk about us.

485
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,200
Just kidding.

486
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,200
Anyway...

487
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,560
I'll go book
my flight back first.

488
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,600
See you soon.

489
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,760
Bye Bye.
