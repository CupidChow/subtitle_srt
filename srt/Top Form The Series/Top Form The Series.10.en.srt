(This series is fictional not

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,480
You're quite the troublemaker.

6
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,680
Did you really say that on the show?

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,160
How did you even come up with that?

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,920
If it weren't for
Jade's recommendation,

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,200
I would have been in trouble too.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,040
I knew it.

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,400
Jade seems really
concerned about you.

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,040
He has known me for a long time.

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,200
I'm jealous of him.

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,760
But now...

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,680
I have you.

16
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,480
(Foremost)

17
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,120
Akin,

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,640
are you writing a letter?

19
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,160
You're awake?

20
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,160
Yeah, I am.

21
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,000
Hey,

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,320
the ring I gave you...

23
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,120
where is it?

24
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,600
Did you lose it?

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,360
I wouldn't lose
something that important.

26
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,320
Here.

27
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,040
What did you do to the rings?

28
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,040
Look closely.

29
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,440
I...

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,040
Here.

31
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,880
See?

32
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,040
Inside, I had it engraved with...

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,080
Mi Tesoro.

34
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,640
Give me your hand.

35
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,760
As for its meaning...

36
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,120
I'd rather not tell you.

37
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,920
Give me your hand.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,160
By the way...

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,600
How did you know my ring size?

40
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,000
Because I'm good.

41
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,400
Don't tell me...

42
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,680
You measured it from...

43
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,000
You!

44
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,280
Are you crazy?

45
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,800
You pervert!

46
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,320
Right...?

47
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,000
No way!

48
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,120
Who would measure from that?

49
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,840
I just...

50
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,000
hold your hand a lot.

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
So I figured out your size.

52
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,920
You're such a creep.

53
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,600
What?

54
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,880
I meant your toe size.

55
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,480
Where was your dirty mind going?

56
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,080
You're the one with the dirty mind.

57
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,320
Oh yeah?

58
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,760
What were you thinking about?

59
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,120
Hello, Mama.

60
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,440
What?

61
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
What happened?

62
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,640
Jin...

63
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,080
Grandma...

64
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,200
Akin.

65
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,840
To my beloved Grandma Maria,

66
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,360
Grandma,

67
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,160
I'm sorry for disappearing
for so long this time.

68
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,760
So much

69
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,920
has happened lately.

70
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,560
I don't even know

71
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,480
how to begin telling you about it.

72
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,560
Because during that time,

73
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,120
everything felt so surreal.

74
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,240
Being hurt...

75
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,840
by someone
who claimed to love me.

76
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,560
Being condemned...

77
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,000
until I had no place to stand.

78
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,160
Everything came
crashing down on me.

79
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,680
Until...

80
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,600
I almost did something foolish.

81
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,560
And nearly lost everything.

82
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,840
But in the end,

83
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,000
I made it through.

84
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,440
Because of Jin.

85
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,880
I once thought of giving up.

86
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,480
I had already let go of him.

87
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,080
But suddenly,

88
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,600
memories from
my childhood flooded my mind.

89
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,160
I remembered a moment—

90
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,800
you reading
Derek Jarman's book to me.

91
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,920
(If yes, give me a wink.)

92
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,760
I barely recall anything from it,

93
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,000
except for one short line:

94
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,560
"Close the book...

95
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,320
and go love."

96
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,320
I never truly
understood what it meant.

97
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,680
Until the day...

98
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
I met Jin.

99
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,840
That wooden boy...

100
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,160
turned my life upside down,

101
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,440
made me
lose myself for a while.

102
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,800
But despite all that,

103
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,520
I found myself
deeply attached to him.

104
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,520
I wanted to take a chance on him,

105
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,280
without caring about anything else.

106
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,400
Because of just one phrase—

107
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,480
"go choose love".

108
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,040
That one line alone.

109
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,440
Grandma,

110
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,600
one day, I'll bring
this guy to meet you.

111
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,160
At this time of year,

112
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,880
the Tree Jasmine at home
must all be in full bloom.

113
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,960
Take care of yourself.

114
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,960
=EPISODE 10=
=FLOWERS AND TEARS=

115
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,560
Grandma left a letter for you.

116
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,800
(To Akin and your beloved.
Open only when you are together.)

117
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,240
Please give it to Akin.

118
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,600
Alright.

119
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,040
Akin,

120
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,800
it's a letter from Grandma.

121
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,360
She wanted you to have it.

122
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,480
I think...

123
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,600
I don't want to read it just yet.

124
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,840
Akin, do you like stars?

125
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,280
I had a dream.

126
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,520
When I was a kid,

127
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,240
I wanted to be a star.

128
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,840
Why is that?

129
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,440
Do you know...

130
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,040
when Grandma found out

131
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,960
that I loved stars,

132
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,920
she decorated everything with them.

133
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,440
It's beautiful.

134
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,760
(To Akin and your beloved.
Open only when together.)

135
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,280
When you're ready,

136
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,640
let's read it together.

137
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,480
Let's go see Grandma.

138
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,760
You're here.

139
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,040
Akin.

140
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,000
Grandma.

141
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,560
Come, sit down.

142
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,280
Shall we have some tea first?

143
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,000
Have some tea first.

144
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,000
Thank you.

145
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,960
This tea is very delicious.

146
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,800
Yes.

147
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,400
So, this is...

148
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,320
the person Akin told me about.

149
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,840
That's right.

150
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,280
Your name is Jin, isn't it?

151
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,560
Yes.

152
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,960
Grandma, you even know my name?

153
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,600
Akin, are you happy now?

154
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,720
He is very happy.

155
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,440
Especially...

156
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,440
when I'm by his side.

157
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,440
Akin has quite the eye for people.

158
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,080
So, the two of you...

159
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,160
first met on a drama set, right?

160
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,800
Yes.

161
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,280
Back then, Kin...

162
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,200
stared at me without blinking.

163
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I thought...

164
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,080
he was interested
in something about me.

165
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,040
But no—

166
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,080
he was actually watching
to see if I acted well or not.

167
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,920
Oh dear.

168
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,960
Oh, and—

169
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,960
he even graded me,
giving me a score.

170
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,040
Really?

171
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,760
That's terrible.

172
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,240
Jin, you must have been
under so much pressure.

173
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,480
Yes, Grandma.

174
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,800
Poor Jin.

175
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,560
Oh, come on, Grandma!

176
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,680
Why are you feeling
sorry for this guy?

177
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,760
If you had seen
how he acted at first...

178
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,680
he was stiffer than a wooden plank.

179
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,120
Look at the way you're talking.

180
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,800
Oh dear.

181
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,480
Jin, you must have
endured a lot with Kin, huh?

182
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,920
Yes, Grandma.

183
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,560
Kin was really strict.

184
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,400
I

185
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,360
barely dared to move.

186
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,960
You two are like
a perfect pair, huh?

187
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,520
Oh?

188
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,760
Why don't you
try it first, dear?

189
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,360
Before it gets cold.

190
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,360
Mmm.

191
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,760
It's delicious.

192
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,600
Is it?

193
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,480
Yes, it is.

194
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,480
I think…

195
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,720
Jin, you're

196
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,720
just like
Kin when he was a kid.

197
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,840
Did you know?

198
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,920
You're radiant,

199
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,040
full of energy.

200
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,000
Oh, not that much, Grandma.

201
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,040
It's true.

202
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,240
You have to

203
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,840
take good care of that, dear.

204
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,480
Okay?

205
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,600
Alright.

206
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,480
Because that brilliance—

207
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,800
It's yours alone.

208
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,600
No one can ever take it from you.

209
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,440
Yes.

210
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,360
I want to thank you, Jin—

211
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,720
For at least

212
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,200
reassuring me...

213
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,120
that Akin…

214
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,840
has truly grown into a great actor.

215
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,280
Grandma.

216
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,640
Yes, dear?

217
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,480
I'm sorry.

218
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,320
For not visiting at all.

219
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,080
That's alright, sweetheart.

220
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,600
Didn't I tell you?

221
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,440
Driving all those
hours just to see me—

222
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,560
It's better to spend
that time rehearsing.

223
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,840
Akin…

224
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,720
Everyone has the same

225
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,480
amount of time, that's true.

226
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,200
But I want to be sure—

227
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,040
that my grandson…

228
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,480
is truly making
the most of that time…

229
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,440
So that you can
shine your brightest.

230
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,240
Give it your all

231
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,160
in your own way.

232
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,640
So that I'll always
be able to see you,

233
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,040
Akin

234
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,280
all the time, my dear.

235
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,320
No…

236
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,000
no tears.

237
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,920
No crying.

238
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,000
Come now, come give me a hug.

239
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,520
Come here, sweetheart.

240
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,440
You're all grown up now,

241
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,680
you know that?

242
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,640
I'm so proud of you, Akin.

243
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,040
No tears, okay?

244
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,200
I love you, Akin.

245
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,120
Jin… can I have a hug too?

246
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,760
Come to Grandma.

247
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,960
I love you both so much.

248
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,520
Keep loving each other, no matter what.

249
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,800
Akin…

250
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,080
Bad dream?

251
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,520
It was a beautiful one.

252
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
Akin,

253
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,840
make sure to come back in
time for Grandma's service, okay?

254
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,160
Yes, Mom.

255
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,960
Where are we going now?

256
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,920
You'll know when we get there.

257
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,520
Come on.

258
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,240
Jun.

259
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,240
Hmm?

260
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,760
Did you see the theater
poster at Grandma's house?

261
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,400
Yes, I saw it.

262
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,640
"Flower and Tear."

263
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,440
That play was

264
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,960
the reason

265
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,600
I told Grandma that

266
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,920
I wanted to try being an actor.

267
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,640
Really?

268
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,840
Yeah.

269
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,800
I want to watch it.

270
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,040
Can we find it online,
or did you record it, Akin?

271
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,640
I don't think so.

272
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,880
Because Grandma

273
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,240
wrote and performed

274
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,000
that play herself.

275
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,640
She did it when I was still young.

276
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,880
A long time ago.

277
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
I don't think anyone recorded it.

278
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,560
What a shame.

279
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,960
It must have been
such a wonderful story.

280
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,920
I've

281
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,320
always wanted to
perform in that play myself.

282
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,400
Umm.

283
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,720
But back then,
I was too young.

284
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,240
And now

285
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,640
that I'm old enough,

286
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,320
Grandma got sick.

287
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,680
Here, this is the place.

288
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,760
This is where

289
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,640
I meant to bring you.

290
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,600
This place

291
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
used to be a very famous theater.

292
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,680
The plays that Grandma performed,

293
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,800
they were staged here.

294
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,040
But it's such a shame

295
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,320
that a place like
this had to shut down.

296
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,560
With the economy,

297
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,880
and people,

298
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,480
who, day by day,

299
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,840
value this kind of
performance less and less.

300
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,120
Jun.

301
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,440
I dreamed about Grandma last night.

302
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,840
And in the dream,

303
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,760
you were there too.

304
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,640
But even though it was just a dream,

305
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,440
it was such a beautiful one.

306
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,440
Grandma even said that

307
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,120
you were

308
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,120
much like me when I was young.

309
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,200
Okay.

310
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,920
Sorry, Jun.

311
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,320
I'm sorry I didn't take you
to see Grandma in time.

312
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,960
It's alright.

313
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,160
Then, I'll just take it as

314
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,160
she secretly told me

315
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,240
to go and see her instead.

316
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,080
To Akin

317
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,160
and your beloved.

318
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,760
Open only when you are together.

319
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,400
I think

320
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,040
I'm ready now.

321
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,600
(To Akin and your beloved.
Open only when you are together.)

322
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,240
(To Akin and your beloved.
Open only when you are together.)

323
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,880
To Akin

324
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,040
and Akin's young lover.

325
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,960
Hi.

326
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,920
Actually,

327
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,360
I wanted to see Akin

328
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,360
bring your partner
to visit me in person.

329
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,240
But unfortunately,

330
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,120
I don't think I'll be able
to wait until that day.

331
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,320
It's time for me to
embark on a long journey.

332
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,320
But Akin doesn't need to worry.

333
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,560
This will be the most peaceful

334
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,720
and exciting journey for me.

335
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,480
I probably won't be back
to visit Akin for a long time.

336
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,120
But Akin doesn't
have to rush to visit me.

337
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,160
Live life to the fullest,

338
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,160
and don't regret anything just yet.

339
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,080
And we'll meet again someday.

340
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,120
So,

341
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,440
This isn't my last letter

342
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,320
it's just a vacation
letter from me.

343
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,920
I'm packing my bag now.

344
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,000
I've prepared everything already.

345
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,480
But before I leave,

346
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,520
there's something I want to ask you
and your partner to remember.

347
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,120
For my funeral,

348
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,480
don't make it too
extravagant like a stage play.

349
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,280
Make it as simple as possible,

350
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,640
and spend time with those
staying behind.

351
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,360
As for Jin,

352
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,920
please take care of Akin.

353
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,440
If there's a day when he eats
a whole big cake by himself.

354
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,320
Please stop him.

355
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,440
But if you can't stop him,

356
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,080
then at least eat with him.

357
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,680
Akin has

358
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,200
a habit of pretending
to be strong, just like me.

359
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,120
So,

360
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,840
please hug him

361
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,160
and listen to him often, Jin.

362
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,280
That's all I'm worried about.

363
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,640
Oh,

364
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,200
and one more thing, Akin,

365
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,640
the bookshelf on
the top floor of my room

366
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,920
has a script that

367
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,720
I left intentionally for you,

368
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,960
as the last gift.

369
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,160
Grandma.

370
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,920
Safe travels.

371
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,960
I've

372
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,680
been thinking for a long time,

373
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,240
about what I should leave behind.

374
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,760
But when I think about it,

375
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,200
I've already given
you the best thing

376
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,120
in this world.

377
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,560
That thing is…

378
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,480
Akin.

379
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,640
I'm so happy,

380
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,760
to have watched you
grow up so well, Akin.

381
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,840
Akin, Akin.

382
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,320
Bye-bye.

383
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,000
You're the Akin
that I'm so proud of

384
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,240
in this world.

385
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,080
And all those beautiful stories,

386
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,160
they are all in this script.

387
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,280
But it's also a stage play,

388
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,280
one of the ones I love the most.

389
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,720
Finally,

390
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,720
if Akin misses me and can't bear it,

391
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,800
just hug yourself tight.

392
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,720
Love yourself a lot.

393
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,960
Because Akin,

394
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,720
you are the best thing
I left on this world.

395
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,800
Right now, fans are really
worried about you, Akin.

396
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,200
Is there anything you
want to say to them?

397
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,640
Thank you for everyone's support.

398
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,960
After this event,

399
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,040
I will find some time

400
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,080
to work on a project

401
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,000
dedicated to my grandmother.

402
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,720
Can you share

403
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,080
what the project is about?

404
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,080
It's about the stage play.

405
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,880
Sigma's here!

406
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,320
Take pictures,

407
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,280
take pictures!

408
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,880
How did they get here?

409
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,600
Please make way for him.

410
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,600
Please make way.

411
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,040
This camera.

412
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,760
Jin,

413
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,800
you're here!

414
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,480
I haven't seen you in days.

415
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,320
I called, why didn't you pick up?

416
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,640
I was worried.

417
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,800
How did you all get here?

418
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,400
Hey.

419
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,200
The work that we postponed earlier,

420
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,400
- the clients started following up now.
- Touch.

421
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,880
I think now is not the right
time to talk about work.

422
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,680
But this can't be
postponed any longer.

423
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,360
This one.

424
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
How did you get here, boss?

425
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,200
Why wouldn't I be able to come?

426
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,560
We're in the same industry.

427
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,480
We've worked together many times.

428
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,520
Especially on a day like this,

429
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,040
I wanted to come and
pay my respects to her.

430
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,240
Are you okay?

431
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,920
Akin,

432
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,800
everything is

433
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,640
in here.

434
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,040
Thanks a lot, Sine.

435
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,440
Jin,

436
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,720
please take care of Akin for me.

437
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,240
I will.

438
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,960
(Blue Derek Jarman)

439
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,480
(Flower And Tear)

440
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,840
(Flower And Tear
Maria Theatre)

441
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,520
You and I are just
the same, aren't we?

442
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,840
You once said you
wanted to become an actor

443
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,360
because of this very play.

444
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,440
As for me,

445
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,800
the reason I decided
to stay in this industry

446
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,680
was also because of this play.

447
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,400
Hey,

448
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,400
to honor Grandma,

449
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,440
I want to make
a film based on this script.

450
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,040
Can I?

451
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,840
Of course.

452
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,400
I'll take care of it.

453
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,880
Thank you so much

454
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,080
for always being by my side.

455
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,120
Just make sure it's good.

456
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,040
You know it.

457
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,680
I'm Akin, after all.

458
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,720
Kin! Kin!

459
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,880
Are you here, Kin?

460
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,720
Kin!

461
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,120
Come help me here.

462
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,520
Can you help contact and
buy the rights to Maria's work?

463
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,720
Flower And Tear.

464
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,200
(Flower And Tear)

465
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,920
Right now, your fans are
really worried about you, Akin.

466
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,320
Is there anything
you'd like to say to them?

467
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,840
Thank you everyone for your support.

468
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,920
Once I finish this project,

469
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,280
I'll take some time
to work on something

470
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,080
in dedication to my grandma.

471
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,840
Can you tell us

472
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,160
what kind of project it is?

473
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,240
It's related to theater.

474
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,000
Regarding the rights
to "Flower And Tear"

475
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,280
"Grandma's garden of flowers".

476
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,400
I want to purchase
the exclusive rights.

477
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,720
As for the money,

478
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,440
I have no limit.

479
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,880
And if anyone comes

480
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,360
asking to buy it after this,

481
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,920
just tell them:

482
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,680
Sigma already bought it.

483
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,040
Are you trying to tie your
eyebrows into a bow or something?

484
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,280
Are you stressed out
about the script?

485
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,640
I tried writing a scene…

486
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,480
but I just can't figure out
Grandma's dialogue.

487
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,240
Hey,

488
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,400
can you help me finish the scene?

489
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,000
Here.

490
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,120
You'll play Sun, okay?

491
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,080
Umm.

492
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,200
And I'll be Grandma.

493
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,400
Okay.

494
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,640
Does “forever”
really exist, Grandma?

495
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,560
What do you think, Sun?

496
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,520
Do you believe it's real?

497
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,440
The way you say it, Grandma…

498
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,320
It sounds like it's not real.

499
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,800
Well, if you already
knew the answer…

500
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,240
then why ask me?

501
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,840
Because…

502
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,880
I want you to stay
with me forever, Grandma.

503
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,400
Grandma,

504
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,080
will you stay with me forever?

505
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,040
You're getting

506
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,720
better and better every day.

507
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,840
Are you planning to take
my job soon or what?

508
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,640
No way.

509
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,600
Hold on a sec.

510
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,880
Let me take a call
from Mildy real quick.

511
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,000
Hello, Mildy.

512
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,280
Is something wrong?

513
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,400
What's going on with Jin?

514
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,680
Why hasn't he shown up for work?

515
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,760
Did Touch tell you?

516
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,480
I already told him

517
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,160
I want to take a break right now.

518
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,440
Jin,

519
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,240
I really don't want to get involved
in your personal matters…

520
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,400
but what you're doing is

521
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,760
causing problems
for him, you know.

522
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,320
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
asked me to call you like this.

523
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,200
You're not a no-name actor
like you were two years ago.

524
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,320
Now you're number one.

525
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,160
Don't let your personal issues
ruin your professional life.

526
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,720
You can't do that, dear.

527
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,080
Understood.

528
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,080
I'll head back tomorrow.

529
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,520
How's it going?

530
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,760
I'll go start the car.

531
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,200
As for the unfinished script,

532
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,200
perhaps it's just waiting
for Akin to finally complete it.

533
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,440
Kin,

534
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,000
we're home.

535
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,720
Let's head upstairs.

536
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,840
Hey,

537
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,840
go take a shower, okay?

538
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,680
Tomorrow,

539
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,000
I've got a ton of lines
I need your help with.

540
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,400
Got it.

541
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,200
I promise

542
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,000
I'll do my best.

543
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,600
But do you know, Kin,

544
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,040
this little team member right here…

545
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,600
also needs a little love and
support to keep breathing.

546
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,880
Now's not the time to be sweet.

547
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,800
Right this second,

548
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,520
my script is
the most important thing.

549
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,800
I'm running the show this time.

550
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,520
I'm serious, okay?

551
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,840
I'll give you a thousand.

552
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,200
You little trickster.

553
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,440
Let's go upstairs.

554
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,120
Hello, Jade?

555
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:35,920
What?

556
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:41,920
What's going on?

557
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,000
Following the entertainment
industry's loss of Maria,

558
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,200
a veteran actress

559
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,080
also known as young
actor Akin's grandmother.

560
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,480
There has been an overwhelming
wave of grief across the industry.

561
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,200
Sigma Corporation has

562
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,520
just announced plans to revive one
of Maria's most iconic stage plays,

563
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:58,880
"Flower And Tear".

564
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,640
What does this mean, Jade?

565
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,360
From what I found when tracing
the rights for Flower And Tear,

566
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,040
"Grandma's garden of flowers"

567
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
as soon as Maria passed away,

568
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,960
Sigma swooped in and bought up
the rights to all her works

569
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,320
from every theatre company
that originally held them.

570
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,120
That's just disrespectful.

571
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,280
Who does that?

572
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,840
Racing to buy up a grandmother's legacy
right out from under her grandson?

573
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,960
They clearly planned this.

574
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,160
They knew exactly how
to hit Akin where it hurts.

575
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,480
They even cast Hong Tē specifically

576
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,880
and replaced the original
cast with all new rookie actors.

577
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,240
There's no way they're
following the original script.

578
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,240
Is there any way

579
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,520
we can buy the rights back?

580
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,160
Well,

581
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,720
there's only one option.

582
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,160
We have to negotiate with them.

583
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,960
But judging from
the situation right now,

584
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,240
even if we get down on
our knees and beg them

585
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,000
- there's no way they'll give it back.
- I'll do it.

586
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,800
Even if I have to beg on my knees,

587
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,680
I'll do it.

588
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,480
=TOP FORM=

589
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,560
Give us a tip on watering plants,
Mr. Sexiest Man.

590
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,080
Akin?

591
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,800
I want to water them too.

592
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,280
Can I do it?

593
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,440
– No.
– Just a little?

594
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,680
I want to hold the camera.

595
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,560
– Stop.
– It's getting wet!

596
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,200
– Let me water some.
– No.

597
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,240
Hey!

598
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,400
Hey!

599
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,560
I can't be the only one getting wet!

600
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,840
Alright, alright!
Everything's soaked now!

601
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,120
I'm sorry.
