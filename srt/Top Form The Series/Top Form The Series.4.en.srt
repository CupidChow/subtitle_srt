1
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,400
Hey!

2
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,360
Wooden Boy!

3
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,200
Where is this place?

4
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,720
This is my apartment.

5
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,680
Your apartment?

6
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,560
Then...

7
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,680
how did I end up here?

8
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,360
Well, you were drunk last night,
so I brought you here.

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,960
Me? Drunk?

10
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,640
Wait a minute...

11
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,200
What did you just call me?

12
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,960
"Kin", of course.

13
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,680
Who...

14
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,120
gave you permission
to call me that!?

15
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,040
You did!

16
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,600
Me?

17
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,480
Yep.

18
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,400
I'm not...

19
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,920
What?

20
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,960
What the heck are you filming!?

21
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,320
I'm filming you!

22
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,160
Don't post it on Instagram,

23
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,640
or I'll block you

24
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,320
for sure,

25
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,240
Jun!

26
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,920
What's Jun? My name is Jin.

27
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,280
Jun.

28
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,440
Jin.

29
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,000
- Jun.
- My name is Jin.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,840
- Jun.
- Jin.

31
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,160
Jun! Jun!

32
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,320
But it's okay to call me that.
It's kind of cute.

33
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,240
Jin.

34
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,440
You can stop recording now.

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,840
Wow.

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,320
Now you say my name correctly, huh?

37
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,680
Let me tell you something.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,080
You—

39
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,160
Don't get too full of yourself.

40
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,880
The only reason
I followed you on IG—

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,120
I tapped the wrong
button, that's all.

42
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,200
I'm not interested
in you or anything.

43
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,200
Then if you're not
interested in me...

44
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,840
Why do you keep checking my stories?

45
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,400
Kin?

46
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,520
I'm not checking them.

47
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,440
Just now—

48
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,440
How did you just casually
call me by my nickname?

49
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,600
Are we that close?

50
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,800
And what if I want
to be closer to you?

51
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,160
Is that not allowed?

52
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,760
Well.

53
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,000
Alright then.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll buy the rights for a thousand.

55
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,840
Fame-hungry actor!

56
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,840
You think just
this amount of money...

57
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,080
Can buy me?

58
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,840
Can't it?

59
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,680
Sure, it can.

60
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,800
Hey, hey!

61
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,880
♪You make me become someone...♪

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,440
♪Who's farsighted...♪

63
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,400
Kin! Kin!

64
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,240
What?

65
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,160
What if I want to ask for more?

66
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,560
Of course!

67
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,040
You believe me now?

68
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,760
So, what did you ask for?

69
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,440
What do you think...

70
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,080
I asked for?

71
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,920
You already know.

72
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Wait, wait—what did you ask for?
Don't tell me—

73
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,720
I didn't ask for anything.

74
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,720
Last night, after you got the money—

75
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,760
You just kept laughing.

76
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,520
I never even asked for anything yet.

77
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,400
If you didn't ask for anything...

78
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,240
Then—

79
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,080
Where are my clothes?

80
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,840
Last night, I carried you back
from the bar, right?

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,840
You threw up.

82
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,400
It's okay.

83
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,600
Come here.

84
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,360
Stand up straight first.

85
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,120
Me? Throw up?

86
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,320
Yeah, your shirt was
completely ruined.

87
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,840
Then where are your clothes?

88
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,240
Well, you threw up on me too.

89
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,760
Oh, really?

90
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,600
Isn't this your room?

91
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,600
Yeah.

92
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,760
Couldn't find your wardrobe?

93
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,560
Well, last night...

94
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,760
You held onto me all night.

95
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,720
I couldn't move at all.

96
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,800
Don't try to weasel
your way out.

97
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,600
Oh—

98
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,000
So you and those Sigma guys...

99
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,720
Planned to blackmail me, didn't you?

100
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,440
Sorry, what?

101
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,040
Don't play dumb.

102
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,120
So this is what you were planning...

103
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,840
You were trying to
blackmail me, weren't you?

104
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,640
We'll get him drunk
and then blackmail him.

105
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,840
Come on, Akin, drink more!

106
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,680
Akin, you're doing great!

107
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,000
Finish this whole glass!

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,840
Of course, newbie! At my level—

109
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,960
How many more glasses left?

110
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,440
Bring me another one!

111
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,960
You were planning to get me drunk...

112
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,280
And secretly film me, right?

113
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,200
Is that what this is all about?

114
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,600
You've got the wrong idea here.

115
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,920
How am I wrong?

116
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,320
Well, this...

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,840
This...

118
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,400
And this...

119
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,560
It's getting out of hand now.

120
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,120
What do you want from me?

121
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,720
Just tell me,

122
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,240
I'll do anything for you.

123
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,360
As long as you delete the video.

124
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,360
You'll do anything?

125
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,400
Yes.

126
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,080
I'll do anything for you.

127
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,960
Really?

128
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,400
Really.

129
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
Then...

130
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,840
Can I hug you just once?

131
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,960
Huh?

132
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,880
I said,

133
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,120
"Can I hug you, Kinn, just once?"

134
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,160
I'm not drinking ever again.

135
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,920
(delete, cancel)

136
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,920
(While waiting for your shirt
to be sent for washing)

137
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,440
(You can wear my shirt for now.)

138
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Kin.

139
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,400
Akin.

140
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,320
Are you hungry?

141
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,560
At first, I planned to eat
together in front of the TV.

142
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,640
But now we're running late.

143
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
You can eat in my car.

144
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
It's okay.

145
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,200
I'll have Sine come
pick me up instead.

146
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,400
I've been talking to
him since last night.

147
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,360
"You need to come to
the set with me today.

148
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,960
Come quickly, okay?

149
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,800
Huh?

150
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,800
Hello, Kin, what's up?

151
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,680
Hello, Sine.

152
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,360
Why didn't you come to pick me up?

153
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,920
I can't hear very well here.

154
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,360
Did you leave me behind?

155
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,440
Sine!

156
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,320
Akin!

157
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,640
Don't forget to eat it.

158
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,040
You look really good
dressed like that.

159
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,400
I almost forgot
you're wearing my clothes.

160
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,200
By the way...

161
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,600
Here.

162
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,520
You didn't delete
the video completely.

163
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,680
You filmed so much.

164
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,760
How could I delete all of it?

165
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,600
Will you delete it?

166
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,240
If you want to delete it, go ahead.

167
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,280
Delete it then.

168
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,760
Go ahead and delete it.

169
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,120
I won't delete it.

170
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,760
Hey, don't post it anywhere!

171
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,760
If the video leaks,

172
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,320
I'll sue you for sure.

173
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,720
I won't let it leak.

174
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,520
I'm just keeping it for myself.

175
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,760
Yeah, Akin.

176
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,000
Last night, I gave you
another thousand.

177
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,640
I haven't asked for anything yet.

178
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,560
Can I ask now?

179
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,240
What else?

180
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,880
After today's shoot,
can I drive you home?

181
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,480
Is that okay?

182
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,760
Can I?

183
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,320
Please?

184
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,400
I don't know.

185
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,880
Consider it agreed.

186
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,040
A cunning person like you is

187
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,000
waiting for the opportunity

188
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,400
to steal the scripture
from me, isn't it?

189
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,080
Master Yi Chen.

190
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,720
About last night,

191
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,040
I have explained.

192
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,880
It was you

193
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,600
who got drunk,

194
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,040
vomited, and left
the scripture at the brothel.

195
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,080
I didn't want to
defeat you, Master Yi Chen.

196
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
In my life,

197
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,640
I have only one goal.

198
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,160
It is to be close to you.

199
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,240
My heart tells me that.

200
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,040
Please,

201
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,360
let me follow you

202
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,800
and take care of you.

203
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,360
It is up to your heart.

204
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,560
Cut.

205
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,560
Good, passed.

206
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,760
You all performed very well.
Great job.

207
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,400
Good, good.

208
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,840
Akin, wait for me.

209
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,040
Really, he seems to
have improved his acting.

210
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,040
Yes.

211
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,400
I wonder if you briefed
him about something.

212
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,760
That could be why
he played so well.

213
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,000
Look carefully. I think

214
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,920
the chemistry is seamless.

215
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,520
Flows naturally.

216
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,000
Let's go. We'll change the set.

217
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,040
Next set.

218
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,600
Okay, beautiful.

219
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,040
Hey,

220
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,440
Jin has one hour of break time.

221
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,080
Please have him do
a live with the fans.

222
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,040
Sure. I'll take care of it.

223
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,960
- Please take care of it.
- Okay.

224
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,840
- That was an amazing scene entry.
- Akin, do you know that

225
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,360
my heart almost
jumped out of my chest?

226
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,960
Jin,

227
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,040
it's time for the live with
the fans. Are you ready?

228
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,520
Ready.

229
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,360
Let's go.

230
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,600
Oh, Sine.

231
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,520
Would it be okay if I asked if Akin

232
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,640
could join Jin for the live opening?

233
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,640
It would only be for
less than five minutes.

234
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,600
Akin doesn't really
like doing live streams,

235
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,160
but let me ask him.

236
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,360
Is it okay, Akin?

237
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,520
Just for a moment, it'll be cute.

238
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,880
Hello everyone, hello.

239
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,200
Say hi.

240
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,520
Hello.

241
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,760
Right now,
everyone is here with Jin.

242
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,640
I'm on the set of
The Legend of Gemini.

243
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,200
And we can't miss

244
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,360
today's topic, Jin is with Akin.

245
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,240
Wave and say hi to the fans.

246
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,280
Hello.

247
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,160
Uh... Let me try reading
some comments.

248
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,400
Everyone, please be patient.

249
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,680
I can't read fast enough.

250
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,040
Someone mentioned Akin here.

251
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,880
Let's have a look.

252
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,680
"If I ask for..." Ask for what?

253
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,600
It's gone now.

254
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,000
I couldn't read it in time.

255
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,800
Uh… Let me check.

256
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,080
Here it is!

257
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,800
"If I try to chase Akin
for 21 days straight,"

258
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,880
"would I succeed?"

259
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,600
Why 21 days?

260
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,120
Is it some kind of belief?

261
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,480
No, Akin,

262
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,640
it's the 21-day theory.

263
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,800
Have you heard of it?

264
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,400
It goes like this—

265
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,480
this theory says that

266
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,120
if we do something
continuously for 21 days,

267
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,400
it will become part
of our daily routine.

268
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,240
If we apply it to love,

269
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,960
it means that if we pursue someone

270
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,320
for 21 days straight,

271
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,840
there's a chance
we'll win them over.

272
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,040
Like that.

273
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,160
Oh, I see.

274
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,560
So, could I?

275
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,480
I mean ‘could they’,
for the fan who asked.

276
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,440
If you can do it,

277
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,200
give it a try.

278
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,880
Today's great—we finished early.

279
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,800
No traffic either.

280
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,400
I'll update you tonight.

281
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,680
Got it.

282
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,440
Oh, and don't forget, Akin—

283
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,280
tomorrow 10 AM.

284
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,560
Hi.

285
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,160
(Day 1)

286
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,640
Akin, actually,

287
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,320
my child has been sick lately.

288
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,240
I don't have much time
to pick up and drop off you.

289
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,840
Jin, can you look after him for me?

290
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,680
Of course.

291
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,280
Sine!

292
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,040
Make yourself comfortable.

293
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,040
I had this seat
custom-made just for you.

294
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,360
And the chocolate milk—
you can have it.

295
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,280
I'll drive you.

296
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,720
No need, I can
do it myself. Gosh!

297
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,320
(Day two)

298
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,160
There's shade over there.

299
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,480
What's so hot about it?

300
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,360
Just drive, Wooden Boy.

301
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,520
Are you shy of me?

302
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,320
What's there to be shy about?

303
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,360
I'm just afraid
someone might see us.

304
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,120
Who would see us?

305
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,920
What are you doing?

306
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,400
(Day four)

307
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,840
We've arrived at the set.

308
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,680
Do you want to eat?

309
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,000
(Day eight)

310
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,520
The delight of ending the workday.

311
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,320
My finger hurts.

312
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,200
What's wrong with your finger?

313
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,040
Can you take a look? It hurts.

314
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,840
Look closely, please.

315
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,760
I don't see anything wrong. Oh!

316
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,240
You idiot.

317
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,080
What are you doing?

318
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,560
Ow, my finger hurts.

319
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,480
It hurts, huh?

320
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,840
Yeah, it hurts.

321
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,800
This one really hurts.

322
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,400
(Day 16)

323
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,600
You must help me.

324
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,120
You need to finish everything
before the sun sets today.

325
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,560
By today.

326
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,440
Okay.

327
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,520
You must help me.

328
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,320
You need to finish
everything before the sun sets.

329
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
By today.

330
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,520
But, don't use the word "by" —

331
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,320
just TODAY!

332
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,160
How about ‘today’, are you free?

333
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,600
You!

334
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,560
- Okay.
- Alright, let's go home.

335
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,840
Let's continue at home.

336
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,000
You must help me.

337
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,760
Here, Akin, go change your clothes.

338
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,720
Okay.

339
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,320
Hey.

340
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,840
Are you alright, dear?

341
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,800
What startled you?

342
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,280
It's just that I…

343
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,920
I saw…

344
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,920
A gecko.

345
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,000
Alright, be careful,
it might bite you.

346
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,520
If anything happens,
you can tell me, okay?

347
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,800
Okay.

348
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,520
(Sorry.)

349
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,920
(For scaring you.)

350
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,120
(Today is)

351
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,000
(the 20th.)

352
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,320
(Have you softened up)

353
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,600
(for me yet?)

354
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,400
(If not…)

355
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,640
Are you done, dear?

356
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,760
Uh, just a second.

357
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
(If not…)

358
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,920
(It's okay.)

359
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,640
(It's okay.)

360
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,560
(I can wait.)

361
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,040
(I can wait.)

362
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,800
(For you.)

363
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,720
(I can wait for)

364
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,200
(as long as it takes.)

365
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,440
(But can I ask for...)

366
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,400
(...one thing?)

367
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
(Can I call you...)

368
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,640
(Can I call you)

369
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,280
(Kin &lt;3)

370
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,040
(Is that okay?)

371
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,200
(Please, Kin.)

372
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,520
(If it's okay.)

373
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,840
(Then just wink once.)

374
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,880
Kin.

375
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,640
(Say it again, I dare you.)

376
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,120
Kin.

377
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,360
(Day 21)

378
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,120
Thank you.

379
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,560
Thank you.

380
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,120
What's going on?

381
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
You're smiling a lot!

382
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,920
It's a secret.

383
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,280
Do you want to know?

384
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,400
It's a secret.

385
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,920
Jin.

386
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,200
Jin, don't leave yet.

387
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,680
Don't leave yet.

388
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,520
I just remembered that

389
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,920
we have a live stream
with the fans today.

390
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,480
Fans asked for it.

391
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,320
So, I squeezed in some time
for the live stream today.

392
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,560
Just for an hour.

393
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,920
Not long at all.

394
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,480
Okay?

395
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,440
Alright.

396
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,480
Alright?

397
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,480
Okay.

398
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,800
Then, I'll go live.

399
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,680
Akin, can you wait a bit?

400
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,800
Akin.

401
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,760
Akin, can you join
the live with Jin?

402
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
The fans will probably love it

403
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,200
seeing the two of you together.

404
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,120
Akin probably doesn't
like going live, right?

405
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,920
Just a little bit.

406
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,040
Just a moment, just a moment.

407
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,320
Okay.

408
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
Alright.

409
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,040
Just keep it joyful!

410
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,240
Just a moment, okay?

411
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,440
Just a moment, really.

412
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,280
Oh, the fans will be so happy!

413
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,160
Ready, ready, let's go!

414
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,200
One, two, three!

415
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,880
Hello, everyone! Hello!

416
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,480
We've got people joining already!

417
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,600
Wave your hands, please!

418
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,760
Hello, everyone!

419
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,080
I've been waiting for so long!

420
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,480
Touch, what does that comment say?

421
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,520
They're asking
if you have a partner,

422
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,080
what would you call them?

423
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,440
I haven't figured it out yet.

424
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,560
Let Akin answer first.

425
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,080
I'd say "babe" or "baby".

426
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,120
What do you think, babe?

427
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,760
Wow!

428
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,080
Just like a couple!

429
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,520
Wow, everyone's shipping!
They're shipping so hard!

430
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,480
Oh no! Wow, so many
people are sending gifts!

431
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,160
Thank you so much!

432
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,800
You really look like a couple!

433
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,840
Everyone, Akin has to
go back to work now.

434
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,920
Let's all say goodbye to Akin.

435
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,560
Wait a sec, wait a sec!

436
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,160
Some fans are asking if you
can sing a song together. Please?

437
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,920
Just a quick one.
Come on, a short one!

438
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,960
You make me become...

439
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,760
Uh, let's save it for
another time, everyone.

440
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,560
Please, please!

441
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,160
I'm going now. See you!

442
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,040
Akin.

443
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,800
What's wrong, Akin?

444
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,480
Why are you fidgeting like that?

445
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,280
No, Sine.

446
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,080
I'm just not comfortable sitting.

447
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,600
Did you do something
with the car?

448
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,960
No, I didn't.

449
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,200
But don't you usually
go back with Jin?

450
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,880
What's wrong?

451
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,240
What're you talking about?

452
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,160
You're speaking like me and that
Woodblock are actually a couple.

453
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,760
Akin...

454
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,600
If there's something,
hurry up and sort it out.

455
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,240
There's no shooting
tomorrow either.

456
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,560
If you leave it for too long, it will just
drag on even more. Do you understand?

457
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,400
I had this seat
custom-made just for you.

458
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,800
And the chocolate milk—
you can have it.

459
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,240
What are you looking for?

460
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,800
Nothing.

461
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,920
You're kind of weird.

462
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,840
We'll be shooting this scene.

463
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,200
- Alright.
- No worries.

464
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask me.

465
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,480
Sorry.

466
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,920
I need a little focus.

467
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,440
Um...

468
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,720
Jin, put on your shoes first.

469
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,440
Oh, okay.

470
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,600
You can change here.

471
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,080
Got it thank you.

472
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,440
Have you eaten yet?

473
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,320
Jin.

474
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,400
Could you drop me off?

475
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,720
I can't today.

476
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,440
I came with Ford.

477
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,680
Let's go, Jin.

478
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,920
I'll take Jin first.
He has an urgent task.

479
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,120
I shouldn't have let him
pick me up in the first place.

480
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,560
Just walking out of the live stream.

481
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,880
Is it really necessary
to get this upset?

482
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,560
Kin has to apologize, right?

483
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,720
(Seems like an A hole in person)

I'll send the information over.

Jin and Akin,

492
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,560
make them the number one couple.

493
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,400
Make people go crazy over it.

494
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,840
Good.

495
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,000
You owe me again, Akin.

Today, I think...

505
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,560
The love life of Aries
during this period requires,

506
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,840
paying attention to each other's feelings.

507
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:48,440
Try to observe how the other person feels.

508
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,680
If you want to make them happy,
try using a lucky charm.

509
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,760
Like honey to add some
sweetness to your relationship.

510
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,840
Been very busy lately?

511
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,120
Just a little bit.

512
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,280
And you?

513
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,280
Very!

514
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,360
Why are you avoiding me?

515
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,280
I'm not avoiding you.

516
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,960
I'm just focusing on driving.

517
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,560
You're focusing on driving

518
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,960
even when you're
stuck at a red light?

519
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,240
You still have to be
cautious at a red light.

520
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,920
Do you want a candy?

521
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,880
It's green now.

522
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,520
We've arrived, Kin.

523
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,400
Hey, Wooden Boy.

524
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,880
Come up and talk in my room.

525
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,320
No, I'd better not because...

526
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,160
Kin.

527
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,280
Kin.

528
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,600
Kin.

529
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,280
I think it's better to do it later.

530
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,760
Now!

531
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,640
Do you understand?

532
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,000
I think I'll head back first.

533
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,120
Why are you in such a rush to leave?

534
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,440
Okay.

535
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,600
You're intentionally
avoiding me, aren't you?

536
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,760
I never thought
of avoiding you.

537
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,640
I just...

538
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,800
Akin.

539
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,440
Calm down.

540
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,040
Why?

541
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,080
Weren't you the one
who wanted to hug earlier?

542
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,880
Why is it only you

543
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,840
who always does things your way?

544
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,800
Can't you let me
do things my way?

545
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,200
Just once.

546
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,360
Just once would be good enough.

547
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,240
I'm actually having a cold.

548
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,600
Huh?

549
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:50,880
I have a cold.

550
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,160
I told the director
and Ford already.

551
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,080
But they said there's
no time to reschedule.

552
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,200
Because the show needs to air.

553
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,320
The best I could do

554
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,600
was switch my scene with yours.

555
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,160
So I had to take strong medicine

556
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,320
to make sure I could work.

557
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,880
And...

558
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,840
the reason I distanced
myself from you...

559
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,280
Because I didn't want you
to catch my cold.

560
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,520
And the reason I didn't
tell you directly...

561
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,720
Is because I didn't
want you to worry.

562
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,000
You idiot.

563
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,440
I thought you hated me already.

564
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,080
How could I hate you?

565
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,840
Drink.

566
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,640
Thank you.

567
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,200
Wait.

568
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,040
Drink it all, you'll feel better.

569
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,480
I thought you

570
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,000
hated me.

571
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,400
I like you, Kin.

572
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,880
Even if others say things about you.

573
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,160
I'll never hate you.

574
00:45:05,644 --> 00:45:06,434
Come on.

575
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,120
You wanted a hug, right?

576
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,440
Come here.
