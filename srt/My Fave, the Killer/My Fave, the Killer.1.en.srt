(Sakamoto) A serial murder case?

112
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:15,621
The method is very similar to the case I was in charge of in Tokyo.

113
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:19,416
The murder weapon is an ax, targeting a young woman.

It won't hurt that much if you stay still.

00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,727
(Takamiya Rui) What happened?

139
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:07,691
Maybe your boyfriend?

140
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:20,412
(Rui Takamiya) I had a bruise on my upper arm during the live show a week ago.

141
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,956
It happened again.

A violent man is the worst →

145

I don't know what will happen if I say I want to break up with you.

It's okay, don't worry.→

149

I'll solve it myself.

150
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,085
I'll try and talk it over with my boyfriend.

151
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:15,217
(Rui Takamiya) Shall I join you when we talk?

152
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,888
>> No, that's right. I'm fine on my own.

153
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,308
(Rui Takamiya) Yes.

154
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:30,816
>> Don't tell anyone about this.

155
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,736
Especially... (Rui Takamiya) I won't tell Thelma.

>>Thank you.

157

If Thelma found out about this, she'd be really angry.

``I can't even think about dating a man.'' ``I'm not prepared enough.''

It's okay to talk about idols, but at least more than me →

(Thelma) Mr. Doi took the day off today. (Rui Takamiya) Yeah.

The president doesn't care about that. (Haura) Ah!
