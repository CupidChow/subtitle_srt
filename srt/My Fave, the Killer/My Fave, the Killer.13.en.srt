(3 people) I want to do it.

6
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:41,936
(Michiru Komaba) I'm sorry, but I decided to quit Babysta.

7
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,271
(Thelma Hayakawa) Huh? What are you talking about?

8
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:47,233
(Michiru) To a producer I met recently――

9
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,109
I got scouted

10
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:50,903
“It’s a waste to be in the countryside”

11
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,989
“You can definitely succeed in Tokyo”

12
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,158
Tokyo?

13
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,577
(Michiru) Well, that's it.

14
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,539
Huh...wait, what about today's live?

15
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:04,041
I was planning to go out today, but...

16
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,378
I just got invited by that producer.

17
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:11,257
It's like having drinks with famous celebrities.

18
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,591
That's why I'm sorry

19
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:15,845
What, that's too irresponsible?

20
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,680
Isn't it good?

21
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:21,517
It's an underground idol's live show after all, right? It's also local

22
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,562
You should stop licking me too!

23
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,565
Thelma's Kansai dialect appeared

24
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:31,944
Thelma says she wants to move into Tokyo...

25
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,281
It seems like they are trying their best to use standard Japanese.

26
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,533
Frankly speaking, it's a waste.

27
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:41,495
Because it's definitely not possible for Babysta.

28
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:46,792
I mean, it's already over when Thelma is the center, right?

29
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,378
Well, that's it.

30
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,424
Did you properly inform the president and Mr. Doi?

31
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,509
(Michiru) Say something nice, then.

32
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:59,889
(Sound of door opening and closing)

33
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,186
(Thelma) Huh...

34
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,111
(Louis) When Michiru said she was quitting...

35
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,740
“This will be the end of Babysta,” I thought.

36
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,701
“Well then...”

37
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,370
that was my true feelings

38
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,668
What should I do today's live?

39
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:34,381
Of course, it's impossible for two people.

40
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:37,718
Is it canceled today?

41
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:39,178
(Louis) But...

42
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,221
(Thelma) That's not going to happen.

43
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,265
(Louis) Huh?

44
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,560
(Thelma) There are people who come to see Babysta.

45
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,064
Maybe just a few people

46
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,442
(Louis) Thelma…

47
00:03:56,779 --> 00:04:00,532
Is it okay to divide Michiru's solo part like this?

48
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:01,700
(Louis) Huh?

49
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:08,791
Yeah

50
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,004
Should we make it look like it's just the two of us when the three of us are together in the intro?

51
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,134
Yeah I think it's good

52
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,136
Is it okay?

53
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,140
(Louis) Thelma never gave up.

54
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:27,893
Isn't this how you pose at first?

55
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:29,395
(Louis) Oh, here? (Thelma) Yeah.

56
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,313
This is what it looks like now, right?

57
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:33,107
So back to back

58
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,316
(Louis) Ah...

59
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,151

60
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,862
Right here?

61
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,531
Ah, maybe it's okay, maybe it's okay

62
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,617
So as for the three people after that...

63
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,411
(Thelma) That's right (Louis) We'll do it together.

64
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,913
(humming)

65
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:49,832
(Louis) Then I'll pass by then. (Thelma) Yeah.

66
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,501
(Thelma) Because it was like this (Louis) Oh, yeah, yeah.

67
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,337
(Thelma) Shall we do it now? (Louis) Yeah yeah

00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,317
(Thelma) What should I change? (Louis) Hmm...

72
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,819
(knock sound)

73
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,032
(Azusa Doi) Thank you for your hard work (Louis) Thank you for your hard work

74
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:28,078
(Doi) I'm sorry for the end of the live show, but I have to report to you both.

75
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:41,175
It's sudden, but we have decided to add a new member.

76
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,137
(Thelma) What do you mean? I haven't heard anything.

77
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:48,140
(Doi) I'm sorry, but it has been decided at short notice.

78
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,607
(Izumi Sawakita) Sawakita... I'm Izumi...

79
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,819
thank you

80
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,530
(Thelma) Huh? Huh... I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

81
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:06,033
(Izumi) Ah... I'm sorry.

82
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,204
Sawakita... This is Izumi...

83
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,999
(Thelma) Your voice is so small! Huh... are you okay?

84
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,959
(Doi) Well, eventually

85
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,505
(Thelma) Huh...

86
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,345
(Doi) So...

87
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:30,432
(Thelma) What? Is there anything else?

88
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,561
(Doi) I'm going to use Izumi as the center...

89
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,271
The president...

90
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,944
(Louis) Please wait a moment.

91
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,198
Thelma has supported Bevista to this point.

92
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,283
Suddenly...

93
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,119
(Doi) I know that.

94
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:54,373
However, by changing the center, we renewed the image.

95
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:59,002
The president wants to sell it as a new Babysta...

96
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,714
(Louis) That's it...

97
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,846

98
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,682
