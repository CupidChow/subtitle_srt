Thank you for coming.

Hello, this is Saori Shindo.

61
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:17,891
First of all, I would like to ask you ➡

62
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:21,495
What is the most important thing for beauty?

63
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:25,832
The key is to not get stressed out.

64
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,669
Stress is not the best thing for your beauty.

65
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,904
So if you feel stressed ➡

66
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,440
What will you do? Haha.

67
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,108
It will be resolved immediately.

68
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,778
In my own way.

69
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,953
The costumes for the play party are the new mom's job.

Don't touch it.

78
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,919
The ribbon is in the wrong position.

79
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,322
The seams are rough too. I'll have to start over from scratch.

80
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,661

(Yuna) That's...

85
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,846
After all, I asked a professional to do it. Huh?

86
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:50,017
That's not true. Professional techniques.

87
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,085
But this➡

88
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:55,022

91
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,862
Shall I use it as a rag?

92
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,464

(Risako) Maybe I should wipe the bathroom floor as well.

96
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,314
(Aya) I agree.

97
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:22,416
(Emi) Maybe I should wipe your face.

98
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,652
(Risako) Failures are useful.

99
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,321
(Aya) It's really popular.

100
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,989
(Emi) I'll flush it down the toilet.

101
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,325
(Risako) It's eco-friendly.

102
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,827
(Aya) It's dirty.

That's impossible!

149
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:43,917
It's a custom-made item from a world-renowned pastry chef that I've been pre-ordering for a year.

150
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,754
It's not a whole cake that you can buy around there.

That's enough.

The birthday party is ruined.

168
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:04,031
Take Keita-kun and go home quickly.

169
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:11,371

00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:21,048
(Yukiko) I'm sure that birthday party will be held➡

172
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:24,818
The trigger for Yuna's suicide.

Clicking... (sound of tapping the keyboard)

174
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,193
Okay, I increased the resolution.

175
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,529
Now you can see every detail.

176
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,700

177
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,702
Don't you see it?

178
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:59,186
It's late, crispy.

179
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:02,322
(Yuna) Yes! i am coming.

180
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,625
(Inner voice) I don't want to see it.

181
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,861
But it's still here➡

182
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:12,099

Please look here.

202

You tripped Yuna and caused her to fall.

203
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:02,109
Why are you doing this?

204
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:04,478
Weren't you friends?

205
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:09,082
Easy, right?

206
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,652
All I have to do is make Yuna-chan fall.

207
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:13,353
You can do it, right?

208
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,690
No, but... I can do it.

209
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:22,196
Oh, I see, you don't know.

210
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:26,900
What does Yuna-chan say about you behind your back?

211
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,136
Huh? Haha.

212
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:35,309
I don't know if they are there or not...

(Yukiko) Saori-san is a monster.

220

Taking advantage of the malice that resides in people's hearts➡

221
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:19,820
It's a monster that does whatever it wants.

222
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:25,259
I sent this video to Yuna's mother➡

Is that you?

224
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,100
My daughter was killed.

Killed by my mom's friend.

(Yukiko) I am a weak and cunning person.➡

227

Instead of helping Yuna-san➡

228
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:45,312
I'm afraid of being bullied again➡

229
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:48,916
I was complicit in Yuna's bullying.

230

(Yukiko) Please tell Yuna's mother.

231

Grandma, was I wrong?

Should I have taken revenge on that person too?

It was Yuna's haunting.

That's not true.
