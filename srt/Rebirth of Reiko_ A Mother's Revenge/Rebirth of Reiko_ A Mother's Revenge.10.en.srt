(Akihiko) I don't remember much after that.

189

Ugh... From then on, I was scared every day.

204
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:25,252
I wonder if that person will tell Yuna.

205
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:31,625
(Akihiko) Well then➡

206
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:35,662
Tell yourself the truth➡

207
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,799
I wanted to sincerely apologize to Yuna.

208
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:43,070
(Yuna) ((I can't believe my dad came with me too➡

00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:00,187
I'm happy too, Akihiko-san, even though you're busy.))

213
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:04,958
((Okay, tonight I'll make something Akihiko-san likes.))

((Ah, Keita, I’m waiting.))

216
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:17,938
(Akihiko) But when I see Yuna's smile➡

217
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:22,242
Ugh... I just couldn't say it.

218
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:27,447
((Yuna｡ Ha ha...｡))

219
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:33,220
((Yuna-chan!)) (Risako)((Ugh…｡))

220
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:38,759
(Akihiko) I thought it was my fault.

221
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:46,633
(Akihiko) Ugh... Yuna jumped off➡

222
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:50,204
I think it's because I heard about that day.

223
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:57,978
I wanted to confirm that➡

224
00:17:57,978 --> 00:18:00,447
I decided to meet that person again.

225
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:04,852
((He came after all.))

I...

231
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:34,948
Yuna was being bullied by Saori Shindo.

232
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:41,955
Saori is probably angry at being abandoned by you➡

233
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,891
He bullied Yuna.

234
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:52,366
If you don't have a relationship with Saori➡

235
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:54,801
