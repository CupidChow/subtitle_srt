Ugh... why?

8
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,494
That's a lie, right? That you killed someone.

9
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:30,631
I was being made into a criminal.

＜The murder in the past➡

11
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:36,970
It was a false accusation orchestrated by Saori's husband, Mikihisa.

I have no motherhood at all➡

106

I wasn't suited to be a mother.➡

107
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:56,403
You did it because Saori asked you to do it, right?

108
00:08:56,403 --> 00:09:02,109
Even though she didn't listen to my request, she followed Saori's instructions.

109

Why do you think it was Saori-san's instructions?

At first I thought you did it all.

But Saori uses people to do what she wants without doing it herself➡

115
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,672
Because she's like a devil.

116
