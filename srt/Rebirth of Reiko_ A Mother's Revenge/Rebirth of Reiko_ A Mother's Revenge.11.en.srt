Aren't you no longer interested in us?

186
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,959
No, that's what I thought➡

187
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:30,597
After all, if there's no Saori material, it'll be boring and I'll probably die.

188
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:36,203
(Aya) Hey, you should definitely do it.

189
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:41,041
By all means, take revenge on that damn woman.

Yuna-chan's mom is there, right?

193
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:11,238
It's me. To get compensation for the birthday party➡

194
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:14,741
I introduced Yuna-chan to a part-time job.

00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,580
