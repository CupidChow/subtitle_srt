00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:04,545
Take everything from me➡

00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:07,548
Are you satisfied with this?

186
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:11,885
But whatever you do➡

187
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:14,888
Your daughter won't come back to life.

188
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:21,562
Why was it that kid?

189
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:26,800
Why did you keep cornering that kid?

190
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:33,240
Young, innocent and cute.

191
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:41,348
Even though I don't have any status, property, fame, etc.

192
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:47,688
He was smiling with the happiest face in the world.

193
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:50,924
So that smile➡

194
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:54,361
I thought I'd destroy it.

No way➡

196
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,801
I never thought he would take his own life.

00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:13,046
You're the idiot.

198
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:17,551
Yuna didn't take her own life.

Huh? No matter how much I get bullied➡

200
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:24,224
Yuna didn't give in to you.

201
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:31,398
I wanted to leave this town and start a new life.

202
00:15:34,835 --> 00:15:39,673
You tried to take everything away from that child.

203
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:44,511
But you couldn't take it away.

204
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,682
