00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,908
(Narration Reiko/Reiko) <My beloved daughter falls from the balcony of her home.>

2
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:09,843
<He took his own life.>

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,012
Ah~! Ugh...

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,680
<The reason is.>

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,349
(Voice changer's voice) My mom's friend killed me.

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,919
<I was bullied by my mom friends at kindergarten.>

7
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:24,024
<All my happiness has been taken away.>

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,427
<I am reborn and take care of my neighbor's child➡

9
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,830
I infiltrated the kindergarten as a mother.>

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,266
Please call me Sora-kun Mama.

11
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:33,934
Open your eyes.

12
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:36,436
(Emi) Who the hell are you?

13
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:39,072
<Those who took away something important➡

14
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:41,975
I will never forgive you.>

15
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,644
Squeak!

16
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:48,815
Huh? This apartment belongs to that woman.

17
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,722
Hey, what happened?

18
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,892
(Saori) Heaven's punishment has fallen on the mischievous woman.

19
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,462
Huh? ``Jeju's Sparkling Examination War''.

20
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,832
Haven't you seen it? I... I'm sorry.

21
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,502
I finished episode 16 yesterday.

22
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,470
Distribution just started the day before yesterday, right?

23
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,674
I couldn't stop. Especially at the Gamjatang store...

24
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,342
Spoilers are a death sentence.

25
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,211
I would like to talk more with Saori.

26
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,446
I'm about to confess. Ah...

27
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,015
(Inner voice) They look alike.

28
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,684
Hurry up. (Aya) Really...｡

29
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,019
Register now and make it your favorite.

30
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,523
See you soon~

31
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:31,358
Now, please excuse me.

32
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:33,527
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

33
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:36,029
Hey, Sora-kun mom. Yes.

34
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,998
Do you have some time after this?

35
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:40,801
Masato also said he wanted to play with Sora-kun➡

36
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,469
Would you like some tea?

37
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,272
Yes, please. Then let's go to a coffee shop somewhere...

38
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,040
I don't feel comfortable at a coffee shop.

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,376
I want to go to your house.

40
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,378
Pingpon! (Sound of elevator arrival)

41
00:01:51,378 --> 00:02:11,331

42
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,000
(Reminiscence) Here it is.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,668
It's here.

44
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,905
(Risako) The room where that woman lived.

45
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,908
Such a coincidence...

46
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,010
There's no way that's the case.

47
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,846
(Risako) Huh? Please come up.

48
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:29,683
(Sky) Masato-kun, here, here.

49
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,351
I'll bother you.

50
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:38,025
♬～

51
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:40,160
<Welcome➡

52
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,865
The daughter whose life you took away➡

53
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,867
To my mother's house.＞

Ping pong!

58
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,232
Masato-kun answered all questions correctly. Amazing!

59
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:21,034
Sora-kun, do you want to try it too? Yeah!

60
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:26,974
The view from the balcony is nice➡

61
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:30,878
Even though it was a family-friendly property, the rent was very low.

62
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:36,517
Veranda...

63
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,690
Stop it!

64
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,792
Huh?

65
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,863
Ha... ah no.

66
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:52,032
(Masato) Sora-kun did well too.

67
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,034
(Sky) Yeah.

68
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,769
How about some honey?

69
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:58,539
(Risako) Ah, then.

70
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,419
Goho, goho, goho! OK?

71
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,022
Goho… yeah.

72
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:20,761
When feeding honey to children under 1 year old ➡

73
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,397
It can also be poisonous.

74
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:26,667
Some mothers don't even know that...

75
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,939
It's horrifying, isn't it?

76
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,743
Yes... right.

77
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:42,983
As I mentioned earlier, why is the rent so low➡

78
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,986
Have you asked a real estate agent?

79
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:48,455
yes.

80
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,791
It's an accident property.

81
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,528
It was the home of Yuna, who passed away.

82
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:58,432
She died from parenting neurosis.

83
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:01,802
That woman said something big.

84
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,905
Are you taking an exam?

85
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:08,475
Ah... I didn't plan on doing that.

86
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,377
Huh? Why?

87
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:13,213
That's what I was told at the cram school I went to for a trial the other day, right?

88
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:16,984
Keita-kun can aim for Koran Academy.

89
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,986
But➡

90
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,822
I want Keita to grow and grow.➡

91
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:26,927
Now, I want you to learn many things other than studying.

92
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:32,799
(Risako) I'm going home, Masato. (Yuna) Huh?

93
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,737
If you breathe the air in this room, you'll catch a fool.

94
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:41,575
I have to raise Masato to be an elite!

95
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,912
Ah, that...

96
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:47,447
(Risako) Even though you deny other people's educational policies➡

97
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,017
I would commit suicide with my children involved➡

98
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:54,588
That's stupid hahahaha➡

99
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,290
Hahahaha.

100
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,926
Educational policy was different➡

101
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:04,298
I can't believe you bullied Yuna like that.

102
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,633
(Risako) Hey, about this house➡

103
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,069
Did you really find out later?

104
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:12,806
You knew about that woman, didn't you?

105
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,474
no.

106
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,646
Yes, then do you know this story?

107
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,548
That woman abused the child➡

108
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,218
Her husband also became unloving and almost divorced her.

109
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,220
Afterwards, housewives are engaged in prostitution➡

110
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,121
There were rumors, too?

111
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:35,162
That was a terrible mother.

112
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,133
It seems like it had nothing to do with that woman.➡

113
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,236
If you are an acquaintance, if you say that much➡

114
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,171
You should say it back.

115
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:55,015
Yuna abused? It's impossible.

116
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:58,685
It's impossible, housewife prostitution. Don't come here again!

117
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,354
(Naruse) Wow!

118
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:02,022
Ah.

119
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:06,093
She's acting like an old lady when she gets angry and throws salt at her.

120
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:11,565
I'm sorry, but inside I'm an old lady.

121
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:14,134
Is that your mom friend from earlier?

122
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:17,638
Yuna-chan! Ugh...

123
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,308
(Risako) Ugh...

124
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,913
Yes, please eat a lot. Thank you.

125
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:29,249
Okay, yes.

126
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:32,319
Yes. Can I have it? Are you okay? Yeah, it's okay.

127
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,388
Yeah, let's go back to our seats. Yes.

128
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:37,391
Hello, Chairman.

129
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:41,328
Shindo-kun, how are you doing? Yes, thanks to you.

130
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:46,600
Hey, Sora-kun, you used to go to school here.

131
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,337
Yes, thank you for the other day.

132
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:53,473
See you again. See you then.

133
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:02,416
Are you acquainted with the chairman of Koran Academy?

134
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,518
The other day, we met at a children's diner.

135
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:08,155
Wow, that's amazing.

136
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,791
I hope you like the sky too.

137
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,860
(Risako) Is it true? ➡

138
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,462
Is it true that you know the president of Koran Academy?

139
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:18,565
Huh? Why you? Why!

140
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:21,568
what happened? Risako-san...

141
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,737
(Aya) Something is scary.

142
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:30,477
(Risako) When I heard about Koran Gakuen, I changed my eye color➡

143
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:33,914
You think I'm a stupid educational mom.

144
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:38,485
No. I understand how you feel.

145
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,822
Huh?

146
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:48,328
We want our children to learn in the best possible environment.

147
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:51,398
It's a natural thing to do as a parent.

148
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:59,873
It's all because I love Masato with all my heart, right?

149
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,749
Haha.

150
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:12,219
No one understands my feelings.

151
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:19,193
My husband also treats me like an educational mom who has an academic background complex.

152
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:25,365
I'm just doing my best for the right person.

153
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,771
That's right.

154
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:33,674
If I wasn't a single mother➡

155
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:36,944
I wanted to put Sora into Koran Academy.

156
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,617
You➡

157
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:48,589
Why do you understand my feelings so well?

158
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:52,426
We are mothers raising children.

159
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:59,399
If there's anything I can do to help, please let me know.

160
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:05,038
I will cooperate with anything.

161
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,244
Anything?

162
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,580
Anything.

163
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:20,854
Well then, about Masato as the chairman...

164
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,557
Huh?

165
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:27,661
No, it's nothing.

166
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:34,001
This is the judgment of last month's mock exam.➡

167
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:39,306
Given the current situation, it will be difficult for Masato to enter Koran Academy.

168
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,046
It's a beautiful gerbera. The language of flowers is...

169
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,714
Hope. Hope.

170
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:50,717
Haha. Hahahaha.

171
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,420
You are a truly wonderful and talented person.

172
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,690
Ah... thank you very much.

173
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,546
The seeds have been sown.

174
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,517
The chairman is also completely satisfied➡

175
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,320
I think I trusted my grandma.

176
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,290
(notification sound)

177
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,766
(Risako) I wonder if the two of us could talk for a moment.

178
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,605
That woman also got eaten.

179
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,545
What's the story? Masato is➡

180
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,815
I want you to help me get into Koran Academy.

181
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:59,620
I can't ask Saori-san to do something like this.

182
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,824
If you know the chairman, you can do something, right?

183
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,492
That’s it➡

184
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:08,529
Does that mean you want me to help you enroll through the back door?

185
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:10,964
I didn't say that.

186
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:16,436
(Risako) I have 8 million.➡

187
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:19,940
To the chairman as a donation.

188
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,510
I don't think the chairman can be motivated by money alone.

189
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,979
So what should I do?

190
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:31,151
