(Reminiscence) Yuna-chan was our best friend.

21
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,535
No, I don't think there was.

22

Huh? Maybe it's just my imagination.

23
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,110
Even though you're young, you're quite calm.

I took my son with me. Hey, everyone.

29
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:35,662
I wish she had died alone. She's a failure as a mother.
