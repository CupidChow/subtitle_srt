1
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,289
It's the start of a new day
for your afterlife partner, Jumadeung.

2
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,669
I think I had too much for lunch.

3
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:45,879
It's pretty quiet today.

4
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,630
Don't say that.

5
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,591
You can't say things are quiet.

6
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,592
Why?

7
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,260
You might not know this,

8
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:55,054
but if you say something like that,
things always get busy.

9
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,556
Like a jinx or something?

10
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,976
Come on. Who believes in that stuff?

11
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,278
What? What…

12
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,489
ERROR

13
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,913
After we downloaded some graphics
from the Land of the Living,

14
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,207
the entire company
was infected with a virus.

15
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,292
We're still trying to identify it…

16
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,711
When will it be fixed?

17
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,130
There's so much to be done.

18
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,548
We'll call you back.

19
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,594
From what we can see now,

20
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,721
it'll take two or three days.

21
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,722
Two days?

22
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,141
That's way too long…

23
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,229
Due to an intranet issue,

24
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,272
there is heavy foot traffic
in the building.

25
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,526
To prevent any accidents,
please stop working

26
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,070
and wait for instructions
from your designated Reaper.

27
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,782
We have to write entries into
the Book of the Deceased by hand,

28
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:56,991
one person at a time.

29
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:01,246
Please correctly document your name,
date of birth, and time you were born.

30
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:06,292
Wait for instructions from
your designated Reaper. Thank you.

31
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,461
Why aren't they picking up?

32
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,755
SOUL ENTRY AND EXIT RECORD

33
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,632
ERROR

34
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,009
I don't understand.

35
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,970
The afterworld has computer viruses too?

36
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,222
The afterworld mirrors
the Land of the Living.

37
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,976
All we know is that the victim works
in SP Beauty's marketing team,

38
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,644
and that they were born in April.

39
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,479
At least we have that.

40
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,398
-Let's go.
-Yes, ma'am.

41
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,242
Hello. How may I help you?

42
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,411
Yes.

43
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,126
So…

44
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,253
it's someone

45
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,255
in there?

46
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,383
The company's bigger than I thought.

47
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,052
ERROR

48
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,971
They said it'll take two or three days?

49
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,098
Yes.

50
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,735
Finding a risk case with just
two team members is impossible.

51
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,112
The RM Team isn't
the only one with problems.

52
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,113
You saw it yourself.

53
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:21,159
How serious the entire situation is
at Jumadeung with that virus or whatever.

54
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,452
So what do you expect us to do?

55
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:26,539
They say to some,
an emergency is a chance.

56
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,335
Team Manager Park told me

57
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:35,632
he couldn't understand
why people choose death so easily

58
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,135
when it only takes a few words
to give them the will to live again.

59
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,138
So you show him, Ryeon.

60
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,391
That what saves people is not your powers

61
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,977
but the weight of your words.

62
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,030
EPISODE 7: A PRISON WITHOUT BARS

63
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,866
Having no support from Jumadeung

64
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,869
means we can't fake employment,
hack in, or use our powers.

65
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,496
It's too risky to do this blindly.

66
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,498
So, you know.

67
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,126
If faking a position is too hard,
can't we go in as a part-timer?

68
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,004
SP Beauty's marketing team
just posted this on Albajiok.

69
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,756
They're looking for part-timers.

70
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,509
ALBAJIOK
OFFICE ASSISTANT RECRUITMENT

71
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,053
Mr. Choi Jun-woong.

72
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,931
It's not the sort of company
that accepts anyone who applies.

73
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:28,059
They only pick the most qualified
candidates even for part-timers.

74
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:31,187
Well, if you can clean up things
once everything is said and done,

75
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,773
I can whip up some amazing qualifications
for you guys.

76
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,401
But the problem is the interview.

77
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,904
I think I'll get in without a problem.

78
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,406
What?

79
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,157
There are high-pressure, debate,

80
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,243
in-depth, multiple-day,
and drinking interviews.

81
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,288
They'll be rude and jeer at you,
while attacking your personality.

82
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,081
You two?

83
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,625
I don't think so.

84
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,337
I might not look like it,

85
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,424
but I beat thousands of other candidates
to get into Jumadeung.

86
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,802
Okay, it might be a little easier
for you, then.

87
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,387
For Mr. Lim.

88
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,932
To explain it simply,

89
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,436
an interview is a legitimate opportunity
for you to shamelessly brag

90
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,063
about the things you can't say
in front of others.

91
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,357
And you do it all
with a smile on your face.

92
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,319
I am like a grasshopper.

93
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,989
While an ant spends all summer
gathering food for the winter,

94
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,283
a grasshopper spends
the whole summer singing.

95
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,494
However, I think a true asset to
a company is not a hardworking ant,

96
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:32,081
but a grasshopper,
who is creative and pushes boundaries.

97
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,084
I am that creative
and boundary-pushing grasshopper!

98
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,922
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

99
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:44,719
What kind of part-timer would we pick?
Lazy grasshoppers or hardworking ants?

100
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,182
Mr. Lim Ryung-gu?

101
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,391
Yes, that's me.

102
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,519
What do you think is the problem
with this company's products?

103
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,437
Well.

104
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,777
Your colors are clearly divided
between cool tones and warm tones.

105
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,279
But you market them saying
they can be used regardless of skin tone,

106
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,239
which is clearly making
a fool out of the customer.

107
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:08,117
It's impossible to use the same color
for different skin tones.

108
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,620
You have a point. And?

109
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,081
Your campaign marketing relies too much
on your existing clientele.

110
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,957
While your events do fit
the latest trends,

111
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,001
you don't have an outlet
to advertise them.

112
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,961
And?

113
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,255
-You wanted more?
-No? That's it?

114
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,509
I have more
but you might find it unpleasant.

115
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,010
I'm open-minded.

116
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,721
Your biggest problem is that your makeup
targets young women in their 20s,

117
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,431
but they have you,

118
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,769
a middle-aged man
with no insight into young people,

119
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,230
conducting this interview, which--

120
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,815
Wait.

121
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,149
Mr. Lim Ryung-gu.

122
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,069
Here's some advice from someone
who has more life experience.

123
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,529
You might not like this but…

124
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,198
Then I don't want to hear it.
You said I might not like it.

125
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,660
If it's something I might not like,
I'd rather not hear it at all.

126
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,954
You little…

127
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:55,790
Well.

128
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,750
You two are out.

129
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,003
Ms. Koo Ryeon?

130
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,632
What is your height and weight?

131
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,094
Pardon?

132
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:12,473
Don't take this the wrong way.
We sell women's beauty products

133
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,977
so a part of my job is to take note
of the appearances and figures

134
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,645
of the members of my team.

135
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:23,401
From now on, why don't you put
on your resume that you

136
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,320
double-majored in
a nice face and a hot bod?

137
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,825
Come on, don't give me that look.

138
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,537
It was a joke to make you smile
since you looked so nervous.

139
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,997
Would you look at that?

140
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,458
Ms. Koo, you're in.

141
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,882
You can start work right now

142
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,301
and the two of you are out.

143
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,142
Goodness.

144
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,060
He stepped on a golf ball and fell.

145
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,937
-What should we do?
-What should we do?

146
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,815
Ma'am, I think he fainted.

147
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,233
Shouldn't we wake him up?

148
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,359
Here.

149
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,618
-Are you okay?
-What?

150
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:17,246
I think these two are better than me
at quick responses and problem-solving.

151
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,957
Maybe you're right?

152
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,752
I trust you'll hire such talented people.

153
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,302
Ms. Shin. Good.

154
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:35,223
This is our assistant manager, Shin Ye-na.
She's the best on our team.

155
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,934
These are the part-timers
who'll assist the opening event.

156
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,393
-Show them around.
-Yes, sir.

157
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:44,815
Try to be as good as Ms. Shin here.
Then I won't have anything to worry about.

158
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,152
-Sir.
-Here you go.

159
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:49,987
Jeez.

160
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,573
I texted you ages ago, why are you late?

161
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,617
There was a meeting.

162
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,744
Who do you think comes first, me or them?

163
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:57,954
Are you that stupid?

164
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,413
I'm sorry, sir.

165
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,458
If anyone asks, I went to see a client.

166
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,459
Yes, sir.

167
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,300
Gosh.

168
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,302
Corporate life sure is hard.

169
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,558
Excuse me, Ms. Jeong.

170
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,059
Yes, Ms. Shin.

171
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,894
I'm sorry, but could you help them?

172
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,647
I have to prepare for the meeting.

173
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,774
-Hello.
-Okay.

174
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:27,900
Thank you.

175
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,611
Nice to meet you all. I'm Jeong Bo-ram.

176
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,947
The work's fairly straightforward.

177
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,705
Grab just the product using the pen tool,

178
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:44,000
then separate it from the background
by putting it on a new layer.

179
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,668
That's all you need to do for now.

180
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:49,130
Okay, so, go find an empty spot
and you can start working.

181
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,172
Thanks.

182
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,528
Tomorrow is the grand opening
for the 100th shop.

183
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,363
The event is at the end of this month.

184
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,658
Make sure the free giveaways are ready.
The event needs to go off without a hitch.

185
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,993
Ms. Jeong?

186
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,786
I called and asked the factory.

187
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,372
They said they can meet
the deadline we requested.

188
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,915
Tell them they must be on time.

189
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,751
Once they're done, make sure you check

190
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,960
-to see if the store receives them.
-Okay.

191
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,587
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes.

192
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,511
Can we find them before it's fixed?

193
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,888
We have to find them.

194
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,599
Everyone looked fine on the surface.

195
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,310
There's a company intranet, right?

196
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,437
I'll look for people born in April.

197
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,439
Don't get caught.

198
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,316
Okay, good luck!

199
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,652
Good luck…

200
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,874
HAM MAN-SIK, TEAM MANAGER

201
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,002
Damn.

202
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,480
Let's take a look here.

203
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,745
Damn.

204
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,498
Born in April…

205
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:11,730
Jeez!

206
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,901
Every time I go, they're on a holiday.
Stupid screen golf center.

207
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,736
I guess they're too rich to work hard.

208
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,255
Jeez.

209
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,133
I'll have to change golf centers.

210
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,484
Ma'am, what about Mr. Lim?

211
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,028
Listen carefully.

212
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,697
-If he gets caught, we're abandoning him.
-What?

213
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,616
Come on, ma'am.

214
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,659
It's the only way.

215
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,639
Are you okay?

216
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,975
I think it was just something I ate.
I can't seem to keep it down.

217
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:30,893
I'm fine.

218
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,275
What do you do for exercise, Ms. Koo?
Or are you on a diet?

219
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,945
I don't really gain weight easily.

220
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,030
I see.

221
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,490
I'm jealous.

222
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,619
I don't think you have to be jealous
of anyone's figure, Ms. Shin.

223
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,663
Thank you.

224
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,379
Mr. Lim! You're alive!

225
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,635
Good job. It was a bit close there.

226
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,804
I almost got caught.

227
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,430
You almost got abandoned.

228
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,015
-Hey!
-Yes, ma'am?

229
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,351
What?

230
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,064
You were going to abandon me?

231
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,067
Are you saying

232
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,778
I stink just because I sniffed around?

233
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:25,155
Do you really think
I would do that, Mr. Lim?

234
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,825
We've known and worked together
for more than a century.

235
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,244
So how did your search go?

236
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,289
Mr. Lim?

237
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,461
Jeong Bo-ram.

238
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,754
Kim Yong-jun.

239
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,464
Shin Ye-na.

240
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,799
Tomorrow is the grand…

241
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,758
Lee Dong-ja.

242
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,010
It's these four people.

243
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,512
Wait a minute. Who was Lee Dong-ja again?

244
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,608
Wait a minute.

245
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,819
Ms. Lee. Are you just coming to work now?

246
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,489
Why not take the whole day off
while you're at it?

247
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,657
I'm sorry, sir.

248
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,743
But I did say I'd take the morning off.

249
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:11,827
Is that something to be proud of?

250
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,413
All you do is say, "I'm sorry."

251
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,332
What are you, a robot?

252
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,712
This is why working moms can't cut it.

253
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:26,634
If you have a kid, why don't you just
stay home and focus on raising it?

254
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,885
Choose one or the other.

255
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,680
Why do you insist on coming to work
and being a nuisance?

256
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,561
I'm sorry.

257
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:40,898
Who…

258
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,025
-We're part-timers.
-We're part-timers.

259
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,276
Part-timers, yes.

260
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,655
Right. I'm Lee Dong-ja.

261
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,746
What is it, Ye-won?

262
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,706
No, stay there.

263
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,416
Daddy will be there soon.

264
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,334
I'm hanging up.

265
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,921
MY DAUGHTER YE-WON

266
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,720
Yes, Ye-won. What is it?

267
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,014
I'll go.

268
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,646
Ye-won, you can't keep calling me.

269
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,398
Mom, I don't like it here.

270
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,444
Yes. Where are you?

271
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,196
You said you were coming.
When will you be here?

272
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,823
What? A meeting?

273
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,866
I have to go to a meeting right now too.

274
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,954
I told you to take the day off
since Ye-won didn't have school today.

275
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,456
What do you mean I didn't!
She's your kid too!

276
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,168
What is it?

277
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,004
Daddy isn't coming?

278
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,339
No.

279
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,716
He's going to be a bit late.

280
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,717
So…

281
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,386
No, I don't want to be alone!

282
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,848
What the hell do I do?

283
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,062
KIDS' CAFÉ

284
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,188
I thought it was a café

285
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,315
but it's a kids' café.

286
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,234
Yes.

287
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,864
Yes. I'll be there.

288
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,076
Mommy needs to go to a meeting now.

289
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,995
I don't want to be alone!

290
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,456
I'll stay with her.

291
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,374
What?

292
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,835
You can stay with me
until your mom comes back, okay?

293
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,045
Still…

294
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,212
Aren't you late?

295
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,050
Ye-won, I'll be back soon.

296
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,760
You just play with her here, okay?

297
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,971
I'm sorry, but could you stay with her?

298
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,347
Thank you.

299
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,528
I think I now understand why
everyone always complains about work.

300
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,033
Just sitting here is suffocating.

301
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,452
I thought your dream was to get a job.

302
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,205
I know.

303
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,298
Whoever's good at lifting things,
can you come with me to the storage?

304
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,801
What? Wait a minute.

305
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,804
I mean, I think everyone would agree
I look stronger.

306
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,013
Looks aren't everything.

307
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,016
I'm not the type
to have any body fat on me.

308
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,226
In other words,

309
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,061
my entire body is made of muscle.

310
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,314
That's not…

311
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:31,401
I might not have been born rich,
but I was born strong.

312
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:35,155
All it takes is a little weight lifting
for me to add muscle.

313
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,074
Whenever I take a long walk,

314
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:41,537
I can feel my calf muscles
getting more defined.

315
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,331
I just need someone with strong arms--

316
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,666
Just a minute.

317
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,338
Let's arm wrestle.

318
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,884
Don't blame me if your arm breaks.

319
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,187
That was an unnecessarily long warm-up.

320
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,148
You should always warm up thoroughly.

321
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,567
Warming up for defeat?

322
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,694
You're more talkative than usual.

323
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,155
Just like how your hand
is sweatier than usual?

324
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,656
-Let's go.
-Okay.

325
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,658
One,

326
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,201
two,

327
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,745
-three.
-Sir.

328
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:32,045
Hello, Mr. Hand, here so soon?

329
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,674
Let's go.

330
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,968
-Follow me.
-Okay.

331
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,469
I'll just wipe my hand and go.

332
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,603
Keep an eye
on Jeong Bo-ram and Shin Ye-na.

333
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:49,855
How wet.

334
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,452
Ye-won.

335
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:04,995
Let's take a break.

336
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,530
Of course,
you're fat if you eat like that.

337
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,949
Yes, that's your girlfriend.

338
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,785
Shut up.

339
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,079
Those little bastards.

340
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,289
Look at those calves.

341
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,625
-I've never seen anyone like that before.
-I'm sorry,

342
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,835
but could I have some more
chocolate chips?

343
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,505
She wants more chocolate chips.

344
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,758
You should quit eating chocolate
unless you want to be like her.

345
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,551
I think you two look great together.

346
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,469
Shut up.

347
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,062
SP BEAUTY MARKETING TEAM, BORN APRIL

348
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,858
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

349
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,530
Excuse me, I need to take this.

350
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,990
-Okay.
-Okay.

351
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,704
She is so skinny.

352
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,872
I think she's skinnier than before.

353
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,459
Her clothes look awesome on her
and she's great at her job.

354
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,378
-I'm so jealous.
-Yes.

355
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,839
I think she looks too thin.

356
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,550
-She looks thin in a good way.
-Yes.

357
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,885
How does that even work?
If you're thin, you're thin.

358
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:44,845
Don't you agree?

359
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,015
You shouldn't talk about weight
when you're eating.

360
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,435
You need to be reverent before food.

361
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,103
Reverent?

362
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,780
Ms. Jeong.

363
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,657
Stop eating so much.

364
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,829
Sir, I don't have a problem with my body,
so why do you keep…

365
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,042
What do you mean you don't have a problem?

366
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,002
Ms. Jeong, you can't do that.

367
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,254
As an employee, you represent the company.

368
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,590
This isn't a food business,
we make cosmetics.

369
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,632
Sir!

370
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,468
This is sexual harassment.

371
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,428
What?

372
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,930
Ms. Jeong. Sexual harassment?

373
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,099
How is this sexual harassment?

374
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,103
What, did I touch you?
Or did I do anything to you?

375
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,063
Jeez.

376
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,398
I'm saying this
because I'm worried about you.

377
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:42,903
No man in Korea is going to like you
if you're this fat, you know?

378
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,406
This is all because I'm trying to
get you to take care of yourself.

379
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,158
Because I'm worried about you.

380
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,455
Isn't taking care of yourself
different from watching your weight?

381
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,372
What?

382
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,338
What did you just say?

383
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,800
Taking care of yourself is different
from watching your weight.

384
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,261
It's always the ones
who don't take care of themselves

385
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:12,140
who use that excuse
to criticize someone else.

386
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,977
Jeez!

387
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,647
You think you can lecture me?

388
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,899
You're nothing but a part-timer.

389
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,610
Young people these days.

390
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,487
They don't have any manners!

391
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,948
In my day, when your boss said something,

392
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:31,118
you'd say, "yes, sir,"
and do what they say!

393
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,538
Dear Reapers of Jumadeung,

394
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,831
your workday is over.

395
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,707
Thank you for your hard work as always.

396
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,684
I want…

397
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,478
to clock out for the day.

398
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,563
I mean.

399
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,898
Come on…

400
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,694
Why is my entire job
just clicking on things?

401
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,780
My back.

402
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,619
Okay.

403
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,164
-Let's get to work.
-Right, work.

404
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,083
How was Kim Yong-jun?

405
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,963
It's terrible being a contract worker.

406
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:28,425
They say if you have to work,
you might as well work for a big company.

407
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,926
But even if you work for the same company,

408
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,178
it's just not the same as
being a regular worker.

409
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,263
Still, won't this hard work

410
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,348
pay off eventually?

411
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,812
There's the rent, the bills,
the student loan payments,

412
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,190
and whatever's left is gone

413
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,525
after you order in a couple of times
on weekends.

414
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,486
Do you still think
hard work is all you need?

415
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,203
Escape.

416
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,622
What?

417
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,416
My college friends and I are preparing
to start a business,

418
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,126
and we just got investors.

419
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,252
I'll be joining them soon.

420
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,380
I know we'll have to work our butts off,
but we might make it big.

421
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,341
Look how cryptocurrency surged in value
even though no one expected it to.

422
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,592
You never know.

423
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,219
Yes.

424
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,014
He was thinking about his future.

425
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,475
He didn't seem like someone
planning to kill themselves.

426
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,019
What about Ms. Lee Dong-ja?

427
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,982
-When will your mom come back?
-I don't know.

428
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,276
Mommy is always busy.

429
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,198
-Really?
-Yes, but my mom's really cool.

430
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:34,866
Why?

431
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,162
My mom makes people better and cooler.

432
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,499
She said she's working hard

433
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,919
so I can use nicer things when I grow up.

434
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:49,673
I see.

435
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:50,840
Ye-won!

436
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,677
Ye-won, I'm sorry.

437
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,638
Goodness. Honey, Mommy's sorry.

438
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,723
Did you have fun?

439
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,100
I'm sorry, honey.

440
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,728
I'm late. I'm sorry.

441
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,690
Stop being sorry.

442
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,483
What?

443
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,819
-Did you miss the meeting?
-No.

444
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,362
Then were you late?

445
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,530
No.

446
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:17,200
-Then did you underperform at your job?
-No. I've never done that, really.

447
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,287
Right, you never did.
So why act like you did?

448
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,580
If you act like that,
people will get the wrong idea.

449
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,165
The company and your child.

450
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,876
They'll think you did something wrong.

451
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,004
You're doing great already.

452
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,798
Right? Isn't your mom doing great?

453
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:32,716
Yes!

454
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,261
She's having a hard time
juggling work and family life,

455
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,305
but she loves both her job and her kid.

456
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,017
I think it's Ms. Shin Bo-ram.

457
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,060
-Jeong Bo-ram.
-I think it's Ms. Jeong Bo-ram.

458
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,229
Of course,
you're fat if you eat like that.

459
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,648
You should quit eating chocolate
unless you want to be like her.

460
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,066
Yes, that's your girlfriend.

461
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,278
I saw the Negative Energy Levels go up!

462
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,574
I think it's due to the horrible things
Ham Man-sik spews at her.

463
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,285
Shin Ye-na…

464
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,871
Ms. Shin Ye-na is…

465
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,041
Tomorrow is the grand opening
for the 100th shop.

466
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,335
The event is at the end of this month.

467
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,503
Everyone wants to be like her.

468
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,130
She was promoted quickly too.

469
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,715
I think it's definitely

470
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,342
-Ms. Shin Bo-ram.
-Jeong Bo-ram.

471
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,259
Ms. Jeong Bo-ram!

472
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,844
It's too early to be sure.

473
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,475
SP BEAUTY MARKETING TEAM, BORN APRIL

474
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,854
"GRIM REAPER" HAS INVITED
"A PRISON WITHOUT BARS" TO THE CHAT

475
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,732
I WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD
WHERE NO ONE LOOKS AT ME

476
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:36,780
CAN YOU REALLY DIE WITHOUT PAIN?

477
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,035
IT WAS DEVELOPED AS A GUARANTEED
AND PAINLESS WAY TO END YOUR LIFE

478
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,164
Yes, we'll take care of it. Yes.

479
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,792
Hello, this is SP Beauty.

480
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,001
Yes?

481
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,385
What is it?

482
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,720
The free giveaways for the 100th shop
haven't shipped out yet.

483
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,599
Ms. Jeong put in the order for 15:00,
but the supplier mistook it for 5 p.m.

484
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,852
I'm sorry!

485
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,855
Hey! You think you can make this
go away by saying sorry?

486
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,358
How is it possible that
we don't have any giveaways

487
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,984
at our 100th store opening?

488
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,486
We already sent a text out,

489
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,863
so there will be
a lot of customers coming!

490
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,782
All you do is stuff your face,

491
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,951
I knew she would do this!

492
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,453
I knew she would do this!

493
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,461
Ms. Jeong, so how far along are they?
Have they packed the products yet?

494
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,381
They're checking for faulty products now.

495
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,926
So everything should be done before 4 p.m.

496
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,469
-In about an hour.
-Yes.

497
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,805
They have all their employees
at the factory now,

498
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,266
but they're not sure
if they can finish packing by 4 p.m.

499
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:49,102
Looks like we're going to
have to give people

500
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,146
products that haven't even been packaged!

501
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,063
Damn it!

502
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,941
I'll go to the factory
and help with the packaging.

503
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,151
I'll go too!

504
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:57,861
We'll go too.

505
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:58,778
Me too.

506
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,613
Why would you guys go?

507
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:04,075
Don't you need all the help you can get?

508
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,785
Right. Isn't that why you hired us?

509
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,414
Sure. We need all the hands we can get.

510
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,420
Stack them carefully.

511
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,507
MAKE-UP TUTORIAL

512
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,521
What do we do?

513
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,232
I told the customers that

514
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,610
the giveaway promotion
will be delayed about an hour,

515
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,154
but our model
for the makeup demonstration left

516
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,572
because she had another appointment.

517
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,369
We worked so hard
to get the makeup artist for this event.

518
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,955
I can't wait any longer.

519
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,123
What do we do?

520
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,421
I'll do it, then.

521
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,424
No.

522
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,638
After all, this is to model the makeup.

523
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:10,725
She might work.

524
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,774
Could you do it for us, Ms. Koo?

525
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,818
Please?

526
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:26,241
Okay, but I don't work for free.
You can buy me dinner later.

527
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,327
Okay, I will.

528
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,672
This is SP Beauty's highlighter,

529
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,550
our best-selling item
for spring and summer.

530
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,301
We'll use this to brighten the face.

531
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,763
If you brush it over the T-zone
and the cheekbones like this,

532
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,016
it contours the face
and makes it look brighter.

533
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,269
We'll do the cheeks next.

534
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,020
The color I'm using is coral,

535
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,482
which is going to be
the trending color for this spring.

536
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,902
We won't overdo it
and make it look natural.

537
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,578
I'm sorry about the model thing earlier.

538
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,037
It's okay.

539
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,582
I just wanted to help…

540
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,749
Don't worry about it.

541
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,459
Thank you.

542
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,340
I haven't had steak in so long.

543
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,176
Is it good?

544
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,929
Yes. It's delicious.

545
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,681
There are mushrooms too.

546
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,851
It's good.

547
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,645
Here, try this too.

548
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,605
Thank you.

549
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,690
How is it?

550
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:41,858
I haven't tried it yet.

551
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,193
Isn't it good?

552
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:45,695
I think it will be.

553
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,239
I'll just pop to the bathroom…

554
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,289
Ms. Shin Ye-na?

555
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,249
Yes.

556
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,544
I think our suicide risk case this time
is Shin Ye-na.

557
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,213
What about Ms. Jeong Bo-ram?

558
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,341
It's not Jeong Bo-ram.

559
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,094
She seems like a kindhearted person,
with high self-esteem.

560
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,347
The steakhouse was amazing.

561
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,807
It was crispy on the outside
and pink on the inside.

562
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:18,478
And it was tender like cheese.
The perfect combination of texture.

563
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,188
Let's go together next time.

564
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,651
She looked so down
when Ham Man-sik was criticizing her.

565
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,113
It's only human to react that way.
That's nothing to do with self-esteem.

566
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,282
Who wouldn't feel pain
when they've been cut with a knife?

567
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,620
Feeling pain and having scars
is the same for everyone.

568
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:39,082
But I don't see the reason why
you're so sure it's Shin Ye-na.

569
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,962
Didn't you notice anything off
about Shin Ye-na?

570
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,757
Not really, apart from
how talkative she was…

571
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,176
She didn't eat anything.

572
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,680
She kept on talking while cutting
her food into smaller and smaller pieces.

573
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,224
I haven't had steak in so long.
Is it good?

574
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,267
There are mushrooms too.

575
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,936
The sauce is really good.

576
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,896
She kept asking pointless questions…

577
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,815
How is it? Is it good?

578
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,066
I haven't tried it yet.

579
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,276
and talked about how good the food
was without eating anything.

580
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,987
I think it's great too.

581
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,280
She would put her fork down
after putting it up to her mouth.

582
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,032
The only thing she ate

583
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,077
was a piece of mushroom.

584
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,540
I didn't know. I thought she was
really enjoying the meal.

585
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,837
I don't think you have to be jealous
of anyone's figure, Ms. Shin.

586
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,963
Thank you.

587
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,684
Actually, I was curious why Shin Ye-na

588
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,519
had that cut on her hand.

589
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,647
All she ate was that
little piece of mushroom,

590
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,358
but she stuck her finger down her throat
and threw that up.

591
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,279
This wasn't just a one-off occurrence.

592
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:55,158
And that's probably how
she hurt her hand too.

593
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,870
So that's why you asked Shin Ye-na
to buy you dinner.

594
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,875
She's obsessed with being thin?

595
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:05,960
Why?

596
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,628
I don't know.

597
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,673
Only Shin Ye-na has the answer to that.

598
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,323
Our father who art in heaven,

599
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:22,203
lead us not into temptation
and deliver us from evil.

600
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,331
Please, help me.

601
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:27,917
Please.

602
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,294
Please…

603
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:50,148
What's everyone doing today?
Let's have a team dinner?

604
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,650
Everyone stay after work, okay?

605
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,236
This is so annoying.

606
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,530
He just wants to use
the company card to drink.

607
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,417
Ms. Jeong, do you have anything sweet?

608
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,045
Here, have as many as you want.

609
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,339
Thank you so much. I'll have that one.

610
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,050
Well, Jeong Bo-ram.

611
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,095
Stop stuffing your face. Jeez.

612
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,306
Pigs will be asking you
to be friends at this rate.

613
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,266
Whatever. No matter what you say,

614
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,435
I'm going to stay true
to my healthy pig self.

615
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:28,978
Fine.

616
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,646
-Hey, Mr. Woo.
-Yes, sir.

617
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,190
You know there's
a team dinner today, right?

618
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,316
You have to stay until the end.

619
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:44,911
Have some too, Ms. Shin.

620
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,412
It's okay.

621
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,873
You've been so busy
with the opening event and everything.

622
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,584
I haven't seen you eat much lately,
so I'm worried about you.

623
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,501
I'm fine.

624
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,796
Come on, just have a little.

625
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,256
To keep your blood sugar up.

626
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,558
Ms. Jeong! Aren't you embarrassed
about your weight?

627
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,311
I know you don't like what Mr. Ham says,
so why don't you stop eating?

628
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,146
-Ms. Shin.
-Why?

629
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,147
Why would you

630
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,734
keep on stuffing yourself
and eating everything you want?

631
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,736
Why? Don't you have any self-restraint?

632
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,659
I'm sorry. I was being too pushy,
wasn't I?

633
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:28,204
I guess you've been under
a lot of stress lately.

634
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,050
I'm sorry, Ms. Jeong.

635
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,386
It's okay.

636
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,555
Get some rest.

637
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,775
She's so skinny.

638
00:37:58,776 --> 00:37:59,902
I'm so jealous.

639
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,656
I wish I could be that skinny,
even for a day.

640
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:06,200
-But it won't happen in this lifetime.
-Same here.

641
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:09,829
Look.

642
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,540
Look how thin she is. Gross.

643
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,126
-I bet her bones would break with a kick.
-Go on then.

644
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,168
Don't be ridiculous.

645
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,004
-I don't like women that thin.
-Me neither.

646
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,589
I can hear you. I can hear everything.

647
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,508
Please, stop!

648
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,218
It's gross.

649
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,932
Ms. Shin Ye-na's condition looks critical.

650
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,976
It's going up.

651
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,478
If something were to happen to Shin Ye-na,

652
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,440
it'll probably be today.

653
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:56,917
Everyone.

654
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,546
Good job on the opening event
for the 100th shop!

655
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,382
To SP Beauty!

656
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,342
SP!

657
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,135
SP!

658
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,304
-For…
-Good job, everyone.

659
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,014
Good job, everyone.

660
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,390
Good job, everyone.

661
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,851
Come on, Ms. Shin.

662
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,604
Why did you come
if you're not going to drink?

663
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,065
I don't feel very well…

664
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,067
No wonder you're so thin.

665
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:24,111
You know, it's unattractive
for a woman to be so thin.

666
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,197
Didn't you have enough?

667
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,492
We've got one who's too big

668
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:34,580
and one who's too thin.

669
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:40,002
So the two of you should mix
so you're just the right amount of curvy--

670
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,254
What is this?

671
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,172
Eat up, sir.

672
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,842
There must have been a bone inside.

673
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,348
There was a bone…

674
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,432
Are you okay?

675
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,018
Sir, where's the bathroom?

676
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,228
Right there.

677
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,438
-Oh, no.
-Serves him right.

678
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,440
Hey, there's bone. Be careful.

679
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,905
Ms. Shin.

680
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,657
Are you okay?

681
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,075
You don't look well.

682
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,744
She's right.

683
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,621
You must have been very stressed.

684
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,081
I think you lost more weight.

685
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,418
Stop it.

686
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,711
You need to gain some weight. Here, eat.

687
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,713
Why is everyone telling me what to do?

688
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,007
She's nothing but bones,
yet her stomach sticks out.

689
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,427
Isn't that muffin top?

690
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,012
She looks gross now that she's thinner.

691
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,764
She needs to gain some weight.

692
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,683
She must have been fat before.

693
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,561
Stop. Stop, please, stop!

694
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:41,522
Ms. Shin.

695
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,649
Ms. Shin!

696
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,025
Damn it…

697
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,549
Ma'am, it's back up.
But her Negative Energy Levels are…

698
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,010
-Let's split up.
-Okay.

699
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,314
Ms. Shin!

700
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,942
Ms. Shin!

701
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:29,862
No.

702
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,852
Apartment…

703
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,271
Six…

704
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,774
Sixteen…

705
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,072
SHIN YE-NA, ASSISTANT MANAGER

706
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,454
NITROGEN

707
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,372
Ms. Shin.

708
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,172
Ms. Shin.

709
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,173
Ms. Shin.

710
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,091
Ms. Shin!

711
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,686
MYEONGIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

712
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,659
Are you okay?

713
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,831
Why did you save me?

714
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,298
Why did you try to kill yourself?

715
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:16,343
What is it that has you in so much pain?

716
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,474
I don't know.

717
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,313
Why I have to live like this.

718
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,815
What I'm living for.

719
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:43,078
Why are you so obsessed with being skinny?

720
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,498
Obsessed?

721
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,001
I'm sorry if I've offended you.

722
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,962
I heard you throw up after you eat.

723
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,381
People who are normal

724
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,175
wouldn't understand.

725
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,596
But you're so much thinner
than most people.

726
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,265
I was fat when I was young.

727
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,019
All the way up through high school.

728
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,817
SHIN YE-NA

729
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,944
You psycho,
why are you spraying disinfectant?

730
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,574
-Hey, Cholera.
-What are you doing?

731
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,867
I'm disinfecting her.

732
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,243
Hog cholera is going around these days,
you know.

733
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,954
My nickname during high school
was cholera.

734
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,790
Because hog cholera was at its peak then.

735
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,626
-Give me that.
-She smells like a pig.

736
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,587
-Right, left, up.
-She's going to be suyuk at this rate.

737
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,172
-Hey, it's your girlfriend.
-Whatever.

738
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,299
-Go tell her you love her.
-You guys are perfect together.

739
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,385
-She smells.
-Come on, take that back.

740
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,345
-Pork cutlet?
-I smell pork cutlet.

741
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,429
How about pork cutlet for dinner?

742
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,140
Hey, I want bossam.

743
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,351
-Bossam would work too.
-Right?

744
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,602
But did you know

745
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,438
pigs can never see the sky?

746
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,149
The pigs are being put into tanks
and are being buried.

747
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,234
Around 1,300 pigs are…

748
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,777
I thought I should just die

749
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,073
if I can't ever live seeing the sky.

750
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:26,181
I thought, if you're fat,
you can't even die if you want to.

751
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,811
That was

752
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,605
when I started throwing up.

753
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,281
I starved myself,
as if my life was on the line.

754
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,248
I ate just enough to not die

755
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,089
and threw up the moment I felt full.

756
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,784
When I lost weight,
people asked me how I did it

757
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,120
and complimented me.

758
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,415
Her clothes look awesome on her
and she's great at her job.

759
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,834
-I'm so jealous.
-It felt good.

760
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,503
And I was proud of myself.

761
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,381
I worked really hard…

762
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,635
and got recognition for it too.

763
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,804
Then why are you in so much pain?

764
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:53,143
I thought I could finally escape
from people's gazes,

765
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,646
but whether I'm fat or thin,

766
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,233
people never stop judging how I look.

767
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,443
-She's so skinny.
-I'm so jealous.

768
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,237
I wish I could be that skinny,
even for a day.

769
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,197
Look how thin she is. Gross.

770
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,532
I bet her bones would break with a kick.

771
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,576
I don't like women that thin.

772
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,619
Me neither.

773
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,583
When I eat something to
try to gain a little weight,

774
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,293
I throw up immediately

775
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,878
because I keep remembering
how things were before.

776
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:36,019
It feels like I'm in a prison
I can never escape from.

777
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:39,648
I really hate

778
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,317
how I am now.

779
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,840
What should we do? Should I call him?

780
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:07,884
I'm here.

781
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:13,098
I went to Ms. Shin Ye-na's house
and brought her here.

782
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,016
Good job.

783
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,184
You should go in now.
She's having a really hard time.

784
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,146
No. Choi Jun-woong.

785
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:20,689
You go in.

786
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:23,233
What?

787
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,652
You brought Shin Ye-na here,

788
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,030
so you can see this through.

789
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:29,740
Ma'am?

790
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:34,244
What? It's time we trust him with things.

791
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:38,999
Do you think I can do it?

792
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,793
Do it your way.

793
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,924
Okay.

794
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,106
My way…

795
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,068
What is that?

796
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,043
My little sister was like that too.

797
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,923
She went through something similar to you,
and had a hard time.

798
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:32,511
She gained over ten kilograms
studying for the college entrance exam.

799
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:36,598
I didn't think it would bother her
because she was always so cheerful, but…

800
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,270
Hey, you're home.

801
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,398
Hi--

802
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:47,651
What's with her?

803
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:51,321
After her boyfriend broke up with her
because of her weight,

804
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,491
she quickly became depressed.

805
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:55,951
Excuse me.

806
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,911
How much is this?

807
00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:00,080
Come on, that wouldn't fit you.

808
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:01,748
Hey, excuse me.

809
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,584
She asked how much it was,
not that she wanted to try it on.

810
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:07,879
Never mind.

811
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:12,008
At first, I thought she would get over it

812
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,177
but she didn't.

813
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:18,515
The looks people gave her must have been
too cruel for her to bear.

814
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,228
Come on, get out here!

815
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:25,605
Just leave me alone!

816
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,983
No. Open the door right now.

817
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:29,818
Why?

818
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:33,071
Why are you in there
instead of eating the food I prepared?

819
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:35,615
-Come on out right now and eat.
-No, I don't want to!

820
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,868
I've had enough!

821
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,619
Are you an idiot?

822
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,873
-Mom!
-Answer me, are you an idiot?

823
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,666
No, you're not.

824
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,544
So why would you change yourself
into what other people want you to be?

825
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:51,631
Those people who only judge appearances
will always find ways to criticize you,

826
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,718
no matter how perfect you are.

827
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,178
Don't let them tell you what to do.

828
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:58,096
Is your life theirs or yours?

829
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:06,021
No matter what people say,
you should always be on your own side.

830
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:07,689
You're beautiful.

831
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,525
I've raised you
into this beautiful person.

832
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:17,908
I think you're very similar to
how my sister was then.

833
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,494
Are you saying it's my fault?

834
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:24,372
It was only for a moment for your sister,

835
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,251
but I've spent my whole life
being judged by people.

836
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,670
Just because I was fat.

837
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:35,759
I've become trapped in this prison
that other people have made for me.

838
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:41,181
You're right. I never went through that,
so I don't really know.

839
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:48,688
It's possible that the people
who made that prison and put you in there

840
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:53,276
were the people who've hurt you
this whole time.

841
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,326
But…

842
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,621
don't you think you could be the one

843
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,499
who locked the door
so you couldn't escape?

844
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,861
Don't try so hard…

845
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,699
to maintain a body you don't even want.

846
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:45,120
Your body is yours, not someone else's.

847
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:52,085
You should love and care for it yourself.

848
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,423
I want to be able to get you out.

849
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,470
I want to get you out,

850
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,806
but I don't know how.

851
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,948
When did this…

852
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:35,188
The key was in my hand all along.

853
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:10,306
SHIN YE-NA, ASSISTANT MANAGER

854
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,519
Was he always this eloquent?

855
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,773
So you show him, Ryeon.

856
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,568
That what saves people is not your powers

857
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,486
but the weight of your words.

858
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,114
It's because he's speaking from the heart.

859
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:32,996
Get rid of our fake resumes
and turn in our resignations.

860
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,375
-Where are you going?
-To finish the job.

861
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:57,771
I was hurt that you left
without saying goodbye.

862
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:01,816
But I was so excited

863
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,570
when you asked me
to meet you at a place like this.

864
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:09,866
So, there's something I've been
wondering about for a while now.

865
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:11,910
You can ask me.

866
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:16,039
You've got these great legs.

867
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:18,958
Why would you hide them under those pants?

868
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:22,504
A pencil skirt would be
absolutely perfect.

869
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,982
So I can teach idiots like you a lesson.

870
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:46,111
Ms. Koo. What are you, a thug?

871
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,070
What are you doing?

872
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:49,823
I'm older than your great-grandfather,
show some respect.

873
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,032
Are you insane?

874
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:54,911
Butt.

875
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,125
-Waist.
-You--

876
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:02,752
Chest.

877
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,921
All things you've been
harassing women about.

878
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,674
I didn't think you would understand it
if I used words.

879
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,425
You're crazy!

880
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:12,804
No, you're crazy.

881
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:17,934
I think you'd learn best
from firsthand experience, right?

882
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:20,311
From now on,
whenever you hurt people's feelings,

883
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,312
you'll feel your gut twist

884
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,148
and you won't be able
to stop going to the bathroom.

885
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,067
Your body will pay for the sins
your mouth has committed.

886
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,402
The rest of your punishment

887
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:29,446
will come after your death.

888
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:36,703
Hey!

889
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,413
Hey!

890
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:41,583
I've been too nice to you!

891
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:42,750
Hey!

892
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,919
Come back here! Stop!

893
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,810
Even when you hear people say rude things,

894
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,563
how can you shake it off so quickly
and smile?

895
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,650
I can't help but be affected by it.

896
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,280
The truth is,
I don't like hearing that stuff either.

897
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:15,658
But I really am happy with my own body.

898
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,411
I think that's how I can
shake it off so quickly.

899
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,873
It might be hard to imagine,

900
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,584
but when I was young,
I was all skin and bones.

901
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,753
I was really ill.

902
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,507
But I miraculously got better.

903
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,134
And since I can only live this life once,

904
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:35,011
no matter what other people say,

905
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:38,223
I decided to eat whatever I want
and have fun.

906
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,558
And stay healthy too, of course.

907
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,645
Because my standard for happiness,

908
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,356
is myself.

909
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,278
Thank you for the wonderful advice,
Ms. Jeong.

910
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,101
It's delicious.

911
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:36,823
This is great!

912
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:51,921
RISK MANAGEMENT TEAM
EMPLOYEE CHOI JUN-WOONG

913
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,215
You're still here?

914
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:55,758
Why?

915
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:00,847
I was just worried.

916
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:04,767
What do we do when we find someone
we have no idea how to help?

917
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:07,854
What do you think?

918
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:11,107
Our job is to still try to save them
despite that.

919
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,193
They are the only ones
who can free themselves

920
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,654
from their situation.

921
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:24,996
Our job is to offer them comfort,
sympathy, and support

922
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,333
rather than a solution.

923
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:34,047
Those things can be difficult
to come by in this harsh world.

924
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:35,673
And…

925
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:39,010
it's not like you're doing this alone.

926
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:41,137
Why are you worrying
about the future anyway?

927
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,138
Fine.

928
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:43,931
Okay.

929
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,310
Ma'am.

930
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:48,353
What now?

931
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,897
You know, at the emergency room.

932
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,024
Why did you leave it up to me?

933
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:58,071
I just thought you were
the right one for the job.

934
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:00,948
Based on what?

935
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,327
Call it an old person's instinct.

936
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,165
Now go home.

937
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,420
Okay.

938
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:22,595
Right.

939
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:29,435
I'll go ahead then.

940
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,314
Don't stay too late, ma'am.

941
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,831
EPILOGUE

942
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:57,296
My arm…

943
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,465
Come in.

944
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:11,060
What? There's more?

945
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,895
It's the handwritten record of souls.

946
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:17,608
The whole company is a mess
because of this damn virus.

947
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:21,487
Good job. I know The Escort Team
must have had the hardest time.

948
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:22,530
It's all right.

949
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:27,452
Machines may have made things easier,
but you can't let your guard down.

950
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:28,578
The easier things get,

951
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:33,291
the worse it might be next time
if we don't prepare for things like this.

952
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:37,462
I think we should have a backup grid
or system in place.

953
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:39,297
Okay.

954
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,214
So…

955
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:41,758
Come on in.

956
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,554
Here are the documents you need to sign

957
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:48,222
for the reexamination
of our network management system.

958
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:50,683
The System Management Team
asked me to pass them along.

959
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:55,354
Hey!

960
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:29,388
Someone sent me a private message.

961
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:32,350
I found people who use suicide
as a way to make money.

962
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,644
No. Don't do anything rash.

963
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:36,312
Never mind, I'll find this scammer myself.

964
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:37,772
Their ID is "Grim Reaper"?

965
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:41,400
"I'll join you too."

966
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:44,737
But we all promised
that we would die together.

967
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:45,780
He's here.

968
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:47,240
We have to get out of here.

969
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:50,284
I already died once,
I'm not scared of anything.

970
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:51,369
He's fine, right?
