1
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:41,541
Why did you have to say that
and ruin everything?

2
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,001
Wait.

3
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,589
Does this mean I have to stay in
a coma for three years before waking up?

4
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,343
All right, if that's how it is.

5
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,179
Then…

6
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,558
-Choi Jun-woong will go back into--
-I'll take him.

7
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,780
I'll take him.

8
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,042
EPISODE 3: FOREST OF TIME 1

9
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:24,959
Ma'am.

10
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,172
Working at Jumadeung is the epitome
of success in the afterworld.

11
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,008
You need to beat
thousands of other candidates to get in.

12
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:32,967
So why…

13
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,012
would you let a nobody like that in?

14
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:38,640
Excuse me?

15
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,309
What? A nobody?

16
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,562
I was pretty impressive
when I was alive too.

17
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,732
I'm someone with countless certifications!

18
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,650
I'm telling you!

19
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,152
He won't be just observing.
What were you thinking?

20
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,821
Do you really not know?

21
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,949
Why I accepted someone
with no basic skills or abilities

22
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,617
and who only gets into trouble?

23
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,121
No, I don't know.

24
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,414
So I can use him how I want.

25
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,516
Aren't you getting in?

26
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,434
Get in, Mr. Choi.

27
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,675
Isn't there a single thing here
that's normal?

28
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,260
REPORT CRIMINAL SOULS
CALL NUMBER 2482

29
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,012
REAPER ACT OF CONDUCT

30
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,978
This is the Risk Management Team's office.

31
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,650
It's a bit messy, right?

32
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,278
It used to belong to
the Special Crimes Unit,

33
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,113
which was a part of the Escort Team.

34
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,074
Special Crimes Unit?

35
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,953
They escorted the souls who go to Hell
for the crimes they'd committed in life.

36
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,456
It used to be led by our Team Manager.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,043
Move!

38
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,343
What about now?

39
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,095
The team was dissolved,
and now we use this office.

40
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,057
Why? Don't you like it?

41
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,975
No, not at all.

42
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,686
It's very sophisticated and retro…

43
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:53,650
It's so cozy I think it's a great space
to get some work done.

44
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,817
POTENTIAL SUICIDE CASE

45
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,820
Let me formally introduce myself.

46
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,072
I'm Lim Ryung-gu.

47
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,115
Ryung as in "high"
and gu as in "to rescue."

48
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,579
I'm sorry, I don't normally laugh
at other people's names.

49
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,206
I apologize, Mr. Lim.

50
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,876
Well. It's fine.

51
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,587
I'm used to people making fun of
my name since I was little.

52
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,297
Right.

53
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,091
Was your name Mr. Temp?

54
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,342
No.

55
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,136
Was it Mr. Contract?

56
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,098
I guess you can read a person
by the impression they give off.

57
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,100
-You're not the chill type, are you?
-Physiognomy?

58
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,060
-Yes.
-Let's say I'm very competitive.

59
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,479
I'm not the type
to back down from a challenge.

60
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,522
You aren't?

61
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,523
Neither am I.

62
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,821
-Mr. Lim.
-Yes.

63
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:40,738
Begin.

64
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,159
Hands out. Stand at attention.

65
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:51,499
I will begin explaining
the Code of Conduct for Jumadeung Reapers.

66
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,754
A Reaper may not dress or behave
in a way that compromises dignity.

67
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,509
It's my first time doing this.

68
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,552
This looks expensive.

69
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,512
There's not much
to spend on once you're dead.

70
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,430
I think

71
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,391
this is going to look really nice
once it's done.

72
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,976
You look like a rag doll.

73
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,020
You're right.

74
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,357
Keep looking forward.

75
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,611
You will receive a new
Resident Registration Number,

76
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,988
NAME: CHOI JUN-WOONG
DATE 10/12/2021

77
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,323
along with a new name.

78
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,160
NAME: KIM WOONG-JUN

79
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,536
But…

80
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,872
what if I run into someone who knows me?

81
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:31,956
Don't worry.

82
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,708
They'll see the new face we've inputted.

83
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,960
-What?
-It means they won't recognize you.

84
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,297
Not even my family?

85
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:40,965
Of course.

86
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:44,594
No Reaper may use their abilities
in front of humans

87
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,430
or intervene in human affairs

88
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,934
or leave any ties to
the Land of the Living.

89
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,811
TEAM MANAGER KOO
ASSISTANT MANAGER LIM

90
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,571
STANDARD AFTERLIFE
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

91
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,075
COMPANY NAME: JUMADEUNG INC.
EMPLOYER: JADE EMPEROR

92
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,120
And the most important part is,
from today,

93
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,292
the Choi Jun-woong
from the Land of the Living

94
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,129
is no longer.

95
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,800
I wanted to fill your shoes better

96
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,887
but this is how I managed to get a job.

97
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,849
Still, this is…

98
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,685
a pretty big company.

99
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,148
I don't think
there is another one as big in Korea.

100
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,025
So don't worry, Dad.

101
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,527
I'll do a good job

102
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:08,863
and go back to

103
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,575
Mother and Min-young in no time.

104
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,333
Stop drinking, Mom.

105
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:08,381
It's the anniversary of your dad's death.
I'm just feeling a little down.

106
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,423
Try to understand.

107
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,761
You know how our family is
unnecessarily frank and objective, right?

108
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,222
You want to drink because of Jun-woong.

109
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,725
You'll make Dad sad.

110
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,270
I told you it's not like that.

111
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,187
Please.

112
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,731
Mom, we need to prepare for
the long run with Jun-woong.

113
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:29,026
We can't lose our energy this early on.

114
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,069
Okay?

115
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,821
Goodness.

116
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,115
People say your own children
are the scariest.

117
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,660
They're not wrong.

118
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,211
Mom.

119
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,380
How come we don't have
any pictures with Dad?

120
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,348
Given the journalist he was,
your father was always the one

121
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,683
taking pictures of us.

122
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,728
If I had known he wouldn't return
from that business trip,

123
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,606
I would have taken a photo of him
that day he left.

124
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,316
You're right. What a pity.

125
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:10,818
Let's clean up.

126
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,571
I'm sure he's finished.

127
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,211
Bring it here. I'll wash it.

128
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,485
NAMGUNG JAE-SOO, AGE 29
STUDYING FOR POLICE EXAM

129
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,072
Name, Namgung Jae-soo. Age 29.

130
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,033
He's been studying for the Police
Academy Exam for the last three years.

131
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,494
His Negative Energy Levels
have surged recently.

132
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,664
But there's a problem.

133
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,540
What is it?

134
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,085
He's Jun-woong's closest friend.

135
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,753
What is the world coming to?

136
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,714
I feel like my job is just studying for
the Police Academy Exam.

137
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,676
ACQUAINTANCE OF CHOI JUN-WOONG
CURRENT NEGATIVE ENERGY LEVEL: 85%

138
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,513
Should we exclude Mr. Choi from this case?

139
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,142
Why? Do you think his personal feelings
will get in the way?

140
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,104
Yes.

141
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,524
Personal feelings
can help sometimes, right?

142
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,570
Anyway, why isn't he here?

143
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,613
Where did he go?

144
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,909
You don't think…

145
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:44,537
What?

146
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,423
A blind date?

147
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:00,678
Stop filming.

148
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,977
Give me back my shoes.

149
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,568
You think you can talk back to me
because I've been nice?

150
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,778
Piss off unless you want to die.

151
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,738
I worked part-time to buy them.

152
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:22,992
Jae-soo.

153
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,494
Namgung Jae-soo.

154
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,206
-Why are you being like this?
-Put the shoes on.

155
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,916
-Your face.
-Your face, smile.

156
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,543
DREAMS OVER GRADES
FRIENDSHIP OVER COMPETITION

157
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,836
Let's just go get a snack.

158
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,340
Give me back my shoes.

159
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,302
This dumbass is at it again.

160
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:43,971
Give them back.

161
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,229
Jae-soo in his designated spot.

162
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,481
Give them back already.

163
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,733
That's cute.

164
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,318
Hey, give me back my shoes!

165
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,402
You little.

166
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,783
No, getting involved
will only cause more problems.

167
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,494
Hey, give it.

168
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,579
Give it!

169
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,456
Give me my shoes.

170
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,542
Persistent bastard.

171
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,919
Let's end this today.

172
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,128
Give them back!

173
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:17,796
Hey.

174
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,140
My shoes.

175
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,099
Shoes?

176
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,559
Who are you?

177
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:33,812
What?

178
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,813
You surprised me.

179
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,441
What do you want?

180
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:44,281
Haven't you had enough?
Give him the shoes.

181
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,824
Are you friends with this guy?

182
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,576
Hey.

183
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,912
No, we're not friends.

184
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,414
Hey, you went to Seonam Kindergarten.

185
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:53,916
Seonam Kindergarten?

186
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,710
If we're from the same neighborhood
and in the same class, we're friends.

187
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,214
Three to two sounds doable.

188
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,340
Thanks, friend.

189
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,425
Please, three to two?

190
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,761
Wait.

191
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,221
Let me talk to him for a second.

192
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,726
Nice to meet you, friend.

193
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,020
Get ready, go.

194
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,897
Did you mess with my friend?

195
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,023
Really? Damn.

196
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,485
Hey, on three.

197
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,444
One.

198
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,071
-Two.
-Two.

199
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:27,324
-Three!
-Three!

200
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,210
Oh, man.

201
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,795
This is salty.

202
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,841
This is exactly when
you should eat fried chicken.

203
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,260
When you need cheering up.

204
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,095
What are you on about?
Did you get hit a lot?

205
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,265
So my father's factory
went under during the IMF,

206
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,975
and my family had nothing.

207
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,353
How are you so nonchalant about that?

208
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,689
It's not like your family
became penniless.

209
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,066
My family went under too.

210
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,862
For some reason, ever since then,

211
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,156
I get this craving for fried chicken
when I need a boost.

212
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,490
How are they related?

213
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,868
It's like how people eat samgye-tang
during the dog days of summer.

214
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:11,994
It's just chicken.

215
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,204
That's a long story just to say
you want fried chicken.

216
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,708
I failed today, but I'll go again tomorrow
to get them back.

217
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,711
-Get what back?
-I need to get my shoes back!

218
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,504
Are you insane? Have you gone crazy?

219
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,342
Failure means you should try again,
Jun-woong.

220
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,428
Who came up with that nonsense, Jae-soo?

221
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,346
My father.

222
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,932
Such wise words from your father!

223
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,310
Tell him I'd like to meet him someday.
I want to hear his wise words in person.

224
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,478
He passed away.

225
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:40,940
A long time ago.

226
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,110
Sorry, I can't say anything
without putting my foot in my mouth.

227
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,239
Anyway, failing isn't bad.
Let's just accept this one as a failure.

228
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,242
Stop shaking your head
and let's just fail.

229
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,161
-I don't want to get beat up again.
-No.

230
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,081
I'm going again tomorrow.
I'll get my shoes back.

231
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,416
Look at you.

232
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,002
You persistent bastard.

233
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:09,760
Hey.

234
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,097
Hey, Jae-soo.

235
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,559
Jae-soo!

236
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,189
Seriously.

237
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,399
You, hey, you!

238
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,859
You're home, open your door!

239
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,278
Come on and open it already, you idiot!

240
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,489
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

241
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:32,992
Who…

242
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,743
are you?

243
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,454
It's me.

244
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,331
It's me, you idiot.

245
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,959
What if I run into someone who knows me?

246
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,753
Don't worry.
They'll see the new face we've inputted.

247
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:47,965
It's perfect.

248
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,591
NATIONAL ID CARD
KIM WOONG-JUN

249
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,385
What?

250
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,890
Hey, Jae-soo.

251
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:57,808
Open the…

252
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,978
Jae-soo, come on out.
I just need a minute.

253
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,816
Is this the police?

254
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,943
Please, you need to save my friend.

255
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,946
My friend's trying to
kill himself right now…

256
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,241
Please, come quickly. Please.

257
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,708
Here, quickly.

258
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,626
Jae-soo.

259
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,919
Jae-soo.

260
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,588
Jae-soo.

261
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,757
Someone called in a breaking and entering.

262
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,300
-What? Why?
-Come with us.

263
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,760
What? No.

264
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,928
Hey, sir. Wait.

265
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,430
RESIDENT DATABASE
CHOI JUN-WOONG

266
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,515
Choi Jun-woong.

267
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,392
9410124-1…

268
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,519
How many times do I have to tell you?

269
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,564
We need to go right now.
It's an emergency.

270
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,192
Give us your real name
and resident registration number.

271
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,401
What do you mean?

272
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,820
Will you take responsibility
if something bad happens?

273
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,448
Don't you know it's a crime to
use someone else's identity?

274
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,241
Tell us your real one, not someone else's!

275
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,910
I'm telling you that one is mine!

276
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,705
I'm telling you it's mine.
Why do you keep asking…

277
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,461
What are you doing here?

278
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,925
Hello. He's a close friend of mine.

279
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,134
He's been in an accident,

280
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,095
and he's not in his right mind,
as you can see.

281
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,889
-What are you talking about?
-Wait.

282
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,489
Did you forget?

283
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,282
They can't recognize you.

284
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,844
Thank you for your hard work.

285
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,222
Get it together.

286
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,308
How can I get it together
when my friend is supposed to die?

287
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,019
You should be more logical and reasonable
because he's your friend.

288
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,271
Please, I can't do that.

289
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,689
What are you going to do if you can't?

290
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,108
Even if he wasn't your friend,
we need to save Namgung Jae-soo.

291
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,738
Can you really save Jae-soo?

292
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,241
Give me the report.

293
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,076
This is his third year
taking the Police Academy Exam.

294
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,661
This year, he failed the first exam.

295
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,164
The first one?

296
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,334
No, that can't be.

297
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,003
He always passed the first one.

298
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,338
Come on, just a little more.

299
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,633
What's the situation now?

300
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,593
Don't you have any more?

301
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,553
-Bye.
-Bye.

302
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,888
He's not doing anything.

303
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,692
-I'm back.
-I'm back.

304
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,069
It's as if

305
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,238
time has stopped for him.

306
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,450
He won't leave his house.

307
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,367
What should we do?

308
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,707
Fried chicken, fried chicken.

309
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,751
Fried chicken should do the trick.

310
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,669
-What are you talking about?
-Is that all you need?

311
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,047
From where? You can get it delivered--

312
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,256
No, not like that…

313
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,175
The chicken Jae-soo
used to eat with his dad

314
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,384
when he was around six years old.

315
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,929
He always talked about it
whenever he had a hard time.

316
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,356
Even if you're a Reaper,
there's no way to go into the past.

317
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,858
How can you be sure
that fried chicken will make him better?

318
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,401
Memories are easily distorted.

319
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,862
-I don't agree.
-Mr. Lim's right.

320
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,572
Let's go see Namgung Jae-soo first.

321
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,574
We need to get him out of the house first.

322
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,036
I have a way.

323
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,295
We're here to spread the good word.

324
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,214
Can we have a moment of your…

325
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,097
He's sharper than we thought.

326
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,057
It seems so.

327
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,684
Seriously?

328
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,187
Excuse me.

329
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,273
I mean, really.

330
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,484
Who on earth opens their door
to cult members these days?

331
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,320
Then what? Do you have a better idea?

332
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,217
FAILURE MEANS YOU SHOULD TRY AGAIN

333
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,806
WHO ARE YOU

334
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,727
COME OUT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW

335
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,608
What did I tell you?

336
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,277
This isn't going to work.

337
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,657
That idiot.

338
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,703
Never mind, just tear the door off
and drag him out.

339
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,417
What?

340
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,733
He's fast for a guy
who never leaves his house.

341
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,194
He's preparing for the police academy!

342
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,696
Stop chatting and run!
We're going to lose him!

343
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:48,825
Wait.

344
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,161
Let's teleport.

345
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,330
Teleport.

346
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,373
No, there are security cameras!

347
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,168
What kind of Grim Reaper
is scared of security cameras!

348
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,212
Not even ghosts can get around
security cameras.

349
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,213
Really?

350
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,422
Hey, Jae-soo!

351
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,465
Hey!

352
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,849
Where's Jae-soo?

353
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,059
I lost him.

354
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,228
Let's split up.

355
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,896
You go there and you go that way.

356
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,064
Okay.

357
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,110
The signal.

358
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,489
Where on earth are you?

359
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:34,454
What?

360
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:36,998
SEOUL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

361
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,961
That's the hospital I'm at.

362
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:22,335
Heo Na-young, born September 27th, 1993.
Death by car accident.

363
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,171
Escort her.

364
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,047
No, I can't go like this.

365
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,926
Wait, please. Just for a minute.
Let me say goodbye.

366
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,803
Your time in the Land of the Living
has come to an end.

367
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,515
Please.

368
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:15,931
Of course.

369
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,391
I knew you couldn't have sent it.

370
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:55,345
Jun-woong! What's wrong?

371
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,931
Hey, Jun-woong.

372
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,562
Excuse me, sir.

373
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,814
Crap, he's tachycardic.

374
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,065
-Get me the defibrillator, quickly.
-Okay.

375
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,245
-Charge to 100.
-Yes.

376
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,859
Are you crazy?

377
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,278
Choi Jun-woong.
Stop making trouble and stay still.

378
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,530
Who are you to tell me to stay still?

379
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:56,865
You nearly died.

380
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,452
Explain so I can understand.

381
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,288
A newbie who doesn't know the basics.

382
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,582
-What?
-A subordinate with no sense of duty.

383
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,209
And a team manager from Hell.

384
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,380
Looks like this team won't last
for much longer.

385
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,882
Maybe I was worried for no reason.

386
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,635
No. You were right to be worried.
And you should stay that way.

387
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,560
NAMGUNG JAE-SOO, AGE 29
STUDYING FOR POLICE EXAM

388
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,321
I'll send my people in advance…

389
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:40,533
Team Manager Koo.

390
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,412
Seriously.

391
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,009
I mean…

392
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,095
what did I do wrong?

393
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,471
Do you really not know?

394
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,932
You didn't read the contract, did you?

395
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:04,849
The contract?

396
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,560
The clause stating
a temporal error will occur

397
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,355
if your temporary body
gets close to your real body.

398
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,273
So?

399
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,317
Your memory will be erased randomly…

400
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,153
You didn't read it.

401
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,823
So what if I lose a little of my memory?

402
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,659
You could forget your own face.

403
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,619
Then you can't return to your own body.

404
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,163
Simply put, you'll die.

405
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,457
Die?

406
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,419
Why are you telling me
something so crucial now?

407
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,087
You should have read the contract!

408
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,173
Come on.

409
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,300
Yes, I didn't read it.

410
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,970
Then I suppose you read
all your contracts thoroughly?

411
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,763
Down to the last clause?

412
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,432
Mr. Lim Ryung-gu?

413
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,100
I do.

414
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,018
I read every single word.

415
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,063
Thoroughly.

416
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:01,281
You have to be born like that
to be that annoying.

417
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,059
Who are you?

418
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,395
Why do you keep following me?

419
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,939
You're drunk.

420
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,275
Stay seated. Please.

421
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:54,375
Look at you, spending money
when you don't even have a job.

422
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,921
As if you're not broke too,
studying for the civil service exam.

423
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,215
That's why

424
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,467
I only spend money

425
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,511
-when it's a bang for your buck!
-when it's a bang for your buck!

426
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,597
You know what you're talking about.

427
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,352
Jun-woong…

428
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:20,735
Jun-woong.

429
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,199
It feels like hell.

430
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,078
I soldiered on with the hope

431
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,289
that one day my day will come, but…

432
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,292
The final thing we're going over
is liability.

433
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,796
Legal liability means
civil and criminal liability.

434
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,173
For criminal liability…

435
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,779
2022 POLICE ACADEMY RECRUITMENT EXAM

RECRUITMENT NOTICE

437
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,546
What did I do that was so wrong?

438
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,966
How come I'm the only one
who can't make it?

439
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,555
I worked my ass off studying every day.

440
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,099
What for?

441
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,018
Why!

442
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,360
I know.

443
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:49,115
It feels like everyone's moving ahead…

444
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,622
and I'm the only one who's lost my way.

445
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,666
Like I'm the only loser.

446
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,086
Like I'm the only one standing still.

447
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,052
But you were always someone
who tried until you succeeded.

448
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,803
Right?

449
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,096
You…

450
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,352
You're not like this.

451
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,482
I was barely holding on.

452
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,360
But you're not here,

453
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,196
and I've reached my limit.

454
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,504
Don't cry!

455
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,426
Never mind, cry it out.

456
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,228
I want fried chicken.

457
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,231
What?

458
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,485
Hey.

459
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:12,573
Hey, Jae-soo.

460
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,326
Hey.

461
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,286
Come on.

462
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,122
Jae-soo.

463
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,790
Wake up.

464
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,009
You heard it, ma'am, Mr. Lim.
We really need…

465
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,177
We really need that fried chicken.

NAMGUNG JAE-SOO, AGE 29
STUDYING FOR POLICE EXAM

467
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,642
When did you say
he had that fried chicken?

468
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:40,810
When he was six.

469
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,270
What are you going to do?

470
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,480
There's no way to go into the past.

471
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,486
Then we make a way.

472
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,363
You keep an eye on Jae-soo.

473
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,824
I'll be back
before your end-of-work alarm rings.

474
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:55,825
I'll come with you.

475
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,162
No. Do you have any idea
how dangerous this is?

476
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,621
He's my friend.

477
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,083
He's my friend, so I really want to help.

478
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,043
I said no!

479
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,961
I'll do everything you say.
I won't even talk back.

480
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,298
And I know the neighborhood
since I used to live there.

481
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:11,799
So…

482
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,468
please, ma'am.

483
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,455
Aren't you supposed to be working?

484
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,374
I came to borrow the car.

485
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:51,089
You know that going to the past
was banned a long time ago,

486
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,549
since it never ends well.

487
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,552
Not to mention it often has
a negative impact on the present.

488
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,805
I don't want to go either.

489
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,724
-But I have to.
-No.

490
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,392
Let me go.

491
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:06,354
Why on earth are you going anyway?

492
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,566
To get fried chicken.

493
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:12,985
Fried chicken?

494
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,655
Fried chicken…

495
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,491
Yes…

496
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,408
Okay.

497
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,910
Right, fried chicken, right.

498
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,537
Yes, fried chicken.

499
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,081
Right, you should be the one to go.

500
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,875
Mr. Baek has the key,

501
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,001
so go ask him for it.

502
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:30,878
Okay.

503
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,176
Fried chicken.

504
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,909
I know, the 12-hour limit.
I won't be able to return if I'm late.

505
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,496
-Twelve hours…
-Okay.

506
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,539
Thank you.

507
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,000
Thank you.

508
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,858
Look at all this!

509
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,319
Ma'am!

510
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,488
This is my dream car, can we take this?

511
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,406
This one.

512
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,742
Can't we take this one? This one, come on.

513
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,660
Let's take this one!

514
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,622
No? All right. I'll yield.

515
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,832
I'm yielding voluntarily.
You have to remember that.

516
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,792
How far are you going? How far…

517
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,794
This one here at the end?

518
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,214
This one is good. I like this one too.

519
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,635
Where are you going?

520
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,636
Where are you going…

521
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:03,888
You're not…

522
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,431
No, come on.

523
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,725
Come on. Why?

524
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,186
Why would you leave this great car
and take that one?

525
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:12,855
Get in.

526
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,317
This…

527
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,570
It looks like it won't even start.

528
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,281
Okay, fine, getting in.

529
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,789
It looks dangerous.

530
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:33,334
Why can't we take that car?
Why this one out of all the cars?

531
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,336
Jeez.

532
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,837
It's bumpy.

533
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,175
No!

534
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,085
YEAR 1999

535
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,176
Look at that.

TICKET OFFICE

537
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,781
We really went back in time, right?

538
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,700
Stop looking around and start navigating.

539
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,120
Oh, right. Go straight.

540
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,211
Hello sir, this is Hoban Insurance.

541
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,088
We left a message
asking you to call us back

542
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,883
because we're missing
your insurance payment.

543
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,801
I haven't been able to pay my phone bill,

544
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,762
so I can only receive calls,
not make them.

545
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,764
When do you think
you can make the payment?

546
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,016
I don't think I'll be able to for a while.

547
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,604
Wait.

548

How much can I get back if I cancel this?

551
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,661
Well, this one
doesn't preserve your premium

552
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,289
so you don't really get anything back
if you cancel.

553
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,665
It's only if you pass away…

554
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,377
Okay.

555
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,045
Yes, I understand.

556
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,559
Jae-soo.

557
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,144
Since it's your birthday today,

558
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,356
do you want me to bring your favorite,
fried chicken for dinner later?

559
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,816
Yes!

560
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:02,733
Okay.

561
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,735
Then be a good kid
and listen to the teacher

562
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,404
until I pick you up later, okay?

563
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:07,863
Okay, let's go.

SEONAM KINDERGARTEN

565
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,623
Let's go.

566
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:18,833
Excuse me…

567
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,418
I'll see you later, Jae-soo.

568
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,169
-Excuse me, Mr. Namgung.
-Yes.

569
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,548
It's just the principal said
you're really behind on Jae-soo's tuition…

570
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:27,883
Yes.

571
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:28,926
I'm sorry.

572
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,803
I'll pay soon.

573
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,680
I mean, the principal says she can't…

574
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,528
No! I want to go!

575
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:53,242
I want to go to kindergarten!
It's my birthday party today!

576
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,208
Don't cry, Jae-soo. Don't cry.

577
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,377
I told you

578
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,714
we'll have your favorite fried chicken
tonight. Right?

579
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,341
Right. Fried chicken.

580
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,177
That's right.

581
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,263
Let's go now, okay?

582
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,222
Let's go!

583
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,312
I heard they went under during the IMF.

584
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,147
It really does seem like
they're struggling.

585
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,565
Let's follow him.

586
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,998
Welcome to Two O'Clock Date.

587
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:44,627
No way. They still have this show now.

588
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:46,587
Cool.

589
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,090
Do you need new socks?
I'll give you a good price.

590
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,470
Please come take a look.
They're at a great price.

591
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,526
Jae-soo, I'm just going to
quickly send this resume,

592
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,654
so if the police come,
tell them Daddy is coming back soon.

593
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:12,571
Okay.

594
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,765
It's 500 won per pair,
and 1,200 won for three pairs.

595
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,184
Men's socks here, women's socks there.

596
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,103
It's free to look around.

597
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,565
Jae-soo, what are you going to do
with the money you earn?

598
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:51,026
I need to pay Mom's hospital bills,
and I need to go to kindergarten

599
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,445
and if I have any left,
I'll eat something delicious with Dad.

600
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,992
How are you so nonchalant about that?

601
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,620
Wait, but mister.
How did you know my name's Jae-soo?

602
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,497
What?

603
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,499
I said that?

604
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:10,462
Yes. You said, "Jae-soo, what are you
going to do with the money you earn?"

605
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:14,883
What are you talking about? Me?
I didn't, I really didn't.

606
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:15,968
Right?

607
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:19,763
He said he didn't.

608
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:23,309
See, she says I didn't. I didn't.

609
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,314
-But you did…
-I didn't! I really didn't.

610
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,356
Please, believe me.

00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,572
My dad studies really hard.

613
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,782
He never sleeps and studies all the time.

615
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,327
I don't like studying.

616
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,870
-What do you like?
-Fried chicken!

617
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:46,248
Today, Dad said he's buying me
fried chicken because it's my birthday.

618
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,544
Yes, that. From where?

619
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,880
Which store sells your favorite flavor?

620
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,173
The one Dad buys.

621
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,549
The one Dad buys?

622
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,012
Right. It's 1999, so Texas?

623
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,681
Or Jonggatjib?

624
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,807
Jonggatjib?

625
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,018
No? Then…

626
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,481
Of course! The Mexican Sauce?

627
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:14,026
Right! The Mexican Sauce is the best.

628
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,780
Come on, how do you not know
the name of the fried chicken you like?

629
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:20,616
Is it the Mexican Sauce Chicken?
Jonggatjib? Where?

630
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,117
Come on, tell me.

631
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,538
You're on the same level as the kid.

632
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,916
He said his dad is buying it.
We'll know if we wait.

633
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,515
Yes, I sent my resume
and the analysis data.

634
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:46,350
Oh, you received it.

635
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,479
Really? Okay.

636
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,524
Please give me a call
if you have a spot open.

637
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,567
Okay.

638
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,870
I'm sorry, I'm in a tight spot this month.

639
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,414
Could you cut me some slack?

640
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,332
We already did.

641
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,544
If you don't pay the bill
in full this month,

642
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,295
-there's nothing we can do.
-I mean…

643
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,465
How can you say there's nothing you can do
when she's that sick?

644
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,009
You know there's nothing we can do
even if you do this to us.

645
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,481
I couldn't even make you
seaweed soup today

646
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,859
when it's your birthday.

647
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,779
Dad said he's buying me
fried chicken later.

648
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:41,905
Really?

649
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,450
Lucky you.

650
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,663
Mom, are you okay?

651
00:45:58,797 --> 00:45:59,715
Honey, are you okay?

652
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,550
I'm okay.

653
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,679
Let's go home, Jae-soo.

654
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,265
Honey.

655
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,477
The hospital bill is big, right?

656
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,230
I'm all better.

657
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,274
I can go home now.

658
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,234
What are you talking about?

659
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,656
Don't worry about it.
I took care of everything.

660
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,909
So don't worry about that.

661
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:31,079
You just focus on getting better
for Jae-soo here, all right?

00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,592
Oh, man. These can't get wet!

664
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,762
Jae-soo, you go in.

665
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,473
Don't come out, okay?

666
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,393
They're all wet. Gosh.

667
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,615
Jae-soo.

668
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:07,574
Jae-soo!

669
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,076
Jae-soo!

670
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,162
Jae…

671
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,415
I told you to stay in the car!

672
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:29,638
Who told you to do that?

673
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,522
I'm sorry, Jae-soo.

674
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,399
I'm sorry. It's okay.

675
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:43,151
Jae-soo, I'm sorry.
Daddy's sorry. It's okay.

676
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,112
It's okay.

677
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,079

680

Let's wrap it up in ten minutes.

681
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,722
Hey, you can't…

682
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,226
You can't do this out of the blue!

683
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,687
What do you mean I can't?
You haven't paid the rent in months.

684
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:20,147
I don't want to talk to you.

685
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,191
Still, you can't do this,
not when it's raining!

686
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:26,069
What are you getting angry at me for?
Do it by the law!

687
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,321
Like I'm not annoyed enough already.

688
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,656
Just how much more stuff is there?

689
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,493
-Dad.
-Jae-soo.

Mr. Namgung!

692
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,373
Crap. Mr. Namgung!

693
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,342
He said he had been happy…

694
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:33,011
Human memory is selective.

695
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:36,181
It keeps what was good
and discards the bad.

696
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,850
It wraps up the past in nostalgia.

697
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:43,021
Because that's the only way
you can keep on living.

698
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,651
I guess it was like that for Jae-soo.

699
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,111
Some people are the opposite.

700
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,990
Their past becomes more painful
as time goes by and becomes wounds,

701
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:58,036
and when they can't bear it anymore
they make that drastic decision.

702
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,166
-Let's go back.
-What about Jae-soo?

703
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,793
What about the fried chicken?

704
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,254
We'll have to find another way.

705
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:15,011
Since we've come all the way here,
I'll just go and say goodbye.

706
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:42,122
-Jae-soo.
-Yes?

707
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,166
Daddy will…

708
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,919
drop you off at Mommy's hospital.

709
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,796
Go be with Mommy.

710
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,591
Okay. You're coming there too?

711
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:55,385
Yes.

712
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,519
You know…

713
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,606
I love you so much, right?

714
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:08,523
Yes.

715
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,692
Dad, why are you crying?

716
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,946
I just have something in my eyes.

717
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,115
Okay.

718
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,618
All right.

719
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,538
I'll bring fried chicken, okay?

720
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,429
He's dropping Jae-soo off at the hospital
and going to buy the chicken.

721
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,744
You can go on your own, right?

722
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:09,459
Go on.

Mr. Namgung!

726

Are you out of your mind, Namgung Jae-soo?

727
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:49,833
Let's just talk for a bit.

728
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:54,045
Right, the fried chicken.

729
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,674
That fried chicken you had
in the happiest moment of your life.

It's coming.

So please!

732
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,974
Don't do anything stupid.

733
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,685
That day, on my birthday.

734
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:11,813
I finally understand

735
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,566
that look in my father's eyes.

736
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,538
Why is he going so fast?

737
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:32,334
That road leads to the outskirts…

738
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,007
What's wrong?

739
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,092
Do you really not know?

740
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,011
You don't mean…

745
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,196
Stop the car, sir!

746
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,113
Sir!

747
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,782
Stop the car, sir!

748
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:05,241

Hello.

753
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,888
You have a wonderful aura.
Did you just get a new job?

754
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,181
Yes.

755
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,683
I see.

756
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:12,976
I can feel it.

757
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,603
The life you've lived.
It's like a flashback.

758
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,313
A flashback? Jumadeung?
What department are you in?

759
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:19,065
If you're asking where I belong,

760
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:22,402
I guess I have to say with "that one."

761
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,570
Oh, the Director?

762
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,905
Well, I suppose since they are at the top.

763
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,783
They're the ones who called me.

764
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:36,124
So that's the Director?

765
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:40,378
Yes. He says if you don't give offerings,
your fortune will dry up

766
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,672
and things won't go your way.

767
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,091
The Director says,

768
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:48,553
if you keep on doing this,

769
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:49,596
you'll get punished.

770
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:54,642
I got conned by a cult member.
The word Jumadeung hooked me in.

771
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,151
Where are you going, sir?

772
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:08,698
You're saying the Director is here?

773
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,200
Yes, this way.

774
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,754
Goodness.

775
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:25,173
Your ancestors must have given
many offerings.

776
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:35,266
You're making me blush,
staring at me like that.

777
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,310
Why are you staring at me?

778
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:41,606

Choi Jun-woong, where are you going?

781

You got punished because of me.

782
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,852
I don't want the RM team to be dissolved.

I can't go to the afterlife like this.

785
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,735
Get more people here
and comb through the area.

786
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,487
You're the one who saves people
who are going to commit suicide,

787
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:30,947
right?

788
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,658
Do you not know getting entangled
with a runaway soul can cause trouble?

789
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:36,244
Go and find Heo Na-young.

790
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:39,205
She's related to our case.
We can't just hand her over.

791
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:42,167
If you keep getting in the way,
I won't hold back next time.

792
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,961
