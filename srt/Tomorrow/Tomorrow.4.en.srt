EPISODE 4: FOREST OF TIME 2 & TREE 1

2
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,838
NAMGUNG JAE-SOO, AGE 29
STUDYING FOR POLICE EXAM

3
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,508
Mr. Namgung!

4
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,103
Are you out of your mind, Namgung Jae-soo?

5
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,820
Let's just talk for a bit.

6
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,033
Right, the fried chicken.

7
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,661
That fried chicken you had
in the happiest moment of your life.

8
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,330
It's coming.

9
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,917
So please!

10
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,961
Don't do anything stupid.

11
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,672
That day, on my birthday.

12
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,926
I finally understand…

13
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,553
that look in my father's eyes.

14
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:44,896
Jae-soo.

15
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,526
Why is he going so fast?

16
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,321
That road leads to the outskirts…

17
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,994
What's wrong?

18
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,080
Do you really not know?

19
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,040
You don't mean…

20
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,627
HOBAN INSURANCE
GENERAL LIFE INSURANCE NON-DIVIDEND

21
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,045
The life insurance?

22
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:09,963
Yes.

23
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,181
Sir!

24
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,058
Stop the car, sir!

25
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,143
Sir!

26
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,769
Stop the car, sir!

27
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,229
Sir, can't you hear me?

28
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,523
Sir!

29
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,123
Hold on tight.

30
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,927
Sir, are you crazy?

31
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,304
Were you really trying to die?

32
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,723
I need to die.

33
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:44,933
Sir, please stop.

34
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,060
Stop it! Why are you interfering?

35
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:47,977
I need to die.

36
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,687
Wait, sir, stop.

37
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,730
Please listen to us.

38
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:54,192
No, please. I need to die.

39
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,112
Ma'am, Mr. Namgung is in danger.

40
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,697
I can't talk him out of it.

41
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,157
When will you be back?

42
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,326
-It's bad here too.
-Please! I need to die.

43
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,994
-Please!
-Hold on just a bit longer.

44
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:07,914
Okay.

45
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,300
Where's my mom?

46
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,135
She went to get treatment.

47
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,096
We're waiting on payment for the bill…

48
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,264
When's your dad coming?

49
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,515
My dad?

50
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,350
I don't know.

51
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,405
Dad.

52
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,700
When are you coming?

53
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,370
Who are you people to stop me?
I need to die, I have to!

54
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,454
I…

55
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,082
You can't. Please, just…

56
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,126
Just listen to us for a moment.

57
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,545
Stop it.

58
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,171
Today's your son's birthday.

59
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,091
I'm his father

60
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,553
and I can't even buy him
fried chicken on his birthday.

61
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,973
I'm going to die so that he can eat
without having to worry about money.

62
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,183
Who do you think you are?
I don't need anything else.

63
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,185
I'm going to die. I need to die!

64
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,645
Get it together!

65
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,315
Are you the only one who failed?

66
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,776
Others are struggling at the bottom,
just like you.

67
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,658
I woke up

68
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,202
to find my company bankrupt.

69
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,082
My debt is ballooning
with no end in sight.

70
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,292
I…

71
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,297
I feel like trash.

72
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:40,882
So what?

73
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,675
Does dying solve everything?

74
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,013
Do you think
your son and wife will be happy

75
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,557
with that insurance money?

76
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,354
Then…

77
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,483
What am I supposed to do?

78
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,737
It's…

79
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,699
It's the only thing I can do.

80
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,385
Go home now.

81
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,263
Tomorrow will be no different from today,

82
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,432
so will it be any different
a year from now?

83
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,894
I feel like I'm trapped
in a never-ending forest of time.

84
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,395
Don't think like that.

85
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,191
I guess I never had any happy memories.

86
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,568
Just like me,

87
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,153
my father…

88
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,076
Ma'am.

89
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,035
How is he?

90
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,703
His numbers on the Red Light
won't go down.

91
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,332
Keep a close eye on him.
We'll find a way no matter what.

92
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,084
When will you be back?

93
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,545
I'll call you again later.

94
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,504
Mr. Namgung!

95
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,098
Let's get the chicken, now.

96
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,100
Now?

97
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,980
We should at least get him the chicken.

98
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,650
The tunnel will close soon.
Then we won't be able to go back.

99
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:23,568
Let's go, quickly.

100
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:28,656
Sir.

101
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,534
Just wait a little bit.
We'll go get the chicken.

102
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,288
In the meantime, please think again about…

103
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,332
what's really important.

104
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,020
CHICKEN
BEER

105
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,275
MIND-BLOWING CHICKEN
FRIED CHICKEN

106
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,152
JONGGATJIB YANGNYEOM CHICKEN

107
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,165
What are we going to do?

108
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,667
It's late and there aren't
any places open…

109
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,211
There, up ahead!

110
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,087
Up there, here.

111
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,089
What is this?

112
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,132
JUMADEUNG CHICKEN

113
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,051
What's with the name of this restaurant?

114
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,599
Was this predetermined?

115
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,103
Why on earth are you going anyway?

116
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,064
To get fried chicken.

117
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,233
Fried chicken?

118
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:47,902
Fried chicken…

119
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,696
Yes…

120
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,656
Okay.

121
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,157
Right, fried chicken, right.

122
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,784
Yes, fried chicken.

123
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,203
Right, you should be the one to go.

124
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:01,082
Mr. Baek has the key,
so go ask him for it.

125
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,502
She knew.

126
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,129
Are you okay?

127
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,882
JUMADEUNG CHICKEN

128
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:18,808
Excuse me!

129
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,434
Excuse…

130
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,770
No one's here…

131
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,734
Looks like they're not open,
but all the ingredients are here.

132
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,320
It means we have to make it.

133
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,238
What?

134
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,283
Can you fry chicken?

135
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,243
I have a cooking certification.

136
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,161
You actually are useful.

137
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:42,832
Let's hurry.

138
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,767
FAILURE MEANS YOU SHOULD TRY AGAIN

139
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,563
JUMADEUNG CHICKEN
FAILURE MEANS YOU SHOULD TRY AGAIN

140
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,662
No.

141
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,831
It's his birthday, come on.

142
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,291
Try to make it happy and fun.

143
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,126
No way in hell.

144
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,305
Mr. Namgung, no!

145
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,723
-Mr. Namgung, stop!
-Let go.

146
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,641
Get down!

147
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,850
-Let go!
-Stop it.

148
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:25,935
I said, let go!

149
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,772
Why do you keep following me around?

150
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:30,731
Why?

151
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,650
Stop it now.

152
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:34,902
You…

153
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,196
don't really want to die.

154
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,281
You want to live!

155
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,702
Namgung Jae-soo.

156
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,038
Your fried chicken's here!

157
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,336
Here.

158
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,006
The fried chicken you had with your father
on your birthday.

159
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,553
JUMADEUNG CHICKEN

160
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,557
FAILURE MEANS YOU SHOULD TRY AGAIN

161
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,268
Failure means you need to try again,
Jun-woong.

162
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,854
Who came up with that nonsense, Jae-soo?

163
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,689
My father.

164
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,154
YEAR 1999

165
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,738
Okay. Get some rest now.

166
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:26,996
Dad.

167
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,209
Jae-soo.

168
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,397
Honey…

169
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,232
I know it's been difficult.

170
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,568
Thank you for being alive.

171
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:00,946
And I'm sorry.

172
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,158
I'll try harder from now on.

173
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,702
Honey.

174
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,413
The hospital bill.

175
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,957
It's a lot, right?

176
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,459
What do we do?

177
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,252
Money's not important right now.

178
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,462
All I need is you.

179
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,547
Don't worry, okay?

180
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,014
Jae-soo. Daddy brought fried chicken.

181
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,266
Fried chicken? Where?

182
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:42,446
Happy birthday to you

183
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,033
Happy birthday to you

184
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:49,662
Happy birthday, dear Jae-soo

185
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,164
Happy birthday to you

186
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,416
Happy birthday, Jae-soo!

187
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,336
Happy birthday.

188
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,423
Choi Jun-woong.

189
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,008
Right, the fried chicken.

190
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:04,885
Here.

191
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:05,970
JUMADEUNG CHICKEN

192
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,263
Enjoy.

193
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,183
Let it slide for now.

194
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,228
Jae-soo, happy birthday again.

195
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,272
Enjoy.

196
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,652
Jae-soo, enjoy the fried chicken. Bye.

197
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,696
That guy.

198
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,743
Jae-soo.

199
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,453
Let's eat.

200
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,998
It looks yummy!

201
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:38,919
Yes.

202
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,213
Yes. This is Namgung Hyun.

203
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,508
Yes, right. I did the analysis.

204
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,597
Okay.

205
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,391
Please call me if a spot opens up later.

206
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,101
I'll be waiting.

207
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:55,978
Thank you.

208
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,731
Honey…

209
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,902
Dad, are you okay?

210
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,532
FAILURE MEANS YOU SHOULD TRY AGAIN

211
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:12,870
Of course, I'm fine!

212
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,165
Failure means you should try again.

213
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,461
You just have to keep trying hard.
Then it'll work out one day.

214
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,378
It will.

215
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,551
Let's eat.

216
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,886
Let's eat and cheer up.

217
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,601
JUMADEUNG CHICKEN

218
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:38,938
I remember.

219
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,858
It's that fried chicken.

220
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,241
Right now, you feel like
you're falling behind others.

221
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,787
Even so, you should live.

222
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,582
Because the weather is nice.
Because it's cloudy.

223
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,000
So I shouldn't die.

224
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,126
Start from there.

225
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,171
As you live,

226
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,758
there will come a moment
when you realize it was all for today.

227
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,551
So…

228
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,804
live.

229
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,188
Jun-woong sent all of you, right?

230
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,941
He's alive, right?

231
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,735
You're right.

232
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,320
So you should keep on living.

233
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,031
Then you'll get to see him soon.

234
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,218
NAMGUNG JAE-SOO, AGE 29
STUDYING FOR POLICE EXAM

235
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,472
NAMGUNG JAE-SOO, AGE 29
STUDYING FOR POLICE EXAM

236
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,075
Hey.

237
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,162
Why are you crying again?

238
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,330
Don't cry.

239
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,295
This tastes so bad.

240
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,549
It's so terrible it's making me cry.

241
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,010
It's terrible.

242
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,390
I knew memories are unreliable.

243
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,146
It was good when I tasted it.

244
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,689
Can you please try it?

245
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,732
No, thank you.

246
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,942
I'm allergic to chicken…

247
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,403
Ma'am.

248
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,031
Mr. Lim!

249
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,881
Welcome to Two O'Clock Date.

250
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,926
No way. They still have this show now.

251
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,719
Cool.

252
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:21,391
Let's begin the show for today,
December 16th.

253
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,729
Do you all know about the fish,
the kissing gourami,

254
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,608
that was mentioned in
the recently released movie, Shiri?

255
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,902
They say this fish dies when its partner…

256
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,737
-Ma'am.
-Why?

257
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,824
Could you wait a moment?
I'll be right back.

258
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,534
Choi Jun-woong, where are you going?

259
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,469
Your dad is going away for work, right?

260
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,847
Your mom told you earlier to come home.

261
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,434
My dad's going to come back soon
and bring me this many presents.

262
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,435
And you.

263
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,062
Don't interrupt me.

264
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,106
I'm getting that one.

265
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,150
Your mom's going to get angry.

266
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:13,777
Please.

267
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,078
Oh, no! No!

268
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,247
No! My crown ttakji!

269
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,500
My crown ttakji!

270
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,717
I told Jun-woong to come home early.

271
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,681
I'll only be gone for about a month.
I'll see him when I get back.

272
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,599
Travel safely.

273
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,058
I'll call you when I get there.

274
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,644
Daddy's going to go now.

275
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,146
Bye-bye, Daddy.

276
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,109
Lose some weight, you little rascal.

277
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,862
It'll all go to your height, but still.

278
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,119
Wait.

279
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,627
Who drives like that?

280
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,426
Dad!

281
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,678
Dad.

282
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:22,971
My goodness.

283
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,850
Where have you been?

284
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,811
Listen to your mom
when Daddy's away, okay?

285
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,605
Okay?

286
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,773
It's Dad.

287
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:39,696
Excuse me…

288
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:44,868
I missed you.

289
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,497
Sorry?

290
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,292
This kid. He told me to tell you.

291
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,086
-I did?
-And…

292
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,215
he says he loves you.

293
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,092
That's also from him.

294
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,510
When did I say that?

295
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,136
You did.

296
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,723
Give him a hug.
He's going on a business trip today.

297
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,354
Good night, Dad. Dream about me.

298
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,898
Goodness. Thanks, son.

299
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:15,857
Little rascal.

300
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,905
He also said earlier
that he wanted to take a picture together.

301
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,074
You wanted to take a picture?

302
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,244
-Yes…
-All right, then. Shall we?

303
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,625
Jun-woong.

304
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,296
You ran into each other after all.

305
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,548
-We did.
-Good boy.

306
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,217
Jun-woong said he wants to take a picture.

307
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,052
So I thought I'd take one before I go.

308
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,764
Excuse me, and you are?

309
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,641
I…

310
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,769
I was just passing by.

311
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,692
He said he wanted to take a picture
with his dad today,

312
00:21:58,775 --> 00:21:59,943
so I helped.

313
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,322
Thank you.

314
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,991
Okay then, we have the film.

315
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,117
Excuse me.

316
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:08,785
I…

317
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,287
I'll take it for you.

318
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,288
Sorry?

319
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,831
I'll take the picture for you.

320
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,625
You've always been behind the camera,
so I'll do it for you.

321
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,211
Well, thank you.

322
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,504
Okay, then. If you please.

323
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,548
Shall we?

324
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,383
Thank you.

325
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,845
Okay, here we go.

326
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,182
-Look there. Look, look there.
-Come on, look that way.

327
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,558
One,

328
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,643
two,

329
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,896
three.

330
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,493
ONE YEAR AGO

331
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,306
Get out of the way!

332
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:46,133
The sexual assault of
a seven-year-old girl in 2010.

333
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,932
The sexual assault of
a five-year-old boy in 2017.

334
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,728
And a three-year-old?

335
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,857
And your punishment
in the Land of the Living was only…

336
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,195
Seriously?

337
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,201
Please, let me live!

338
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,329
What do you mean, let you live?
You're already dead.

339
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,087
Look forward to it.

340
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,840
Because I'm going to send you
to the most unimaginable Hell there is.

341
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,767
Seo Ju-wan, born 4:44, June 25th, 1982.

342
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,145
This life has been collected.

343
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,233
TEAM MANAGER PARK JUNG-GIL

344
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,568
Escort him.

345
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,029
Yes, sir.

346
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,073
Now?

347
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,244
What is it?

348
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,080
A soul that needs to be collected
will appear soon.

349
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,207
You escort him.

350
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,001
But I have a soul to escort…

351
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,628
I gave him to another Reaper.

352
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,548
There he is.

353
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,499
That man will take his life soon.

354
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:44,709
Take a good look

355
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,336
at that criminal.

356
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,129
Criminal?

357
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,824
Let go.

358
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,037
I said, let go.

359
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,164
No.

360
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,083
No, please. Help me.

361
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:29,087
I didn't want to die like this.

362
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,339
You are a Reaper,

363
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,758
why are you intervening in the life
and death of a living person?

364
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,760
Have you forgotten
your duties as a Reaper?

365
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,846
No.

366
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,682
No, please.

367
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,309
-Please.
-Let go!

368
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,782
So it's true.

369
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,078
That you're going to lead a team
that saves those from committing suicide.

370
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,789
Without even consulting me.

371
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,461
It was an order…

372
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,256
the Director gave me a very long time ago.

373
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,799
Suicide is a form of murder.

374
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,593
It's a brutal murder of themselves.

375
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,928
Their lives could have been
in that much pain.

376
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,557
They might not have had any other choice.

377
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,392
Pain is the essence of life.

378
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:29,647
It's a living human's fate to struggle
and move forward in spite of that pain.

379
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,404
My judgment to keep you
by my side was wrong.

380
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,367
I will be the one…

381
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,286
to escort that man's soul.

382
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,565
They're forming a disciplinary committee
because of this case.

383
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,403
Right. I will take all the responsibility
as someone who was at the scene.

384
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,320
Don't worry.

385
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,446
I'm telling you…

386
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,825
I'm telling you because I'm worried.

387
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,078
I'm sure I'm not
what you're worried about.

388
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,214
Will you move to another team
once you find your person?

389
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,092
I don't know what it means to you,

390
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,678
but I don't want the RM team
to be dissolved.

391
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,599
So I wish you wouldn't do
things like this from now on.

392
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,269
Is that a request or a threat?

393
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,562
Both.

394
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,942
Hey, what's with the vibe in here?
Did you two fight again?

395
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:59,070
Come on, make up.
Shake hands with each other, hurry up.

396
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,155
Come on, shake hands.

397
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,073
What are we, kids? We didn't fight.

398
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,408
We're done working, so go.

399
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,412
Then, good night.

400
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,930
What?

401
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,684
Why do you pretend to be a bad person?

402
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,395
I mean, at first, I also thought

403
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,690
that you had no filter
and that you were rude and violent--

404
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,733
Hey!

405
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:37,859
Yes, but…

406
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,570
you seem like a good person.

407
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:44,324
With the thing with Jae-soo and my father.

408
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:48,661
You're ridiculous.

409
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,040
You think I'm a good person

410
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,876
just because I rescued your friend
and helped you?

411
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,171
I'm from Hell.

412
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,425
So don't be mistaken.

413
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,687
It's cold.

414
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,799
2022 JUMADEUNG AUDIT REPORT

415
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,467
This is a report by the Audit Department.

416
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,263
Jumadeung Company Code Rule 11 Article 3.

417
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:52,976
No reaper may use their abilities
in front of humans.

418
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,353
Company Code Rule 13 Article 1.

419
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:59,357
No reaper may intervene in human affairs.

420
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,027
Do you admit you broke the rules?

421
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:04,737
Yes.

422
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,448
If you keep ignoring
the Company Code like this--

423
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:11,244
Save those who try to kill themselves.
Isn't it enough that I get that job done?

424
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,788
Not at all. The RM team is
only a part of Jumadeung.

425
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,498
If there's an uproar
from the disciplinary committee,

426
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,292
it could disrupt operations here.

427
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,212
Jumadeung is changing,
as is the Land of the Living.

428
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,590
I can't take only your side.

429
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,008
I never expected that.

430
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:28,177
Because I know you value balance
above any single soul.

431
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,764
An appropriate disciplinary measure
will be given. Do you agree?

432
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,100
Yes.

433
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,578
You startled me.

434
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,831
Standing here isn't going to
make Ms. Koo come out any sooner.

435
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,542
I'm going to go in.

436
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,795
What are you doing?

437
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,882
I said we should get that fried chicken.
It's my fault, so I'll go in and explain.

438
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,761
Ms. Koo was the one
who made all the decisions.

439
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,554
She said she would
take the responsibility.

440
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,432
I mean, we did save him.

441
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,226
Saving him is one thing
and the rules are another.

442
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,770
Wait.

443
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,813
Whose side are you on? Pick a side.

444
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,315
Are you on that side or our side?

445
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,776
You're being so immature.

446
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,362
What are you, a kid? There are no sides.

447
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,864
You're not on our side, are you?

448
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:31,616
That scared me.

449
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,201
Are you okay?

450
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,243
How did it go?

451
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,287
I got a week.

452
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,499
Why? What's the ring for? What is it?

453
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,585
She can't properly use her abilities now.

454
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,295
That ring can't be removed.

455
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,215
But she can still use them, right?

456
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,300
It causes a strong resistance.

457
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,344
There was even a Reaper
who turned to ashes.

458
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,103
So why didn't you stop her
when you were with her?

459
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,398
Never mind.

460
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:07,151
I should know better than to expect
more from you, Mr. Choi Jun-woong.

461
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,448
Do you think Ms. Koo is very angry?

462
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,619
Get ready to get an absolute earful.

463
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:18,746
You're dead now.

464
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:23,960
Wait.

465
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,686
Jeong-hwa, Jeong-ji, Min-jeong.

466
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,063
Why are you following me?

467
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,274
How did you know?

468
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,777
It's hard not to notice someone as big
as you following me like a lost puppy.

469
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,737
What?

470
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:53,990
Hit me.

471
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,326
Just punch me once.
You got punished because of me.

472
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,661
Only one punch?

473
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,330
Anything more than that
might cause issues,

474
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,623
but just hit me.

475
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,625
Okay.

476
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,878
I'll get it done in a single punch.

477
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,009
Ma'am. That scared me.

478
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,638
Ma'am!

479
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,936
I gave you your chance.
You didn't take it.

480
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,146
You can't change your mind.

481
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,939
Be quiet before I really punch you.

482
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,568
If you're that sorry, get me a coffee.

483
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,486
Okay.

484
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,740
Make it three cups, Mr. Lim's coming.

485
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:36,657
Okay!

486
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,537
MORTICIAN

487
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,127
-We'll let you know when they're ready.
-Okay, thank you.

488
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,440
You can see me.

489
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,484
Is my coffee out yet?

490
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,819
No, we're still making it.

491
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,570
It's not done yet.

492
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,989
You can see me, right?
I know you can see me.

493
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,868
Why are you pretending
you can't see me when you can?

494
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,745
The weather's lovely today.

495
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,957
The coffee's going to be great.

496
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,760
Why are you suddenly screaming at me?

497
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,554
You can see me, I was right.

498
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,224
You're the one who saves people
who are going to commit suicide,

499
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,351
-right?
-How did you know?

500
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,602
So, I'm right?

501
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,814
Do you know how long
I've been looking for you?

502
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,858
But where are the others?

503
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:56,696
The tall and pretty lady
with short hair who looks a bit scary

504
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,531
and the guy who dresses a bit funny.

505
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,951
Well, they're nearby.

506
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,997
That's a relief! I really did find you.

507
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,626
Well.

508
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,549
But…

509
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,468
how did you know about our team?

510
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,784
No, it can't be.

511
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:45,995
Na-young.

512
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,624
Na-young.

513
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,793
We need to let her go.

514
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,920
No.

515
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,548
Save her.

516
00:36:58,799 --> 00:36:59,717
Save her!

517
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,470
Please, save her, please.

518
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:10,811
Na-young.

519
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,689
No, Na-young.

520
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,155
No, please.

521
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,283
Na-young.

522
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,795
Woo-jin.

523
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,553
Heo Na-young, born September 27th, 1993.

524
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,888
Death by car accident.

525
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,890
Escort her.

526
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,767
No, I can't go like this.

527
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,352
Wait, please.

528
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,980
Just for a minute. Let me say goodbye.

529
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,856
Your time in the Land of the Living
has come to an end.

530
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,944
Please.

531
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,529
Ms. Heo Na-young.

532
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,156
If you do not cooperate,
we'll have to take you by force.

533
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,686
-Na-young!
-Na-young!

534
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,022
Na-young!

535
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,398
-Na-young!
-Na-young!

536
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,774
-Na-young.
-What is all this?

537
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,109
Open your eyes, Na-young.

538
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,486
Na-young!

539
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,989
It's me, your dad. Open your eyes!

540
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,284
What happens to me now?

541
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,245
You'll come and stay
at our company until your trial,

542
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,122
where they'll decide where you'll go.

543
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:56,000
Like Heaven or Hell?

544
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,836
It's not as simple as people think.

545
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,173
You might be reincarnated or
work at the company like I do.

546
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,302
A newbie who doesn't know the basics.

547
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,220
A subordinate with no sense of duty.

548
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,181
The Risk Management Team
is causing trouble again.

549
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,766
And a team manager from Hell.

550
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,018
What's the Risk Management Team?

551
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:17,146
It's the team the company created
to prevent people from attempting suicide,

552
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,066
but it's debatable
if they're actually effective.

553
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:24,070
Our team manager doesn't like
that team either.

554
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:30,910
Crap.

555
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,092
Mr. Choi Jun-woong,

556
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:49,387
do you not know getting entangled
with a runaway soul can cause trouble?

557
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:51,889
I know,

558
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,058
but she seems to know about our team.

559
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,768
It seemed like she had a story…

560
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,813
Please, could you help me? Please?

561
00:39:58,896 --> 00:39:59,855
You're already dead.

562
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,982
You should have gone quietly
to the afterlife.

563
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,235
You ran away,
and now you ask for our help?

564
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,196
What can you do?
In your state, what will you do?

565
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,116
I can't go to the afterworld like this.

566
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,411
Come on, ma'am, at least hear her out.

567
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,455
No. Report her to the Escort Team
before anyone gets the wrong idea.

568
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:18,624
Please.

569
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:19,959
Please…

570
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,169
Ma'am.

571
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,719
KANG WOO-JIN, AGE 29
SINGER-SONGWRITER

572
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,638
His name is Kang Woo-jin.

573
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,392
Age 29, a singer-songwriter.

574
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,688
He survived a car accident but was found

575
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,065
after having taken
a large number of sleeping pills

576
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,692
and is now hospitalized.

577
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:49,655
It says he's currently
very mentally unstable.

578
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,699
KANG WOO-JIN, AGE 29
SINGER-SONGWRITER

579
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,451
He's my husband.

580
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:57,621
Is he why you said
you couldn't go to the afterlife?

581
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,584
No one can save him but me.

582
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,085
Please, help me.

583
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:07,965
Please.…

584
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,759
They came faster than we expected.

585
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,057
Hey, wait!

586
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,310
Mr. Choi!

587
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,436
Let them go.

588
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:32,031
A soul refused escort
and has been on the run for ten days.

589
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,992
We picked up her signal here.

590
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,285
Did you happen to see her?

591
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,244
I did.

592
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,705
But I don't know where she is now.

593
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,457
Let's not hinder each other's work.

594
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,626
You asked if I saw her.
I told you that I did.

595
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,128
And I said I don't know
where she is because I don't.

596
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,713
How am I hindering your work?

597
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,340
-Hey.
-Stop it.

598
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,467
It's "ma'am" to you, not "hey."

599
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,386
If you want to ask questions,
at least respect her seniority.

600
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,722
Never mind, stop it. Let's go.

601
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:09,902
She said she saw the runaway soul
but doesn't know where she is.

602
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,111
The soul you lost, you mean.

603
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,905
She once worked in the Escort Team.

604
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:15,574
She knows very well what I'll do
if she doesn't hand over the soul.

605
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,536
Surely she hasn't hidden her away.

606
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,247
Isn't that right, Team Manager Koo?

607
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,542
As you can see, I'm in the business
of saving people now

608
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,252
and she's related to our case.

609
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,920
We can't just hand her over.

610
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:30,881
How arrogant of you.

611
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,259
Ma'am!

612
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:38,973
I seem to remember you as being quiet,
but I see you've become needlessly chatty.

613
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,267
I only said what needed to be said.

614
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,769
If you keep getting in the way,
I won't hold back next time.

615
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,402
Get more people here
and comb through the area.

616
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,195
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

617
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:00,953
Are you okay, ma'am?

618
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:04,331
Go and find Heo Na-young.

619
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,167
She couldn't have gotten very far.

620
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,086
What are you going to do?

621
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,796
We'll know when we go talk to
Kang Woo-jin.

622
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:13,674
That'll tell us

623
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,969
if Heo Na-young is going to be useful

624
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,138
in saving Kang Woo-jin.

625
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:52,504
Woo-jin…

626
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:04,933
Wait.

627
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,233
It's around here.

628
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,200
MAPO-GU DISTRICT MANAGER
LEE SANG-YUP

629
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,326
Let's see.

630
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,243
HEO NA-YOUNG

631
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,246
She's around here somewhere…

632
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:33,796
The Escort Team is here.

633
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,719
I think it's that house.

634
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,514
What do we do?

635
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:57,778
What do we do?

636
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,321
Seriously.

637
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:04,034
She's dead. Dead.

638
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,869
You killed her.

639
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,832
Do you really think I killed her?
When she's already dead?

640
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:16,713
Are you okay?

641
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,633
I hid her from the Escort Team
for a moment.

642
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:24,012
Thank you.

643
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,472
Can you really

644
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,933
save Kang Woo-jin?

645
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,436
Yes.

646
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,396
I can save him.

647
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,481
Please let me save him.

648
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,109
I'll be the one to save Woo-jin this time.

649
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,986
What do you mean, "this time"?

650
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,572
Can you elaborate on that a bit more?

651
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,325
Woo-jin…

652
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,829
was the one who saved me before.

653
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:55,586
I would have lived an empty life
if I hadn't met Woo-jin.

654
00:45:58,714 --> 00:45:59,965
I used to do ballet.

655
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:02,843
For such a long time that

656
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:06,388
I didn't even remember when I started.

657
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:13,312
Just as a life without ballet
was starting to seem unimaginable,

658
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,566
my ankles slowly started to hurt.

659
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,278
But I endured the pain
and kept practicing.

660
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,032
Because I was just about to enter

661
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,327
the ballet company of my dreams.

662
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,007
After the surgery,

663
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,551
I wasn't in my right mind.

664
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,680
Because my whole life had disappeared.

665
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,355
Rather than living like this,

666
00:46:57,022 --> 00:47:00,692
I thought dying
would be the better option.

667
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,864
It looks like a passing shower.

668
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,242
Maybe I wasn't quite done
with the world yet.

669
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,660
It's going to pass by soon,

670
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,454
so don't stand in the rain
all by yourself.

671
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,582
For some strange reason,
what he said made me cry.

672
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:53,787
After that, I didn't think
I'd ever see him again, but…

673
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:30,699
Thank you.

674
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,052
My name is Heo Na-young.

675
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,184
Hey.

676
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:01,021
Stop following me around.

677
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,856
How long are you going to chase me?

678
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,278
I'm following you around
because I'm your fan.

679
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,363
Isn't that obvious?

680
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,990
How is that obvious?
What are you, a stalker?

681
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:13,992
A stalker?

682
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,244
I mean.

683
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,537
I didn't mean that…

684
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,290
Or you could follow me around.

685
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,292
I'll allow that.

686
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,754
Why would I follow you around?

687
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:30,008
I know, that's why I'll do it.
Following you around.

688
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:32,928
Woo-jin…

689
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,222
was a lonely person.

690
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,120
We're closed…

691
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:45,167
What is this?
Did you follow me all the way here?

692
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:46,793
It's already closed.

693
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,883
So what do you do now?

694
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,806
-Are you sick?
-No.

695
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:00,932
Come on, let me see.

696
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:05,479
You're burning up.
Let's go to the hospital.

697
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,355
It's fine.

698
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,523
What do you mean?

699
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,361
You're burning up.

700
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:27,876
Are you okay?

701
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:29,419
Yes.

702
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,256
That's a relief.

703
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,008
Your fever's gone down.

704
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:39,679
I bought some porridge.

705
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,266
-So don't skip any meals.
-Okay.

706
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:45,936
Well…

707
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,564
I'll go now.

708
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,399
Get some rest.

709
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,028
Wait…

710
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:56,738
See you again.

711
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,959
Did you get home safe?

712
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,336
Thank you for that day.

713
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,260
I finished the porridge, thank you.

714
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:30,397
Just do it!

715
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,734
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

716
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:38,905
What are you doing?

717
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,171
Softer, like you're stroking it.

718
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,551
That was good, right?

719
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:02,971
You're good.

720
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,849
Shall we wrap up the lesson for today?

721
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:08,977
Okay.

722
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:14,399
Do you have a girlfriend?

723
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,151
No.

724
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:17,903
-Are you married?
-No.

725
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,072
-Do you like guys, then?
-No.

726
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,993
-Should I really go?
-No.

727
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,748
You said no.

728
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:31,791
You just said no, right?

729
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:35,170
I'm not going to go.

730
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,886
Do you want to kiss?

731
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:50,644
If you don't want to, never mind.

732
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,316
No.

733
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,503
Want to do it again?

734
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,740
Okay, let's begin.

735
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:50,787
Relax and think.

736
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,164
Then speak when you want to.

737
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:06,845
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

738
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:20,817
Time's up, right?

739
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,069
Mr. Kang Woo-jin.

740
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:26,698
Leave the thing in your pocket.

741
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,534
I don't know what you mean.

742
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,798
Do you think this will help you
meet someone dead?

743
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:46,926
What do you know?

744
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,847
What on earth am I supposed to do, then?

745
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:52,515
Cheer up?

746
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:56,102
I have to live my life well
if I don't want Na-young to be sad?

747
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:57,687
It's all bullshit.

748
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:58,897
Mr. Kang Woo-jin.

749
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,648
You don't know

750
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,318
what this pain is like!

751
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,779
You can't even imagine it.

752
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:09,824
Never mind, then.

753
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,786
There are plenty of ways to die.

754
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,621
Okay.

755
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,877
It's up to you later if you die or not.

756
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,671
You're right.

757
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,132
How can anyone know when they've never
gone through it themselves?

758
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,510
Everyone just pretends to understand.

759
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,763
Saying it must have been difficult,
it must have hurt.

760
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,017
But that's not what I want to know.

761
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:41,606
There's another reason, isn't there?
Why you've unraveled to this extent.

762
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:51,407
Because I killed her.

763
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,161
Dad.

764
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,412
You killed her.

765
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,289
You did it!

766
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,458
You killed her, didn't you? My Na-young.

767
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,210
You killed my daughter.

768
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:04,629
I killed Na-young.

769
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:07,966
I killed her!

770
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,519
EPILOGUE

771
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:29,904
No.

772
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:34,534
It's his birthday, come on.
Try to make it happy and fun.

773
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,411
No way in hell.

774
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,247
JUMADEUNG CHICKEN

775
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,924
Do you think I'm your girlfriend?

776
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:53,887
Am I your friend?

777
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,225
You're the head of our team.

778
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,146
Why you little…

779
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:05,857
Let's go.

780
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:45,271
You killed my daughter, didn't you?
Why did it have to be my daughter?

781
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,815
It's just as painful for the dead.

782
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,108
I can save Woo-jin.

783
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,736
Ma'am, unwelcome guests are on their way.

784
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:54,447
If something goes wrong, Woo-jin will die.

785
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,908
I'll escort you to the afterlife myself.

786
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:59,786
From now on, the RM team
will handle the soul, Heo Na-young.

787
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,497
It's all my fault. If it weren't for me…

788
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:05,875
You're gravely mistaken if you think
this is the only price you'll pay

789
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,502
for hiding a runaway soul.

790
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,128
Why are you doing all this?

791
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,256
Because we need to save Kang Woo-jin.

792
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:14,551
