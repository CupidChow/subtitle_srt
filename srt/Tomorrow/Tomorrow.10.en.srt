1
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,469
You must decide.

2
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,012
Whether you'll die with honor

3
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,390
or die by someone else's hand.

4
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,272
If you take another step,

5
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,024
I will cut you down.

6
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,442
Do it.

7
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:34,219
You said he only looked the same
but was a different person.

8
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,054
So why is Park Jung-gil…

9
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,014
Why is he trying to remember me?

10
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,975
He's supposed to be someone
who definitely shouldn't know me.

11
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,562
Is that why you're afraid?

12
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:49,359
Because you killed the person he loved?

13
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,531
I see you can't say you're not.

14
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,829
Sometimes, the truest words…

15
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,748
cut the deepest.

16
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,168
Why did you

17
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,046
entrust me with the RM Team?

18
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,507
So that you can achieve

19
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,759
what you desire.

20
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,263
I was intrigued.

21
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,641
Because it was the first time
anyone had been so bold.

22
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,914
EPISODE 10: BREATH

23
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,034
It's good.

24
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:29,250
Hey, I ordered an iced americano for you.
Where have you been?

25
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,293
Choi Jun-woong.

26
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,336
Focus.

27
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,795
Okay.

28
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,464
As you can see,

29
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,174
we have two cases this time.

30
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,011
Cha Yun-jae, Cha Yun-hui.

31
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,138
-They're same-age siblings?
-They're twins.

32
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:47,143
As you can see, the woman,
Cha Yun-hui's level is very high.

33
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,355
Cha Yun-jae's level is also higher
compared to that of the average person.

34
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,232
-Your drinks are ready.
-Okay.

35
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,151
You go, Mr. Lim.
I'm going to drill some sense into him.

36
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,445
-Pardon?
-Me? Why?

37
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,572
Go on.

38
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,159
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

39
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:05,995
Can't you read the room?

40
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,164
You think I'd tell you off
in a cafe like this?

41
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,501
There's something I need to tell you.

42
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,919
What is it?

43
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,505
So…

44
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,425
Come on, you're starting to scare me.

45
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,594
Just tell me already.
Did I do something wrong?

46
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,846
I'm saying this
in case you do something wrong.

47
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,683
You need to be more alert for this case
than you've ever been.

48
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,476
Why?

49
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,814
This case is
a sensitive matter to Mr. Lim.

50
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,483
So take good care of him.

51
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,402
So what is it about?

52
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,864
It's a sexual assault case.

53
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,559
Aren't you going to go inside?

54
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,562
No, I'm not.

55
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,075
The following footage is from a security
camera in Yanghyeon-dong, Seoul.

56
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,578
A man is assaulting a woman on the street.

57
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,497
As the woman attempts to flee,
the man follows…

58
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,127
The woman in the footage

59
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:37,628
is Yun-hui.

60
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,842
The assailant was sentenced to
two years of jail

61
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,511
and a suspended sentence
in the first trial.

62
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,638
That's way too little.

63
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,849
Yun-hui's parents filed an appeal.

64
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,479
So we have to bring their Negative Energy
Levels down, no matter what.

65
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,857
So they can appeal.

66
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:03,696
Because it could be uncomfortable
for Cha Yun-hui, I'll handle her.

67
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,532
You two go find Cha Yun-jae.

68
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,451
He's doing a one-person protest right now.

69
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,453
Okay.

70
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,883
Mr. Lim isn't like that
just because of the case, right?

71
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,888
Be honest and tell me.
That way, I won't make a mistake.

72
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,058
When he was young…

73
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,394
his mother was gang-raped.

74
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,565
Then she took her own life.

75
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,865
This case.

76
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,201
It'll be hard on him.

77
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,083
MYEONGSIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

78
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:10,888
Ms. Cha Yun-hui.

79
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,898
I'm the prosecutor in charge of your case,
Koo Ryeon.

80
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,236
PROSECUTOR KOO RYEON

81
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,129
REVISE SENTENCING GUIDELINES FOR
SEXUAL ASSAULT OFFENDERS!

82
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,381
Hello, are you Mr. Cha Yun-jae?

83
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:46,924
Yes.

84
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,135
I'm Choi Jun-woong, a journalist
with the Yeonha-gu local newspaper.

85
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,553
This is my colleague, Lim Ryung-gu.

86
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:51,888
Hello.

87
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,391
We came because we heard about your story
and wanted to help.

88
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,396
REPORTER CHOI JUN-WOONG

89
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,274
I see. Thank you.

90
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,318
It must be very hard.

91
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,652
It should be hard.

92
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,655
Because it's all my fault.

93
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,995
Is this a game to you?

94
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,040
I don't care if we win or lose,
so just stop.

95
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,958
Are you not thinking about
how things are for me?

96
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,585
It's all my fault, so just stop.

97
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,046
I don't want to see anyone,
so don't come either.

98
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,465
I'm never doing another trial.
That's that!

99
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,551
You heard me, right?

100
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,595
Just go.

101
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,513
No.

102
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,431
I want to hear more.

103
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,309
Look it up on the Internet,
if you're that curious.

104
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,936
It's all up there.

105
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,187
I saw all of that.

106
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,649
Will the law change
if I go with a different prosecutor?

107
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,735
I'm not interested in appealing.

108
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:48,986
Well.

109
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,988
I'm very interested in you, Ms. Cha.

110
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,034
And I believe in hearing things myself
and then making a decision.

111
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,624
I'll be waiting here,
so feel free to talk when you want to.

112
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,224
It's all my fault.

113
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,397
That she's like this
when she used to be so outgoing.

114
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,416
That she only wears
oversized men's clothing now

115
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,711
when she used to love getting dressed up.

116
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:49,839
If only…

117
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,926
I hadn't let her go that day like that.

118
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,683
Then that wouldn't have ever happened…

119
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,689
What is this?

120
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,610
Are you crazy?

121
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,611
Hey.

122
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,446
Don't call me "crazy"
when I just saved you.

123
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,239
Aren't you going to get up
and go to school?

124
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,866
Aren't you going to get an F
if you miss class today?

125
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,911
Hey. I'm already up. Come on!

126
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,332
Hey, I have plans
so I'm going to be late tonight, got it?

127
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,625
What? But I have plans tonight too.

128
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,209
Hey!

129
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,086
I told you not to make plans
on the same day.

130
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,088
Mom's been calling every day
since we moved out.

131
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,424
-What are you going to do?
-Fine. I'll take care of it.

132
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,717
So go away already.

133
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,469
Make sure you handle it.

134
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,180
You're so thoughtless, jeez.

135
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,931
So thoughtless.

136
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,600
-Hey!
-What!

137
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,936
That little…

138
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,188
Hey, let's drink.

139
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,522
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

140
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,024
My college life is ruined.

141
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,150
Only for you.

142
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,907
Why does it have to be here?

143
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,661
Don't act like you know me,
talk to me, or look at me. Got it?

144
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,037
Make sure of it.

145
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,247
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

146
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,917
That little…

147
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,087
How is it that you twins
even like the same bar?

148
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,840
Hey, you and your sister
really don't look anything alike.

149
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,760
-Yes, I know.
-Yes.

150
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,512
I thought twins all looked similar.

151
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,391
Thanks for the compliment.
This is the happiest I've been this year.

152
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,936
I'm always thanking my parents
that we're fraternal.

153
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,940
I'm getting stressed out.
Let's have another round.

154
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,274
I don't know, it's a bit too fast.

155
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,276
Hey, cheers.

156
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,112
-Come on!
-Cheers!

157
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,993
Should we get going now?

158
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:44,829
Go where?

159
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,418
Hey, Cha Yun-jae.

160
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,212
What?

161
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,965
Why are you acting like you know me?
Are you drunk?

162
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,176
When are you going to go home?
I'm going now.

163
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,302
Okay. Bye.

164
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,765
I'm scared. Can't you go home with me?

165
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,184
You're scared?

166
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,145
Are you talking about yourself?

167
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,729
I'm scared of you too.

168
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,440
You little…

169
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,192
I'm going for another round.
Just take a cab home.

170
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:19,071
What are you talking about?
Are you trying to drink yourself to death?

171
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,574
Let's just go home together.

172
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,952
Please?

173
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,080
Stop making those noises.

174
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,500
You're giving me goosebumps.
That sobered me up.

175
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,878
Just go already!

176
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,337
Fine.

177
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,923
You better be quiet
when you come home later.

178
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,303
You little…

179
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,097
Does it hurt?

180
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,140
Jeez.

181
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,435
Come on, take her home.

182
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,978
She said she was scared.

183
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,771
Didn't you just see that?

184
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,690
She's freakishly strong!

185
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,568
-Still, it's late.
-I think I'm going to throw up.

186
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,656
This tastes good.

187
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,165
Yun-hui, did you get a cab?

188
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,669
Couldn't get one so I'm walking.
Going to try again by the main street.

189
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,631
Call me when you get home.

190
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,258
Yun-hui, text us when you get home.

191
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,469
Okay.

192
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:35,940
Seriously, Cha Yun-jae?

193
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,405
Didn't you tell me to just go…

194
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,242
Be quiet and walk
if you don't want to die.

195
00:13:58,921 --> 00:13:59,880
The little…

196
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,249
Help!

197
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,625
Help me!

198
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,058
Call me when you get home.

199
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,560
Hello?

200
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,228
Mom.

201
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,314
You can call me if you're scared.

202
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,987
Hey, are you already asleep?

203
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,180
What, she's still not home?

204
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,772
She said she was scared.
Did she sleep at Eun-gyeong's?

205
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,282
I'm so sleepy. Whatever.

206
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,535
I should wash up and go to bed.

207
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,460
Hey, Dad. What are you doing here
at this hour?

208
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,256
You bastard. What were you doing?

209
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:10,302
Where were you
while Yun-hui went through all that?

210
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,515
What about Yun-hui?

211
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,688
Yun-hui…

212
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,202
Yun-jae.

213
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,747
What…

214
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,000
What happened to you?

215
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,128
Who…

216
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,423
Who did this?

217
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,967
Just tell me, who did this to you?

218
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,218
Stop it.

219
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,220
We need to get him.

220
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,555
No, Yun-jae.

221
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,725
Mom said she's going to call the police.
Please, talk her out of it.

222
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,184
What are you…

223
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,937
You want the guy who did this
to you to get off scot-free?

224
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:02,938
What about me then?

225
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,983
I don't want people to know about this.

226
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,444
I want to let it pass quietly
like nothing happened.

227
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,445
Are you crazy?

228
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,530
Will you take responsibility
if the word spreads?

229
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,742
This is why I told you not to overdrink
and just go home!

230
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,285
You just had to stay out and be reckless!

231
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,286
What?

232
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,079
Why were you walking there at that hour?

233
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,707
Bastards like that went after you
because you were there all alone!

234
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,167
This is your fault.

235
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,044
This is your fault!

236
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,546
I told you I was scared.
I told you to come with me!

237
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:31,133
If you had come with me, then none of this
would have ever happened to me!

238
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,551
This is your fault!

239
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,594
It's all your fault!

240
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,220
Get it together!

241
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,322
Please have mercy.

242
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,827
Please don't kill me.

243
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,163
Please don't…

244
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,667
If I don't kill you,

245
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,503
what will you do for me?

246
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,465
Please don't kill me.

247
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,468
Please don't kill me.

248
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:19,158
I'm so sorry. Please don't kill me.

249
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,661
I'm sorry.

250
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,662
You want to live?

251
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,372
Yes.

252
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,874
Then do as I say.

253
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,087
Don't scream.

254
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,006
Don't open your eyes.

255
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,259
When I leave, keep your eyes shut
and go only after you count to 1,000.

256
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,139
-Got it?
-Yes.

257
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,101
I have your ID.

258
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,771
If you call the police,
I'll come after you.

259
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,524
I won't.

260
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,903
Please, don't kill me.

261
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,301
One, two…

262
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,138
three, four…

263
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,807
LADIES' RESTROOM
PLEASE USE CLEANLY

264
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,142
Six hundred and eighty.

265
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,812
MEN'S RESTROOM
PLEASE USE CLEANLY

266
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,023
Six hundred and eighty-one.

267
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,526
Six hundred and eighty-two.

268
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,113
Six hundred and eighty-three.

269
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,231
I told you to shut your eyes
and count to 1,000.

270
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,611
I'm so sorry!

271
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,205
I'm sorry. Please don't kill me!

272
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,456
I'm so sorry!

273
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,626
I'm sorry. Don't kill me, please.

274
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,004
I really won't, so please don't kill me.

275
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,967
I'm sorry.

276
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,845
When the defendant put his hand
on your shoulder,

277
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,764
why did you walk with him
like nothing was wrong?

278
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,059
I thought it was my brother.

279
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,271
Didn't you tell me to just go…

280
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:58,358
My brother was at the same bar so
I thought he followed me to pull a prank.

281
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,318
WITNESS STAND

282
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,361
So when you realized
it wasn't your brother,

283
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,739
why didn't you shake him off immediately?

284
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,450
I realized he wasn't my brother
and tried to resist…

285
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,036
Be quiet and walk
if you don't want to die.

286
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,872
But he threatened
to kill me if I screamed,

287
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,373
so I had no choice but to follow him.

288
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,586
But you didn't actively resist him, right?

289
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,338
Right?

290
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,716
The little…

291
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,135
I did resist.

292
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:29,139
There were shops nearby open at that hour.

293
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:32,392
If you had actively resisted,
someone would have heard it.

294
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,478
I did resist.

295
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,022
The locks were broken
in the bathroom in the mall

296
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,940
that the defendant dragged you to.

297
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,359
I have your ID.

298
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,321
If you call the police,
I'll come after you.

299
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,740
-I won't.
-The door was open

300
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,533
so you could have easily run away.

301
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,620
What were you doing while your pants,
which are difficult to remove,

302
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,537
were being taken off?

303
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:56,166
If you had screamed loudly,
someone would have heard.

304
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,211
But no one heard anything.

305
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:02,422
You didn't actively resist
or make a desperate attempt to run away!

306
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,717
I…

307
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,843
Answer me.

308
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,554
-I…
-If you really hadn't liked it,

309
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,348
you would have resisted.

310
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:12,974
Even if you're a woman,

311
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,477
if you had truly resisted,
you couldn't have been assaulted.

312
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,480
Doesn't that mean you agreed
to the defendant's actions?

313
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,984
Objection, your honor!

314
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,822
What the defense is saying to the witness
is extremely inappropriate.

315
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,657
Sustained.

316
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,328
That will be all.

317
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,981
I heard he only got two years in prison.

318
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,070
Because he was drunk,
and it wasn't premeditated.

319
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,864
Because he's young.

320
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,159
Because he's a good student
and has a lot of friends.

321
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,370
Because he's in medical school
with a bright future ahead of him.

322
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,039
Letters of apology and volunteer work.

323
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,586
He was defended in all sorts of ways.
In the end, his sentence was reduced.

324
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,506
Just two years in jail and probation.

325
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,885
He won't be arrested
until the verdict of the second trial.

326
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,595
So he's technically innocent now.

327
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,307
Is that why
you're doing a one-person protest?

328
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,269
I thought it might help with the appeal.

329
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,063
You know, his parents.

330
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,192
They got him a new apartment
so he wouldn't feel down.

331
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,777
An expensive studio apartment
with a view of the university campus.

332
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,368
Every morning, he works out
at the gym in the building.

333
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,456
He studies at nearby study cafés.

334
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,625
-Come on, get it!
-Hey, you block it.

335
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,418
-Get that one. You're dead.
-Let's go.

336
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,961
He goes to Internet cafés with his friends

337
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,089
and goes drinking in the evenings.

338
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,897
He orders in food and goes to sleep
while looking at his phone.

339
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,198
He even joined a book club a few days ago.

340
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,079
Did you know?

341
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:44,084
That was something Yun-hui wanted to do.

342
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,589
Yun-hui's in the hospital
unable to do anything,

343
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,718
and he's living his life smiling all day.

344
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,636
Why?

345
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,391
I don't know why he's smiling.

346
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,316
I'm going to save Yun-hui.

347
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,612
I'm going to make him pay for his crimes.

348
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,200
That's the only way I can ask Yun-hui
to forgive me.

349
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,794
Please don't kill me,
I really won't do it.

350
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,713
-I swear!
-Cha Yun-hui!

351
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,006
Snap out of it!

352
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,718
Cha Yun-hui!

353
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:36,970
Just leave me alone!

354
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,265
I told you it was my fault.
I was the wrong one!

355
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,183
Everything happened because of me!

356
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,352
If only I hadn't been drinking that day.

357
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,688
If only I hadn't been walking there
at that late hour!

358
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,440
If only I hadn't been wearing clothes
like that!

359
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,943
It's all my fault, everything!

360
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,994
SEARCH: YANGHYEON-DONG

361
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,418
HONESTLY, SHE SHOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN OUT AT THAT HOUR

362
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,299
The unblurred security footage
of the sexual assault at Yanghyeon-dong…

363
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,052
Once saw the security footage,
I understood the guy.

364
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,763
The Yanghyeon-dong girl's famous now.
She even has a forum about her.

365
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,390
I saw the Yanghyeon-dong girl yesterday.

366
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,601
The security footage
of the sexual assault…

367
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,519
Then she shouldn't have been drinking.

368
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:47,874
That's why she shouldn't have gone around
drinking and wearing such tight clothes.

369
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,918
What was she thinking,
going around at that hour?

370
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,978
Is that why you cut yourself?

371
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,689
Because you thought it was your fault?
To punish yourself?

372
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,818
No.

373
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,112
To escape it.

374
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,323
Because no matter how hard I try,

375
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,243
my thoughts keep returning to that memory.

376
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,249
Those memories only stopped

377
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,626
when my skin tore off
from biting my nails in fear.

378
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,715
That pain lets me forget the fear,
even if for a moment.

379
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,302
Ever since then,
I needed to be in pain to live.

380
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,055
It was the only way I had

381
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:48,101
to run away from that memory
and my reality.

382
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,112
This scar is what's left
of every painful memory since then.

383
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,865
People say my scar is disgusting,

384
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,368
but compared to the pain I went through?

385
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:07,912
This scar is nothing.

386
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,085
But you know what?

387
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,883
What you're doing now is hurting me.

388
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,342
So please.

389
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,428
Please just leave me alone!

390
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:26,389
It'd be better to just die.
I've held on long enough.

391
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,975
So please,
just look the other way and let it go!

392
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,611
You didn't just "hold on long enough."

393
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,155
You held on remarkably well.

394
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:44,407
And what happened

395
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,326
isn't your fault.

396
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,204
You didn't do anything wrong.

397
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,414
You…

398
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,708
are a victim

399
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,669
who has survived that painful time
without breaking.

400
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,006
The world is still

401
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,966
on the side of the victim.

402
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,677
As am I, of course.

403
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,348
I hope you know that.

404
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,815
I'll come again.

405
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,287
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

406
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,624
Could you redo the bandage
on Cha Yun-hui's wrist?

407
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,875
It's bleeding through.

408
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,502
Yes, okay.

409
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,394
Her condition is worse than I thought.

410
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,481
She's refusing everything
and blaming herself.

411
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,279
I think the most important thing
is to get her out of that mindset.

412
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,363
What about Yun-jae?

413
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,739
It's the same with him too.

414
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:11,119
He feels especially guilty about saying
those harsh things to her at the hospital.

415
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,832
The incident is one thing,
but they hurt each other badly too,

416
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:18,334
when it has been hard enough
for both of them already.

417
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,923
We have some time before the appeal,
so we'll have to try.

418
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,801
Mr. Cha's preparing really hard
for the appeal too.

419
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,304
There's not only the one-person protest,

420
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,807
but also he's been investigating
everything the perpetrator has been doing.

421
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,393
Though the bigger problem is
that the bad guy is doing great.

422
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,313
What about Mr. Lim? Is he okay?

423
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,023
Yes, well, so far.

424
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,005
The world is still

425
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,673
on the side of the victim.

426
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,717
As am I, of course.

427
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,179
I'll come again.

428
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,195
Remember when the country
was in an uproar over the incident

429
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,655
that happened at Yanghyeon-dong?

430
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,032
Later, people were questioning
if what the girl said was true.

431
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,575
They were saying things like
how the guy was a med student,

432
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:36,245
so why would he grab a woman
off the street and rape her?

433
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,956
It seems that all that has died down.

434
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,626
But we can still see the girl's brother
doing a one-person protest

435
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,628
in front of
the National Assembly Building…

436
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,885
First off, if he's a med student,
that means he's smart.

437
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,888
He can retake the tests
and apply somewhere else.

438
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,640
He can even take the medical boards.

439
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,477
That's why the girl's brother
is protesting every day

440
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,354
in front of the National Assembly
Building to stop that from happening.

441
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,107
CHA YUN-HUI, AGE 23
STUDENT AT SEOHAN UNIVERSITY

442
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,567
Ms. Koo. Ms. Cha is…

443
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:11,447
I'll go to Yun-hui. You go to Yun-jae.
Take Mr. Lim with you.

444
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,657
Okay.

445
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,200
CHA YUN-HUI, AGE 23
STUDENT AT SEOHAN UNIVERSITY

446
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,166
Why are you here?

447
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,796
Why's your arm like that?

448
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,634
What are you doing?

449
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,386
I should be asking you the same thing!

450
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,680
Do you want to tell the whole world that
your sister is a sexual assault victim?

451
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,098
It's not like that.

452
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,267
We can't just leave him like that.
We have to do something!

453
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,978
I told you I don't need that.
I told you to stop it!

454
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,564
Okay. Calm down. You're bleeding.

455
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,358
What, this?

456
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,778
My heart's been torn up
thousands of times already.

457
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,489
You ruined everything,
just when I barely managed to forget.

458
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,576
Do you have to see it with your eyes
to know that I'm hurting?

459
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,703
Then you'll stop
when you see me die, right?

460
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:01,122
-It's not like that.
-How are you different from that bastard?

461
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,500
No, you're worse than he is.

462
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,795
Just please, get out of my sight!

463
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,672
Let's just all die instead!

464
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,220
Okay, I'm sorry.

465
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,973
I'll leave…

466
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,477
so please go to the hospital right now.

467
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,604
You're bleeding a lot.

468
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,095
She's not in her hospital room.

469
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,262
What about Yun-jae?

470
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,556
He's not here either.

471
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,350
Where is he?

472
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,896
The apartment is the only place
they could have gone.

473
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:07,980
Go there first.

474
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,651
CHA YUN-HUI, AGE 23
STUDENT AT SEOHAN UNIVERSITY

475
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,070
Hurry!

476
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,590
What are you doing? Put down the knife!

477
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,384
Don't any come closer, I'll cut myself!

478
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,762
Calm down.

479
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,722
We'll help you in any way we can, okay?

480
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,600
How are you going to help?

481
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,311
They appeal and protest
saying it's for me.

482
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,938
How is it for me exactly?

483
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,275
Why do I have to be exposed
in front of people again?

484
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,736
Your parents and Yun-jae started it
to help you.

485
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,654
That's funny.

486
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,073
My family was the first to blame me.

487
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,785
So why did you go around
at night like an idiot!

488
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:03,703
Dad.

489
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:07,957
What are you crying about?
Crying won't solve anything.

490
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,459
Mom.

491
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,296
They all blamed me.

492
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,716
Even Yun-jae, my best friend
and my brother.

493
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,093
This is why I told you not to overdrink
and just go home!

494
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,720
You just had to stay out and be reckless!

495
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,140
That wasn't what I wanted to hear.

496
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,310
Even the last person
I could depend on disappeared.

497
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,188
That's what hurt me most of all!

498
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,065
But now they say
they're doing this for me?

499
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,320
How am I supposed to understand that?
Why should I understand that?

500
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,657
Go! If you come any closer,
I'll really cut myself!

501
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,540
CHA YUN-JAE, AGE 23
STUDENT AT SEOHAN UNIVERSITY

502
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,084
Ms. Koo.

503
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,794
Mr. Cha seems to be in danger.

504
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,130
Go find Yun-jae.

505
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,090
I'll take care of things here.

506
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,267
Please, calm down.

507
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,478
No.

508
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,939
This can only end with me dying.

509
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:16,525
Those trials and those one-person protests
couldn't solve anything.

510
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,362
I've held on long enough.

511
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,324
So please just leave me alone!

512
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,246
Cha Yun-hui.

513
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:32,667
Cutting yourself like that will only hurt.
People don't die that easily.

514
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:38,130
Don't pretend like you know
when you haven't gone through it yourself.

515
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,048
Yes.

516
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,175
I don't know what you went through.

517
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,635
But…

518
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,762
I know a lot about doing that.

519
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,069
Do you know what happens
when you cut your wrist

520
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,406
intending to kill yourself?

521
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,456
The hot blood runs from your wound,

522
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,377
and you can feel your heart
beating like crazy

523
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,462
as if it's there at your wrist.

524
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,674
You cut yourself

525
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,803
because you didn't have anything left
in this world that you care about,

526
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,640
but you find yourself lingering,

527
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,351
realizing the regrets
hiding behind the pain.

528
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,319
I thought everything was my fault.

529
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,405
Because I felt guilty
for even being alive.

530
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:51,954
Ryeon.

531
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:56,625
Why would you choose to…

532
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,963
How could you go before your father?

533
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,300
Ever since that day,

534
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,053
I've been constantly living in regret,

535
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,181
for a very, very long time.

536
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,768
So please, don't keep blaming yourself

537
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,686
for what happened that day.

538
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,897
You are the victim.

539
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,732
Not the perpetrator.

540
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,817
He's the one

541
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,445
who hurt you unilaterally.

542
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,909
No one can or should blame you.

543
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,160
Even if…

544
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,955
it's yourself.

545
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:44,840
Can someone

546
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,635
with a scar as ugly as this

547
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,263
really live a proper life?

548
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,892
It's not ugly.

549
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,978
It's proof…

550
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,273
of how desperately you wanted to live.

551
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,615
In order to live.

552
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,284
Because you wanted to live.

553
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,167
So live, Yun-hui.

554
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,352
I want to live.

555
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,397
I wanted to live.

556
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,751
Our officers went to see Yun-jae before.

557
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:05,963
He's apparently blaming himself

558
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,508
for everything that happened that day.

559
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,803
You and Yun-jae

560
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,056
care for each other more than anyone else.

561
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,726
You're just a bit out of sync.

562
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,438
How are you different from that bastard?

563
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,441
No, you're worse than he is.

564
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,902
Just please, get out of my sight!

565
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,820
Let's just all die instead!

566
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,865
Ma'am, what do I do?

567
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,867
Yun-jae.

568
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,160
Please, find Yun-jae.

569
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,704
What are you talking about?

570
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,623
I…

571
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,834
I told Yun-jae to die.

572
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,378
That he's just like the bastard.

573
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,963
To get out of my sight.

574
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,966
I said it because I was angry.

575
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,135
I didn't mean it. What should I do?

576
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,649
Mr. Lim, where are we going?

577
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,234
To Tak Nam-il's house.

578
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,444
But I thought we were looking for Mr. Cha.

579
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,947
If I were him,
I would have killed this bastard first.

580
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,534
It says Building 105 here,
but this is Building 104.

581
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,077
We need to look for Mr. Cha…

582
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,248
Damn it.

583
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,294
REVISE SENTENCING GUIDELINES FOR
SEXUAL ASSAULT OFFENDERS!

584
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,046
This is so funny.

585
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,299
You're actually laughing.

586
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:37,596
I have heard you were living your life
completely unaffected, laughing all day.

587
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,349
But you actually are laughing.

588
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,267
What, who are you?

589
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,687
How did you get in?

590
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,652
Damn it.

591
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,328
Hey.

592
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,372
I see.

593
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:04,748
Now I know who you are.

594
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,504
You were hired by the brother
of the bitch I messed up, right?

595
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,214
You bastard!

596
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:16,510
There's no need.

597
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,138
Don't get blood on your hands.

598
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,726
Because I'm going to kill this bastard.

599
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:24,643
Please.

600
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:28,314
What? You want to become
a news sensation like his sister?

601
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:55,633
Mr…

602
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,468
Mr. Lim.

603
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,432
Wait, Mr. Lim!

604
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,142
Damn it.

605
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,686
-Why are you not stopping him?
-Why would I?

606
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,063
The bastard deserves to die.

607
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,272
Mr. Cha Yun-jae!

608
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,650
This isn't the time for you
to be doing this.

609
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,734
I know.

610
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,279
That I deserve to die too.
That I'm the same as that bastard!

611
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,406
Why are you the same as that bastard?

612
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,784
I know you want to kill him,

613
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,494
but this isn't a problem
that can be solved like that.

614
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,454
-You know that too!
-No.

615
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:28,248
It'll only end when that thing dies.

616
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,459
That's the only way Yun-hui
and I can be happy.

617
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,504
Okay.

618
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,923
Then kill him

619
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,509
and you die too.

620
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,136
Wasn't that the plan?

621
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:43,764
But…

622
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,933
if I were you.

623
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:46,892
I wouldn't do that.

624
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,228
I would go to Ms. Cha.

625
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,360
I don't deserve to do that.

626
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,612
Because it's all my fault.

627
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:00,447
Damn it, if it's your fault…

628
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,574
If it's your fault,
then go and tell her you're sorry.

629
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,159
Even if she pushes you away!

630
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,662
Even if she refuses your apology,
tell her that you are sorry.

631
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,208
You think everything will be fixed
if you disappear?

632
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,835
What about the people who are left?

633
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,838
Who do you think
is suffering the most right now?

634
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:23,429
Think of how much pain Ms. Cha must have
been in all this time, all by herself.

635
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,513
A one-person protest.

636
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,306
Revenge.

637
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,058
Instead of doing those things,

638
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:29,810
stay by her side.

639
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:32,688
Go and tell her

640
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:36,024
how glad you are that she lived,
that she held on.

641
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:37,693
Please.

642
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:40,571
I could die

643
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,073
in place of my precious sister…

644
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,410
if I have to.

645
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:53,876
But I was scared.

646
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,380
That she would hate me.

647
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:02,050
That she would resent me. That's why…

648
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,354
So hurry up and go be by her side.
Right now.

649
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,457
Mr. Lim!

650
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,751
No Reaper may intervene in human affairs.

651
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,127
-Did you forget that?
-Get out of my way.

652
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,004
-Mr. Lim, please!
-Stop it.

653
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,344
Why?

654
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,305
No one protected

655
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,016
either Ms. Cha or Mr. Cha.

656
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,101
That's not your job.

657
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,437
Who are you, people?

658
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:58,023
Who are you to fight over me?

659
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,610
You think you're some
caped crusaders of justice?

660
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,238
You think you guys
are some sort of heroes?

661
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,491
Why don't you keep on trying, damn it.

662
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:11,370
Let's see who dies first,
me or that bitch.

663
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,330
Mr. Lim.

664
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,126
Get it together, Mr. Lim.
You can't do this, not like this.

665
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,004
Bastards like this need to be put on trial

666
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,923
and receive their due punishment.

667
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:25,551
I'm sorry.

668
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:32,933
You're all being ridiculous.

669
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,602
Wearing those clothes and drinking…

670
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,981
it's all to flirt
and get a rise out of men.

671
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,234
She's the one
who got me all excited first,

672
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,361
-so why's she suddenly blaming me--
-What?

673
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,491
You know.

674
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,285
You're pretty too.

675
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,453
As pretty as that bitch.

676
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,413
This bastard…

677
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,544
You really are hopeless.

678
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,713
I'm going to erase your memory anyway,

679
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:04,840
but let me hit you, just this once.

680
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,769
COURT

681
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,612
Sexual assault is the only crime

682
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:30,157
where people say that the victim
is in the wrong too.

683
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,742
But why

684
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:35,037
do assailants think it's okay
to do such a thing?

685
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,290
Because she was wearing revealing clothes?
Because it was night?

686
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:41,251
Because it was somewhere deserted?
Because he'd been drinking?

687
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:46,423
If that's the case, every one of you here
will become the target of these crimes

688
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:48,550
and they will be justified.

689
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:54,389
There is no reason
that could justify a crime.

690
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,016
Not even if

691
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,103
he is in his 20s
with his life ahead of him.

692
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,898
Not even if he's a medical student
with a bright future.

693
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,902
A momentary mistake?

694
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:11,031
I wonder if you could say that
if your own child had been the victim.

695
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,866
-She's right.
-That's true.

696
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,286
Sexual assault…

697
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,373
is the murder of the soul.

698
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:23,502
From now on, assailants should
receive punishments as criminals,

699
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:27,839
regardless of their excuses.

700
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,091
That is why

701
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,885
I request the following sentence.

702
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:34,930
The average life expectancy
in Korea is 83,3 years.

703
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:37,808
Taking away 23 years for the age
of the victim, leaving 60 years.

704
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:42,145
A total of 138 related videos
and 9,826 related online comments,

705
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,647
each converted into one year.

706
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,483
I request that the defendant,
the murderer Tak Nam-il,

707
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,236
be sentenced to 10,024 years in prison.

708
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,696
Yes!

709
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,178
Quiet!

710
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:16,930
Order in the court.

711
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,602
Thank you, Yun-jae.

712
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,313
For persuading me to come to the trial.

713
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,402
Actually, the prosecutor asked me to.

714
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,489
I see.

715
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,784
Still, thank you.

716
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,870
I'm glad I came.

717
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:46,168
Thank you for surviving,
and for holding on, Yun-hui.

718
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,880
I should have told you that first,

719
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,758
but I only hurt you.

720
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,265
It couldn't be helped.
We were both blaming ourselves.

721
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:05,937
I turned it on you
because my own pain was so immense,

722
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,399
when it wasn't even your fault.

723
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,153
I'm sorry.

724
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,407
I'm sorry too.

725
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,288
From now on,
don't avoid the world anymore.

726
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:26,082
Don't run away and don't hide.

727
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,088
I'll be with you by your side.

728
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,343
Okay.

729
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,645
I'm glad things worked out
with Ms. Cha and Mr. Cha.

730
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,188
It won't be easy,

731
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,607
but they'll support each other
and overcome this.

732
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,777
Mr. Lim's going to be okay, right?

733
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,237
He should be.

734
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,947
I've never seen him like that.

735
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,990
Speaking of which,
I should give him a call.

736
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,285
He's an adult. He'll get through it.

737
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:03,995
Don't worry about it.

738
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,481
Are you kidding me?

739
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,733
Fifteen years? The crazy bastards.

740
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,861
Hey! Do you know who I am?

741
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,696
Do you think my father
won't make you people pay for this?

742
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:40,073
I'm going to appeal
and get my revenge on all of you, damn it!

743
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,952
-Hey, be quiet.
-You'll pay for this. What's your name?

744
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:47,747
Guard, what's your name? Hey, you bastard!

745
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,833
Answer me! Tell me your name, damn it!

746
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,877
Guard, answer me!

747
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,300
You bastards, lecturing me
when you can't even drive?

748
00:52:58,383 --> 00:52:59,593
Open the door.

749
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,181
Damn it!

750
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,184
What?

751
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,519
Wasn't there someone here?

752
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,146
Maybe he fell under the bridge.

753
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,480
Hurry up and look for him.

754
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,570
What are they doing?

755
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:29,831
They take all that tax money,
but look at the state of this bus, jeez.

756
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,006
Who the hell are you?

757
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,883
Can anyone just get on like this?

758
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:45,055
Tak Nam-il, born 3:44 a.m,
on September 27th, 1997.

759
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,515
This life has been collected.

760
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,351
What's all this now?

761
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,940
You'll die from a heart attack,
ten minutes from now.

762
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,276
I cannot change your lifespan,

763
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:01,196
but you won't mind
if I change the way you die, right?

764
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,990
It's a shame to let
someone like you die so easily.

765
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,752
Fire!

766
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:18,129
Guard. There's a fire!

767
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,840
Guard. Fire! There's a fire!

768
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,258
Yell all you want.

769
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,843
They won't be able to hear it.

770
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,223
Open the door.

771
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,350
Help me!

772
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,936
Put the fire out!

773
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,771
Open the door, damn it.

774
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,898
Open it. Please.

775
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,191
Save me.

776
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,860
The legs that chased her.

777
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,154
The arms that held her down.

778
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,615
The mouth that laughed,
the eyes that gazed.

779
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,411
Limb by limb, you'll be engulfed
by the flames of Hell.

780
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,665
It will be extremely painful.

781
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:55,333
I'm sorry.

782
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:58,336
I'm sorry. Okay?

783
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,797
I'm sorry!

784
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:19,733
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE
URGENT TRANSPORT

785
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,589
Hey.

786
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:45,675
-You call that a drawing?
-You're really asking for it.

787
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:46,968
Just keep studying.

788
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:47,969
Okay.

789
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,512
What is it?

790
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,555
Mother.

791
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:36,935
Yeong-sik and Chang-bok
keep making fun of me.

792
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:41,564
What did they say
that has you crying so sorrowfully?

793
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:45,318
They keep making fun of my name,
saying it's weird.

794
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,696
They said it's like a dog's…

795
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,247
They sure don't know anything at all.

796
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,624
Your name is a wonderful one.

797
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:00,834
Really?

798
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:01,960
Of course.

799
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:06,047
A noble monk of great virtue chose it.

800
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:07,590
Come here.

801
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,514
Ryung as in "high."

802
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:16,850
And gu as in "to rescue."

803
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,894
It means someone who will
save many from a high place.

804
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,984
You know how to write too, Mother?

805
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:31,281
Not all the letters,
but I know enough to teach my son.

806
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:37,662
Mother, there's so much you know,
and there's nothing you can't do.

807
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:40,165
Really? Do you really think so?

808
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:42,208
Yes.

809
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:54,948
I heard that Mr. Lim killed someone

810
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,658
while he was still among
the Land of the Living.

811
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:58,701
Do you know what kinds of rumors
are going around at the company right now?

812
00:58:58,785 --> 00:58:59,827
What you heard is true.

813
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,997
I escorted Ryung-gu
because he committed murder.

814
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:05,917
Ms. Koo, please tell me.
What exactly happened to Mr. Lim?

815
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,710
Why is he hurting so much like that?

816
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:09,754
It's been a while, Geum-hong.

817
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:11,923
I am no longer a kisaeng.

818
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,050
When it comes to a cloth
that has been sullied,

819
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:17,136
the stain will never go away no matter
how hard you try to wash it out.

820
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:21,724
As a woman, I no longer wish
to add to my own shortcomings.

821
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:24,477
It seems as though that Geum-hong
has forgotten her true self.

822
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,314
If only those bastards
didn't do that terrible thing,

823
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,607
then both you and Yu-hwa…

824
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,150
What terrible thing?

825
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,946
