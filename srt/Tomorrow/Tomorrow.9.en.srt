1
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,122
You.

2
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,207
Why were you there?

3
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,667
No.

4
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,880
Why was I there?

5
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,798
Where?

6
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:50,717
In my nightmares.

7
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,971
All Reapers remember
the last life they lived.

8
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,766
The same goes for me too.

9
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,311
Yes. Even though I don't want to.

10
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,355
In the memories of your past life,

11
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,274
was I there as well?

12
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,194
No, you were not.

13
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,697
My past life was full of sins.

14
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,908
There's no way we could've encountered

15
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,452
or even passed by each other in that life.

16
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,497
As you have said,

17
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,957
it was just a nightmare.

18
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,669
Yes.

19
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,713
It was just a dream.

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,468
I shouldn't have said anything.

21
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,220
Forget that I said it.

22
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,654
MIRACULOUS COVER LETTERS

EPISODE 9: SOMEDAY, BECAUSE OF YOU

24
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,408
Choi Jun-woong, get up already!

25
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,830
The sun's been up for hours,
it's practically setting.

26
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:02,872
Wake up, come on.

27
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,334
-Mom, just five more minutes.
-Get up right now.

28
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,254
-Goodness. Aren't you going to get up?
-Mom.

29
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,340
Why are you doing this to me
first thing in the morning?

30
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,258
Jeez.

31
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,137
Mom?

32
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,013
Yes, what?

33
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:20,932
I mean…

34
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,101
-Is it really you, mom?
-Gosh.

35
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,353
Of course! I'm your mother.

36
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,647
What? What's going on?

37
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,566
What about Team Manager Koo and Mr. Lim?

38
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,443
What "Team Manager"?
You're unemployed, for crying out loud.

39
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,446
He must have lost it
after all the rejection.

40
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,783
Hey, watch your mouth when
you talk about your brother.

41
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,910
What? It's not like what I said is wrong.

42
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,662
He is unemployed.

43
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,622
Mom.

44
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,916
Min-young.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,459
Mom, Min-young.

46
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,171
Mom…

47
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,130
Oh, jeez.

48
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,426
Mr. Choi? Do get up now.

49
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,888
No, just five more minutes.

50
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,016
Mr. Choi?

51
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,440
No!

52
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,067
No!

53
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,452
You must find the company
to be very comfortable.

54
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,745
To sleep like that.

55
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,788
Anyway, it's a shame.

56
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,750
If you hadn't woken up,
you would've become a full-time employee.

57
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,501
Gosh.

58
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,837
I almost swore right then and there.

59
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,174
You…

60
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,059
TEMPORARILY CLOSED
DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

61
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,230
Is something really up?

62
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,448
Did something happen? Why is it closed?

63
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,743
Who are you?

64
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:04,911
What?

65
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,622
I asked, who are you?

66
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,628
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

67
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,881
Who are you?

68
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:17,882
It's me, you idiot.

69
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,550
What?

70
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,094
Right…

71
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,305
Did something happen to the owner?

72
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,182
Yes. She's a little unwell.

73
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,393
-Where? How much? Did she get hurt?
-What?

74
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,355
I mean…

75
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:36,192
It's just that I can't eat tteokbokki
from any other place.

76
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,194
I get cranky
if I don't eat it for a while.

77
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,990
-Okay.
-Yes.

78
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,163
Yes, hello?

79
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,331
Yes, that's right.

80
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,125
Grade Eight?

81
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,168
Yes, I can teach all subjects.

82
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,754
Okay. I'll send you a text.

83
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,589
Okay.

84
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,303
She'll be on a break for a while.

85
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,015
You do private tutoring?

86
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,726
Yes. Why?

87
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,437
My nephew's in middle school.

88
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,856
Really? I tutor middle school students.

89
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,318
I'm taking some time off from college,
so I have the time.

90
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,777
If you want to hire me,

91
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,072
you can look up Choi Min-young
on the Neighborhood Teacher app.

92
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,824
You're taking time off from school.

93
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,367
Yes, I have to make money.

94
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,370
But you have to keep this a secret
from my mom.

95
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,497
Okay.

96
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,501
Okay then.

97
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,295
Please let me know.

98
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,179
TEMPORARILY CLOSED
DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

99
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,859
SEOUL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

100
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,248
Jun-woong!

101
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,376
-Get me the defibrillator, quickly.
-Okay.

102
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,961
The clause stating
a temporal error will occur

103
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,256
if your temporary body
gets close to your real body.

104
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,175
You could forget your own face.

105
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,052
Then you can't return to your own body.

106
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,887
Simply put, you'll die.

107
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,272
This is as far as I can go…

108
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,529
Yes. It's nothing, really.

109
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,405
I took the meds.

110
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,034
Why are you making such a fuss?
Fine, I'm hanging up now.

111
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,869
Hello.

112
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,246
Hello.

113
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,999
Aren't you the owner of Jung-im's Snacks?

114
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,334
Yes, I am.

115
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,002
Right.

116
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,506
I can't eat any other tteokbokki
besides yours, you see.

117
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,093
I've only eaten your tteokbokki
since I was born.

118
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:11,848
Really? I wonder
why you don't look familiar, then.

119
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,852
It's not that I'm a regular or anything.

120
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,103
I just go every now and then.

121
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,522
I haven't been able to go lately
because something came up.

122
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,440
I see.

123
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,609
So why are you here?

124
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,028
It can't be a good thing
to run into you at the hospital.

125
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,532
My friend is here.

126
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,242
I see.

127
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,955
For me, my son is here.

128
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,585
Right, I saw that your store was closed.

129
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:41,836
Oh, that.

130
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,672
My daughter made such a fuss about me
not looking well,

131
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,132
so we're closed for a bit.

132
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,344
Goodness, you must have gone
and found it closed.

133
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,471
It's no big deal.

134
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,848
Still, it's nice seeing you here.

135
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,435
You're right. Fancy us
running into each other like this.

136
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,354
Goodness.

137
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:01,772
Are you okay?

138
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,609
Yes, I'm fine.

139
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,236
I've lost my sense of balance

140
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,530
now that I'm getting older and all.

141
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,741
Thank you.

142
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:15,578
I'll give you a lot of extra food
the next time you come.

143
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,582
I have to go wash up my son.

144
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,439
What's wrong with him?

145
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,985
I don't know.
He's been like this the whole time.

146
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,030
Choi Jun-woong, did something happen?

147
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,490
It's nothing.

148
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,326
If it's nothing, then get it together.

149
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,994
Okay, I'll get it together.

150
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,541
Jeez!

151
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,376
I said I'd get it together, I mean it.

152
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,169
What?

153
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,296
What's this?

154
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,423
Out of the suicide risk cases
we've had so far,

155
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,342
Namgung Jae-soo had the highest
Negative Energy Level, at 98 percent.

156
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,511
It's a very high-risk case.

157
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,640
-Thankfully, we can track the location.
-Let's go.

158
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,147
Gosh.

159
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,276
Jeez. Let's just teleport.

160
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,735
It's at 99 percent now!

161
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,115
There are many security cameras.

162
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:41,747
What?

163
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,630
-Choi Jun-woong!
-Mr. Choi!

164
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,048
Hey, Choi Min-young!

165
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,602
Choi Min-young, are you crazy?

166
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,395
Are you out of your mind?

167
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,857
-I don't have my business card on me.
-Okay.

168
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,900
I'll save my number on your phone.

169
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,193
We'll compensate you,

170
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,696
whether it's for the car repairs
or any psychological trauma.

171
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,242
Are you okay?

172
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,410
Yes, I'm okay.

173
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,789
Are you all right?

174
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:42,683
I've seen this puppy the past few days
around where I go to tutor.

175
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,645
I saw it on the road
so I went to rescue it.

176
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,190
You're the customer from before.

177
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:55,488
You can't rush out there like that.
You could've really hurt yourself.

178
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,156
You should think of yourself too.

179
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,699
You're right.

180
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,577
But I couldn't think of
anything else other than rescuing it…

181
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,498
Thank you.

182
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,749
Sure.

183
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,712
Could you…

184
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:16,884
I rescued it, but I can't take it with me.

185
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,429
Don't worry.

186
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,933
-We'll take care of it.
-Wait, we will?

187
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:29,230
Okay, thank you very much.

188
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,564
His name is Kong.

189
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,066
Here.

190
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,403
Thank you.

191
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,154
Thank you.

192
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,659
Who was that? You acted like you knew her.

193
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,246
She's my younger sister.

194
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,124
I guess it's in your genes
to jump into things recklessly.

195
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:53,671
I've handled…

196
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,215
the compensation.

197
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,010
What are you planning to do?
It's not like we can take it to Jumadeung.

198
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,929
That doesn't matter.

199
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,598
He's the suicide risk case.

200
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,267
-What?
-He…

201
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,185
He is?

202
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,440
FAMILY
ADDRESS

203
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,738
I thought only people
were on The Red Light…

204
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,657
It's not technically limited to humans.

205
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,326
But this is very rare,
so it must be some kind of error.

206
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,247
It's also my first time seeing
a suicide risk case that's an animal.

207
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,374
It's the same as it is with humans.

208
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,501
There must be a reason
why they tried to commit suicide.

209
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,378
We need to find that reason

210
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,172
and save them.

211
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,299
Animals are no exception.

212
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,093
His owner might be looking for him.

213
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,471
Let's start by checking all
the nearby veterinary clinics.

214
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,598
-Okay.
-Okay.

215
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,270
VETERINARY CLINIC

216
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,230
Goodness.

217
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,149
Hello.

218
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,652
This little guy is Kong.
Do you have his owner registered here?

219
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,112
PATIENT SEARCH: KONG

220
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,492
We don't have any dogs
under the name of Kong.

221
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,619
Really?

222
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,205
-Okay, then. Thank you.
-Sure.

223
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,458
Can I get some information
on a dog named Kong?

224
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,128
Did you mean this Kong?

225
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,173
I guess they just have the same name.

226
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:20,966
Thank you.

227
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,345
VETERINARY CLINIC

228
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,143
He's not registered at our clinic.

229
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,563
Seeing as how he has a collar,

230
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,732
it does mean he had a family.

231
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,527
Is there a possibility
that his owner lost him?

232
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,446
Then they must have
lost him in the neighborhood.

233
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,407
Dogs can usually find their way back,
at least near their home.

234
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,911
I don't think he's a dog
from this neighborhood.

235
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,919
Let's check how Kong is doing first.

236
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,170
Okay.

237
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,967
He had a family, so why…

238
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,843
That means he might have been abandoned.

239
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:13,102
Kong is inside resting
and drinking some water.

240
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,187
He's around 13 years old.

241
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,273
But he's so small!

242
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,609
-Looks aren't everything.
-How long has he been out on the streets?

243
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,696
Judging from the tear marks
around his eyes,

244
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,824
I'd say it's been around three weeks.

245
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,494
It seems like someone
took good care of his teeth, but…

246
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,080
-What about his general health?
-Well…

247
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,918
It's pretty bad.

248
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,795
Why? How bad is it?

249
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,256
I don't think he has much time left.

250
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,883
He's an old dog.

251
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,678
And given the stage he's in,
the owner must have known too.

252
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,056
I think you should prepare yourselves
for the inevitable.

253
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,227
I mean, seriously.

254
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,771
How could someone abandon a sick dog?

255
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,982
He should burn in hell.

256
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,280
What is it? Come on.

257
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,866
Let's not jump to conclusions.

258
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,161
We don't know anything for sure yet.

259
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,954
KONG

260
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,706
How do we get Kong's levels down?

261
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,376
It's hard because we don't have any clues.

262
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,670
We have to start looking for a way.

263
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,924
Choi Jun-woong, go and talk to
the Editing Team at Jumadeung.

264
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,425
The Editing Team?

265
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:30,262
If Kong doesn't have long to live,
they must be preparing a video.

266
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,806
You would know. You've been there.

267
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,391
EDITING TEAM
CHOI JUN-WOONG

268
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,769
What?

269
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,062
Right.

270
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,605
Okay. I'll go.

271
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:45,778
Hello.

272
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,446
-Look who's here?
-Hello.

273
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,366
Look who it is.
Mr. Choi, it's been a while.

274
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,283
Yes.

275
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,618
Ms. Koo gave me a call.

276
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,871
Yes. Do you make flashback footage
for animals too?

277
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:56,997
Of course.

278
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,249
We do it for every life
that lives and dies.

279
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,628
That's why it's so busy
and difficult here.

280
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,381
-Right. Here.
-Okay.

281
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,217
I was just working on
Kong's flashback video.

282
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,551
For Kong?

283
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,637
Kong doesn't have much time left.

284
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,433
That's why editing the flashback
is so important. It's like a final gift.

285
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,520
I hope he only has good memories.

286
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,439
Well, they're mostly good memories,

287
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,191
but there are things he wishes he'd done,

288
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,901
things he's sorry about,
and things he regrets.

289
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,403
You know, a wide variety.

290
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,487
Yes. Right.

291
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,073
-Well, thank you.
-Okay.

292
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,866
-Take care.
-You too.

293
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,201
-Bye.
-Bye.

294
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,473
What do we do?

295
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,892
-It's a puppy.
-Mom.

296
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,686
Hello?

297
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,895
Yes. There's…

298
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,897
There's an unconscious dog here.

299
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,025
-Mom, the puppy is shaking.
-Yes.

300
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,693
Yes, it's bleeding a lot too.

301
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,905
-Are you okay, puppy?
-It's Ilsan-ro 285 beon-gil.

302
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,490
Yes.

303
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,035
Hey…

304
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,078
What do we do?

305
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,538
What do we do, Mom?

306
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,749
It's dangerous,
so let's get him out of here first.

307
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,708
Come on.

308
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,376
Yes. Please, come quickly.

309
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,755
Yes. Ilsan-ro 285beon-gil.

310
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,350
-Mom.
-Yes?

311
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,643
I chose a name.

312
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,103
-What is it?
-Kong.

313
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,521
Kong?

314
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,108
-Because his eyes look like beans.
-That's a great name.

315
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,486
He's so cute.

316
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,452
From now on, your name is Kong.

317
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,496
Kim Kong.

318
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,331
Kong, come on here.

319
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,426
Okay, come here.

320
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,894
Kim Hun, Kim Kong!

321
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,730
You could've gotten hurt!

322
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,068
Kong, I'm okay.

323
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,529
Hey, Kim Hun.

324
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,531
Put your arms back up.

325
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,412
Kong, let's hurry home.

326
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:43,956
Let's hurry.

327
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,666
Kong, come on.

328
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,257
Kong, no, Kong!

329
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,308
What do I do?

330
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,395
Hey, kid, are you okay?

331
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,397
-Hey, kid.
-The kid's hurt.

332
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,690
What do we do?

333
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:10,649
Someone call 911.

334
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,984
Wait, I'll call 911.

335
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,073
Kong!

336
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,159
My Kong.

337
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:21,910
Kong, let's go.

338
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,621
Ta-da.

339
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,248
What do you think?

340
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:30,294
This is what you call a scar of honor.

341
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,717
I'm really okay.

342
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,470
Come on, look, it's fine, right?

343
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,431
Kong.

344
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,599
Kong, let's go.

345
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,642
Let's go.

346
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,935
There.

347
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,070
You're doing great, Kong.

348
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,241
I'm home.

349
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:05,954
Kong, come here.

350
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:08,832
There we go.

351
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:10,792
Kong.

352
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,086
Look at this. I got a tattoo.

353
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,796
It's totally awesome, right?

354
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,842
Come here, Kong.

355
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,642
Come here.

356
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,645
There you go.

357
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,854
Good job.

358
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:31,772
Say "give me."

359
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,899
Say "give me."

360
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,236
Good job.

361
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:38,820
The weather's nice.

362
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:41,782
What is it?

363
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,994
You really seem to like this view.

364
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,457
I like it too.

365
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,462
From now on, we'll be living here
together in this house.

366
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,260
Try to understand
if I can't play with you a lot, okay?

367
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:04,888
Want me to throw it?

368
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,348
Go get it, Kong.

369
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,105
There you go!

370
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,370
Kong.

371
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,584
Go away, I'm not in the mood
to play with you.

372
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,345
Yes.

373
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,974
Okay, let's break up.

374
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,857
We found a tumor on Kong's kidney

375
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,276
and it's metastasized to the other organs.

376
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,445
So even if we do surgery,

377
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,948
he's quite old,
so I can't guarantee the prognosis.

378
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:16,460
I'm saying he needs surgery right now
because he's sick!

379
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,339
What do you mean,
"prepare for the inevitable"?

380
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,042
He did abandon him, that bastard!

381
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,670
He took good care of him at first
but became negligent.

382
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,839
He abandoned him
because Kong's old and sick.

383
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,801
I'll leave him at the hospital,
so come keep a good eye on Kong.

384
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,927
Okay.

385
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,435
Well?

386
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,731
We searched the area, but there weren't
any fliers looking for Kong.

387
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,359
I think he's been abandoned.

388
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,654
Is that why you were trying to die?

389
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,780
But too bad.

390
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,699
I'm a Reaper who saves lives.

391
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,120
So this isn't going to go
the way you planned.

392
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,166
KONG

393
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,459
Kong.

394
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,836
Does it hurt?

395
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,004
How much does it hurt?

396
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,551
How could he abandon you
when you're so tiny and cute?

397
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,177
That bastard.

398
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,765
Right? He really is awful.

399
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,643
It's not like you wanted
to get sick or old.

400
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,019
But he abandoned you.

401
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,021
He's a bastard. Seriously.

402
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,531
Wait.

403
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:13,243
Seeing as how he has a collar,
it does mean he had a family.

404
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,412
Is there a possibility
that his owner lost him?

405
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,456
Then they must have
lost him in the neighborhood.

406
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,459
Dogs can usually find their way back,
at least near their home.

407
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,129
Did you…

408
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,723
Yes, ma'am.

409
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,475
If I'm correct,
I think Kong ran away from home.

410
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,352
-Ran away?
-Yes.

411
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,605
I think it'll be quicker to search
the online boards for pet owners.

412
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,941
And the owner has a tattoo
on his right arm covering up a scar.

413
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,943
I think it'll be good
to keep that in mind.

414
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,111
-Okay.
-Okay.

415
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,949
Mr. Choi was right.

416
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,120
I filtered it using the approximate dates.

417
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,122
This person has been looking
for Kong since three weeks ago.

418
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,374
He has a tattoo
on the back of his hand too.

419
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,585
That's weird.

420
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:07,297
If he wasn't abandoned,
why did Kong choose to run away from home?

421
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,781
Su-hyeon, what about the design
the dog cafe people sent us?

422
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,909
Hun just needs to
finish the illustration and that's it.

423
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,913
Are you almost done
with the illustration, Hun?

424
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,123
Yes.

425
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,126
Hun, are you crying?

426
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,420
Did something happen?

427
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,505
He's crying?

428
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,258
Hey, are you all right?

429
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:52,926
Yes, I'm fine.

430
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,763
-Is it because of your dog?
-Dog?

431
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,725
The dog he's had since he was young
suddenly disappeared.

432
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,686
That's why he's been rushing out
whenever he gets a call.

433
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,604
This is just about a dog?

434
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,856
I thought it was something serious.

435
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,650
Come on, don't cry.

436
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,986
If you want to make him feel better,
do it properly.

437
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,320
What do you mean, "just about a dog"?

438
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,990
You call a dog a dog,
what else would you call it?

439
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,617
I'm going to take a break.

440
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,457
Jeez, he's making
such a big deal out of it.

441
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,126
You and your mouth. Just shut up.

442
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,128
What did I do?

443
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:34,009
LOOKING FOR A DOG NAMED KONG

444
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,306
You okay?

445
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,397
How many weeks has it been? Three?

446
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,649
Just give up now.

447
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,818
How long are you going to be like this?

448
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,070
Seriously.

449
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,240
You've done more than enough.
You can stop now.

450
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,035
How can I do that?

451
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,162
To be brutally honest, are you going
to ruin your life because of a dog?

452
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,372
What, you'll die too if it dies?

453
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,126
Hey.

454
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:09,711
Hey, Kim Hun!

455
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,566
LOOKING FOR A LOST DOG, KONG!

456
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,200
LOOKING FOR A LOST DOG, KONG!
NAME: KIM KONG

457
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:05,100
LOOKING FOR A LOST DOG, KONG!
NAME: KIM KONG

458
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,117
Kong, I'm busy.

459
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,785
Later. Let's play later.

460
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,005
Yes, I'm going right now. Yes.

461
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,173
Kong, no.

462
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,015
I'm sorry, Kong.

463
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,060
I'm so sorry.

464
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,079
I FOUND KONG, PLEASE GIVE ME A CALL

465
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,417
-Hello?
-Yes.

466
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,253
Yes, this is Kong's owner.
I can go right now. Where are you?

467
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:18,214
-I'll send you a link to the address.
-Okay, I'll go right now.

468
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,576
What about Kong? Where's Kong?

469
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,244
He's not here.

470
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,040
What?

471
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,336
Do you people think this is funny?

472
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,463
I came here,

473
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:01,549
knowing he might not be here,
that it might just be a scam.

474
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,344
Do you know how I felt,
coming all the way here?

475
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,437
That's Kong, right?

476
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,065
He's with our friend right now.

477
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,901
Then why didn't you bring him? Why?

478
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,279
I'll get straight to the point.

479
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:24,989
Kong…

480
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,991
tried to commit suicide.

481
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,119
-What?
-Kong ran into the road.

482
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,706
And we found him.

483
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,917
What is that supposed to mean?

484
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,336
Who are you people?

485
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,505
That tattoo on your arm.

486
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:44,050
You got it to cover the scar you got
from that accident trying to rescue Kong

487
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,093
when you were young, right?

488
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,098
We found out through Kong.

489
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,309
I'm sorry, but that's all we can tell you.

490
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:58,022
Right now, our colleague is watching Kong,
so he can't make any rash decisions.

491
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,817
You're lying. That makes no sense--

492
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,195
You know that
Kong doesn't have much time left, right?

493
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,156
If you want to get Kong back,
just believe us first.

494
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,291
At first, I thought Kong was abandoned
because he was sick.

495
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,333
What do you mean, abandoned?

496
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,836
He went out
when I left the door open for a minute.

497
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:22,881
It's my fault.

498
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,049
I didn't think he would go out.

499
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,302
Right.

500
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,345
Turns out he had run away.

501
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,891
We found him quite a distance from home.

502
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,268
Why do you think he did it?

503
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,024
Why do you think he chose to
leave his home,

504
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,068
and why do you think he tried
to kill himself?

505
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,613
That can't be. Why would Kong…

506
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,298
He's on his way.

507
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,342
To see you.

508
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,094
But I think

509
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,807
I understand a little
why you wanted to leave home.

510
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,811
You're right. Fancy us
running into each other here like this.

511
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:21,731
Goodness.

512
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,149
Are you okay?

513
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,069
Yes, I'm fine.

514
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,112
Yes, I have to make money.

515
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,407
But you have to keep this a secret
from my mom.

516
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,825
To my family,

517
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,161
I'm just a sick son

518
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,332
and a brother racking up
a big hospital bill.

519
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,461
I had forgotten, since I've been
spending time like this.

520
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,049
The family I love is having a hard time
because of me,

521
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:51,302
and there's nothing I can do for them
right now.

522
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,431
If I feel this way,

523
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,976
you must have felt worse.

524
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,770
So you didn't want to be a burden.

525
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:05,274
So much so that you thought it
would be better to die.

526
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,486
Right?

527
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,912
You're right, he's old.
He's 15 years old now.

528
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,833
I'm worried. He's having problems
in a lot of places these days.

529
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:28,131
I'm saying he needs surgery right now
because he's sick!

530
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,758
What do you mean,
"prepare for the inevitable"?

531
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,265
Hey, do you live life
thinking that you'll die?

532
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,182
You just live.

533
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,478
No. I can't live without Kong.
I don't think I can live without him.

534
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,940
If Kong dies in front of me,
I'll go crazy.

535
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,942
If something like that ever happens,

536
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,278
then I'll die with him too.

537
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,124
You're so pretty.

538
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,500
Where's your owner?

539
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,627
Is he lost?

540
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,425
It's my fault.

541
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,180
It's because of what I said that Kong…

542
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:24,020
But Kong isn't just a dog to me.
He's my family.

543
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,146
So please,

544
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,940
can't you let me see Kong?

545
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,966
Will you stop being so stubborn?

546
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,845
You know
that you don't have much time left.

547
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,226
It's not an easy thing

548
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,311
to choose death for yourself.

549
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:06,854
I know too.

550
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,690
You must have been
very scared on your own.

551
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,614
You must have thought of Hun,

552
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,741
and you must have missed him.

553
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,495
And you couldn't go back home

554
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,623
because you didn't want him
to see you die.

555
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,666
But…

556
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,503
Kim Hun is desperately looking for you.

557
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,380
Did you know that?

558
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,012
Kong leaving home was Kong's choice.

559
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,515
Choi Jun-woong.

560
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,685
If we let Mr. Kim see Kong,
then what about Kong's feelings?

561
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,438
What about Kong's choice?

562
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,315
If Kong dies like this,

563
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,278
Mr. Kim will live a life
full of guilt and regret,

564
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,530
thinking he wasn't able to protect him.

565
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,410
We can't let him live the rest of his life
feeling like that.

566
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,162
Choi Jun-woong.

567
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,414
Do you have any idea
what kind of hell it is

568
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,332
to part ways without a proper goodbye?

569
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,919
It's no different
than choosing an eternal hell

570
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,255
just to escape the pain in the present.

571
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,848
Kim Hun said that you were his family
that he loves.

572
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,517
What about you?
Don't you feel the same way too?

573
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,063
I know what you're worried about.

574
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:35,568
You're worried that he'll have a hard time
and be sad if you die by his side.

575
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:39,989
You left because you didn't want him
to feel that pain.

576
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,535
But that should be up
to the people who are left behind.

577
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,498
It would be selfish
not to let him do even that.

578
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,085
Of course it's hard and sad…

579
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,422
when a family member you love is dying.

580
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,507
But…

581
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,344
you need to go through that time

582
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,138
to be able to miss your loved ones freely.

583
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,311
It might hurt
to think about them immediately,

584
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,688
but the sense of longing

585
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,609
is created because of happy memories.

586
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,867
This is your last chance
to spend time with him.

587
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,161
You should be smiling

588
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,247
for your final farewell.

589
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,173
Choi Jun-woong.

590
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,092
Take some time to think before you come.

591
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,636
Let's go, Kong.

592
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,653
Kong.

593
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,134
I'm sorry.

594
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,137
But you can't do this.

595
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,222
Why would you run away
when you're sick? Why…

596
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,725
Why would you try to die?

597
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:34,854
Because he feels bad.

598
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,691
He probably felt bad
about causing that scar,

599
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,735
about getting sicker and sicker,

600
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,071
about making you worry
and causing you pain.

601
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,448
He felt bad about all of it.

602
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,957
Why would you think such silly things?

603
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,754
Because you don't want your family
to feel pain and suffer because of you.

604
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,799
Kong.

605
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,634
I'm the one who should be sorry.

606
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,889
I should have taken better care of you
and spent more time with you.

607
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,143
I should have checked if you were hurting,

608
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,562
what you did in the empty apartment
when I wasn't there,

609
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,064
if you were lonely.

610
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,567
I really wanted to give you
everything you wanted.

611
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,904
Because…

612
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,242
ever since you came to me,
I was happy every moment.

613
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,746
You're the only one
that's given me endless love.

614
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,832
You always console me.

615
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,628
And you always stay the same.

616
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,347
I would have been so lonely without you.

617
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:58,229
So Kong, you have to
take care of me until the very end.

618
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,983
Let me stay by your side
until the end, okay?

619
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,377
Come with me.

620
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,597
Already?

621
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,811
Hello, I'm Reaper Jang Hyeon-jun
from the Escort Team,

622
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,563
I'm in charge of animal souls--

623
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,358
Right.

624
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,734
Hey, what are you doing?

625
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,945
I'm here because there's an animal soul
about to meet its end.

626
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,283
Did I pick a bad time?

627
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,284
Yes. Go back.

628
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,743
It's time, though.

629
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,663
KIM KONG
DEATH BY NATURAL CAUSES

630
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,498
That must be Kong.

631
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,502
Take him just 30 minutes later.
You can wait that long, right?

632
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:06,255
No, actually. That's still too short.

633
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,966
Wait an hour and a half
before you take him.

634
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,968
No. I'd have to file
a disciplinary report.

635
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,137
Our team has
a lot of disciplinary reports,

636
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,513
so you can use one of those for reference.

637
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,223
No. Nope. I can't.

638
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,477
The number of late cases for escorting
animal souls is over ten thousand.

639
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,607
I don't think one more will make
a big difference.

640
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,027
This place has great milk tea.

641
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,820
You can have both of these,

642
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:33,157
as you take at least four and a half laps
around the neighborhood.

643
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,242
Four and a half laps is too…

644
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,916
One and a half hours.
I'll be back on the dot.

645
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:42,875
Okay.

646
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,636
We don't have much time.
You know that, right?

647
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:59,225
Is Kong's life really almost over?

648
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,436
Yes.

649
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,688
But why now?

650
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,899
Death is just like that.

651
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,238
Still, you two can spend
his last moments together.

652
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,490
This is the last time,

653
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,535
so don't tell each other
that you're sorry.

654
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,078
Spend the time well.

655
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,247
Okay.

656
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,044
Excuse me.

657
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,421
Kong must be pretty cold.

658
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,298
You can put this around him.

659
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:36,720
Put this on, Mr. Kim.

660
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,977
Kong, shall we go for a walk?

661
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,612
Let's go.

662
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,091
KIM KONG, AGE 15

663
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,363
Kong, do you remember this place?

664
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,537
You're doing great, Kong.

665
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,250
This is where we came for our walks.

666
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:05,684
Kong.

667
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,228
You wouldn't know this,

668
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,524
but whenever I imagined
our last moment together,

669
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:16,403
I used to think a lot about
what I should do.

670
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,574
But I couldn't figure it out.

671
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,746
I'll try not to be too sad.

672
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,124
Because I know that if I'm sad,

673
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,876
it'll make you even sadder, Kong.

674
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:34,713
Good job.

675
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,424
Thank you, for loving me
with all my flaws.

676
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,802
Say "give me."

677
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,388
Good job.

678
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,600
And always being there for me.

679
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,521
Even when you're gone from my life,

680
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,439
I'll work hard

681
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,484
and miss you with a joyful heart.

682
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,990
So please, wait for me for a little while.

683
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:07,162
When we meet again,
I'll play with you every day.

684
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,331
I'll never make you feel lonely.

685
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,959
So the day we meet again…

686
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,516
Kong…

687
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:33,856
It's okay.

688
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,901
I'm here, don't be scared.

689
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,118
Kong.

690
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:48,704
It's okay.

691
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,130
Goodbye.

692
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,009
Goodbye, my little brother Kong.

693
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,189
Kong.

694
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,325
Kim Kong.

695
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,368
Don't look so down.

696
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,413
You'll have a lot of friends
where you're going.

697
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:33,957
And Mr. Kim

698
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:37,544
will be fine too, thinking about you,
so don't worry.

699
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,260
We'll get going then.

700
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,641
It's amazing.

701
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,102
How our pets always wait for us

702
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,189
when human relationships
are never absolute,

703
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,233
not even between parents and children.

704
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,527
Because they are pure.

705
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:05,572
Do you think there's any human
as pure as animals?

706
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,366
I don't think so.

707
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,409
If there are, maybe newborns.

708
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,203
There are no beings

709
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,789
as pure as animals.

710
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,214
Did you have a chance to
say goodbye to Kong?

711
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:06,675
Yes.

712
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:11,013
I'm sorry I said that you were making
a big deal out of nothing.

713
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,265
It's okay.

714
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,017
I shouldn't have brought
my personal life to work.

715
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:15,934
No.

716
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:19,229
I've never had a pet,
so I couldn't understand.

717
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:24,443
I don't know if this
will make you feel any better,

718
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,238
but people say that when you die
and go to the afterlife,

719
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,907
your pet will be waiting there
to greet you.

720
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:35,746
So don't be too sad.

721
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,167
Okay. Thank you.

722
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,608
We found the owner.

723
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,152
Kong passed away, though.

724
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,825
Still, it's a relief
that he wasn't abandoned.

725
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,662
And he saw his family again.

726
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,331
He ran away from home.

727
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:20,957
What?

728
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:26,254
Pets don't want their owners
to see them die,

729
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:30,425
so they leave their homes or die
when their owners aren't looking.

730
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,512
So that's why Kong…

731
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:38,350
It must be because it's harder
to see your family suffer or be sad

732
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:43,063
than to go through your own pain.

733
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,401
I guess people and animals
are all the same.

734
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,070
You go through hard times

735
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,698
because of the people you love.

736
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,241
But they also give you strength

737
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,076
and are why you don't lose hope.

738
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,079
They say my brother

739
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,708
jumped into the Han River to save someone.

740
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:08,505
Seeing you try to rescue me

741
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:13,301
made me admire my brother a little bit.

742
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:20,100
I was so surprised that day
that I forgot to thank you properly.

743
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:23,395
Please tell your colleagues
that I said thank you too.

744
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,480
Okay.

745
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,274
Thank you.

746
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:39,244
SEOUL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

747
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:44,750
Excuse me?

748
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,337
Hello.

749
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,505
It is you.

750
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,008
Are you here to see your friend?

751
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,427
Yes, well…

752
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,601
How is it going, healthwise?

753
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,394
My son?

754
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,105
He is getting much better.

755
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:08,565
I meant you, ma'am.

756
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,735
It must be hard, taking care of him.

757
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,697
I feel better
whenever I lay my eyes on my son.

758
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:21,244
I don't know when he'll wake up,
so I have to stay healthy at all times.

759
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,123
He'll be heartbroken if he wakes up
to find his mom sick.

760
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,752
I can't do anything to make my son worry.

761
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:31,671
Right.

762
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:33,965
He'll wake up soon.

763
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,220
Of course.

764
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:40,639
Of course, that's what keeps me going.

765
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:42,974
Thank you.

766
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:44,768
What?

767
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,062
What for…

768
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,526
Be well.

769
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,194
What?

770
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,864
Just, be well.

771
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,534
Okay, then.

772
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:02,160
Okay.

773
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,715
Please listen
to the following announcement.

774
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:18,468
There will be a training session
for new Reapers today

775
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,804
in the main conference room
on the 572nd floor.

776
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:25,016
We ask that all team managers of
the Soul Management Department attend.

777
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:29,521
-Hey.
-You scared me.

778
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:32,649
What are you thinking so hard about?

779
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:33,733
It's nothing.

780
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,821
What is it? You can tell me.

781
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:39,656
Tell me.

782
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:45,328
If I wake up six months later
like we agreed on the contract,

783
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,414
will my family be happy again?

784
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,749
That's up to you.

785
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,378
Your family's happiness isn't something
we can control on our end.

786
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,005
No.

787
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,673
I will make them happy no matter what.

788
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,425
I'll make sure to get those benefits

789
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,385
and give them everything they want.

790
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:02,721
You do that.

791
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,766
My family's having a hard time
because of me,

792
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,436
so I have to make it up to them.

793
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:10,896
Sure.

794
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:15,984
It can't be easy, just watching
without being able to do anything.

795
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:21,740
So, do you regret the day you saved
that homeless person at the Han River?

796
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:25,785
No, but…

797
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,581
Seeing my family having such a hard time

798
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:32,000
does make me wonder why I did it…

799
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,546
It's not just you and your family, though.

800
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:40,300
Whether it's grief, loneliness,
pain, or whatever it is,

801
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:44,638
all humans are subject to an equal amount
of time where they have to endure it.

802
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:49,184
And those who do
are rewarded for it later.

803
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:52,270
I don't think it's equal,
the time or the reward.

804
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:54,439
Everyone…

805
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:57,484
thinks only the time
they have to endure is heavy

806
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,278
and the reward is too light.

807
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,698
Endure it well.

808
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:05,283
You…

809
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:08,078
have a lot riding on it.

810
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:11,581
Okay.

811
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:16,086
Sure, I'm doing this for the benefits,

812
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,880
but why on earth do Ms. Koo
and Mr. Lim do this work?

813
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:24,094
Probably because they want to
be reborn with a silver spoon?

814
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,513
Reborn?

815
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,975
Isn't it a bit late for them to be reborn?

816
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,644
I thought Ms. Koo and Mr. Lim
are both really old.

817
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:37,983
I definitely heard them say
they have an objective…

818
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:42,529
You really don't let
anything slide, do you?

819
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:44,531
Yes.

820
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:47,575
That's probably
why they're remaining here.

821
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:51,871
Because they have regrets.

822
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:29,094
The wounds you think
cannot heal on their own

823
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,930
leave quite a deep scar.

824
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:34,432
So I only want

825
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,685
those regrets to end

826
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,897
so the warm sun can shine once more

827
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,775
on their lives of perpetual winter.

828
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,404
Well, that's it for me today!

829
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:51,199
I'm falling behind on my deliveries,
so I'll be off.

830
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,789
Okay, goodbye.

831
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:00,935
EPILOGUE

832
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,270
You've been well?

833
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:07,358
It's already been 50 years
since you came here.

834
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,529
I see. You've had a good time
with your friends?

835
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,158
Yes.

836
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,785
You have to prepare to be reborn too.

837
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:22,123
You've been good,
so you'll be born as a human this time.

838
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:26,711
But before that,
there's someone you need to meet.

839
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,068
We have two cases this time.

840
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:33,695
You need to be more alert.

841
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:35,697
-Why?
-It's a sexual assault case.

842
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,574
Didn't you tell me to just go…

843
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,909
Be quiet and walk
if you don't want to die.

844
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,035
Please don't kill me.

845
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,830
-I'm sorry.
-You want to live?

846
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:47,458
-I really won't do it. I swear!
-Cha Yun-hui! Snap out of it!

847
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,627
Because he's in medical school
with a bright future ahead of him.

848
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,087
In the end, his sentence was reduced.

849
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:54,007
I have heard you were living your life
completely unaffected, laughing all day.

850
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,675
But you actually are laughing.

851
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,012
Mr. Lim!

852
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,973
No Reaper may intervene in human affairs.
Did you forget that?

853
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:04,017
-Get out of my way.
-Mr. Lim, please!

854
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:09,105
