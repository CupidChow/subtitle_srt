00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,012
APRIL 28TH, 2022
DAY OFF

2
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,443
-What is it?
-Jeez. You startled me.

3
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,322
What do you mean? I was just…

4
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,908
I was just passing by.

5
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,160
And I came in.

6
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,912
What is it? Did something happen?

7
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,289
No. Leave.

8
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,709
If nothing's up,
let's just drink together.

9
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,629
There's no need to advertise to the world
that you have no friends.

10
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,130
Stop acting like we're friends.

11
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,423
I'm not in the mood.

12
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,092
Don't be like that.
Let's just have a drink together.

13
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,011
What do you think we are?

14
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,015
Well, you know. The same team?
A boss and a subordinate?

15
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,351
So you do know. That's the line.

16
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,727
So stop trying to cross it.

17
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,354
It's off-putting.

18
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,522
Off-putting…

19
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,023
That's way too harsh.

20
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,400
I'm worried about you, that's why.

21
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,986
It's freezing and you're here drinking
with nothing but…

22
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,613
Stop bothering me and get lost, will you?

23
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,784
Fine. I'm going.

24
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,370
I'll get lost.

25
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,206
I was just worried, that's all.

26
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,833
You just had to hurt my feelings.

27
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,231
She sure drank a lot.

28
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,368
I…

29
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,455
I don't want…

30
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:47,750
tomorrow to come.

31
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,594
I think the afterworld is too harsh
on people who took their own lives.

32
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,887
The first punishment.

33
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,680
The breaking of the threads of fate.

34
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,098
You know what?

35
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,105
Unless they break that thread themselves,

36
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:12,775
they will meet that person again,
no matter how many times you are reborn.

37
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,444
By breaking the thread themselves…

38
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,405
do you mean suicide?

39
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,839
EPISODE 14: WINDFLOWER

40
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,218
Are you going somewhere?

41
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:40,762
It's my day off.

42
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,889
What are you going to do?

43
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:44,724
I'm going to see a friend.

44
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,060
But you don't have friends.
I thought they all passed away.

45
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,353
I do too.

46
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,897
Just be honest with me.
What are you going to do?

47
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,941
I told you, I'm going to see a friend.

48
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,543
KOO RYEON

49
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:15,755
MEASURING NEGATIVE ENERGY LEVELS

50
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:16,673
KOO RYEON

51
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,776
What…

52
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,945
Come on!

53
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,447
Why are you so surprised?
Were you thinking about me?

54
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,116
No.

55
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,075
But…

56
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,327
what's with your outfit?
Are you going somewhere?

57
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,998
I'm going to the department store.
I heard the new season's in.

58
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,001
And see your mother too
while you're there?

59
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,795
Yes.

60
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,799
But did something happen?
What's with that look on your face?

61
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,095
I just checked
Ms. Koo's Negative Energy Level,

62
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,347
and it was 100 percent.

63
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,644
Today must be her day off.

64
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:16,024
-Sorry?
-Reapers get only one day off every year.

65
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,484
The day they died.

66
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,821
Of course she'd be in a bad mood.

67
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,907
After all, how many people had
a happy death?

68
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,107
You can't, my lady.

69
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,400
My lady.

70
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,281
My lady!

71
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,789
You seem to have a good life.

72
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,113
You know, don't you?

73
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,907
If you ask me that so out of the blue,

74
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,742
how am I supposed to know what to say?

75
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,329
I can see that Ms. Koo
is having a hard time,

76
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,166
but I don't think she'll ever tell me why.

77
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,128
Shouldering someone else's pain
is not an easy thing to do.

78
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,047
Especially more so
if you're close to them.

79
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,218
Ryeon knows that, which must be why
she doesn't want to talk about it.

80
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,595
She killed herself, right?

81
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,099
Yes.

82
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,561
And it's related to Mr. Park?

83
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,105
You. Why were you there?

84
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,400
No. Why was I there?

85
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,902
Where?

86
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,529
In my nightmares.

87
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,866
You sent Ms. Koo to the Escort Team,

88
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,743
then had her manage
the Risk Management Team.

89
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,419
Why did you do that?

90
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,796
What's your reason?

91
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,925
You are still the same as ever.

92
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,427
"Same as ever"?

93
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,511
Ma'am!

94
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,348
What is Ryeon to you, exactly?

95
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,685
-Sorry?
-Answer me.

96
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,148
At first, she was just cold.

97
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,149
Are you insane?

98
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,359
Why are you trying to dive
into the Han River?

99
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:09,071
Don't say anything or ask anything,
and just pretend you're not here.

100
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,615
And she was hard to approach.

101
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,408
And now?

102
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,410
Now…

103
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,375
Woo-jin!

104
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,754
Ma'am!

105
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,339
Ma'am!

106
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,550
Thank you so much.

107
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,843
I admire her.

108
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,596
I want to be like her sometimes too.

109
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,890
I want to help her.

110
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,269
To the best of my abilities.

111
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,984
I see you are now ready
to look into Ryeon's pain.

112
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,998
I sincerely hope you can handle it.

113
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,962
ABOUT 400 YEARS AGO

114
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,810
I told you, there's no need for that.
You can go.

115
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,353
No, my lady.

116
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:26,107
Your father told me to stay by your side
and keep an eye on you, no matter what.

117
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,902
And I'm saying whatever it is
you are worried about won't happen,

118
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:30,903
so don't worry.

119
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,197
Please. I'm not falling for that again.

120
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,200
I'd sooner trust a passing dog or a pig
than trust you.

121
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,660
-What?
-What?

122
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,745
I'm sorry, my lady.

123
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,415
It's fine.

124
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,876
This is because I haven't given you
enough reason to trust me.

125
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,212
It's all my fault.

126
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,380
My lady.

127
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,190
Gosh. My lady.

128
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,234
I nodded off again.

129
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,781
My lady, not again!

130
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,092
You shall be my target today.

131
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,306
Do you have a death wish?

132
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,725
I'm sorry, sir!

133
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:31,107
I'm sorry, young master.
My son has committed a grave atrocity.

134
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,316
Please, spare our lives!

135
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,945
Low-lives like you have no business
being here.

136
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,865
-I shall turn both of you in immediately--
-You are being too harsh.

137
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,702
Put away your sword.

138
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,872
To draw your sword at them
when they are not even armed.

139
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,416
You are no better than a beast.

140
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,042
What did you say?

141
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,585
My lady…

142
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,176
I suppose there is little meaning
in arresting these bottom-feeders.

143
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,472
If I catch you again,
I will have your heads.

144
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,313
Thank you, my lady.

145
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,898
-Hello, sir.
-Good morning.

146
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,567
-Bye, mom!
-Be careful.

147
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,734
-Good morning.
-Hi.

148
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,319
-Goodness.
-Hello.

149
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,363
-Hello!
-Hi!

150
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,074
-Goodness, hello there!
-Hello!

151
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,119
-Hey!
-Hello.

152
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,370
Good morning.

153
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,331
-Hey!
-How are you?

154
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,791
-Have a good day.
-Yes.

155
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,181
Please don't touch that.

156
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,477
They may look like any other flower,

157
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,354
but these are the roots
of a highly poisonous plant.

158
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,857
It can kill even a horse or a cow.

159
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,817
Really?

160
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,740
My lady, this tastes best
while it's still warm.

161
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,700
Please, enjoy.

162
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,995
I don't know if I could.

163
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,414
I didn't catch even a single rabbit today.

164
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,708
Gosh, there's no need for that anymore.

165
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,668
You have already repaid us
for the medicine.

166
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,379
-You don't have to come here anymore.
-What are you saying?

167
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,381
I still have a long way to go
to repay you.

168
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,677
When that snake bit me during my hunt,
I was on the verge of death.

169
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,680
You were the one who brought me here.

170
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,934
Thanks to you,
I am still alive and breathing today.

171
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,062
That is not something
you can put a price to.

172
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,773
Not even a lifetime is enough time
to repay you.

173
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,566
You've given us more than enough.

174
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,777
The way you don't look down on us

175
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,530
and treat us like people is plenty enough.

176
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,491
I only worry
that you'll hurt yourself, my lady.

177
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,659
Do not worry.

178
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,371
And thank you for the food.

179
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,509
To draw your sword at them
when they are not even armed.

180
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,010
You are no better than a beast.

181
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:28,909
What happened?

182
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,203
My leg…

183
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:39,712
This will hurt.

184
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,876
What are you doing?

185
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,169
-What?
-You…

186
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,296
Grandpa!

187
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,637
Are you all right, sir?

188
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,097
Had you arrived any later,

189
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,266
you would not have survived.

190
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,312
Just know it's all thanks to Lady Ryeon.

191
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,814
It's because she said
we must save you no matter what.

192
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:46,278
She said all lives are valuable
and precious.

193
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,373
You will be able to stand in a few days.

194
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,542
Thank you.

195
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,923
I believe it is she
who deserves your gratitude.

196
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,394
Look, I caught a pheasant!

197
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,877
We finally meet again.

198
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,260
Thank you.

199
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,263
I only saved you to stay true to my word.

200
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,141
Law cannot exist without people.

201
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,767
We are all the same people.

202
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,310
Yes.

203
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,104
I, too, am a person.

204
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,151
How are you?

205
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:10,571
Thanks to you, I am all better.
Enough to hunt.

206
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,825
No wonder there weren't any pheasants
in the woods today.

207
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,912
Are the two of you planning to
make all of our stomachs explode?

208
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,124
If that were my plan,
I would have caught a boar instead.

209
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,751
Are you sure that will be enough?

210
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,545
I shall bring back a tiger next time.

211
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,838
Goodness.

212
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:31,341
We need to have tigers
in the mountains to protect us.

213
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,968
What do you mean?

214
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,472
Well, I heard that
the barbarians of the north

215
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,349
have crossed the Amnok River
and are plundering and pillaging villages.

216
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,893
Should a war break out,

217
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,980
commoners like us
would be the first to die, no?

218
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,865
I heard my father talking about this too.

219
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,118
He said Later Jin's endless
and exorbitant demands

220
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,578
are causing a big stir in the Court.

221
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,537
Goodness.

222
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,832
With our national defenses so weak…

223
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,292
It's because this country

224
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,087
only values civil officials
and has no respect for the military.

225
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,756
It is a shame.

226
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:12,925
Well, I should get going.

227
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:20,724
My lady, I am Jung-gil,
the eldest son of Park Won-sik.

228
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,895
May I have the honor of knowing your name?

229
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,106
My name is

230
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,691
Koo Ryeon.

231
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,834
With our national defenses so weak…

232
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,254
It's because this country

233
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,215
only values civil officials
and has no respect for the military.

234
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,445
What do you mean I'm to be married?

235
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,822
But this is so sudden…

236
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,740
You are of age to marry.

237
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,121
And there have been talks of your match
with this family even before your birth.

238
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,247
Father!

239
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,584
He is a fine-looking fellow
with great academic accomplishments

240
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,836
and lacks nothing as your husband.

241
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,882
I don't want to marry a man
whose face or name I do not know.

242
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,593
How dare you say that as a woman!

243
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:44,183
Is the lack of motherly love
and my overindulgence of you to blame?

244
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,142
No, Father.

245
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,729
Then is my teaching you, a girl,
how to read and write to blame?

246
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,023
Is that why you have become so arrogant?

247
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,107
No.

248
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,903
Then I must be to blame
for letting you do as you wish,

249
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,155
because I had admired your will
and effort in your studies

250
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,323
despite the limits of your gender.

251
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:00,991
That is not it!

252
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,451
Then what is it?

253
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,786
Confucius said,

254
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,955
"One who says what they like

255
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,125
and what they do not like
is a good person."

256
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,129
Father, I would like to be a good person.

257
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,465
What are you saying?

258
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,051
I'm saying your admonishments
will not work.

259
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,262
I do not wish to be married off
to the family you have chosen for me.

260
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,513
Goodness!

261
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,766
Why can't you ever do as you are told?

262
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,976
I shall take my leave, Father.

263
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,484
My lady!

264
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,403
You can't, my lady!

265
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,161
I cannot accept this marriage.

266
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,081
So what are you planning to do
after you barge into his house?

267
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:52,251
I have to tell him
that I have another in my heart.

268
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,589
My lady, there will be big trouble
if your father finds out about this.

269
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,384
And that's why
you should keep your mouth closed.

270
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,435
All right.

271
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,438
You wait here and watch the show.

272
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,606
Sorry?

273
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,984
Could I really do that?

274
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:20,445
You always told me that you wanted
to join a theatrical troupe.

275
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,828
-But I feel bad…
-It's fine.

276
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,889
Open the door.

277
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,017
Open the door!

278
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,193
What a lovely shade.

279
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,508
What are you doing?

280
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:09,471
I was wondering how you would look
with red rouge around your eyes.

281
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,015
Please wipe it off.

282
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,770
The red suits you very well.

283
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,031
Why do you look at me with that gaze?

284
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,079
I love you.

285
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,556
How long do I have to wait?

286
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,058
It is said that a tiger
exerts its full energy

287
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,060
even when hunting a mere rabbit.

288
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:01,189
It means whether you are hunting
a pheasant or a deer,

289
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,275
your attitude must never waver.

290
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:11,074
I have decided to take the exam
to become a military official.

291
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,537
I shall fight for the commoners
who will be the first to suffer

292
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:20,125
should our country undergo
any hardship or war.

293
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:42,105
MAY THE UNION OF THESE TWO FAMILIES
BECOME A SOURCE OF HAPPINESS

294
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,520
My lady!

295
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,807
You greet the peddler and his trinkets
with the same delight as ever.

296
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,142
They say that to see is to want.

297
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,020
It means one should be wary
of one's material desires.

298
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,234
How foolish I am
to covet an ornament such as this.

299
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,032
Choose whichever is to your liking.

300
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,995
My wife.

301
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,793
This one.

302
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,754
This one. And this one too.

303
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,965
I like this one too.

304
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,092
Could you pick just one, please?

305
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:39,431
Then please pick the one
which suits me the best.

306
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,976
You are enchanting in everything.

307
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,729
-I shall take all of them.
-Wait.

308
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,480
I like this one.

309
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,862
I like this one the best too.

310
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:55,447
What is that?

311
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:00,493
-Why are there soldiers here?
-What is going on?

312
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,039
What is it?

313
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,124
An urgent dispatch
from Lee Chun-ho, the Commissioner.

314
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,293
The barbarians have crossed the border
and are pillaging villages.

315
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,502
He asked for your help.

316
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,631
The place is not far from here, right?

317
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,716
Any word from Hanyang?

318
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,676
The orders are to go immediately
and help him.

319
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,935
The situation seems quite bad.

320
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:29,981
The country comes before
one's own well-being.

321
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,566
Do not worry about me and go.

322
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,194
Sir.

323
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,111
Wait.

324
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,658
Then…

325
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,702
I shall go.

326
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,267
Ma'am, have you heard?

327
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,853
The rumor that the Qing army will attack.

328
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,399
Nurhaci of Later Jin has died
and Hong Taiji has ascended to the throne.

329
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,193
I heard he has changed
the name of their country to "Qing."

330
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,277
He is a dangerous man.

331
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,448
Shouldn't we be leaving too?

332
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,994
I heard half the people here
have already packed up and left.

333
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,247
If one's country is collapsing,

334
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,791
will there truly be
someplace safe to go to?

335
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,086
Wouldn't it be safe in Hanyang,
where the King is?

336
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,879
If you'd like to go, you can go.

337
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,216
How could I leave without you, ma'am?

338
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,384
Why not?

339
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,052
You said you'd leave any time

340
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,805
should you fall in love with
the leader of a theatrical troupe.

341
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,764
Oh, dear.

342
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,183
That was a joke I made when I was young.

343
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,394
Are you still going to tease me for that?

344
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:54,315
How dare you make jokes
when the country is in peril.

345
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,779
I shall go to the market, ma'am.

346
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,615
Rice and barley are so hard
to come by these days.

347
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:06,453
I hope there'll be something today.

348
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,252
I had no idea how painful it would be

349
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,921
to send your son to the battlefields.

350
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,340
He will be fine.

351
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,134
Please, do not worry.

352
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,343
If it weren't for you,

353
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,721
he would never have become
a military official.

354
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,848
I beg your pardon, Mother,

355
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,268
but the idea was not of my suggestion.

356
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,353
If he had become a civil official
like everyone else,

357
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,522
he wouldn't have gone off
to fight in the war

358
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,191
and would have had a bright
career ahead of him.

359
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:40,361
He made that choice because he loves
this country more than anyone else.

360
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,072
And I am proud of that side of him.

361
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,118
You will never know my pain,
not in a million years,

362
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,412
since you have no child of your own.

363
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,124
What is it? Do you think I'm wrong?

364
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,678
Mother, we must run.

365
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,434
What do you think you're doing?

366
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,274
Do not resist!

367
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,119
Impudent wench!

368
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,338
Mother!

369
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,715
Go hide in the basement of the shed.

370
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,009
What about you? Where will you go?

371
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,261
-Gop-dan has yet to return.
-She is just a servant!

372
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:31,222
She is like family to me,
someone I've spent my whole life with.

373
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,473
You must hurry!

374
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,183
All right.

375
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:47,989
Gop-dan…

376
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,385
There you are, hiding like a rat!

377
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,965
Gop-dan!

378
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,762
My lady, you shouldn't have come.

379
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:36,681
Let's go.

380
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,683
I'm scared.

381
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,059
You'll die if you stay here!

382
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,608
Let's go.

383
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,829
My lady!

384
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,622
It's too dangerous to go.

385
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,999
I must save her.

386
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,500
You stay here and hide.

387
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,753
My lady…

388
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:31,402
Are you all right?

389
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,979
-What is it?
-His wound seems to have festered.

390
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,199
-Put him on the horse.
-But what about you?

391
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,160
I'll be fine, so get him on the horse.

392
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,519
Sir. You're back!

393
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,190
-Sir, you're back.
-Jung-gil!

394
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:34,734
Jung-gil!

395
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,444
Jung-gil!

396
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,946
Jung-gil, you're here. You're back.

397
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,868
I'm glad you are safe, Mother.

398
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,747
Are you hurt?

399
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,958
-No, I'm fine.
-Good.

400
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:52,793
But…

401
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,713
where is she?

402
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,176
Where is Ryeon?

403
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,180
I think she was taken

404
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,057
by the barbarians.

405
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,519
Jung-gil.

406
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,313
Jung-gil!

407
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,095
Stay on your guard!

408
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,822
Don't cry.

409
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,367
We will definitely return home alive.

410
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,895
Ma'am, are you all right?

411
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:17,646
What about you?

412
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,648
It's all my fault.

413
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:23,611
I should have just killed myself then.

414
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,366
You must live.

415
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,327
We shall be able to return home,
as long as we are alive.

416
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,205
Yes, ma'am.

417
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,051
Gop-dan.

418
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,222
I think there's a way we can go home.

419
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,958
Have you seen any other women being taken?

420
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,709
It's not just one or two.

421
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:24,171
Rumor has it that it's hundreds,
no, thousands of women.

422
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,514
They may look like any other flower,

423
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,975
but these are the roots
of a highly poisonous plant.

424
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,936
It can kill even a horse or a cow.

425
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,367
What's wrong with them?

426
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,668
I think the food has been poisoned.

427
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,007
Let's go.

428
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,056
Everyone, get up! Hurry!

429
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,020
That way!

430
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,745
It's this way.

431
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:05,165
Everyone, come this way!

432
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,579
We're here.

433
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,540
We're in Joseon now.

434
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,959
You must hold on just a little longer.

435
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,169
Yes.

436
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:52,379
Let's go.

437
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,277
We're safe!

438
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,073
We're here.

439
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:25,746
Stop right there.

440
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,206
We are people of Joseon!

441
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,459
Turn back.

442
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,878
You could very well be spies
sent by the barbarians.

443
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,213
I cannot let you enter.

444
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,130
-No.
-What?

445
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,800
-What do you mean by that?
-It is the Army Commander's orders.

446
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:41,387
Anyone who crosses the border
is no longer a citizen of Joseon.

447
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,639
-What?
-How…

448
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:48,727
You're saying that
the country we've made our way back to,

449
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,063
after escaping death countless times,

450
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,649
is abandoning us?

451
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,323
If you take another step,

452
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,075
I will cut you down.

453
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,455
Do it.

454
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,213
Who's there?

455
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,103
If you so much as touch
a hair on these women's heads,

456
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,147
I shall cut your throat.

457
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,112
You will regret this.

458
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,545
You're late.

459
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,047
Thank you for staying alive.

460
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,800
I'm sorry I am so late.

461
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,289
Did you have another nightmare?

462
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,792
It's already been a year.

463
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:37,711
You can put it to rest now.

464
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,425
Let's go see a physician tomorrow
and have him prescribe something.

465
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,856
Thank you, sir.

466
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,285
-Goodness.
-It's that woman.

467
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,954
-It's her.
-Goodness.

468
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,956
-How unsightly!
-Look at her.

469
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:17,084
-Goodness.
-I can't believe my eyes.

470
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,378
-What is this world coming to?
-The nerve of her!

471
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,683
How dare they call this tiny stream,

472
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:35,143
"Hoijeolgang"?

473
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,729
What does it mean? "Hoijeolgang"?

474
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,982
They say it is a river
where one regains one's virtue.

475
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,110
The government designated it as such.

476
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,153
They say they will absolve
one of their sins

477
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,989
should one wash oneself here.

478
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,324
What sins have we committed?

479
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,244
The sin of returning alive

480
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,163
after being taken by the barbarians.

481
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:57,791
Are they accusing us

482
00:47:57,874 --> 00:48:00,377
of prostituting ourselves
to return here alive?

483
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:01,795
Yes.

484
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,298
I can't believe this.

485
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:07,593
Had I known it was going to be like this,
I shouldn't have come back!

486
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,930
It is mere gossip.

487
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,849
It will wash away

488
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,310
as time goes by.

489
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:27,613
Have you heard the news?

490
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,115
The Great Lord of Sinpung, Jang Seon-hong,

491
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:34,119
has asked the King for his permission
to divorce his wife.

492
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,704
Over what?

493
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,080
His wife is a Returning Lady

494
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,375
who came home
after being taken by the barbarians.

495
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,172
How can we let a woman sullied
by the barbarians

496
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:49,843
carry on the family line
and prepare the ancestral rites?

497
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:54,681
-I will look for your new wife soon.
-Mother!

498
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,892
Our country was too weak to protect them.

499
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,310
Our women suffered this indignity

500
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,103
because our men failed
to protect our nation.

501
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,147
How could you place fault on the women?

502
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,524
I heard some wives took their own lives
to protect their virtue.

503
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,234
For whose virtue?

504
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,528
Never…

505
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,697
speak of such things again.

506
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,077
What about the rumors?

507
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,245
What will you do about them?

508
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:21,458
Do you even know what sort of things
people are saying about your wife?

509
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:33,553
Did you hear?
About the Chief Officer's wife?

510
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,555
She hasn't been out much lately.

511
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:39,142
They say she's pregnant
with a barbarian's child.

512
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,060
Really?

513
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:40,977
Yes!

514
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:41,937
Goodness.

515
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:44,898
They say it's the quiet ones
you have to watch out for.

516
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,901
Someone saw her go to the physician
a few days ago.

517
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,153
I heard it was to get rid of the child!

518
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,613
I heard that too!

519
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,031
Then it must be true!

520
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,491
It must be, goodness.

521
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,454
Who told you that?

522
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:02,999
Please, have mercy on me, sir.

523
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,961
Shut your mouth.

524
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,881
Ma'am!

525
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:10,841
Ma'am!

526
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,759
Ma'am, it's urgent!

527
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,511
What is it?

528
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,683
-Oh, my.
-Goodness!

529
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,479
Tell me exactly where
and who you heard that from.

530
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:27,941
-I'm sorry, sir! Please, have mercy!
-We don't know!

531
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:31,695
Everyone was saying it,
so we just joined in.

532
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,029
Please, have mercy!

533
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,745
I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry!

534
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,663
We'll never do it again!

535
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,707
Everyone was saying it, we didn't mean…

536
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,126
Stop! What is the meaning of all this?

537
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,712
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am!

538
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,172
Please, help us!

539
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,798
Please, help us! Help us!

540
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:55,469
How are we supposed to know
where this rumor started?

541
00:50:58,638 --> 00:50:59,598
Yes.

542
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,476
Where there is no smoke, there is no fire.

543
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,521
-You may go.
-Sorry?

544
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,857
-Mother.
-I'm sure there are worse being said.

545
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,858
Let them go.

546
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:15,697
What do you think about this rumor?

547
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:17,324
What are you saying, Mother?

548
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:20,702
You may go.

549
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,497
Thank you, ma'am!

550
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,798
What are you doing?

551
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,592
Those kinds of men must be punished.

552
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,177
Put away your sword.

553
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,284
Not once had he ever talked back to me
while growing up.

554
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:05,539
There must be a reason
why my son has changed so much.

555
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,639
Do you think your own life

556
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,976
is worth more
than the honor of this family?

557
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,396
Mother.

558
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,107
You must decide.

559
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,526
Whether you'll die with honor

560
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:37,779
or die by someone else's hand.

561
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,037
She is so shameless.

562
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,914
-Goodness.
-My gosh.

563
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,584
I feel bad for her husband.

564
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,669
I don't know how he can live
with such shame!

565
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:55,797
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

566
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:59,217
The nerve of that Returning Lady,
going around with her chin held up high!

567
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,011
Her audacity!

568
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,387
How dare you!

569
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,180
Let's go.

570
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,474
I am fine, but how dare they insult you!

571
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,143
Come on, let's go.

572
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,481
How dare she come to the market?
She'll bring ill luck to us all.

573
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,483
Take that, you hussy!

574
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,777
What do you think you're doing?

575
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,447
Oh, no.

576
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,241
Ma'am. Goodness…

577
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,872
What have we done wrong?

578
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:31,791
Look me in the eyes and say it again.

579
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,502
This dirty Returning Lady's got pride.

580
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,965
You should be welcoming us.

581
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,967
How dare you point fingers
at women who defended

582
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,595
the honor of the men
who couldn't protect this country?

583
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:44,930
Shame on you!

584
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,806
Shut up!

585
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,767
Ma'am!

586
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,894
You have no right to raise your voice,
you Returning Lady!

587
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:55,273
-Jeez!
-You!

588
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,901
Why do you place the blame on us?

589
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:10,372
Ma'am…

590
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,832
-Jeez!
-Go away!

591
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:16,544
-Damned Returning Lady!
-Leave!

592
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,797
Stay as you are, my lady.

593
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,090
I will…

594
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,343
protect you.

595
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,341
Gop-dan…

596
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,559
Gop-dan.

597
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,145
Gop-dan!

598
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,189
Gop-dan!

599
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,445
Gop-dan!

600
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,370
Gop-dan!

601
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,096
Ryeon!

602
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,139
Please.

603
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:53,016
I'd rather die as well.

604
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:56,770
It's just a rumor. This too shall pass!

605
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:58,229
That rumor

606
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,441
just keeps spreading.

607
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,069
False as it may be,

608
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:07,030
it is what people talk about, every day.

609
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:09,157
I cannot sleep.

610
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,534
I cannot eat.

611
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,704
I cannot do anything.

612
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,664
How can you only think of yourself?

613
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:18,750
What about me!

614
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,380
Do I not matter to you?

615
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,555
I will only get in the way of your career.

616
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,516
I have no intention of achieving my dream

617
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:37,227
at your sacrifice.

618
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:42,273
Don't ever do anything so rash again.

619
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,239
I will take care of it, no matter what.

620
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:56,079
So you've been visiting her bed
ever since?

621
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,205
That's right!

622
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:59,916
She had such pale skin,
seeing as how she's a noblewoman.

623
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,085
It's like paradise on earth.

624
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:05,421
I was planning to cut her off
after just once or twice, but…

625
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:06,339
But?

626
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,675
She's such a lecherous little thing.

627
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,593
She's so eager to have me

628
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,053
that she doesn't let me sleep
throughout the night!

629
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:15,223
She's fallen hard for you, right?

630
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:17,183
No doubt about that,
if she's climbing the wall

631
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,102
without her mother-in-law
or the Chief Officer seeing.

632
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:23,815
Who's there?

633
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,695
Sir.

634
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,739
Please, don't kill me.

635
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,075
It's too late.

636
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:46,045
I'll take down anyone
who dares to utter such insults,

637
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,423
no matter how many bastards there are.

638
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,855
Is that how you were taught
to wield your sword?

639
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:07,567
Ryeon.

640
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,152
Put it away.

641
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:15,200
I will not.

642
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,869
You have worked to protect these people.

643
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:20,580
Yet it is from the very mouths
of the people we have sought to protect

644
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,541
that this foul rumor continues
to spread like lice.

645
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:28,129
Every day, another rumor sprouts
like a weed taking root.

646
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,632
What other choice do I have

647
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,927
than to cut them down?

648
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:39,974
I shall cut and cut

649
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,228
until there is nothing left.

650
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,359
-I am doing this for you.
-No.

651
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:52,028
I have put their vile blood on my hand
to protect you.

652
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:56,241
You should have killed me instead
with that sword.

653
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,954
You should have listened to your mother.

654
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:04,624
Stop it.

655
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,751
You shouldn't have stopped me then.

656
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:07,752
I told you to stop.

657
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,045
It would have been better…

658
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,423
if I had never returned.

659
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:13,341
Stop!

660
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:23,434
Do you think of me as a beast
because I killed them?

661
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,063
Why do you look at me so?

662
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,190
You know who I did this for.

663
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,984
Don't say it was for me.

664
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,070
It would have been better

665
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,948
if I had never returned.

666
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:40,410
At least then,

667
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,871
our end would have been better than this.

668
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:12,734
I have done nothing I am ashamed of.

669
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:18,114
But how can I live,
seeing you lose yourself

670
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:23,369
and knowing that I have made you so?

671
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,259
I am afraid this is the end of
what fate has planned for us

672
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,304
in this Land of the Living.

673
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:03,660
I'm sorry.

674
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,184
Get rid of the body

675
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,269
so nobody gets a word of this.

676
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,479
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

677
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,691
Stop.

678
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:36,109
Stop!

679
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:37,295
Don't go, Ryeon…

680
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:39,964
I'm so sorry.

681
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:42,800
Ryeon.

682
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:44,677
Ryeon!

683
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:49,891
You can't go like this.

684
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:28,387
