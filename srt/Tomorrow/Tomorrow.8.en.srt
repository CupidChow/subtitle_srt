1
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,205
10 YEARS AGO

2
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,208
Can I ask you a question?
There's something I'm curious about.

3
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,839
Why don't you sleep, sir?

4
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,178
Why are you smiling?

5
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,764
You've been working under me
for about 200 years now,

6
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,350
and that's the first question
you want to ask me?

7
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,024
The truth is I can't sleep.

8
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,194
I'm afraid of falling asleep.

9
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:13,573
When I sleep, that horrible moment
keeps repeating itself.

10
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,575
Who are you?

11
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,119
Sadness and rage.

12
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,706
Distrust and despair.

13
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:23,917
And…

14
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:25,960
lethargy.

15
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,255
The person looks exactly like me

16
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,508
but that's not me.

17
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,512
So I hate seeing that nightmare
every time I fall asleep.

18
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,513
I'm

19
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,057
afraid to fall asleep.

20
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,315
Does that answer your question?

21
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,442
Yes.

22
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,666
Death by asphyxiation.

23
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,376
EPISODE 8: BROKER

24
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,087
In a sealed room.

25
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,548
A gas tank.

26
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,635
SUICIDE RISK CASE SUMMARY REPORT

27
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,808
MANNER OF SUICIDE:
DEATH BY ASPHYXIATION

28
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,404
NITROGEN

29
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,866
Where did she get something like that?

30
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,660
GAS

31
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,830
GAS SUICIDE

32
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:48,877
What is this?

33
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,962
NITROGEN

34
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,442
Have some too.

35
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,111
Yes. Are you okay?

36
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,493
Before,

37
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,872
I was never happy even when I was eating
the most delicious things,

38
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,417
but I'm much better now.

39
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,252
That's good to hear.

40
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,296
But…

41
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,090
why did you ask to see me?

42
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:40,053
I was curious about something.

43
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,182
The things that were
in your room that day.

44
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,893
Right.

45
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:50,146
I was wondering if you could tell me
where you got them.

46
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,108
I know, of course.

47
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,819
It's not something
that's easy to talk about.

48
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,364
And I'm not trying to blame you either.

49
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:04,077
I was just thinking something like this
shouldn't happen again…

50
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,955
I posted things on my social media.

51
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,916
About how I wanted to die.

52
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,877
CAN YOU REALLY DIE WITHOUT PAIN?

53
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,505
Then one day,

54
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,757
Someone sent me a private message.

55
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,841
IT WAS DEVELOPED AS A GUARANTEED
AND PAINLESS WAY TO END YOUR LIFE

56
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,802
They said they could help me.

57
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:29,727
Ma'am.

58
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,107
-Here you go.
-What's up? You…

59
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,027
I see. It's performance evaluation season.

60
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,654
Yes.

61
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,115
I'd appreciate it if you could give me
a good evaluation.

62
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,663
You're a good person
and you're great at your job already.

63
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,541
You're pretty ambitious, aren't you?

64
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,335
I bet you're the only Reaper in Jumadeung

65
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,795
who has given up on a promotion.

66
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,965
Is that why you are afraid of nothing?

67
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,717
Is that an insult or a compliment?

68
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,718
Both.

69
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,804
I'll exercise my own discretion
for your evaluation.

70
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,723
As you wish.

71
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,808
Ma'am.

72
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,019
The things I saw in Ms. Shin Ye-na's room.

73
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,228
-The--
-Mr. Choi.

74
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,646
Did you check your email?

75
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,481
-What?
-The performance evaluation form.

76
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,359
Employees are supposed to evaluate
each other's work performance.

77
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,070
You can fill out the evaluations
for Ms. Koo and me.

78
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,156
That's not what's important right now…

79
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,159
I found people who use suicide
as a way to make money.

80
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,786
Take a look at this.

81
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,747
It's similar to what happened
with Ms. Shin Ye-na.

82
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,752
They only accept cryptocurrencies
so they can't be traced.

83
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,379
These bastards are complete professionals.

84
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,508
Come to think of it, I think they were
the ones behind our previous case.

85
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,385
You mean the van?

86
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,307
They're very well prepared.
How did they meet?

87
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,560
I think they met through a broker.

88
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,480
What is it? Why don't I know?

89
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,899
It happened before you got here.

90
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,942
They make posts on social media saying

91
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,819
they'll teach them a surefire
and painless method.

92
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,697
Or they message people
who are depressed to recruit them.

93
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,033
Yes.

94
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,701
I knew it wasn't their first time.

95
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,454
Let's get those bastards.

96
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,084
No. Don't do anything rash.

97
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,669
How is this rash?

98
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,173
What? Are you going to go
and bring them to justice?

99
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,299
Don't kid yourself.

100
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,509
That's not our job.

101
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,220
Reapers may not use their powers
in front of people

102
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,430
or intervene in their affairs.

103
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,307
I'm sure you know that very well.

104
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,350
He's right.

105
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:36,604
As you know, our job is to help people
to live out their designated lifespan.

106
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,980
That's it.

107
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,690
Why? Intervening is what we do.

108
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,193
That's only limited to
the people on The Red Light.

109
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,653
The permission is temporary.

110
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,779
Still, this is--

111
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:48,074
If we start intervening in human affairs,
there would be no end to it.

112
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,952
Politics, society, war, pollution.

113
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,787
We'll be mixed up in countless issues.

114
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,834
It's the job of the living to take care of
the social order. Do you understand?

115
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,211
The Risk Management Team
is strictly temporary.

116
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:03,005
With so many people in the company
against this team,

117
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,341
is it necessary for us
to cause more problems?

118
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,802
So we just leave these psychos alone?

119
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,262
I'm sorry. It can't be helped.

120
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,806
But this situation is different.
Like with Ms. Shin.

121
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:13,808
Because of these guys,

122
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,477
we might not be able
to save the people who are at risk.

123
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,230
Ma'am, please reconsider your decision.

124
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,314
No.

125
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,316
Please, Ma'am.

126
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,360
Mr. Choi Jun-woong.

127
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,822
Again, it's not our job to bring justice.

128
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,907
I don't want to hear it!

129
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,953
I'm just telling you what I think.
Is anything I'm saying wrong?

130
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,789
This is so frustrating.

131
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:44,672
Jeez!

132
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,550
If you don't care about it,
then just say so.

133
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,762
"Don't kid yourself,
it's not our job to bring justice."

134
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,765
Whatever.

135
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,684
If I can't get help from the afterworld,

136
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,061
I'll get it from the Land of the Living.

137
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,566
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE
POLICE OFFICE

138
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,778
So you're saying that there are people
selling tools to aid in the suicide

139
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,031
of suicidal people in exchange for money?

140
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,657
-Is that it?
-Yes.

141
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,869
They're evil guys who gather people
to encourage mass suicide.

142
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:15,870
Do you have proof?

143
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:19,123
I found an online cafe that proves it.
Hang on.

144
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,292
Here, look at this.

145
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,295
-Jeez.
-What?

146
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,965
Sorry. I did find a link.

147
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,967
See, here. This one.

148
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,721
They're just some scammers

149
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,182
who take the money
and send fake items or disappear.

150
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,476
No, I'm telling the truth.

151
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,687
If you bring me more conclusive proof,
then I'll think about it.

152
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,481
Wait. What do you mean,

153
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,234
you'll think about it
when I get more conclusive proof?

154
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,860
Aren't you being irresponsible?

155
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,488
Isn't this something the police
should be investigating?

156
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,824
Sir, we're very busy people.

157
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,828
It's hard enough having to deal
with tons of ridiculous reports every day.

158
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:58,788
So,

159
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,749
just stop it with this pointless report.

160
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,960
"Pointless"? People's lives are at stake!

161
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,419
I've had enough.

162
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,797
You dare raise your voice
in a police station?

163
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,882
Who are you anyway?

164
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,676
I'm a Grim…

165
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,722
What I mean is…

166
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,349
You are?

167
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,268
I'm looking for a job.

168
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,438
Sir.

169
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,733
Just focus on finding a job,
instead of wasting your time like this.

170
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,194
Isn't the job competition
really fierce these days?

171
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,238
What does that have to do with this?

172
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,156
You have too much time on your hands.

173
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,492
That's why you're looking into
these things.

174
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,994
No, I'm telling you it's real!

175
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,204
Get out! I'm busy enough as it is.

176
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,581
Busy?

177
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,791
I'm telling you! It's real!

178
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:45,751
Let's go, sir.

179
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,796
Let's not make a scene.

180
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,464
You people are all the same!

181
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,382
HUMAN RIGHTS, IMPARTIAL, KIND

182
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,383
Let go of me!

183
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:53,926
Jeez.

184
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,178
I'm telling you, it's real!

185
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,639
Goodness.

186
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,268
They're all the same,

187
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,270
whether in the afterworld
or the Land of the Living.

188
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:05,855
What is this?

189
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,732
NITROGEN

190
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,611
THE OFFICER WHO WAS AT THE SCENE SAID THE
ENTIRE APARTMENT WAS FULL OF NITROGEN GAS

191
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,036
Never mind, I'll find this scammer myself.

192
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,412
I'll find them.

193
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,165
"I wish tomorrow wouldn't come."

194
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:28,002
"Once I open my eyes,
I fear the new day in front of me."

195
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,879
"Every day is painful."

196
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:32,798
"Why do I have to live?"

197
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:37,678
"Hashtag depression, suicide, the end."

198
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,608
Why aren't they writing back already?

199
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,819
Do I have to make it
sound more depressing?

200
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,117
GRIM REAPER
DEATH_GUY

201
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,578
It's here.

202
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,414
Their ID is "Grim Reaper"?

203
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,625
Just who do they think they are?

204
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,295
I have you now.
I'm going to get you no matter what.

205
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,256
My ID.

206
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,510
SET UP ID

207
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,178
"Jumadeung."

208
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,471
JUMADEUNG
CONFIRM

209
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,226
Betamale, Goodbye, Farewell, Sunset.

210
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,740
"Is death really guaranteed?"

211
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:40,741
Is it painless?

212
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,992
What methods do you have?

213
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,787
"How can you be sure it won't hurt?"

214
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,664
How much is it?

215
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,165
How do you install it?

216
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,709
You have a lot of questions.

217
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,545
This video will answer them.

218
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,754
Video?

219
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,927
What is this?

220
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,887
NITROGEN

221
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,111
Jeez!

222
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,572
What the hell.

223
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,868
Seriously.

224
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,205
As you can see,
its death was quiet and clean.

225
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,291
"Its death was quiet and clean…"

226
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:34,086
I think this is better than
living its whole life in a cage.

227
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,671
Doesn't it hurt?

228
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,047
I developed this for you all

229
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:41,635
as a guaranteed
and painless way to end your lives.

230
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,429
It's for us?

231
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,930
This guy's out of his mind.

232
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,683
I've also attempted
to take my life several times

233
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,268
because of long-term depression.

234
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,021
So I know how you all feel,
more than anyone else.

235
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,485
This time, using this method,

236
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,737
-I plan on dying with you.
-"Plan on dying with you."

237
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,700
So what do you say?

238
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,371
I'll do it.

239
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,875
Trying to die alone was hard for me,

240
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,837
but I think I can find the courage
if I have someone to do it with me.

241
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,965
What about the rest of you?

242
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,303
Can I join?

243
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,180
I'll join you too.

244
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,351
I was afraid of doing it alone too.
I'll join you.

245
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,275
What about you, Jumadeung?

246
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,197
Goodness.

247
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,957
"I'll join you too."

248
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,230
"In case of extreme danger,

249
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:19,441
weapons may be used under the discretion
of the commanding officer."

250
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,095
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,555
Ms. Koo.

252
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,724
Mr. Lim.

253
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,573
Is this it?

254
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,604
Are you…

255
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,483
I'm Jumadeung.

256
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,859
I see.

257
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,903
I'm Beta…

258
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,697
Betamale, that's my ID.

259
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,034
I'm Sunset.

260
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:54,912
I'm Goodbye.

261
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:01,210
Grim Reaper said they'd come by
with the items soon.

262
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,927
I guess Farewell isn't coming.

263
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,224
Coward. Everyone mustered up
the courage to come here.

264
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,603
Come on, we all have our reasons.

265
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,814
You shouldn't be saying things like that.

266
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,734
You're very empathetic, Jumadeung.

267
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,903
You don't seem like someone
who belongs here.

268
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,785
I get worked up easily.

269
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,288
I'm sorry.

270
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,891
I don't think I can do it while sober.

271
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:03,897
I realized only now

272
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,942
that I'm not talented enough

273
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,236
to make a living as a pianist.

274
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,950
But I'm scared of starting something new
at this age.

275
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,705
Give it a try. You're still so young.

276
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,457
I hate my youth.

277
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,044
I thought things would work out
if I gave it my all,

278
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,671
that my hard work wouldn't betray me.

279
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,633
But seeing less-talented colleagues
hold recitals

280
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,844
just because they come
from wealthy families,

281
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,555
just made me hate myself.

282
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,062
I'm so tired.

283
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,733
After voluntary retirement,

284
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,611
I was home alone all day.

285
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,488
And I started feeling like

286
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,115
I was a useless person to my family.

287
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,495
I thought I had lived my entire life
for my family.

288
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,708
But it turns out I haven't done anything
for myself.

289
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,419
It all felt so futile.

290
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,634
Then why don't you look into hobbies
or start your own business?

291
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,385
What?

292
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,930
You don't seem like someone
who wants to die.

293
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,017
You just seem a bit different
from the rest of us.

294
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,897
I'm sorry.

295
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:36,156
How did you come to make this decision?

296
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,367
Right.

297
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,621
You can take your time.

298
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,921
I've been looking for a job.

299
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,423
My father died when I was young,

300
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,593
and my mother ran a snack bar
to pay for my education.

301
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,431
I've worked so hard to reach my goal.

302
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,143
I couldn't afford to feel tired,

303
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,813
thinking about my mother,
my sister, and my late father.

304
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:13,527
But the reality was so harsh and cold.

305
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,196
I think the feeling of dejection

306
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,616
from reading all the texts that told me
I didn't get the job

307
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,953
brought me all the way here.

308
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,957
It must have been very hard.

309
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,758
Where can I find the bathroom?

310
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,011
It's up there.

311
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,164
What are you doing, Choi Jun-woong?

312
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,332
Get it together.

313
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,667
Get it together.

314
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,375
Damn, it's Grim Reaper.

315
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,264
Guys, he's here.

316
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,391
-We have to get out of here.
-What?

317
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,768
What do you mean? Who's here?

318
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,437
How should I say this?

319
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,786
Is that Grim Reaper?

320
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,497
He said he'd go with us too.

321
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,748
No, he's a scammer.

322
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,334
He's an evil guy using you to make money.

323
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,421
He'll be the only one to live
and recruit more suicidal people.

324
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,006
No way…

325
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,173
Come on.

326
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,758
We have to get out of here.

327
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,846
Whether or not we're being used,
wouldn't it be better to die?

328
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,767
No. You coming all the way here
when you could have done it yourself

329
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:54,021
is because you wanted someone
to hear your story, isn't it?

330
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,355
Come on.

331
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:59,693
Didn't you come because you had this hope
that someone would stop you?

332
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,196
But we all promised
that we would die together.

333
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,658
No! Please don't throw away your lives

334
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,578
on a piece of trash like him.

335
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,080
You have to cherish it, please.

336
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,293
Business cards.

337
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,669
Right, cards. Please.

338
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,547
Call this number and they'll listen to
everything you want to say.

339
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,134
Whatever you want to talk about,
whatever's on your mind, they'll listen.

340
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:27,054
So call this number.
Let's just go for now, okay?

341
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,308
TEAM MANAGER KOO RYEON
RISK MANAGEMENT TEAM

342
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,895
We don't have time.
We have to go right now!

343
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,450
No.

344
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,618
I won't go.

345
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,453
Please.

346
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,665
I really made up my mind this time.

347
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,918
Please, you have to live.

348
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,213
I don't know why you're here,
but as long as you're alive,

349
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,173
you have a chance to fix it. So let's go.

350
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,174
No.

351
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,801
I really don't want to.

352
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:09,888
Come on. You have to go now.

353
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,226
Hello.

354
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:17,854
But why are there only the two of you?
Where are the others?

355
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,397
I sent them all away.

356
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,484
You're a scammer, aren't you?
I've got you now.

357
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,487
I was going to let you die peacefully,
but you just won't let me.

358
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,906
Hey.

359
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,408
Guess you're destined
to be beaten to death.

360
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,120
I brought this just in case.

361
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,079
Take it.

362
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,042
I already died once,
I'm not scared of anything.

363
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:43,922
Come on, you bastard!

364
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,104
Damn it.

365
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:14,995
Damn it!

366
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,859
Are you okay?

367
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,123
I'm not okay because of you.

368
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,685
There's nothing more to say,
seeing as how they went over the wall.

369
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,189
Who are you?

370
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,902
Sir.

371
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,904
Please, don't kill me.

372
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,491
It's too late.

373
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,626
I'll take down anyone
who dares to utter such insults,

374
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:48,004
no matter how many bastards there are.

375
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,793
What? Choi Jun-woong didn't come?

376
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,295
I guess so.

377
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,921
He must be really mad.

378
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,634
Does he think he can do this just because
he's not happy about something?

379
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,886
-Should I call him?
-No.

380
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,306
He probably just needs some time to think.

381
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,349
It's not like he can go far.

382
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,601
He's probably wandering around
somewhere nearby.

383
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:49,899
WEAPON USAGE RULES

384
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,902
I don't think so.

385
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,325
It seems he's taken some things.

386
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,248
What? Has he gone after the broker?

387
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,293
That seems likely.

388
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,633
I didn't think this would come in handy.

389
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,719
He acts like a complete child sometimes,

390
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,680
so I installed something onto his phone.

391
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,391
How appropriate.

392
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,062
LOADING…
FIND MISSING CHILD

393
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,063
148-69 EUMBAWI-GIL, ANDONG-MYEON,
POCHEON-SI, GYEONGGI-DO

394
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,648
He went pretty far.

395
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,865
He's fine, right?

396
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,534
He probably hiding somewhere
because he's scared.

397
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,119
And that's what I'm hoping.

398
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:19,531
Damn it!

399
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,958
What are you?

400
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,167
Me?

401
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,252
Betamale.

402
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:33,711
And also…

403
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,383
Grim Reaper.

404
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,765
I guess you don't understand.

405
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,862
They're both me.

406
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,158
NITROGEN

407
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,589
GRIM REAPER: BETAMALE, DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD JOIN ME?

408
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,010
BETAMALE: OKAY. WE'LL GO TOGETHER

409
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,640
CAN I JOIN?
I'LL JOIN YOU TOO

410
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,147
But why…

411
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,942
What do you think?

412
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,235
Is it because of money?

413
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,529
I've already earned enough money.

414
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,282
-Then what?
-Because I want to live.

415
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,702
-What?
-Strangely enough, whenever I want to die,

416
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,247
looking at other bastards die
makes me want to live again.

417
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,460
But you ruined everything, damn it.

418
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,129
You're one crazy bastard, aren't you?

419
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,261
Hearing something
like that all of a sudden

420
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,431
makes me feel so good.

421
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,016
Maybe I really am crazy.

422
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,643
You psycho.

423
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,270
But what's your deal?
You don't look like a cop.

424
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,069
I'm a Grim Reaper, you bastard.

425
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,699
Are you insane?
I told you, I'm Grim Reaper.

426
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:27,700
This won't do.

427
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,370
I can't have you going any crazier.
Let's do it right now.

428
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,871
As the real Grim Reaper,

429
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,041
I'll show you.

430
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,129
What are you doing?

431
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,715
Untie me, you bastard!

432
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,635
I'll untie the rope once you die,
don't worry.

433
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,012
If the cops find out,

434
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,598
I need to be someone
who just sold a couple of these.

435
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,476
And you'll be the one
who used it in a weird way.

436
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,440
You bastard.

437
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,302
JUMADEUNG

438
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,050
Fight someone your own size, you coward.

439
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,303
Choi Jun-woong, wake up.
Are you all right?

440
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:16,267
No. You can't…

441
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,227
Mr. Lim, keep a close eye on him.

442
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,147
Ma'am!

443
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,360
Mr. Lim, we need to get that guy.

444
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,153
I told you.

445
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,447
We can't intervene in human affairs.

446
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,782
We need to get him.

447
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,533
Mr. Choi Jun-woong!

448
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,955
At the company, there are rules.

449
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,416
But ever since you joined the team,
we kept breaking them.

450
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,463
You might be leaving this team
in six months,

451
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,508
but we're a team that needs to continue
until we achieve our goal.

452
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:54,597
So please stop doing such reckless things
while you're here.

453
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,281
Why is nothing going my way? Damn it.

454
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:14,867
What the hell?

455
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,704
Why is she so fast?

456
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,248
Try to follow this!

457
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,457
Just try!

458
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,797
I knew it. I must have imagined it.

459
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,340
I thought I'd gone insane!

460
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,514
What's that?

461
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,474
I'm going to hit you!

462
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,018
Seriously, I'm going to hit you!

463
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:43,688
Damn it!

464
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,829
I told you to move!

465
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,998
I said I was going to hit you!

466
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,125
Damn it.

467
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,586
I said I was going to hit you.

468
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,141
Get it together, you bastard.

469
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,643
I told her to move.
So how's it even possible?

470
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,063
How can someone appear here
and then there?

471
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,856
It doesn't make sense. I imagined it.

472
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,025
Right. I imagined it.

473
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:34,864
What are you?

474
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:35,782
Me?

475
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,492
A Grim Reaper.

476
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,369
Why is everyone saying
they're a grim reaper?

477
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,996
I'm Grim Reaper!

478
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,374
-What is it, some sort of fad?
-No, I'm a Grim Reaper.

479
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,794
But first, you need a beating.

480
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,265
Making money using
people's lives like this.

481
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,934
And you call yourself human?

482
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,186
You piece of trash.

483
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:11,776
Why…

484
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,655
Why's that wrong? Why?

485
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,326
They want to die.

486
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:25,998
All I did was just help people
who wanted to die.

487
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:26,958
I mean.

488
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,253
Did I tell them to kill themselves?

489
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,463
Did I tell them to kill themselves?

490
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,842
That's enough. I think it'd be better
if you didn't exist in this world.

491
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,770
Ma'am! You can't intervene any further!

492
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,272
Why? Why are you stopping her?

493
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,586
SONG JIN-HO, AGE 34

494
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,465
Ma'am, Mr. Lim.

495
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,469
Why's this bastard on The Red Light?

496
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,805
Why?

497
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,853
The virus…

498
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,194
I think he is our case.

499
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,739
This doesn't make sense.

500
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,241
Right? Ma'am!

501
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,367
Choi Jun-woong.

502
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,912
-What's our job?
-No.

503
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,830
We have to draw the line.

504
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,833
No. Even if our case is a criminal,

505
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,710
it's our job to save him

506
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,254
if he tries to give up on life.

507
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,549
I told you, he tried to kill people!

508
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,843
And me, you saw it.

509
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,305
We can't decide if he lives or dies.

510
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,807
The authority to decide
if he lives or dies is not in our hands!

511
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,894
Why? Why on earth
do we have to save someone like him?

512
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,738
I think it's poison.

513
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,950
The job's over anyway.

514
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,119
It's better that I die.

515
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,329
No.

516
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,664
You can't die!

517
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,457
Ma'am, what do we do?

518
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,125
What are you doing? Call 911!

519
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,337
No.

520
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,299
What if there's another victim?
What will you do then?

521
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:42,718
No.

522
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,220
Leave him to die.

523
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:48,182
Ma'am. As long as he's on The Red Light,

524
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,269
-we have to save him no matter what!
-No, I don't want to.

525
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,979
I don't want to, Ma'am!

526
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,399
What's the point of
saving a bastard like him?

527
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,026
Let's just leave him here

528
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,446
and help someone who actually needs us.
That's what we should do!

529
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,241
Choi Jun-woong!
You think you're the only one who's just?

530
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,201
I'm furious too!

531
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,037
But we still…

532
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,000
have to save him.

533
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,253
That's what the RM Team does.

534
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,089
Do you understand?

535
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,554
Then I quit…

536
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,101
the RM Team.

537
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,335
What brings you here…

538
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,052
This soul reeks of something rotten.

539
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,773
Did you think death was the end?

540
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,109
No.

541
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,946
Compared to the price
you'll have to pay for your sins,

542
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,323
this is just the beginning.

543
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,658
What are you?

544
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,285
There's only one place for you.

545
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:36,540
You will burn for all eternity
within flames that never die.

546
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,628
Every moment,
you will feel your body being ripped apart

547
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,171
and put back together again.

548
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,049
The most horrific Hell there is.

549
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:06,779
Save me.

550
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,200
You said you have to save me.

551
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,460
What are you doing?

552
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,212
I said save me.

553
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,176
The RM Team is saving
even these kinds of people?

554
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,031
This all started because of you.

555
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,325
So you decide.

556
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,453
If you're going to save him

557
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,622
or quit the RM Team.

558
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,208
Ma'am!

559
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,297
Hurry up and save me.

560
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,049
If I die…

561
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,263
you're the one who killed me.

562
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,893
Then how would you be
any different from me?

563
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,897
Save me, come on.

564
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,407
Save me, please.

565
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,745
I really want to live.

566
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:55,763
Is this 911?

567
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,184
We have someone here who drank poison,
please send help.

568
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,817
Don't laugh!

569
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,452
You can't die. No, I won't kill you!

570
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:21,997
Live.

571
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:23,749
You need to live

572
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,836
so you can pay for everything you've done.
Then you can die.

573
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,879
Do you understand?

574
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:30,881
How?

575
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,967
Do you have proof I did it?

576
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,720
Damn it!

577
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:44,163
Please do your best to be
a Reaper who souls can trust.

578
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,680
Let's have a drink.

579
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,103
Aren't you going home?

580
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,438
I will,

581
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:10,898
but I can have a can of beer.

582
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,496
You did well.
It must have been a tough decision.

583
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,916
I didn't want to become the same as him.

584
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,340
This is a secret…

585
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,886
but I heard Ms. Koo was an emotional
and immature brat like you

586
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,096
when she was new too.

587
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,265
A brat?

588
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,559
Whenever she ran into anyone bad
in the Land of the Living,

589
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,562
she would beat them up regardless of
their remaining lifespan.

590
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,690
She's much older now,

591
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,234
so she controls that fiery temper of hers.

592
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:57,986
Really?

593
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,196
Yes.

594
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,119
There have been situations
like this before

595
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:08,539
where we had to save a scammer
who was trying to take their own life.

596
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:12,418
Many people had gone into debt
because of that person.

597
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,963
Two breadwinners of their families
took their own lives.

598
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,966
What happened to that scammer?

599
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,051
Did you save them?

600
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,720
She made the same decision then

601
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,474
as she made today.

602
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:32,855
But why…

603
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,774
You saw it too.
He didn't feel guilty at all.

604
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:40,654
Honestly, I still think
we should have left him to die.

605
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,198
No.

606
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,867
Living out the rest of their life

607
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,161
was much worse for that scammer.

608
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:52,708
Because they had to pay for what
they had done while they were still alive.

609
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,545
You might not know this,
but if there's anything more painful

610
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,589
than the punishment you
receive after death,

611
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,716
it's the punishment you get
when you're alive.

612
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,718
Because you have to feel
ten times the pain

613
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,012
your victims and their loved ones suffered

614
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,513
until you die.

615
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:09,558
Song Jin-ho.

616
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,313
It will be the same with him too.

617
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:18,400
We managed to save him,
but he'll lose his voice.

618
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,777
Poor guy. He's still so young.

619
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,154
Poor guy.

620
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,004
What's this?

621
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,508
He said there was no proof,

622
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,093
but Jumadeung has been recording
his whole life as is.

623
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,555
We usually don't edit the footage
until they are about to die,

624
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,934
but you know how Ms. Koo is.

625
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:56,063
She gathered the footage
of every single one of his crimes.

626
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:58,941
Of course,

627
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,777
it's an afterlife IP address,
so it's untraceable.

628
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,988
You're not going to report him?

629
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:09,868
Who said I wasn't?

630
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:14,206
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE
HUMAN RIGHTS, IMPARTIAL, KIND

631
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:34,685
All I did

632
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:38,647
was just help people who wanted to die.

633
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,632
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

634
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,843
GUEST ENTRY RESTRICTED

635
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,602
Excuse me.

636
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,478
Hey.

637
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,188
Hey!

638
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,857
-Hey!
-Get him!

639
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,284
Song Jin-ho!

640
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:42,294
Song Jin-ho!

641
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,421
Wake up, Song Jin-ho! Get a doctor now!

642
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:45,922
He will never talk again

643
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,759
or hear anything again.

644
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,428
He'll live the rest
of his life confined to a bed.

645
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,805
With his mind intact.

646
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,475
Saving them so they can receive
the punishment they deserve

647
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,768
in the Land of the Living.

648
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,354
That's one of the powers
the Director has authorized

649
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:03,065
for the team manager
of the Risk Management Team.

650
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,234
That's how he'll live for 18 years,

651
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,987
wishing that he had died then.

652
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,076
It would have been better
if he had gone straight to Hell.

653
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,246
That does make me feel better.

654
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,417
But what if I chose wrong?

655
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,963
How could she trust me…

656
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:31,843
Who knows?

657
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,764
Maybe there's something about you
that only she has faith in.

658
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,266
It was like that with Ms. Shin.

659
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,267
Of course,

660
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,853
I didn't want to believe in you.

661
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,321
Well, then. I'll be heading home now.

662
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,539
Don't tell Ms. Koo that we drank here.

663
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,442
Such an interesting fellow, isn't he?

664
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,611
Sprightly, like a budding leaf.

665
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,030
Maybe it's because he's so young.

666
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:40,203
We have so many years behind us,
and that can make us set in our views.

667
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,497
I thought he would stand back
and watch him die,

668
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,124
but he has good instincts.

669
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,253
I don't know.

670
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,298
You should give credit where it's due.

671
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,384
You have to try
to be generous and open-minded.

672
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,136
Otherwise, you become
a condescending old man.

673
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,345
Are you saying

674
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,514
I'm like that?

675
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,225
I can't say that you aren't.

676
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,358
I see you're still unable to sleep.

677
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:15,572
Dreams take a form different from reality.

678
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,616
I don't understand…

679
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,409
Most people who make the wrong choice

680
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:23,121
regret it for a long time

681
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,707
but eventually, they forget.

682
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:28,043
But sometimes,

683
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:33,089
there are those who are
forever haunted by their regrets.

684
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:35,801
They can never forget.

685
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,137
Not even in their dreams.

686
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:43,266
Even though no amount of regret
can change the past.

687
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,674
I'm sorry, ma'am.

688
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:18,844
Choi Jun-woong.

689
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:22,681
Everything worked out fine this time,

690
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,432
but if something went wrong

691
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,560
that would mean
we wouldn't be able to save

692
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,562
the people who are at risk, like you said.

693
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:33,066
There would be no tomorrow
for the people who need our help.

694
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:41,783
Big or small, every decision you make
is a choice that has consequences.

695
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,995
That's why I tried to stop you
in the beginning.

696
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,872
I still don't regret that decision.

697
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:51,418
So if you ever want to quit, go ahead.

698
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,300
No, I don't.

699
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:00,969
You can't have a team…

700
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:03,638
by yourself.

701
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,058
I don't know when you're going to quit,

702
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,561
but keep that in mind while you're here.

703
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:13,106
Okay, I will.

704
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:15,775
And…

705
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,861
thank you for helping me.

706
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,238
Good that you know.

707
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,074
Would you like some coffee?

708
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,117
I know a good place.

709
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,201
If you want to.

710
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,328
Yes, ma'am!

711
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,172
Here's the coffee, ma'am…

712
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,215
Where did she go?

713
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,027
Right.

714
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,780
You have to be together to be a team.

715
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,074
If you do it alone, it's not a team.

716
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,078
RISK MANAGEMENT TEAM
EMPLOYEE CHOI JUN-WOONG

717
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:15,710
Wait.

718
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,629
You might be leaving this team
in six months,

719
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,840
but we're a team that needs to continue
until we achieve our goal.

720
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:25,303
So please stop doing such reckless things
while you're here.

721
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,554
Goal?

722
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:27,514
I'm sorry.

723
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:31,017
Please keep the promise
that I can go home when the alarm rings.

724
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:36,398
Now that I think about it,
Mr. Lim always leaves work on time,

725
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,816
and Ms. Koo…

726
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,485
You think I'm a good person

727
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:43,029
just because I rescued your friend
and helped you?

728
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,990
-Sorry?
-I'm from Hell.

729
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,325
So don't be mistaken.

730
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,956
Seriously, what is it?

731
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,137
What brings you here?

732
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,722
You have a question for me.

733
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,269
Why did you show up there?

734
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:17,856
It wasn't to escort a soul.

735
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,442
I was only there
to watch the RM Team fail.

736
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:21,359
You're lying.

737
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,531
Why did you help
with Choi Jun-woong's choice?

738
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:29,117
Help him? That's ridiculous.

739
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,161
I know you provoked him on purpose.

740
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,291
It seems you can still see through me.

741
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,170
And did you trust his choice?

742
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,214
I did.

743
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,260
I trusted you once too.

744
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,220
Why did you come here?

745
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,388
Because I wanted to ask.

746
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,977
Is that how you were taught
to wield your sword?

747
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:58,646
You.

748
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:00,523
Why were you there?

749
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,567
No.

750
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,402
Why was I there?

751
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,031
Where?

752
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:11,826
In my nightmares.

753
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,334
EPILOGUE

754
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,086
INCOMING CALL

755
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:23,088
Yes, this is the assistant manager
of the RM Team, Lim Ryung-gu.

756
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:26,341
I don't know much about dating.

757
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:28,885
I can't help with your inability
to find a girlfriend.

758
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,178
I don't write talismans.

759
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:31,763
This isn't that kind of place.

760
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:33,723
The temperature of Han River today…

761
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,768
Ask the Korean
Meteorological Administration.

762
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:40,438
Do these people keep calling you too?

763
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,566
Yes. It first started as
a call for help from suicidal people.

764
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,527
Now they're telling me
about all sorts of problems.

765
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,948
Yes, good night everyone.

766
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:51,991
That's "good night" in English, G-O--

767
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,036
-Choi Jun-woong, aren't you getting them?
-Getting what?

768
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,706
Some lunatic went around giving people
my phone number and Mr. Lim's.

769
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:00,917
Please.

770
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,961
Call this number and they'll listen to
everything you want to say.

771
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,087
Whatever's on your mind…

772
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:05,755
I see.

773
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,174
I wouldn't know.

774
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:11,427
So you aren't getting these calls?

775
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:13,888
You're that lunatic, aren't you?

776
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:17,976
Goodness. I think the Chinese food
I ordered is here.

777
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,519
-You!
-Tangsuyuk, tangsuyuk.

778
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:22,188
-Stop right there.
-Yes, I'm coming. Thank you!

779
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,731
Sorry, ma'am, Mr. Lim!

780
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,026
Is this the HR team?

781
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,611
It's about the performance evaluation form
I submitted yesterday

782
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,737
for Mr. Choi Jun-woong.

783
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,781
Could you change everything to F, please?

784
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,062
Ninety-nine percent.

785
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,939
A very high-risk case.

786
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,232
I thought only people
were on The Red Light…

787
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:09,486
We searched the area, but there weren't
any fliers looking for Kong.

788
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,905
I was just working on
Kong's flashback video.

789
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,157
Your name is Kong. Kim Kong.

790
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,658
No! Kong!

791
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,203
To be brutally honest, are you going
to ruin your life because of a dog?

792
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,455
Because he's sick!
He needs surgery right now.

793
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:21,789
Is that why you were trying to die?

794
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,083
He did abandon him, that bastard!

795
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,418
What do you mean, abandon?

796
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,295
We found out through Kong.

797
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,172
You're lying. Who are you, people?

798
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:30,840
I'll get straight to the point.

799
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,967
Kong tried to commit suicide.

800
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:36,054
