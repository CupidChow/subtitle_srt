1
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,497
It's the start of a new day
for your afterlife partner, Jumadeung.

2
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,249
I can't believe it.

3
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,543
He beat a living person
intending to kill them?

4
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,627
Goodness.

5
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,172
I did hear some rumors about Mr. Lim.

6
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,758
-Like what?
-I heard that Mr. Lim killed someone

7
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,676
while he was still among
the Land of the Living.

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,052
Really?

9
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,846
Yes, and not just one or two either.

10
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,390
That's horrible.

11
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,392
The whole team's not to be
associated with.

12
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,562
A team manager from Hell
and a team member who's a murderer?

13
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:03,813
That's what I'm saying.

14
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,316
Excuse me!

15
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,902
Are you all having fun?

16
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,988
Ms. Jeon, you said Mr. Lim
killed someone in his previous life.

17
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,908
-Did you see that happen yourself?
-Well, no…

18
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,536
Let's only talk about
what we've seen for ourselves, okay?

19
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,206
Let's go.

20
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,750
Let's not get involved with the RM Team.

21
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,921
Don't you all have work to do?

22
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,215
Go on!

23
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,302
I could just…

24
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,518
Jeez, I feel bad.

25
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,644
REAPER DISCIPLINARY ACTION ANNOUNCEMENT

26
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,064
They're running their mouths
when they don't know anything.

27
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,233
Mr. Lim should explain things himself.

28
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,693
Do you know what kinds of rumors
are going around at the company right now?

29
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,738
They're saying Mr. Lim killed
multiple people in his previous life.

30
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,406
Four, to be exact.

31
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,491
Okay, I see.

32
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,284
Come on.

33
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,953
I'm not in a mood to joke around.

34
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,496
I'm not joking.

35
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,125
Come on, I have enough on my mind
without you piling things on too.

36
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,753
I know it's because of
what had happened to his mother,

37
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,006
but to see someone so rational
lose control like that…

38
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,637
And he won't say anything
when I ask why, either.

39
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,303
Yu-hwa.

40
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,638
-Yu-hwa!
-Yu-hwa!

41
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,308
-Look at you!
-Thank you, everyone.

42
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,522
"Hui-hwi-rang-yo."

43
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,191
"Hui-hwi-rang-yo."

44
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,027
"The morning sun shines brightly."

45
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,695
Very good.

46
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,282
Goodness.

47
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,701
My son is so handsome.

48
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,895
EPISODE 11: WEST SKY 1

49
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,356
DEPARTMENT TRANSFER FORM

50
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,027
I know people are criticizing you
and Mr. Choi because of my assault case.

51
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:39,904
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,615
I let my personal feelings
get in the way of work.

53
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,159
As long as you know, it's okay.

54
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,120
I'm used to people talking behind my back.

55
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,830
I don't care about that.

56
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,835
Are you sure
you don't need to be by her side?

57
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,505
Yes.

58
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,465
I think it'll be all right.

59
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,593
That's a relief.

60
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,529
Mr. Lim!

61
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,991
Mr. Lim, are you really leaving?

62
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,159
Yes.

63
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,411
Why? Don't go.

64
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,417
I thought you didn't like me.
I thought you'd be glad.

65
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,794
That's true, but…

66
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,881
who's going to write all those
disciplinary reports if you leave?

67
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,053
I'm leaving because I don't want
to write those reports.

68
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,889
So your mind's really made up?

69
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,557
I'm a man of my word.

70
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:50,933
Goodbye.

71
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,852
Jeez.

72
00:05:58,941 --> 00:05:59,859
Ma'am.

73
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,739
Are you really going to let
Mr. Lim go like that?

74
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,407
That's what he wants.

75
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,784
I don't stop people who try to leave.

76
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,411
Still. You know he's only doing this

77
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,205
because he doesn't want to
cause trouble for the team.

78
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,624
-No.
-No?

79
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,085
I give up. I'm going to tell the Director.

80
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,211
I told you.

81
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,882
Ryung-gu's mother took her own life
after getting gang-raped.

82
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,677
Ryung-gu's mother…

83
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,014
and Ryung-gu too.

84
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,978
The Reaper who escorted
both of them to the afterworld…

85
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,481
was me.

86
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,025
What?

87
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,610
You know I used to work

88
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,489
in the Crimes Unit, right?

89
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,992
Yes, but why would Mr. Lim…

90
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,454
So I'm telling you,
what you heard is true.

91
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,791
I escorted Ryung-gu

92
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,876
because he committed murder.

93
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,378
But…

94
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,467
He's not someone to do that, so why…

95
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,015
Ms. Koo, please tell me.

96
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:17,186
What exactly happened to Mr. Lim?
Why is he hurting so much like that?

97
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,564
There could be something
I could be of help with.

98
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,537
What is it?

99
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,581
Mother.

100
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:40,960
Yeong-sik and Chang-bok
keep making fun of me.

101
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,590
What did they say
that has you crying so sorrowfully?

102
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:49,343
They keep making fun of my name,
saying it's weird.

103
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,722
They said it's like a dog's…

104
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,272
They sure don't know anything at all.

105
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,566
Your name is a wonderful one.

106
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,859
Really?

107
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,068
Of course.

108
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:10,072
A noble monk of great virtue chose it.

109
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,532
Come here.

110
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,539
Ryung as in "high."

111
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,291
And gu as in "to rescue."

112
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,920
It means someone who will
save many from a high place.

113
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,009
You know how to write too, Mother?

114
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:35,348
Not all the letters,
but I know enough to teach my son.

115
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:41,729
Mother, there's so much you know,
and there's nothing you can't do.

116
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,232
Really? Do you really think so?

117
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:45,816
Yes.

118
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,614
Stop lying.

119
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,699
Your name doesn't have a meaning.

120
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,077
Yes, it does! My mother told me.

121
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,247
She said a monk of great virtue
chose it for me.

122
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,915
She even wrote it down and showed me.

123
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,125
Liar.

124
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,920
How would your mother know something
even my father doesn't?

125
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,505
Don't you know
you can't take the National Exam

126
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,798
even if you learn how to read and write?

127
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,591
It's completely useless.

128
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,594
Why? We're all people.

129
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,805
You think a commoner's son
and a nobleman's son are the same?

130
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,431
They are completely different people!

131
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,566
Wait.

132
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,736
Ryung-gu, where are you going?

133
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,904
Are you running away?

134
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,990
Hey, Ryung-gu!

135
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,998
What is this?

136
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,586
Young master.

137
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,302
Ryung-gu?

138
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,225
Why, your face…

139
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:07,773
What happened?

140
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,191
Who did this?

141
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,028
Not again…

142
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,906
Vice Minister Kim's son was passing by,

143
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,409
so I asked him if he could teach me
to read and write.

144
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,703
And I was beaten for it.

145
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,288
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:26,208
I promised you
that I'd never do that again.

147
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,635
Goodness, if only Ryung-gu weren't smart
then he wouldn't want to learn so much.

148
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,929
He started speaking faster than
other kids around his age, right?

149
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,724
Yes, he started talking
around his first birthday.

150
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,686
That's why having a smart kid is a problem
for commoners like us.

151
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,938
They can't become officials
like the noblemen.

152
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,650
Maybe if you were rich.

153
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,194
I heard people buy and sell
government positions these days.

154
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,695
Ma'am.

155
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,030
Please, lower your voice.

156
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:59,283
Come on, it's just the two of us,
who cares?

157
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,495
You're so timid.

158
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,288
Ma'am.

159
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:08,167
Anyway, it's only going to
get harder for you.

160
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,294
I know for a mother
there's nothing as terrible

161
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,754
as clipping her own child's wings.

162
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,590
But it's still something you must do.

163
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,425
To make life easier for him.

164
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,012
Goodness me.

165
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,408
Ryung-gu.

166
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,661
Yes, Mother.

167
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,121
Why do you like writing?

168
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,832
Words immediately disappear
after they are spoken,

169
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:51,585
but if they are written down,
they stay there for a long time.

170
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,380
I think that's fascinating and wonderful.

171
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,473
I will teach you how to read
and write from now on,

172
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,144
so you must never go bothering
the sons of noblemen again.

173
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,271
Really?

174
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,273
Mother, you're the best!

175
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,983
Thank you so much, Mother.

176
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,906
"Ji-gwa-pil-gae, deuk-neung-mak-mang."

177
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,743
When you've learned of a shortcoming,
you must fix it.

178
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,747
When you've learned how,
you must not forget.

179
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,417
"Mang-dam-pi-dan, mi-si-gi-jang."

180
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,128
Do not speak of others' shortcomings

181
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,589
and forget not your own strengths.

182
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:39,758
Mother.

183
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,012
I'm not sure what comes next.

184
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,096
All right.

185
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,348
I will recite the rest,
so repeat after me.

186
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:47,892
Yes.

187
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,110
It's so delicious, Mother.

188
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,614
-Be careful not to get a stomachache.
-Yes.

189
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,242
"Hui-hwi-rang-yo."

190
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,495
"Hui-hwi-rang-yo."

191
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,581
The arrow of time constantly urges on.

192
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,542
"The arrow of time constantly urges on."

193
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,961
The morning sun shines brightly.

194
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,589
"The morning sun shines brightly."

195
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,175
Very good.

196
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,802
Goodness.

197
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,096
My son is so handsome.

198
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,474
How are you so handsome?

199
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,476
Because I take after you, Mother.

200
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,228
-Is that so?
-Yes.

201
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,990
Here's your order. Enjoy.

202
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,246
Ma'am, three gukbaps over here.

203
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,497
Yes.

204
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,465
Those men don't seem to be locals,
but they've been here often lately.

205
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:05,177
You know how the new governor
came a few months ago.

206
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,847
I heard he's backing those thugs.

207
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:09,765
What?

208
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,435
It's what those noblemen officials
do all the time.

209
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,480
Instead of arresting them, they back them.

210
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,734
It's only citizens like us in the middle
who suffer because of it.

211
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:42,923
Who are you?

212
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,634
To think that we'd find the woman
the Governor has been looking for

213
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,678
in a shabby tavern like this.

214
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,390
Whenever he'd drink,
he'd always reminisce about your looks.

215
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,060
Where on earth have you been, sir?

216
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,562
Why didn't you come to us?

217
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:06,822
So…

218
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,450
are you ready today?

219
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,243
It's been three days already.

220
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,913
Ready for what?

221
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,957
You impudent girl.

222
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,419
Who are you to dare make me wait?

223
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:27,134
I'm merely following the Madam's orders
to pour your drinks, sir.

224
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,218
Really?

225
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,013
Is that so?

226
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,065
How uptight you are for a kisaeng.

227
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,652
Although, I suppose
that's what makes it fun.

228
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,153
Why are you doing this?

229
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,529
You are drunk.

230
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,573
I'm not drunk on alcohol,

231
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,117
I'm drunk on you, Geum-hong!

232
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,498
It is well over midnight.

233
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,167
To call a lady over at such a late hour

234
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,420
is not right, even for the Governor.

235
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,464
You're nothing but a lowly prostitute.

236
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,758
I heard you were called Geum-hong

237
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:10,761
in that gibang.

238
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,943
My child is sleeping inside.

239
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,113
I will follow you quietly.
So please, lower your voice.

240
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,671
It's been a while, Geum-hong.

241
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,881
How well you've hidden yourself.

242
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,968
The Madam told me she kicked you out
because you fell ill,

243
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,386
but I knew that wasn't why.

244
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,304
They wouldn't just kick out
a moneymaker like you.

245
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,475
Although, I didn't expect you
to have had a child since then.

246
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,521
Why did you summon me
this late at night, sir?

247
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,316
Ever since you left, I could never sleep
because of my longing for you.

248
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,862
So from today, come to my bed
every night and be my mistress.

249
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:11,905
Sir.

250
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,533
I am no longer a kisaeng.

251
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,370
Has your status as a nobleman's daughter
been restored since then?

252
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,914
I did a background check on you.

253
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,709
You were the daughter
of a ruined scholar-official.

254
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,671
The Madam told me she bought you
from your father herself.

255
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,341
I heard he had gambled away
his entire family fortune.

256
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,644
Father!

257
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:54,156
Does your arrogance come from
the silly pride of a scholar-official?

258
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,910
I shall take my leave, sir.

259
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,370
I heard your son
is unusually smart and talented.

260
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:04,875
But under you, he will never escape
the burden of his low birth.

261
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,839
What are you saying right now?

262
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,549
I'll adopt him as my son.

263
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,552
How is that?

264
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,514
Doesn't that make you
want to be my mistress?

265
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:24,019
"Yeon-si-mae-choe, hui-hwi-rang-yo."

266
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:28,482
The arrow of time constantly urges on.
The morning sun shines brightly.

267
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:32,486
That's why having a smart kid is a problem
for commoners like us.

268
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,613
They can't become officials
like the noblemen.

269
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,157
I'll adopt him as my son.

270
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,910
"Seon-gi-hyeon-al, hoe-baek-hwan-jo."

271
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,747
Mother.

272
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,792
Right, yes.

273
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,377
What does that mean?

274
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,338
Seon-gi-ok-hyeong hangs
as it turns around.

275
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:55,259
At the end of the month, only the outline
of the lightless moon is seen.

276
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,468
And what is seon-gi?

277
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:00,556
It is the first four stars
in the middle of the Big Dipper.

278
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:06,186
In other words, the four stars
which make up the handle of the dipper.

279
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,189
How clever you are.

280
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,983
It's all thanks to you, Mother.

281
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,321
"Ji-gwa-pil-gae, deuk-neung-mak-mang."

282
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:21,118
When you've learned of a shortcoming,
you must fix it.

283
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:25,080
When you've learned how,
you must not forget.

284
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,583
"Mang-dam-pi-dan, mi-si-gi-jang."

285
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,815
Mother.

286
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,861
You're the best.

287
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,072
I admire you, Mother.

288
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,331
I shall protect you, my son.

289
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,505
Is that so?

290
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,800
Is that what you truly think?

291
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,511
I may have been a lowly prostitute once,

292
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,805
but I am no longer one now.

293
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,892
As a woman, and as a mother of a child,

294
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,646
I no longer wish to add
to my own shortcomings.

295
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,818
Well, that's hilarious.

296
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,072
When it comes to a cloth
that has been sullied,

297
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,742
the stain will never go away no matter
how hard you try to wash it out.

298
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,536
You think you're some normal housewife?

299
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,333
I implore upon your generosity
to help me live on

300
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,377
as a mother of a child.

301
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:58,215
Your son will end up
living a life like yours.

302
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,634
No.

303
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,011
Perhaps it will be worse than your own.

304
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,980
If you so much as
touch a hair on my son's head,

305
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,065
I will not let it pass lightly.

306
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,864
Ungrateful wench.

307
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,242
Du-sik, are you there?

308
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:29,830
Yes, sir.

309
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,541
It seems as though that Geum-hong
has forgotten her true self.

310
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,335
Go and be sure to remind her
of her old memories.

311
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:36,837
Yes, sir.

312
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,602
What are you doing?

313
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,730
Your mother is a liar.

314
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,148
My father said so.

315
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,153
-No, she isn't!
-Yes, she is. What did you say to us?

316
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,613
You said your father passed away
before you were born, right?

317
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,198
Yes. What about it?

318
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,160
You idiot, you never had a father.

319
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,121
Because your mother
was a dirty prostitute!

320
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,207
What kind of nonsense are you saying?

321
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,710
Why would men visit your mother
in the middle of the night?

322
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,962
It's all because she's a prostitute.

323
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,964
And that's how she knows how to write.

324
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:24,509
No! My mother said she learned
how to write from my grandfather.

325
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,136
How would a woman learn
to read and write in the first place?

326
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,472
My mother knows a lot of things
but she doesn't know how to read.

327
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,389
Yes.

328
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,016
The whole neighborhood
probably knows by now.

329
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,434
That your mother is a prostitute.

330
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,235
-Hey.
-What are you doing?

331
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,446
-Stop it.
-Let go!

332
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,075
My mother isn't a prostitute!

333
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,036
To call a lady over at such a late hour

334
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,915
is not right, even for the Governor.

335
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,541
You're nothing but a lowly prostitute.

336
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,127
I heard you were called Geum-hong

337
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,212
in that gibang.

338
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,465
My mother isn't a prostitute!

339
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,009
You bastard!

340
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,677
She isn't!

341
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,520
I can't believe he was this small.

342
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,368
Ryung-gu?

343
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,622
Are you back already?

344
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,958
I was just about to fetch you
since it's raining.

345
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,598
That Geum-hong must have fooled around
with quite a few men.

346
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,726
I knew it. I thought I saw her
winking at me at the tavern.

347
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,980
And here she is, acting all coy
in front of the Governor.

348
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,898
At least you got her on her back.

349
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,525
You've got that over the Governor.

350
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,875
Have you been calling men in

351
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,503
every time I was out?

352
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:28,466
Is this why you've been going out at night

353
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,594
these past few days?

354
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:36,308
If I had been born to a noblewoman
instead of you, then I…

355
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,935
I, too, could have been able

356
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:44,191
to go to the schoolhouse
to study how to read and write

357
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,610
without being beaten up
by noblemen's sons!

358
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:50,447
It's not like I asked to be born.

359
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,033
Of all people, having someone like you

360
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,202
as my mother

361
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,662
is humiliating,

362
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,790
shameful,

363
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,459
and disgusting!

364
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,841
I'm sorry.

365
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,431
Why aren't you saying anything?

366
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,351
Why aren't you saying anything,

367
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,520
when I'm being so rude
and talking back to you?

368
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,315
Please, just tell me…

369
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,193
that it isn't true.

370
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,154
Just scold me instead!

371
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,406
For being so disrespectful…

372
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:39,037
and for believing in such ridiculous lies!

373
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,122
Mother!

374
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,377
Hey.

375
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,337
Hey.

376
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,216
Hey.

377
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,345
You.

378
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,813
Can I just have one more puff?

379
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,690
I'm dying here.

380
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:36,071
Do you know how much I've spent here?

381
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:37,906
Please.

382
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,081
Piss off.

383
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,591
Well.

384
00:27:56,674 --> 00:28:00,387
Ever since you came here,
all those nuisances have disappeared.

385
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,223
I knew you'd be good at this
the moment I saw you.

386
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,142
How is it that those people
live on drugs like that?

387
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,396
Why do you think?

388
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,731
It's probably because they want
to forget reality.

389
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:17,237
Should there ever come a day
when your life seems ruined, even then,

390
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,739
do anything but that stuff.

391
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,952
Once you partake in it,
there's no going back.

392
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,996
You might be alive,
but you'll be dead inside.

393
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,624
So it'd be better to just die.

394
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,003
Something like that won't ever happen.

395
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,260
Stop.

396
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,098
Ryung-gu.

397
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,600
Come to my room tomorrow.

398
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,644
I'll treat you to a drink.

399
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,312
What do you think?

400
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,313
No.

401
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,190
I don't run tabs.

402
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,651
Come on, I don't have the money!

403
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,902
But I'll get it tomorrow.

404
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,113
Day in and day out,
you sell your body at the gibang

405
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,406
and spend it all on drugs.

406
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,742
Is that what all you prostitutes are like?

407
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,655
Who is it?

408
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,408
Ryung-gu?

409
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,372
It is you, Ryung-gu.

410
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,376
Goodness, how many years has it been?

411
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,670
You acted like you would never return.

412
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,589
What brought you back here?

413
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,383
It's not because of that woman.

414
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,093
That woman?

415
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:09,182
You of all people
shouldn't say such things.

416
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:12,352
I stopped considering that woman my mother
when she killed herself

417
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,854
after she was caught
doing such things by her son.

418
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:15,939
You take that back!

419
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,484
After all she did to raise you!

420
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,615
Goodbye.

421
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:28,785
Goodness. If only those bastards
didn't do that terrible thing,

422
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,162
then both you and Yu-hwa…

423
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,547
What terrible thing?

424
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,757
Don't tell me

425
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,676
you didn't know?

426
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:59,190
You really didn't know your mother at all.

427
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,946
The Governor, he got the thugs to…

428
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,435
Hey.

429
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:22,690
Good!

430
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,326
Who dares?

431
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,383
Who are you?

432
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,593
I asked, who are you?

433
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,470
Tell me who you are!

434
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:57,809
I am the son

435
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,311
of a prostitute.

436
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,604
What?

437
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,150
You're nothing but a lowly prostitute.

438
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,487
Yes.

439
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,198
I think I'm starting to remember

440
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:13,992
who you are.

441
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,494
Go and join your mother.

442
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,261
I am…

443
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,848
going to join you,

444
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,602
Mother.

445
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,306
What are you doing just sitting there?

446
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,892
Get on your feet right now.

447
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,313
Who are you?

448
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,648
I am the Reaper of Souls
who has come to get you.

449
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,276
Follow me.

450
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,391
Enough with the sniffles!

451
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,310
What?

452
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:13,064
All that sniffling
is getting on my nerves.

453
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,276
It's itchy from all the drugs.

454
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,071
Then put something in your nose
or pick at it.

455
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,156
As long as I don't have to see it.

456
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,617
I see.

457
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,627
Ma'am.

458
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,878
What do you wish to know?

459
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:37,964
If I go to the afterworld,

460
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,634
is it possible to see my mother?

461
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:43,636
I don't know.

462
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,014
I don't know who my father was,

463
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,268
but all the memories of my childhood

464
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,562
were full of my mother's love.

465
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,900
She truly loved a bastard like me.

466
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,112
Your mother's name…

467
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,701
It was Yu-hwa, and her last name was Lim.

468
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,753
Lim Yu-hwa.

469
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,466
I escorted her to the afterworld as well.

470
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,430
I escort those like you,
who have committed crimes.

471
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:31,517
She, too, had sinned.

472
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,979
She had committed a special sin.

473
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:37,898
What…

474
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,277
The sin of taking one's own life.

475
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,116
She said

476
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,952
she hadn't always loved you

477
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,079
from the beginning.

478
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,088
Madam.

479
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,262
All she thought of was how to abandon you.

480
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,974
She said that after giving birth

481
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,727
she didn't even nurse you,

482
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,979
and ignored you for days on end.

483
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:23,319
But she said when she saw you
reach out your hand

484
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,780
even to a mother like that,

485
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:28,908
amazingly…

486
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,119
she began to feel love.

487
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,004
She said she couldn't be
like her own father

488
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,298
who had sold his own daughter to a gibang,

489
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:48,344
driven mad by the hardships of the world.

490
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,686
She said she vowed to
never abandon you no matter what

491
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,897
because she knew

492
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:05,361
you did not ask to be born
into this world.

493
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,414
Goodness.

494
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,124
Look at my big boy.

495
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,127
When did you get to be this grown-up?

496
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,017
Hearing you say
all the memories of your childhood

497
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,728
were filled with your mother's love.

498
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,773
It's a pity that she left…

499
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,901
without ever knowing that.

500
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,910
Why would you give up being reincarnated
and choose to become a Reaper of Souls?

501
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:39,663
You'll have to exist for a very long time
as someone neither alive

502
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,125
nor dead.

503
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:47,254
-If you chose this lightly…
-No.

504
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,341
I heard the threads of fate
that linked me to her broke

505
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:54,094
when my mother took her own life.

506
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,890
We will never be together again,
no matter how many times we are reborn.

507
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,392
That's why I wanted to become a Reaper.

508
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:04,396
My mother will be reincarnated too
once she has paid for her sins.

509
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,649
Yes.

510
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,985
When that happens, because I'll have
all the memories of my past,

511
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,948
at least, I can watch her from afar.

512
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,037
To which team
were you thinking of applying?

513
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,414
I…

514
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,292
I would like to work under you, ma'am.

515
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:33,050
The Escort Team is the closest
to life and death.

516
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,718
One needs a great strength of mind

517
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,762
to last there.

518
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,932
Apply to the Book of the Deceased
Management Team.

519
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,393
If you're lucky,

520
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:46,939
you could get information
on your mother's reincarnation there.

521
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:50,818
Yes, ma'am.

522
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,951
The Land of the Living
is already such a mess,

523
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:00,995
and now, the afterworld is too?

524
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,664
What has the world come to?

525
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,710
Even if she is the Jade Emperor,

526
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,962
how could she let someone from Hell
be a Reaper?

527
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,214
The class system
is thousands of years old,

528
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,050
and now, a lowly commoner
like that is joining the ranks!

529
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:18,178
Why? Are you scared
just thinking about getting outdone

530
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,430
by a commoner?

531
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:20,347
What?

532
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,640
How arrogant you are!

533
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,934
I've heard the rumors about you.

534
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,936
Shall we see just how good you are?

535
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,355
I'm here after sending four
to the afterworld,

536
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,399
and I still remember it clearly.

537
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:31,525
They were thugs, right?

538
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,738
-Yes.
-They made such a scene then.

539
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:39,617
So we gave them a taste of Hell
as we escorted them.

540
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,666
Who would follow a lowly commoner
like you to the afterworld?

541
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,709
How could they trust you?

542
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,632
Isn't that right, sir?

543
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,761
In the world, there were such things
as classes that kept people from mixing.

544
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,304
However, that is of the past.

545
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:03,766
The world is changing and so is Jumadeung.

546
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:04,725
But…

547
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,478
If you have a problem with that,
go take it up with the Jade Emperor,

548
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,229
who abolished the class system herself.

549
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,817
I, for one, am satisfied
with my subordinate's abilities.

550
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,085
The Jade Emperor's quarters are this way.

551
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,395
YEAR 2021

552
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,361
Did you hear?

553
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:00,197
There's going to be a new team,
The Risk Management Team or whatever.

554
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,199
Yes, I heard they'll rescue people
who try to kill themselves.

555
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,868
They say they're looking for people
to join the team.

556
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,704
How do you save someone
who's already decided to die?

557
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:08,831
That's what I'm saying.

558
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:12,709
At this rate, there will just be
the Team Manager on that Team.

559
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,461
Who's managing the team?

560
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,755
The manager of the Criminal Souls
Escort Team, Koo Ryeon.

561
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,182
Mr. Lim.

562
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,977
Aren't you getting off?
This is the Book Management Team.

563
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,562
Right.

564
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,676
So it's finally been created.

565
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,721
I guess you heard the news.

566
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,807
The team that prevents the deaths

567
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,601
of people at risk
of taking their own lives.

568
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,103
Yes. The Risk Management Team.

569
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,107
I heard that my mother
is in the Land of the Living

570
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,066
after being reincarnated.

571
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:20,068
I hate to admit it

572
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,947
but I heard that souls
retain faint memories of their past lives.

573
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,158
So those who took their lives once
have a higher likelihood

574
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:27,326
of doing the same thing

575
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,913
in their next life and the one after that.

576
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,083
I'd like to join this team.

577
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:39,796
So that if my mother should ever make
that same decision,

578
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:44,301
I will save her
with my own hands this time.

579
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,353
So that's why he only works eight hours.

580
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,898
He was looking for his mother.

581
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,246
But isn't it too cruel

582
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,541
that someone who took their own life once

583
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:18,293
could do so again in their next life?

584
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,003
It happens very rarely.

585
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,381
Most of them

586
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,384
fare well in their new lives.

587
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,428
What about people who had no other choice?
What did they do wrong?

588
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,181
Isn't it enough to be punished
by having their ties cut from everyone?

589
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,893
No, this isn't
Jumadeung's punishment for suicide.

590
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,020
Then what?

591
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:40,274
Even if it isn't suicide,

592
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,401
if someone has lived

593
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,612
with immense pain over their life

594
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:50,450
even after reincarnation
they're unable to escape its clutches.

595
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,660
Mom.

596
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,420
Mom.

597
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:15,851
Don't look.

598
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,811
It will remain in your heart.

599
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,062
Who are you?

600
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,481
I want to see my mom.

601
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,281
Pain that remains in your heart

602
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,784
will be etched in your soul
and affect your next life too.

603
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:34,620
So…

604
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:40,876
Go follow them.

605
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,423
-Let's go.
-But I want to see her.

606
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,218
Can't I see her just one more time?

607
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,178
No.

608
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,055
Don't look back.

609
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,113
Lee Ha-eun.

610
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:13,492
Born 1:10 a.m, May 24th, 2017.

611
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,286
This life has been collected.

612
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,636
The scars cut too deep,

613
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,888
and so, it affects

614
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,516
the next life as well.

615
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,020
So if that wound doesn't fully heal…

616
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,605
I mean, if…

617
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,066
What if something bad happens

618
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:49,444
to Mr. Lim's mother again this time?

619
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,654
What happens then?

620
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,159
She will have to continue living

621
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:58,954
with those scars.

622
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,800
Yu-hwa, your stomach's so big now.

623
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:14,636
Why don't you tell the manager you want to
take some time off and get some rest?

624
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,013
I'm working because I want to work.

625
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,017
I need to earn a lot
for all my Honeybee's baby formula.

626
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:26,148
And I want to fill my sales quota
before I go on maternity leave.

627
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,482
I see.

628
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,567
Excuse me.

629
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,026
Excuse me for one second.

630
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,989
Yes, sir, what can I get you?

631
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:38,493
Give me everything

632
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:42,164
from here to there.

633
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:43,915
Pardon?

634
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,881
LIM RYUNG-GU

635
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,763
Your name's so unique and pretty.

636
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,266
Mother.

637
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:05,270
They keep making fun of my name,
saying it's weird.

638
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:14,112
They sure don't know anything at all.

639
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,615
Your name is a wonderful one.

640
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:21,828
Sir.

641
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,391
Don't we need a farewell party
or something?

642
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:45,727
What for? He's not going far.

643
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,103
Jeez, that's cold.

644
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,396
You'll be the same
when I leave too, right?

645
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,066
What are you talking about?
We'll have a party to celebrate that day.

646
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:51,983
Never mind.

647
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,694
Mr. Lim, let's go have
fried chicken and beer.

648
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,364
I don't eat with people
from work unless it's beef.

649
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,491
That's a lot to ask
from someone who's still unemployed.

650
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,326
Fine, beef it is!

651
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,578
Where to? Let's go.

652
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,455
You're buying, yes?

653
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,749
-You'll come too, right?
-You two go ahead first.

654
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,501
-I've got some work to finish.
-Okay.

655
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:21,888
It's a good thing
I'm transferring to another team.

656
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,974
Never thought you'd be buying me beef.

657
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:27,769
Wait.

658
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,939
I heard there's no such thing
as free beef,

659
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:35,527
that goodwill extends only so far as pork.

660
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:39,114
-Fine, then, I'm not buying.
-No.

661
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:41,283
I know your intentions are pure,
despite the way you look.

662
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,703
Despite the way I look?

663
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,748
No, I meant
"without having to take a look."

664
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,211
The power that comes with buying beef.

665
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,213
Okay, let's go have beef!

666
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,517
I'm hungry, what should we eat later?

667
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,116
Never mind the beef.

668
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,494
Let's go for a drink instead.

669
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,254
That woman we just saw.

670
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:20,799
She's your mother, right?

671
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:24,094
You just had this look.

672
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,015
I guess you're not completely clueless.

673
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,893
I heard about your mother from Ms. Koo.

674
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:37,190
I badgered her into telling me,
so don't blame her.

675
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,487
I wish you wouldn't blame yourself.

676
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:44,614
It looks like

677
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,992
she has a good life now.

678
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,793
From the moment I became a Reaper,

679
00:54:58,336 --> 00:54:59,754
I wondered every day.

680
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,174
If my mother were reincarnated,

681
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,177
would she have a good life?

682
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:08,847
Yes.

683
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,433
My mother would be living a good life.

684
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:17,397
If I should ever meet her again later,
what should I do?

685
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:24,070
But I couldn't do anything.

686
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:26,740
Still…

687
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,244
You could at least go see her.

688
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,792
She died because of me.

689
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,048
My mother.

690
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:48,970
I killed her.

691
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,264
If I had been born to a noblewoman

692
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:53,725
instead of you, then I…

693
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,311
I, too, could have been able

694
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:01,066
to go to the schoolhouse
to study how to read and write

695
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:04,027
without being beaten up
by noblemen's sons!

696
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,656
I'm sorry.

697
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,036
Of all people, having someone like you

698
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:15,246
as my mother,

699
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:17,540
is humiliating,

700
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,710
shameful,

701
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,754
and disgusting!

702
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:30,864
Mother.

703
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,200
I'm so sorry.

704
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,654
ONE MONTH LATER

705
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:18,745
LIM YU-HWA, AGE 30
SALES ASSOCIATE

706
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,236
Shouldn't we tell him?

707
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,654
That is not Mr. Lim's mother.

708
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:55,782
She just has the same face and name,
but they're different people.

709
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:58,618
I think it's been less than a month
since she's lost the baby.

710
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,411
Don't worry, Honeybee.
Mommy will protect you.

711
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,829
Get it together, Lim Yu-hwa.

712
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:04,874
How long are you going to stay here,
cuddling your fake baby?

713
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,627
Is this really all a dream?

714
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,711
I'm sorry.

715
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:10,964
Mommy is so sorry.

716
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,549
Mr. Lim.

717
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,092
Your mother, she…

718
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,218
Please…

719
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:16,135
Live.

720
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:19,931
