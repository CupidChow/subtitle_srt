1
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:43,752
You will work at the Escort Team
until the time comes.

2
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,672
When will that be?

3
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,257
A long time from now.

4
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,342
In the very distant future.

5
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:53,803
In the Land of the Living,

6
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:59,350
there will be many more people who
are crushed by the weight of their lives.

7
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:04,439
There will be more people trying to
take their own lives, just as you did.

8
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,733
So you must wait.

9
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:11,404
Then you will meet the one
whose life you truly must save.

10
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,283
It will not be easy, of course.

11
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,329
Because you will have to live
an endless today.

12
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,915
I shall ask you once more.

13
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:26,336
Are you sure you will not regret
this choice you are making?

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,754
Yes.

15
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,673
-I have no regrets.
-Is that so?

16
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:32,967
I'm curious…

17
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:39,057
as to how this shall end.

18
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:45,271
Your new superior officer
has experienced much pain, as you have.

19
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:49,609
His all-too-upright character
can sometimes feel suffocating,

20
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:53,029
but I believe he shall be
a good leader of the Escort Team.

21
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,406
Will you serve him faithfully?

22
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,200
Yes.

23
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,507
He is not the man you know.

24
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:19,514
He may look the same,
but he has been reincarnated twice since.

25
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:24,102
Your suicide caused him much suffering.

26
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,939
The wound engraved deep within his soul

27
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,317
has yet to heal
despite his reincarnations.

28
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:36,364
It is difficult to say you are free
from blame in this matter.

29
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,083
This is the one
I've spoken to you about before.

30
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,961
Make good use of her at the Escort Team.

31
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,546
Yes, ma'am.

32
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:00,179
The Escort Team is the closest
to life and death.

33
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,557
One needs a great strength of mind
to last here.

34
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,392
Do you think you can do it?

35
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,812
I will do anything.

36
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,939
If you give me the chance.

37
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,983
A chance, you say?

38
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,653
Chances are only given
to those who qualify.

39
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,906
Is it because I'm from Hell?

40
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,994
Reapers must beat out thousands
of candidates to get into Jumadeung.

41
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,829
What have you competed against?

42
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,543
I will do anything.

43
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,005
Then, from now on,

44
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,716
apprehend and escort criminals.

45
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,968
They have committed great sins

46
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,762
on the Land of the Living
and are destined for Hell.

47
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,598
Like attracts like, does it not?

48
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,184
As someone who has been to Hell,

49
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,186
you should know them better than anyone.

50
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,689
What do you say?
Will you take even this chance?

51
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,317
I will do it.

52
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,593
FINALE: THREADS OF FATE

53
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,766
It's been almost half a year already.

54
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,604
Time just seems to fly away.

55
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,025
This might be difficult to hear,

56
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:42,323
but no one would blame you
if you gave up on your son now.

57
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,744
You must never say that, Doctor!

58
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,831
My Jun-woong…

59
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,501
will come back. For sure.

60
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,141
Do you think humans these days
will stand back and do nothing?

61
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:13,354
Even Jumadeung employees avoid getting
caught on security cameras.

62
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,483
Should our existence be known to humans…

63
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,737
Jumadeung's very existence
will be threatened.

64
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,034
What I would like to know is
why Koo Ryeon was left to her own devices

65
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,119
until things got to this point.

66
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,706
We have been against
the whole thing from the start,

67
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,625
ever since the creation of
the Risk Management Team.

68
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,587
Isn't this all because Jumadeung
has become lax?

69
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,090
Do you know what Jumadeung needs?

70
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,093
A younger, newer, stronger leadership.

71
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,928
-Of course, you're right.
-It does.

72
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:46,929
Right, exactly.

73
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,390
Mr. Ha.

74
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,518
What are you planning to do
about Koo Ryeon?

75
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,438
Simple. I will take her back to
where she came from.

76
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,107
Where?

77
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,109
Hell.

78
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,072
It's even written in the Company Code.

79
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,616
"A Reaper who threatens
the existence of Jumadeung

80
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,701
will be divested of their position."

81
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,953
"They will be summoned to Hell."

82
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,664
"They shall lose their chance

83
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,417
of reincarnation as well."

84
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,255
But why isn't Park Jung-gil here already?

85
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,132
Where is he?

86
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,679
Thank you for working with
Koo Ryeon until now.

87
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,433
Ma'am, can't you help Ms. Koo?

88
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,186
She's worked harder than anyone…

89
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,651
Ryeon has let me down
when I've given her all that trust.

90
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,071
I've arranged your transfers.

91
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,448
Mr. Lim will go to the Sales Team.

92
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,617
Mr. Choi will go to the Editing Team.

93
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,287
What about Ms. Koo?

94
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,959
Mr. Ha will go and arrest her.

95
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,046
Understood, ma'am.

96
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,426
Let's go.

97
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:15,435
-I don't want to go to the Editing Team.
-Did you forget our deal, Mr. Choi?

98
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,896
You can lie in a coma
for three years like now,

99
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,191
or you can work at Jumadeung
and wake up in six months.

100
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,445
-What?
-That job you've always wanted…

101
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,530
Try it here. How's that?

102
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,449
Here?

103
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,576
After you wake up,
you'll receive benefits,

104
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,995
like an automatic pass
into any company you want

105
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,830
or passing an important test.

106
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,457
Your time here is almost over.

107
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,127
Why not quietly work at the Editing Team
and then go see your mother?

108
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:55,183
Isn't that what you truly wanted,
Mr. Choi?

109
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,179
Why were you there?

110
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,349
No. Why was I there?

111
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,809
Where?

112
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:41,896
In my nightmares.

113
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,698
What if the dream's a nightmare?

114
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,076
That's why it's better not to go
into dreams if possible.

115
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,911
Because you might find things

116
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,663
about that person's past life
or the one before that.

117
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,221
Hello, sir!

118
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,848
This is Mr. Choi Jun-woong,
the one I told you about.

119
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,769
I see. Nice to meet you.

120
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,355
What brings you here at this busy hour?

121
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,607
You've adapted very quickly.

122
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,734
Because I've worked here before.

123
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,655
I found a way.

124
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,533
There's someone who can help us.

125
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,869
I don't want to hear it.

126
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:41,330
Why?

127
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,041
Because I know it will be
something stupid or dangerous.

128
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,670
Are you really going to be like this?

129
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,839
How could you be so cold-hearted?

130
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,220
Mr. Kwon.

131
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,056
-Yes, sir?
-Step out for a moment.

132
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,976
All right, sir.

133
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,696
Who is it?

134
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,948
The person who can help us.

135
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,913
You might think this is ridiculous, but…

136
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:23,831
Let's hear it.

137
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,250
What that ridiculous thing is.

138
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,466
How much longer do you plan on
violating the rules of Jumadeung?

139
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,343
This is my job.

140
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,552
Just let that one die.

141
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,887
Stop it!

142
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,847
How could you?

143
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,767
How could you
say something like that to her?

144
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,688
I will never just let her die.

145
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:06,791
What is it?

146
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,253
Please, help.

147
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:12,963
Me?

148
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,049
Why should I help you?

149
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,634
No.

150
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,220
Ms. Koo.

151
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,894
Why should I help Koo Ryeon?

152
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,271
You know everything that's going on.

153
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,981
It's all according to the rules.

154
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,859
But…

155
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,444
Please, help.

156
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,570
Koo Ryeon deceived me.

157
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:42,034
No, it's my own fault for letting
a criminal like that by my side.

158
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,412
A criminal?

159
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:47,665
You…

160
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,793
You really are a bastard!

161
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,130
Who's fault is it that
Ms. Koo's in this situation?

162
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,759
What did you say?

163
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:02,805
You…

164
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,432
really are a bastard!

165
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,021
Do you know why Ms. Koo is in your dreams?

166
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:12,815
What?

167
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,319
Do you know why you've come to hate
people who take their own lives?

168
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,197
You don't know what I'm talking about.

169
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,409
Go inside the nightmare you always have
and see for yourself.

170
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,708
What do you know about this?

171
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,334
Everything.

172
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,881
So go and see it for yourself.

173
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,966
That nightmare.

174
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,518
What brings you here, sir?

175
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,061
I have a dream I need to take a look at.

176
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,272
Did you bring the approval slip?

177
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,226
My name is Koo Ryeon.

178
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,105
I love you.

179
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,527
I'm sorry I am so late.

180
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,532
It would have been better
if I had never returned.

181
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,075
I had no idea

182
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,661
that they were…

183
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,665
Will Mr. Park help us?

184
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,335
The threads of fate between those two
have been broken.

185
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,880
Because Ms. Koo took her own life.

186
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,424
But…

187
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,885
the feelings still probably remain.

188
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,231
Long time no see, Ms. Koo.

189
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,817
How long has it been? 60 years?

190
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,652
Exactly 58 years and 4 months.

191
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,571
I see you haven't changed.

192
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,784
Anyway, when do you think

193
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,245
that special department
the Director talked about will be made?

194
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,747
I'm still waiting for it too.

195
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,590
How long have you been
using that shade for?

196
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,134
For a very long time.

197
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,768
Now I understand…

198
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,647
That look she had on her face that day.

199
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,579
But why are we here?

200
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,706
Take a look at this.

201
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,542
That building was in the background
of all his videos.

202
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,879
So I searched the name of the building
and found it on a map.

203
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,006
This is where he is.

204
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,345
And what makes you think Ms. Koo
will come here?

205
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,222
The jerk keeps provoking Ms. Koo.

206
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,557
Jeez, what a coward.

207
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,144
Showing up out of nowhere and hitting
me in the back of the head?

208
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,813
You're Ryu Cho-hui's stan, aren't you?

209
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:24,316
Or are you a hired gun
sent by Ryu Cho-hui?

210
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,986
You think you can scare me?

211
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,405
Man up and fight me face-to-face!

212
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:30,864
Come on, get in here.

213
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,743
Get in here!

214
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,079
What, are you scared…

215
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,539
What? What is it?

216
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,625
Hey, turn on the lights!
What the hell is the producer doing?

217
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,252
We're live!

218
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,420
What the hell?

219
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,387
Ma'am!

220
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,764
Ma'am.

221
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:56,890
Please, stop.

222
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:11,864
Ma'am…

223
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,141
You guys go back.

224
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,770
You have to stop, ma'am.

225
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,148
There's no need to forgive
bastards like them.

226
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,275
They'll only get worse.

227
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,737
Then there will be even more victims.

228
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,363
The situation is serious.

229
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,325
Mr. Ha says he'll arrest you
and take you to Hell--

230
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,827
It doesn't matter.
That's where I came from, anyway.

231
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,162
Ma'am!

232
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,458
-Don't come any closer.
-No.

233
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,502
-I said, don't come near me!
-No!

234
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,420
Choi Jun-woong.

235
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,464
I don't want to go to the Editing Team.

236
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,467
I want to stay here
at the Risk Management Team

237
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,302
with you and Mr. Lim until the end.

238
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,597
You won't stop meddling to the end.

239
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,558
That's over too.

240
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,271
You're the one who said it.

241
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,524
But we still…

242
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,693
have to save him.

243
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,904
That's what the RM Team does.

244
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,490
We have to save people no matter what.

245
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,076
That's what the Risk Management Team does!

246
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,458
Ms. Ryu.

247
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,585
We need to save her.

248
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,297
We haven't failed yet.

249
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,509
Ms. Ryu,

250
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,427
she's getting better.

251
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,931
She's important to you.

252
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,350
She's your only friend.

253
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,603
This is the way to save her.

254
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,524
No.

255
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,402
No, you're wrong.

256
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,033
You know you saved them all!

257
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,911
There's no salvation
unless you save yourself.

258
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,413
As you live,

259
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,167
there will come a moment
when you realize it was all for today.

260
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,085
So…

261
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,545
live.

262
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,006
-Please, let go of me!
-Woo-jin.

263
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,425
Save him.

264
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,928
All the people you saved,

265
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,389
they're living good lives.

266
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,393
So why are you so unhappy?

267
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,855
If you don't feel happy yourself,

268
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,483
what's the point of saving others?

269
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,039
Let's go back, ma'am.

270
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,918
Mr. Choi is right.

271
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,468
Is this a team get-together?

272
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,803
Aren't you all very chatty?

273
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,932
Koo Ryeon, it's been a long time.

274
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,142
You haven't forgotten me, have you?

275
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,647
How could I forget?

276
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,275
Good. Shall we go back
to where we were together, then?

277
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,236
To the place where you belong.

278
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,113
I'll go there on my own
when my work is done.

279
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,823
No.

280
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,659
You don't have a choice in this.

281
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:47,621
I'm going to take you to Hell,
make you suffer a bit while I'm at it,

282
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:50,332
and make it so you never return
to the Land of the Living.

283
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,043
Well?

284
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,963
Leave the grunt work to me, Mr. Ha.

285
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,047
Park Jung-gil?

286
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,840
I've seen neither hide
nor hair of you all this time.

287
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,050
What are you doing here?

288
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,220
Koo Ryeon used to work under me.

289
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,346
So?

290
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,517
It's my fault for not teaching her well.
I'll be the one to handle her.

291
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,270
What trick are you trying to pull on me?

292
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:15,148
I guess I was wrong in thinking
you were the only useful one in Jumadeung.

293
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:21,113
I'm sorry, but I'm only saying there's
no need for you to trouble yourself.

294
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,197
What did you say?

295
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,786
Jumadeung will take care of
its own problems.

296
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,624
Are you overcome with affection
for your subordinate?

297
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:36,378
What, are you expecting me
to be touched by this and cry?

298
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,508
Hurry and save that girl.

299
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,418
Ma'am.

300
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,796
What are you doing? Go, now!

301
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,136
What are you doing?

302
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,138
Get to work.

303
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,647
Choi Jun-woong.

304
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,150
Yes, ma'am.

305
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:43,695
Did the Director tell you about my past?

306
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,073
Yes. She did.

307
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,283
What about Mr. Park?

308
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,413
He…

309
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,374
He came of his own will.

310
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,213
Park Jung-gil.

311
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:51,847
Get out of my way.

312
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,362
I can't let you pass.

313
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,760
Get out of my way.

314
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,178
No!

315
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,561
They're saying that if I'm going to die,
I should die quietly.

316
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,939
So that's what I'm going to do.

317
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,733
Try to remember
what your dream was in the beginning.

318
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:31,279
Try and remember
why you wanted to become a singer.

319
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,075
It doesn't matter now.

320
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,078
You're not the one who deserves to die!

321
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:39,788
So why should you die?

322
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,593
Who are you? What on earth are you?

323
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:55,804
A Grim Reaper.

324
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,230
If you're really a Grim Reaper,

325
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,857
please just take me with you.

326
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,152
I'm tired of just trying to get
through every day.

327
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,115
My life is disgusting and sickening!

328
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,412
Why shouldn't I die?

329
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,872
That's not true.

330
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,834
It isn't like what they carelessly say.

331
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,253
Your life has never once been

332
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,672
disgusting or sickening.

333
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:38,555
You…

334
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,807
You don't deserve

335
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,934
this pain

336
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,103
or these lies.

337
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,731
I promise…

338
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,401
I'll protect you.

339
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,504
Ma'am…

340
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,217
Stay as you are, my lady.

341
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,053
I will…

342
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,013
protect you.

343
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,062
I won't stand by

344
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,815
and let people cast stones at you anymore.

345
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,361
I'll show the world

346
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,030
what the truth is

347
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,158
and what the lies are.

348
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,422
Choi Jun-woong.

349
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,174
You stay by Cho-hui's side.

350
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,889
-But last time, I was on my own and--
-Don't worry.

351
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,308
That won't happen this time.

352
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,143
Really?

353
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,728
Yes.

354
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,355
I promise.

355
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:13,650
Okay.

356
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,122
Why are you having Mr. Choi stay?

357
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,083
I thought you and Ms. Ryu were…

358
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,626
The fate linking Cho-hui and me

359
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,504
already ended in our previous life.

360
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:40,343
I thought she was happy and well
on the Land of the Living…

361
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,683
When I heard about
what happened to Cho-hui,

362
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:50,019
all those feelings
I had forgotten about exploded.

363
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,938
How did she get in? Get out--

364
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,617
I understand.

365
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,245
I've been there too.

366
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,254
Still, why did you leave Ms. Ryu with…

367
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,465
Because I saw it.

368
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,592
Could you hold her up?

369
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:26,556
Not that I know what will happen
between the two of them in the future.

370
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,312
Round up the cyberbullies
and bring them to the White Room.

371
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,271
The White Room?

372
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,481
Right.

373
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,566
Okay.

374
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:39,986
Mr. Lim.

375
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,946
Yes, ma'am.

376
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,616
I've put you through a lot, haven't I?

377
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,205
Ma'am.

378
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,956
You know how they say
when people suddenly change,

379
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,082
it means they're going to die?

380
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,834
Not that we can die, but…

381
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:56,753
Just go.

382
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,546
Right.

383
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:23,863
I'm sorry.

384
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,742
I'll accept whatever punishment
you give me.

385
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,578
If I have to give up my position
as a team manager, I will.

386
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,664
If you tell me to go to Hell,

387
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,290
I will.

388
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,751
There's no need.

389
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,381
Jung-gil has shouldered
the blame for everything.

390
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,385
What do you mean?

391
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,013
Ma'am, did you…

392
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,892
I only offered a bit of help
to Jung-gil's decision.

393
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,815
I told you, I'm nothing more
than a mere bystander.

394
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,150
Whether it's a Reaper or a human,

395
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:06,781
all decisions are made
by the one involved.

396
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,786
Park Jung-gil.

397
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,914
You shouldn't have done that.

398
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,459
Why did you do it?

399
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,211
Why?

400
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,509
Why did you let Koo Ryeon escape?

401
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,139
I did no such thing.

402
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,186
Oh, Director. You're here.

403
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,774
This fool, Park Jung-gil,
helped Koo Ryeon escape.

404
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,193
And beat all my guys to a pulp.

405
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:45,612
There's no way.

406
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,780
No. He really did.

407
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,699
You said Park Jung-gil saved Ryeon?

408
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:54,120
Mr. Park despises Ryeon
and the Risk Management Team.

409
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,249
What do you all think?

410
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,585
I don't know, I can't believe it.

411
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,878
It's like you said, ma'am.

412
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,881
Mr. Park practically cursed
the Risk Management Team.

413
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,716
What?

414
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,219
I mean, he always hated
the RM Team, right?

415
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,139
Right. It's true, Mr. Ha.

416
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:17,310
This is an undeniable fact.
Yes, of course.

417
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,478
Hey!

418
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:22,774
Mr. Park.

419
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:27,487
You used the Reaper's Guarantee
of Responsibility you had with Ryeon.

420
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,240
To destroy the RM Team?

421
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,371
Yes. I did.

422
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,415
Ryeon's retaliation
against the cyberbullies,

423
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,250
was that a part of it too?

424
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,720
-Yes.
-Park Jung-gil!

425
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:56,933
What's all this about?

426
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,478
I used the Reaper's Guarantee
of Responsibility…

427
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,399
to try to destroy the RM Team.

428
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,317
Of course.

429
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,778
There's no way Mr. Park would have tried
to save Koo Ryeon.

430
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,154
I get it now.

431
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,365
All of you, shut up.

432
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,034
Okay.

433
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,161
Then why

434
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:21,207
did Park Jung-gil let Koo Ryeon escape?

435
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,130
I told you, I never did that.

436
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:33,469
I was just trying to take her myself
so as not to trouble you, Mr. Ha.

437
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,306
And that must be how the fight started.

438
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,308
What?

439
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,027
I acted rashly, ma'am.

440
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,570
Park Jung-gil.

441
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,406
You disobeyed a superior officer
and caused trouble,

442
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,741
which cannot be overlooked.

443
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:58,453
You will spend a month alone
in your current state

444
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,664
and be demoted to a mere employee
for six months.

445
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,832
Do you accept your punishment?

446
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,544
Yes.

447
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,629
I accept.

448
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,508
Go back now, Ha Dae-su.

449
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,385
Ma'am.

450
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,890
That's it for me.

451
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,434
Wait, ma'am.

452
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,019
Ma'am…

453
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,104
Ma'am!

454
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,988
A FEW WEEKS LATER

455
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,157
How do you become a Grim Reaper?

456
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,786
-I'm actually a half-and-half.
-Half-and-half?

457
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,580
I'm not dead or alive.

458
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:45,374
I'm in a coma,
so my real body is in a hospital.

459
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:49,045
So I signed a contract with Jumadeung
as a Reaper until I wake up.

460
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,089
Oh, I see.

461
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,135
Were you always good at cooking?

462
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:02,058
I do have a cooking certificate, but…

463
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,309
This tastes so bad.

464
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,395
It's so terrible it's making me cry.

465
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,983
I got it just to put it on my resume.

466
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,528
But they say what's important
is that you make it with love, right?

467
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,405
I made it with a lot of love.

468
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,657
Try it.

469
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,622
No, don't eat it!

470
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:31,754
It's good.

471
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,297
It's good?

472
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,091
She says it's good.

473
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,300
Do you want to try it?

474
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,316
It's actually okay.

475
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,490
Come on, hurry up
and set the table already.

476
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,577
Come on! Get to it!

477
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,746
Okay, here you go.

478
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:10,084
Now that I think about it, have we
ever had a meal together as a team?

479
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,878
We had that drink one time outside.

480
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:15,882
So we drank but never ate together.
That is a bit weird.

481
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,099
This is actually good.

482
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,521
I'll give it a try.

483
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:34,150
Sitting at a table and eating together
like this is joy too…

484
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,324
So why have I lived,
always giving up on these things?

485
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,951
Stop blaming yourself.

486
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,537
You need to be reverent before food.

487
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,332
Ms. Jeong said that.

488
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,626
You need to be reverent before food.

489
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,046
Such wise words.

490
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,465
Well, then, let's eat.

491
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,759
-Make sure to eat a lot.
-Let's eat.

492
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,344
I'll…

493
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,679
Eat up.

494
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,805
I knew it.

495
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,646
Do you want to become
a full-time employee?

496
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,949
Your fans in the afterworld
prepared this for you.

497
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,493
The material you need to sue
Seol In-u and Park Song-i.

498
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,953
I have fans in the afterworld?

499
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:27,954
Of course.

500
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:31,582
The Reapers who used to be judges,
prosecutors, and lawyers,

501
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,960
all wanted to help
and even wrote out the complaint.

502
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,967
I see you've committed many crimes.
From sex crimes to drugs.

503
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,220
We've gathered all the evidence
and sent it to the press.

504
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,514
Your agency is preparing a release
saying they no longer represent you.

505
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,515
What?

506
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,684
Cut your crap.

507
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,729
Do you know what I did to get here?

508
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,983
How did you get here? Like this?

509
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,610
I only did it because Seol In-u made me.

510
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,238
I'm sorry.

511
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,115
No…

512
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,790
You can pay for the rest
of your crimes in Hell.

513
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,504
No one's going to care
if the articles are corrected.

514
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:19,964
They might not.

515
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,299
But…

516
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,554
Sit.

517
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,680
Stand.

518
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:29,807
Sit.

519
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,393
Stand.

520
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,981
Roll to the left.

521
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,192
Roll to the right.

522
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,362
Stand up! Get cracking!

523
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,536
Starting now, delete every single
hateful comment you wrote

524
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,580
and write articles with the corrections.

525
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,248
What? But…

526
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,458
But there are so many…

527
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,876
-All of them?
-Yes.

528
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,295
All 128,432 of them.

529
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,005
That will take weeks, damn it.

530
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,423
So what if it takes weeks?

531
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:06,010
What about the person
that your 210,519 comments hurt?

532
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,387
No. Who do you think you are?

533
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:12,141
185,230 comments.

534
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,143
Will you come to your senses
if you're beaten

535
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,895
the same number of times
as the comments you've left?

536
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,606
Please, spare me.

537
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,026
Keep running your mouths
if you want another beating.

538
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:23,486
I'll do it.

539
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,029
I'll do it.

540
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,114
This place doesn't have a door
or any food.

541
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:31,118
You won't be able to leave
until you delete everything.

542
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,787
Get moving.

543
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,628
-Excuse me.
-What is it?

544
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,381
I didn't leave hateful comments.

545
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,007
I'm a video creator.

546
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,680
That's why we got you a computer

547
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,934
that's connected to a hacking tool
on Jumadeung's server.

548
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,269
Delete every single video I'm in

549
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,271
and any related comments.

550
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,274
There are probably billions.
You expect me to erase them all--

551
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,116
-Go.
-Yes, ma'am.

552
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,662
Thank you so much.

553
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,665
But I'm still a little nervous.

554
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:21,335
There might not be
a place for me anymore when I return.

555
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,422
Perhaps this could be a time
to recharge yourself.

556
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,967
I hate that people say horrible things
about me for no reason.

557
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,176
I just want to quit it all, but…

558
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,389
I know it's ironic, but I don't want to
go down like a setting sun…

559
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,558
What's wrong with a setting sun?

560
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:39,478
Every day, countless people watch
the sunset and marvel at the sight.

561
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,565
Shine the best you can,

562
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:45,234
and when the time comes,
your sunset will be beautiful.

563
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:49,238
All those people will remember your moment

564
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,325
and be with you until the very end.

565
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,622
You've even got fans cheering for you
in the afterworld.

566
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,630
AS PEOPLE WHO'VE DIED BEFORE,
THE AFTERWORLD IS NICE,

567
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,299
BUT THE LAND OF THE LIVING IS STILL BETTER
GO RYU CHO-HUI!

568
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:21,729
RYU CHO-HUI, AGE 27
SINGER AND ACTOR

569
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,651
How are you feeling?

570
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,112
This is nothing,

571
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,990
compared to the pain you went through.

572
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:17,785
Why…

573
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,371
did you do it?

574
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,457
Why didn't you tell me?

575
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,918
About you and me.

576
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,090
Even if we had been married once,

577
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,676
the thread of fate between us
has been severed.

578
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,595
Even if there had been any feelings left,

579
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,306
what could I have said to you…

580
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,311
when hundreds of years have passed?

581
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,358
Yes.

582
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,151
You are right.

583
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,238
It wasn't a matter of my feelings

584
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,033
when I went to rescue you.

585
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,869
It was because of my pride.

586
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,373
My pride made me misunderstand you…

587
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,211
and do those foolish things.

588
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,465
Thank you…

589
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,386
for saying that.

590
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,771
Ryeon.

591
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,524
What happened to Ryu Cho-hui?

592
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,361
She's recovered.

593
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:42,286
-Will she try to kill herself again?
-No.

594
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,206
I'll stop her, no matter what.

595
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,669
Right.

596
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:53,213
That's what the Risk Management Team does.

597
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,718
I understand it now.

598
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,514
Thank you.

599
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,413
When Mr. Ha said…

600
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:32,336
he came to arrest you under orders
of the Senior Board of Directors,

601
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,797
I had a feeling
he had another goal in mind.

602
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,965
I thought he was trying
to take my position

603
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,468
by using the RM Team as the excuse.

604
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:43,013
So that's why you said
you'd disband the RM Team.

605
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,683
And provoked Choi Jun-woong.

606
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,268
"Provoke"?

607
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,229
Let's just say he was my only hope.

608
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,441
I couldn't tell him to save you myself.

609
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:58,112
Because that would have given
Ha Dae-su a great excuse.

610
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:03,075
So you have no intentions to retire?

611
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:06,495
No. I still have a lot to do.

612
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,247
But…

613
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:12,251
I didn't think that
he would bring Jung-gil into it.

614
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,086
You and Jung-gil.

615
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:19,007
The history and feelings between you two
had to be resolved.

616
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:23,762
Perhaps that is why fate brought
Choi Jun-woong to Jumadeung.

617
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,521
Ryeon!

618
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:33,564
Ryeon…

619
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,487
At the time, I was in so much pain…

620
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:46,118
that I wished to break
all my ties with the world.

621
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:50,539
I even wished that I could just
disappear and cease to exist.

622
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,627
And one day, when the time is right,

623
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,464
the person you must save will appear.

624
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:01,758
You must save them from their death.

625
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:06,346
That is if you want
your wish to be granted.

626
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:08,891
So…

627
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,268
the choice is yours to make.

628
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,562
So think about it.

629
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,275
Who is that person?

630
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,486
The one who will take their own life.

631
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,738
Rescue the poor soul,

632
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:26,033
who has forgotten what a gift life is.

633
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:29,119
When can I meet that person anyway?

634
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,412
Is that person even real?

635
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,414
You'll meet that person one day for sure.

636
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,250
Because that's how
you'll get what you want.

637
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:38,962
When I saw Cho-hui on the Red Light,

638
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:42,257
I thought that this must be
my last mission.

639
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,344
Because of my uncontrollable anger,

640
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:50,224
I didn't care if I had to go back to Hell

641
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,142
or if I ceased to exist.

642
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:56,688
But listening to Choi Jun-woong's words…

643
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:57,981
All the people you saved,

644
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,526
they're living good lives.

645
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,195
So why are you so unhappy?

646
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,740
If you don't feel happy yourself,

647
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:09,576
what's the point of saving others?

648
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:12,996
It made me realize.

649
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:16,667
Realize what?

650
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,796
That the last person I have to save…

651
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,217
is me.

652
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,224
That in the end,

653
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,645
we are the only ones
who can save ourselves.

654
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,607
That's why you entrusted
the RM Team to me.

655
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,484
For that reason.

656
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,279
Yes.

657
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:50,325
The RM Team is there
to help other people realize that.

658
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:54,913
Now that you've accomplished your task,

659
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,916
I will ask you again.

660
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,919
What is it that you want right now?

661
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:11,388
Make the Risk Management Team
an official department

662
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,265
instead of a temporary one.

663
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,102
Okay.

664
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:20,731
And renovate our office
to something more modern.

665
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,191
All right.

666
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,527
I also want Ryung-gu to be
promoted to manager.

667
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,613
But he doesn't have the seniority…

668
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:31,283
He's done so much.
I think he more than deserves it.

669
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,451
Yes, but…

670
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:37,539
I mean, Jumadeung has
a strict seniority system--

671
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,832
And one last thing.

672
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,084
I need more team members.

673
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,378
It's too much
for just the three of us to handle.

674
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,049
I guess it'll be back down

675
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,343
to two again.

676
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,179
You know, Choi Jun-woong.

677
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:56,725
His promised time is almost up
and he did his job well,

678
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,395
so I thought I'd let him go home early.

679
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:02,356
What do you think?

680
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,378
Right, hello.

681
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,381
JUMADEUNG

682
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,092
Thank you.

683
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,969
I guess the Director must be busy.

684
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,147
Thank you. Bye.

685
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,737
FIND CRIMINAL SOULS
REPORT AND APPREHEND!

686
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,033
Things haven't been so quiet
in a while, this is great!

687
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:59,246
I told you that you can't say
something like that at work.

688
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,914
It's pretty quiet today.

689
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:01,915
Don't say that.

690
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:04,584
-You can't say things are quiet.
-Why?

691
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,462
If you say something like that,
things always get busy.

692
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:08,714
Right. Okay.

693
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,842
He's going to forget
everything he heard here anyway.

694
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:13,719
Sorry?

695
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:18,223
Choi Jun-woong.
It's time for you to go back.

696
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,059
The Director gave a special order

697
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,520
for your early return
to the Land of the Living.

698
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:24,521
Goodbye.

699
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:30,652
What, so suddenly like this?

700
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:33,113
Without even a going-away party?

701
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:36,742
No ceremony where Reapers stand in line
on either side and clap for me?

702
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,660
There's nothing like that.

703
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:42,330
You came here unexpectedly,
and that's how you'll return too.

704
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:59,431
So I'm really going like this?

705
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,184
Everyone that fate brings together

706
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,644
must part at least once,

707
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,063
whether they like it or not.

708
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:19,493
I think I'm going to miss
getting chewed out by you, ma'am.

709
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,121
I wish I had more time
to use you how I want.

710
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,922
That reminds me,
we never did this properly.

711
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,062
Thank you for everything.

712
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:48,855
Goodbye.

713
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,360
Come here.

714
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,327
No, not a hug.

715
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,210
You did…

716
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:12,546
a great job.

717
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:18,677
You too, ma'am.

718
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,930
Goodbye, Choi Jun-woong.

719
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:32,941
Please, let my Jun-woong wake up soon…

720
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,004
Mom, where am I?
Why am I lying in a hospital bed?

721
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:56,965
Jun-woong.

722
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,260
Jun-woong!

723
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,178
I'm so proud of you!

724
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:07,267
Mom, what's wrong?

725
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,226
You're alive.

726
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:13,023
Don't you remember jumping off
Dongjak Bridge to save someone?

727
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,524
I did?

728
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,736
My son's alive.

729
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,905
I'm so proud of you.

730
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:21,740
Jun-woong!

731
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,327
Jun-woong!

732
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,288
I was so worried about you!

733
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,166
What's with you?

734
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,502
Come on.

735
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:37,213
I knew you'd wake up.

736
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,633
I'm so proud of you, Jun-woong.

737
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,551
Oh, gosh.

738
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:49,392
6 MONTHS LATER

739
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,353
APPLICATION SLIP
TALENT ACQUISITION TEAM

740
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,313
I'm someone who’s like nitrogen.

741
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,565
Although nitrogen was once
considered useless

742
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,275
because it does not react
with most matter,

743
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,569
once it's converted to ammonia,

744
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,696
nitrogen becomes a fertilizer that helps
one-third of the plants on Earth grow.

745
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:06,660
I would like to work at Bamer and become
the perfect nitrogen for its growth.

746
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:17,462
Here, have some of this too.

747
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,215
Here you go.

748
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:23,134
Now, this is my treat,
so please enjoy, everyone!

749
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,470
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

750
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:28,264
Let's eat.

751
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,527
-I've won it again.
-Won what?

752
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:44,406
I won an event and got tickets to
a Ryu Cho-hui concert.

753
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,365
Ryu Cho-hui?

754
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,326
I heard the concert's sold out,
and it's really hard to get tickets.

755
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,287
I was her fan when I was in the military,
but I'm pretty busy with work…

756
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:54,165
Hey, that guy's a fan of Ryu Cho-hui.

757
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,888
Now, we need to become a company

758
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,099
focused on its people
and lead the industry.

759
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,143
This is the mind map
for the personnel evaluation.

760
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:15,812
This is what we'll be discussing
for the rest of the meeting.

761
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:18,523
We'll continue after a ten-minute break.

762
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,358
Okay. See you in ten.

763
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:44,299
No wonder he wants to die
when he's grilled like that every day.

764
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,294
Really? Yes, okay.

765
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:22,337
Have a nice evening.

766
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,130
Come on. Okay, yes.

767
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:27,675
Hey.

768
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,594
What's that?

769
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:34,474
Hey, you have to share
if you have something good for you.

770
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:37,102
I heard it's good for the…

771
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:39,729
Have one.

772
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,362
This is good!

773
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,324
Hey, Jun-woong,
how about we get drinks later?

774
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,868
Sure. Okay.

775
00:56:58,456 --> 00:56:59,374
EMPLOYEE CHOI JUN-WOONG

776
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:00,875
It's seven already.

777
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:12,512
Let's go!

778
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,515
Everything's on the company card tonight!

779
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,893
I reserved a really great place tonight!

780
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,031
Hurry, Assistant Manager Lim.

781
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,074
It's Manager Lim now.

782
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,034
Okay, Manager Lim.

783
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,625
Oh, Yong-ho!

784
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,420
Let go! Someone like me
should just die and disappear!

785
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,755
Come on, why should you die?

786
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,632
He told me to just kill myself!

787
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:53,178
What did I do so wrong?

788
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,638
I worked so hard to get in here,

789
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,141
but it's hopeless…

790
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:02,896
Hope?

791
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,274
There are very few people
who live with something like that.

792
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:09,569
Appreciating the little things in life
if they make us happy,

793
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:10,862
is what we humans do.

794
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,531
I don't even have

795
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,450
those little joys in life.

796
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,577
Wait.

797
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:19,871
You like Ryu Cho-hui, right?

798
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,332
-Ryu Cho-hui?
-Yes. Ryu Cho-hui.

799
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:26,336
I have a bunch of her concert tickets.
I'll give them to you, all of them.

800
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,715
I don't have anyone to go with.

801
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:34,802
-Yes, you do! You can go with me!
-Two guys going to a concert together?

802
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,429
So what if two guys
go to a concert together?

803
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,265
We'll go and have a beer together
and see the concert!

804
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,892
We can say mean things
about the Team Manager together.

805
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:42,810
These are the little joys in life.

806
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,649
Okay.

807
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,453
PARK YONG-HO, AGE 30

808
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:04,874
You have to promise me.

809
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,085
He seems to be doing well.

810
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:12,173
He's still getting in our way even
when he's back in the Land of the Living.

811
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:14,884
You've returned to your post, I see.

812
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:18,221
I was passing by and I heard a loud voice.

813
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:21,349
The concert's in two days,
so wear something nice.

814
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:23,309
I'll get dressed up.

815
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,228
Okay.

816
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:34,571
Who are you?

817
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,614
You don't look like you work here.

818
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,408
We're your old bosses!

819
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:41,327
"Old bosses"? What are you talking about?

820
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,829
You'll find out when you die.

821
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:46,541
I'll find out when I die?
What's that supposed to mean?

822
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:48,251
I could help you get there.

823
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,795
Of all the things you could
help someone with,

824
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,171
you're going to help them die?

825
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,798
Who are you, people?

826
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:56,801
We're not getting any new team members,
so we might as well get Mr. Choi…

827
00:59:58,469 --> 00:59:59,762
Let's wait just 50 years.

828
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,056
Fifty years…

829
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,101
It's 49 years and 2 months.

830
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:07,478
I'm telling you,
you can get a new member right now.

831
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:10,898
Come on. Who are you, people?

832
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:13,610
Us?

833
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,448
We're Grim Reapers.

834
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:32,271
