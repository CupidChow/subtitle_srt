1
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,334
What an honest organism.

2
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,795
What you get

3
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,505
is what you give it.

4
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,801
If it sees the sun, it blooms.

5
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,928
If it doesn't, it wilts.

6
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,805
Don't you agree, Ryeon?

7
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,100
You didn't call me here
to show me some flowers.

8
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,769
It's about the current suicide risk case.

9
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,566
Lee Young-chun. Age 91.
A senior citizen living alone.

10
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,443
What about it?

11
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:13,448
It seems you'll be working together with
the Escort Team for this case.

12
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,496
His life is set to end tomorrow.

13
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,499
-What?
-In most cases,

14
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:26,753
people wish to live longer
the more they age.

15
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,547
So, why is the last decision in his life

16
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,884
to kill himself?

17
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,137
I guess after all these years

18
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,765
he has deep wounds that have yet to heal,

19
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,476
or regrets.

20
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,560
Yes, you're right.

21
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,313
As you've said,
whatever that wound in his heart may be,

22
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:48,107
shouldn't he live
to his designated lifespan?

23
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,737
So you want me to heal a wound
that he wasn't able to heal in decades,

24
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,447
in one day?

25
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:58,243
At the very least,
shouldn't you make him feel

26
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,079
that his life had meaning?

27
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,466
EPISODE 6: A SOUL BECOMES A STAR

28
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,552
What's taking Ms. Koo so long?

29
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:20,181
It'd be nice if she could ask the Director
to give us more personnel.

30
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,770
No one's coming here.

31
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,816
I guess this team's way too intense.

32
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:33,194
This team feels like
it's the outcast of Jumadeung.

33
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,196
I'm sure most people would prefer to work
in the Escort Team,

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,115
where everyone has a fancy suit. Right?

35
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:40,493
Anyway, how long have you
been working here at Jumadeung?

36
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,745
-Since the Joseon Dynasty.
-Joseon Dynasty?

37
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,708
Ms. Koo's been here longer than you,
so does that mean she's been here

38
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,751
since King Sejong
or General Yi Sun-shin's time?

39
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,794
Do I look that old?

40
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,256
So how long have you…

41
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,633
Since the Qing Invasion of Joseon.

42
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,511
Qing Invasion of Joseon…

43
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,180
Enough with the chatter.
I have something I need to say.

44
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,728
LEE YOUNG-CHUN, AGE 91

45
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,938
If he's going to pass away tomorrow,

46
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,858
what's the point of helping him
find the meaning of life again?

47
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,821
What's certain is that
we don't have much time.

48
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:22,160
I'm sure our task isn't just to keep him
from committing suicide for a day.

49
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,954
Mr. Lim is right.

50
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,250
Get changed. We don't have much time.

51
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:37,467
Man.

52
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,054
I mean, do people still live
in this neighborhood?

53
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,681
They must have left because of
the redevelopment project.

54
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,475
How much farther?

55
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,436
It's that house.

56
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,069
Pull me, please.

57
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,654
Pull me.

58
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,241
What did I expect?

59
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,411
I don't think anyone lives here.

60
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,288
The bell doesn't work.

61
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,373
Is anyone home?

62
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,464
Do I have…

63
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,512
Good for you! I'm so jealous.

64
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,891
Is being dense your special ability?

65
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,647
My fingertips tingled though…

66
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:34,941
They really did…

67
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:55,128
Let's start by cleaning up a bit.
And then we'll search.

68
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,212
Cleaning?

69
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,049
Just looking at clean spaces
improves mental stability.

70
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,010
Especially if it's their home.

71
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,475
We'll need equipment
if we're going to clean the place up.

72
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,477
I don't think there's a shop
that sells them here,

73
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,354
so we'll need to go
to another neighborhood.

74
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,274
It'll be more efficient
to have one person go

75
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,318
rather than having everyone go together.

76
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,652
So, that person.

77
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,446
How should we pick that person?

78
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,198
-What a conundrum.
-It is a conundrum.

79
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,242
I'll go.

80
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,286
Thank you.

81
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,123
Jeez!

82
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,709
They could have just told me to do it.

83
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,544
Why bother pressuring me like that?

84
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,465
-Mom.
-Yes?

85
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,675
Why's that old man taking the trash?

86
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,385
It's because he didn't study hard.

87
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,513
You need to study hard if you
don't want to end up like him, okay?

88
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,059
What a mean thing to say.

89
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,311
Sir.

90
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,228
Sir!

91
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,397
Where are you headed? I'll help you there.

92
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,482
No, thank you.

93
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,901
-Wait.
-What?

94
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,612
LEE YOUNG-CHUN, AGE 91

95
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,863
Mr. Lee Young-chun?

96
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,199
Yes?

97
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,619
You must be busy at the district office.

98
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,496
Oh, not at all. I'm really not busy.

99
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,748
And I don't have anywhere else
to use my energy.

100
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,919
But I feel bad for letting you do this…

101
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,670
You really don't need to.

102
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,714
I'm deceptively muscular under all this.

103
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,965
Is that so?

104
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,180
This neighborhood seems pretty lonely.

105
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:35,144
It used to bustle with people,
but they all left.

106
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,188
Why didn't you go?

107
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:38,773
Me?

108
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:43,820
Well, they offered me a ridiculously
small amount of compensation,

109
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,280
telling me I had to leave,

110
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,325
but I couldn't really move anywhere
with that money.

111
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,663
And I've lived in this neighborhood
my whole life.

112
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,250
Not to mention,
I don't have that much time left anyway.

113
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,341
What?

114
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,843
There you are.

115
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,386
Hey, gramps!

116
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,264
I've been looking for you!

117
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:15,017
You really have a knack
for being a nuisance, don't you?

118
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,021
You managed to walk here
on those old bones, huh?

119
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,065
I told you to go live somewhere else.

120
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,942
Why won't you just listen?

121
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,944
Hey, I think you're being a bit rude.

122
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,446
Don't.

123
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,324
And who's this?
Brought your grandson, did you?

124
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,411
You, take your grandpa somewhere else.

125
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,456
Do you know how much he's costing us?

126
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,084
He's just a young man who came to help me.

127
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,712
I understood, so please leave for the day.

128
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,838
Gramps.

129
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,715
-Hey!
-No.

130
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:50,178
Gramps, we're not leaving until you do.
Understand?

131
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,846
Would you look at that?

132
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,473
What's this?

133
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,057
No.

134
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,394
Why would a person
who fought to save the country

135
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,856
be standing in the way
when we're trying to develop it?

136
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,109
We need to clean up
this crummy neighborhood

137
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,196
so that real estate prices can rise,
and things can get nice.

138
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:12,450
So move, I'm telling you!

139
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,784
-No.
-Jeez!

140
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,329
What are you going to do,
gathering this stuff?

141
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,249
Think of how amazing
you were when you were young.

142
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,417
Don't…

143
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:25,296
So why are you being
such a nuisance now that you're old?

144
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:26,964
I'm sorry.

145
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,217
No, stop! Stop!

146
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,385
Sir!

147
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,637
Are you okay?

148
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,554
You bastard!

149
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,851
It's okay.

150
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,982
-Did you get into a fight?
-Did you not fight back?

151
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:49,028
He was trying to help me…

152
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,113
It's not like it was just one person.
How could I win against those thugs?

153
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,823
Then you shouldn't have attacked.

154
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:56,452
After what they did to Mr. Lee here,
was I supposed to stand by and do nothing?

155
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,162
Don't you raise your voice at me
when you didn't even win.

156
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,374
Excuse me, but who are you?

157
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,794
Are you from the district office too?

158
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,213
Are you Mr. Lee Young-chun?

159
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,173
Yes, that's me…

160
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,341
We're Grim Reapers.

161
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,474
What…

162
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,436
No, not me. Not yet. Just like half?

163
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,939
Mr. Lee Young-chun.

164
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,649
You will die tomorrow.

165
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,557
Are we just putting it out
in the open just like that?

166
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,851
Telling people we're Grim Reapers?

167
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,854
Mr. Lee Young-chun
doesn't have long to live.

168
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,230
I know, but…

169
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,317
He looks really healthy for his age.

170
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,945
It's the lifespan he's been designated.

171
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,157
Do you know how he's going to die?

172
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,952
The Escort Team said
it'll be an acute illness.

173
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:25,166
He's a Korean War veteran.

174
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,627
How did you know that?

175
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,671
He had his Person of Distinguished
Service to the State cap on.

176
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,214
So why is he here, alone?

177
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,425
I didn't see any family
on the Red Light either.

178
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,806
Are you really…

179
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,810
a Grim Reaper?

180
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:45,770
Yes.

181
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,813
I am a Grim Reaper.

182
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,946
Maybe it's because
I'm so close to my death,

183
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,449
but I feel this aura around you.

184
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,242
You really must be

185
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,037
Grim Reapers.

186
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,331
We are here

187
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,042
to save you.

188
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,502
Pardon?

189
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,712
You were preparing to kill yourself.

190
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,469
But you only have a day left to live.

191
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,307
If there's something you want,

192
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,726
anything you want to do or see,

193
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,396
we can do anything for you.

194
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,403
A few weeks ago,

195
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,613
I heard that

196
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,535
one of my neighbors was found dead,
having died alone.

197
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:47,915
His body had decomposed to the point
where there were only bones left.

198
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,376
When I heard about that,

199
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,838
it made me think.

200
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,632
I thought

201
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,678
I'd probably end up like that too.

202
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:05,057
Just waiting for the day I'd die,
not knowing when that'll be,

203
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,976
is too terrifying.

204
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,644
So…

205
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,896
I was looking

206
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,943
for a way to depart this world quietly.

207
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:20,448
Don't you want to spend your last day
in a meaningful way?

208
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,867
I've been meaning to die

209
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,829
after I have finished my work.

210
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:32,710
So I just want to live the day
as I always have.

211
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,385
Where are you going?

212
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,096
I'm going to collect more paper waste

213
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,516
and go to the junkyard to sell it
before the sun sets.

214
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,270
Since it'll be lonely on your own,

215
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,939
we'll be by your side

216
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,400
for your final tomorrow.

217
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,369
Sir.

218
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,123
Why don't you spend the day
relaxing at home or going somewhere nice?

219
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,208
It's okay.

220
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:18,130
Since it's my last day,
I want to soak everything in.

221
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,134
I guess

222
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,512
it's not a good day.

223
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,431
Everything must have been taken already.

224
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,974
The competition must be fierce.

225
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:33,938
There's probably some left
around that corner.

226
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,398
What? Oh, dear.

227
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,236
He really is very energetic.

228
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,904
The problem is, he's too eager.

229
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,614
Is that so?

230
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,324
How lively.

231
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,411
What? Hey, sir!

232
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,664
Sir!

233
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:56,669
Sir, wait! Sir!

234
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,462
Come on, sir!

235
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,713
I mean…

236
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,216
Why would someone so young…

237
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,134
He's even got a car.

238
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:08,180
There's a bunch of people nowadays
who do it as exercise

239
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,724
because they feel cooped up at home.

240
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,268
As exercise?

241
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:16,313
But for us old folk,
it's how we make a living.

242
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,732
It's my own fault for getting old.

243
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,286
There.

244
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,290
Here's a bunch.

245
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,293
The others must have passed by
and missed it.

246
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,004
But the smell…

247
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:40,963
Isn't this trash?

248
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:41,881
Trash?

249
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,675
This is precious to me.

250
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:49,346
Maybe it's because today is my last,
but I'm having a very lucky day.

251
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,390
Leave it. We'll do it.

252
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,558
No.

253
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:57,897
No. I can't have you
getting your hands dirty.

254
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,023
This isn't dirty at all.

255
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,525
I've seen people much filthier than this.

256
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,443
Still…

257
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,529
That's right, just tell us
what to pick up. We'll get them all.

258
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,781
No, it's okay.

259
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,790
Thank you, Grim Reapers.

260
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,590
I'll take that.

261
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,477
Why, sir!

262
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,480
-You've got a big load today.
-Yes.

263
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,857
-You must have been lucky today.
-Yes, indeed.

264
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,528
Who are they?

265
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,114
They came to help me.

266
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,118
So that's how you brought so much!

267
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,828
Yes, I'm very grateful.

268
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,914
Oh, right.

269
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,959
I heard you're closing the junkyard soon.

270
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,126
Yes.

271
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,129
I wanted to hold on for
as long as possible,

272
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,799
but those thugs kept threatening me.

273
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,258
I understand.

274
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,636
I'll be leaving soon too.

275
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,721
Are you moving somewhere?

276
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,350
Real estate prices are so high these days.
It's hard to find a suitable place.

277
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,897
Don't worry.

278
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,025
I'm going to a good place.

279
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,569
That's great to hear.

280
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,916
I always feel bad
that I can't give you more.

281
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,127
Wait, is this it? But we brought so much.

282
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,753
Check again, are you sure that's correct?

283
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,463
I'm really sorry.

284
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,427
What are you always so sorry for?

285
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,263
I know you give me the best you can.

286
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,684
You don't need to pay me today.

287
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,521
And here, I've been saving a little.

288
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,231
It's not much,

289
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,360
but please use it to
buy your kids something nice to eat.

290
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,280
Sir, I can't do that.

291
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,157
I can't take your money.

292
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,908
You've worked so hard for this.

293
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,368
Take it.

294
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,205
When someone older gives you money,
just accept it with a "thank you."

295
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:24,001
Here. I've wanted to give this
to you for a while now,

296
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,754
but things were too tight.

297
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:31,175
I'll treat you to a nice dinner soon, sir.

298
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,970
Thank you…

299
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,181
for everything.

300
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,558
Thank you too, sir, for everything.

301
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,520
Take care of yourself, sir.

302
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:51,945
You too.

303
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,411
I'll do it.

304
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,416
Goodbye.

305
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:17,554
Maybe it's because this is my last sunset,

306
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:22,559
but something about it
feels different today.

307
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:29,900
It's as if the painful memories
of my past are drifting by.

308
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,819
Are you reluctant to go?

309
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,489
Maybe it's because it's the end.

310
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,574
I try not to

311
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:43,664
but I keep looking back over my life.

312
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,044
I keep regretting…

313
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,089
the choice I made that day.

314
00:18:56,301 --> 00:19:01,223
If I had known
my life would be this difficult,

315
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:07,604
I think perhaps
I would have chosen differently.

316
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,441
Did you volunteer to fight in the war?

317
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,319
Yes.

318
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,113
I did.

319
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:38,135
YEAR 1950, DURING THE KOREAN WAR

320
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,305
ADVANCED KOREAN

321
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,737
Mother, I'll be back soon.

322
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,697
You don't have to pack so much.

323
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,910
I'm sorry this is all I can give you.

324
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,537
Don't go hungry, okay?

325
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,456
I'm sorry, Mother.

326
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:14,087
You don't even argue with your friends,
so how is a kid like you

327
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,965
going to wield a gun and fight?

328
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,259
Don't go, Young-chun. Please.

329
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,054
How can I just stand by and watch
when kids younger than me

330
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,640
are volunteering to protect the country?

331
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,933
No…

332
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,018
I'll be back soon.

333
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,190
My goodness…

334
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,609
Mother.

335
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,236
Let me bow to you.

336
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,913
Young-chun, my child.

337
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,751
You have to be careful.

338
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,361
The battlefield was more gruesome
than I had thought.

339
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:26,243
Because no matter where I went,
it reeked of death.

340
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,065
Young-chun, Young-chun!

341
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,986
Young-chun, get it together!
Do you have a death wish?

342
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,195
Sorry, sir.

343
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:06,033
-Let's survive and eat dinner.
-Yes, sir.

344
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,331
People kept dying like that,

345
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,126
so I couldn't get attached to anyone.

346
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,637
The only one I let myself get close to

347
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,514
was Dong-chil.

348
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,267
Dong-chil.

349
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,144
Is it good?

350
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,897
Yes, sir, it's delicious.

351
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,025
Aren't you going to eat it, sir?

352
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,861
You eat your fill.

353
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,286
I'm going to go home and eat the hot meal
my mother will make for me.

354
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,372
I miss my mom.

355
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,169
Do you think we'll see them again?

356
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,257
Of course. We're going to survive
and see them in the end.

357
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,884
We definitely will.

358
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,639
I told her I'd eat well
and we'd meet again when I was taller.

359
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,478
Damn it, do you want your head blown off?

360
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,730
Sorry, sir.

361
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,900
Put your helmet on properly.

362
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,361
-Yes, sir.
-This and this.

363
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,738
You need these intact
when you see her again.

364
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,823
Don't you?

365
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:28,782
Yes, sir.

366
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,910
Eat.

367
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,010
Everyone, move out of the way!

368
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,194
Dong-chil.

369
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,195
Dong-chil!

370
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,784
Dong-chil. Dong-chil!

371
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,704
Dong-chil, wake up.

372
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,038
Wake up, Kim Dong-chil!

373
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,875
Medic!

374
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,711
Wake up, Dong-chil.

375
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,504
Medic!

376
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,091
Where's the medic?

377
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,342
Help.

378
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,059
Dong-chil.

379
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,812
Dong-chil. Are you okay?

380
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,606
It's me.

381
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,066
Sergeant Lee Young-chun.

382
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,574
It's all your fault.

383
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,411
Why did you save me? Why?

384
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,289
Why didn't you just let me die?

385
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,002
Dong-chil, get it together.

386
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,754
It's all your fault.

387
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,380
It's all your fault.

388
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,926
I'd rather die than live like this!

389
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,012
Get the hell away from me!

390
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,681
Don't ever show yourself
in front of me again!

391
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:29,277
Dong-chil resented my decision

392
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,572
to save him.

393
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,491
Wait just a moment!

394
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,258
Mother…

395
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,437
When that godforsaken war was over,

396
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,607
I rushed to my home village.

397
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,527
But my mother wasn't there.

398
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:16,074
Why did I volunteer to fight?

399
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,125
Look how much time has passed.

400
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,836
I rambled on, didn't I?

401
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,337
I'm sorry.

402
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,755
No, not at all.

403
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,965
It's fine.

404
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,467
If you have anything more
you want to say, go ahead.

405
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:39,014
It's been such a long time

406
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,683
since I've confided in someone like this.

407
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,684
It's nice.

408
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,188
I would like to have…

409
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,483
one final drink.

410
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,213
-Here, let me pour you a cup.
-Thank you.

411
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:18,011
Pajeon would be perfect with makgeolli,
but we don't have any.

412
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,805
Hold on, I'll be right back.

413
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:21,931
Choi Jun-woong.

414
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,517
Have you forgotten?

415
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,853
The fried chicken.

416
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:27,979
This tastes so bad.

417
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,191
It's so terrible it's making me cry.

418
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:37,822
The fried chicken…

419
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,121
Yes, right.

420
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,354
You're a good cook.

421
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,524
-It's tasty.
-Please, have as much as you want.

422
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:19,322
Why don't you join me?

423
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,409
-Okay.
-Thank you.

424
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,872
I thought

425
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,917
I'd die a lonely death by myself.

426
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,879
Thank you for not letting it be like that.

427
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,382
-Why don't you have a drink, sir?
-Oh, yes.

428
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,425
Here you go, sir.

429
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,476
Seeing your face without a single wrinkle

430
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:52,272
makes me think
that youth is good after all.

431
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,149
Sir, you're still handsome.

432
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,233
Am I?

433
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,402
Thank you.

434
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,612
But sir,

435
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,740
what did you do after the war?

436
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:05,577
It's no fun listening to an old man
tell his story.

437
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,164
Still, you were around my age
after the war.

438
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,207
I'm curious how you lived.

439
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:27,515
I went back to sitting at a desk
to resume my studies.

440
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,095
No.

441
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:12,769
No.

442
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:18,149
It wasn't easy, returning to everyday life

443
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,946
after being on a battlefield
where horrific cries filled the air.

444
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,394
Hey, Mr. Lee. What's wrong?

445
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:56,479
Mr. Lee, snap out of it. What is it?

446
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,523
-Mr. Lee!
-What's wrong?

447
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,319
Naturally, I began to lead a life
where I lived from hand-to-mouth.

448
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:06,823
I did everything.

449
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,284
Whatever work I could get.

450
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,552
What did you do?

451
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,053
Do you know how much this is?

452
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:30,597
I'm sorry.

453
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,390
Take the broken ones away.

454
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,516
I'm not paying!

455
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,273
Who hired that half-wit?

456
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:15,058
I wasn't physically or mentally stable,

457
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,977
so I never even dreamed of marriage.

458
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,567
I couldn't do hard labor
after I got older,

459
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,322
so I started gathering
paper waste from the streets.

460
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:32,825
Of course,

461
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,203
today's my final day for that too.

462
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,928
Sir, where are you going?

463
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:53,930
No.

464
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,225
No, please sit. I'll be back soon.

465
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,290
Maybe I shouldn't have asked.

466
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,339
War is hard on Reapers too.

467
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:33,011
It's traumatic,
escorting tens of thousands of people.

468
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,972
But you weren't on the Escort Team.

469
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:40,226
When something catastrophic like war
happens and many people die,

470
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,854
Reapers from other departments
assist the Escort Team.

471
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,732
It must have been hard for everyone.

472
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,909
What?

473
00:33:58,911 --> 00:33:59,871
Look!

474
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,886
What are you doing here?

475
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,103
What were you thinking about?

476
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,440
I was jealous,

477
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,610
seeing that young man there.

478
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,989
If I'd been born in this age like him,

479
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,575
if that had been the case,

480
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,495
I thought perhaps

481
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,332
my life would have been a bit better.

482
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:49,545
I'm old without a single accomplishment.

483
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,133
I have nothing but regrets in my life.

484
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,053
My life was meaningless

485
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,640
and worthless.

486
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,228
You may call your life meaningless,

487
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,230
but there's something I want to show you.

488
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,200
What?

489
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,582
This is…

490
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,583
You can see

491
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,253
all of Seoul from here.

492
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,089
It looks different…

493
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,716
looking at it like this.

494
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,927
I don't know…

495
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,097
when the world changed so much.

496
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,599
It's beautiful.

497
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:48,479
It wouldn't exist
had it not been for your choice.

498
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,315
If it hadn't been for you,

499
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,861
the today that people are living right now

500
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,113
would not exist.

501
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,409
The life you have lived
is by no means meaningless

502
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,078
or worthless.

503
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,001
Take in this sight.

504
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:15,548
It's the country you protected.

505
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:49,957
It's been a long time since
the pride I had for protecting my country

506
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,127
had crumbled over the life I had lost.

507
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:57,131
Thank you for saying what you did.

508
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,344
You don't need to thank me.

509
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,889
I've only told you the truth.

510
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,740
Sir!

511
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,367
Where are you, sir!

512
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,077
There you are.

513
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,621
Sir, I've found Mr. Dong-chil!

514
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,538
What?

515
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,252
Dong-chil. Dong-chil!

516
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:37,046
I put your photo
on social media just in case.

517
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,548
A lot of people helped
and spread the word.

518
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,592
I just heard from
Mr. Dong-chil's grandson.

519
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,220
He lives in Busan
and is in good health. Look.

520
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,100
How?

521
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,310
I mean, how is this possible?

522
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:57,024
Thank you for living a good life,
Dong-chil.

523
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,611
He says thanks to you,
he never lost courage.

524
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,571
Goodness.

525
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:04,949
It's all your fault.

526
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,867
It's all your fault.

527
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,703
Why did you save me? Why?

528
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,955
Why didn't you just let me die?

529
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,230
You wanted to go home!

530
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,399
You wanted to show your mom
how you've grown!

531
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,650
What did we fight for?

532
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,695
What do you think
your mother wants to see?

533
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,363
It's not your dead body!

534
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,782
It's you, alive!

535
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,327
Help.

536
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:11,390
Did I say that?

537
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,643
You see this number next to the heart?

538
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,645
This is how many people you've helped.

539
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,940
How did people…

540
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,359
They're showing their respect for you.

541
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,029
For the valor you showed
in risking your life to fight in the war.

542
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:31,118
It's not because I wanted some big reward.

543
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:36,332
I just wanted people to
recognize what I did.

544
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,294
That's why I wore this silly thing.

545
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,386
-What is it?
-I'm surprised you're actually useful.

546
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:52,640
Then why don't you say some nice things
and compliment me for once?

547
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,392
It's cold out. Take Mr. Lee in.

548
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,269
-What about you, ma'am?
-I need to go somewhere.

549
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,270
Go in, sir.

550
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,688
Yes.

551
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,107
-Let's go, sir.
-Okay.

552
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,109
Be careful.

553
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,371
Who's escorting Mr. Lee Young-chun?

554
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,998
Why should I tell you?

555
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,709
I would like for you

556
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,254
to escort him yourself.

557
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,048
Do you want to manage
the Escort Team as well?

558
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,758
Why don't you stick to what you can do?

559
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,219
Instead of holding on
to something you can't do.

560
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,388
I'm asking you for this favor.

561
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:36,392
Please, I'm hoping you'll escort
Mr. Lee Young-chun

562
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,978
with the respect and honor he deserves.

563
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:01,083
Make Mr. Lee Young-chun's last moment
a peaceful one.

564
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:05,004
I can't stand by and watch him
pass away in pain.

565
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,172
Did you guys plan this?

566
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,467
-Pardon?
-Mr. Park was just here.

567
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,846
No two things in this world are the same,

568
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,764
but when people look at something
and feel the same thing,

569
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,183
that's quite something.

570
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:22,771
But no one can be special before death.
Nor should they be special.

571
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:27,067
At least don't let his final passage
in life be a lonely one.

572
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,944
You're expecting quite a lot.

573
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,197
I only want him to be treated with
the bare minimum amount of respect.

574
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,242
It is not for you Reapers
to judge people's lives.

575
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,077
-Ma'am.
-That's enough.

576
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,621
I won't tolerate it anymore.

577
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:44,293
Mr. Lee Young-chun's life
will be judged fairly.

578
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,503
So go.

579
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,771
Fairly?

580
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:07,983
Why does that sound to me like
we're not doing something that we can?

581
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,974
You're supposed to empty the place,
not bring more people in.

582
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,725
Do you want a fight? Is that it?

583
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,102
Come on, just go. Please.

584
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,395
Do you want to be beaten again?

585
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,982
Go inside, sir.

586
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,694
Stop making a scene. Let's talk it out.

587
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,320
And who's this?

588
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,864
What are you going to do
if I don't want to?

589
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,783
-What are you going to do?
-No, don't.

590
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,910
You shouldn't be acting like this to them.

591
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,328
Oh, for crying out loud!

592
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,373
-Are you okay, sir?
-Yes, I'm fine.

593
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:08,168
The way that old geezer glared at me,
I thought he had become young again.

594
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,503
I was almost scared.

595
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,838
You…

596
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,047
So, it's you guys?

597
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,300
You beat up our newbie.

598
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,010
What is all this?

599
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,511
How annoying.

600
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,598
Go inside.

601
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,641
-I'll be there soon.
-Yes, ma'am.

602
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:24,935
Let's go inside, sir.

603
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,186
Are you the grandkid?

604
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,480
What spirited progeny he's got here.

605
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,026
Hey there, Miss.

606
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:33,694
How old are you?

607
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,784
I'm 420…

608
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,328
What? 20?

609
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,370
Are you deaf?

610
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,081
I am 420 years old!

611
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,214
Sir, are you okay?

612
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,092
Yes, I'm fine.

613
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,597
But more than that, what about her?

614
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,391
We've left her all alone.

615
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,768
Don't worry.

616
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,603
She's more than fine.

617
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:09,897
Sir!

618
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,155
Damn it!

619
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:29,708
What the…

620
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:35,130
Trash like you shouldn't be interfering

621
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,801
when every minute and second
is precious to that person.

622
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,720
Piss off.

623
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,138
DANGER

624
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,181
Sir.

625
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,361
Sir.

626
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,532
Don't speak, try to take deep breaths.

627
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,992
Sir, the hospital.
Let's go to the hospital.

628
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,161
No, I should call 119 first.

629
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,623
Mr. Choi, there's no point. Stop.

630
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:11,750
But he might live if we get him treated.

631
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,420
-Mr. Choi.
-I mean, we have to do something.

632
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:15,838
No.

633
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,094
People's designated lifespans
never change.

634
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,596
It is preordained.

635
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:36,817
Sir.

636
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,987
It's fine.

637
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,072
I'm fine.

638
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,032
We…

639
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,617
knew from the moment

640
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,163
that we met.

641
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:05,971
Where are you going?

642
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:11,727
I can't watch.

643
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:18,358
You expect me to just stand by and watch
when he's in that much pain?

644
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,778
Mr. Lee Young-chun's life is over.

645
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:22,821
I know.

646
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,573
I know…

647
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:27,034
I know, but…

648
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,163
What can I do when I can't help it.

649
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:35,626
Okay.

650
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,252
Then you stay here.

651
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:38,712
But…

652
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,590
are you confident
you won't regret this choice?

653
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:49,014
Come back in
when you've composed yourself.

654
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,266
Don't be late.

655
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:21,880
The Escort Team.

656
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,928
What are you doing?

657
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:28,887
Get out of the way.

658
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,517
Please, can you give him
just a little more time?

659
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:35,936
Please.

660
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:39,565
Move.

661
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,125
Please, sir.

662
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,793
There's nothing more you can do.

663
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,630
What can you do when you can't even watch

664
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:04,590
his last moment?

665
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,467
Stand by and be ready.

666
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,083
Who are you?

667
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:51,428
I remember the last time
I saw you from behind.

668
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,391
It was a very long night.

669
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,454
If we survive tonight!

670
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,540
We'll go back home.

671
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:21,458
Everyone,

672
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,752
charge!

673
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:37,349
I want to pay my respects
to the courage you had for your country.

674
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,439
So, we will all accompany you
in your last moment.

675
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,919
Thank you.

676
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,930
You've changed.

677
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,349
The Ryeon I know

678
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,144
had a hard time watching people
in their last moments.

679
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,896
That's why you only wanted
to escort criminals.

680
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,858
I've become a little numb to it,

681
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,360
but I still find it difficult.

682
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,115
No one ever finds it easy.

683
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,618
But that is the work of a Reaper.

684
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,499
To watch to the very end.

685
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,687
The Escort Team.

686
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,400
But why are there so many of them here?

687
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,360
This is a special case.

688
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,113
The Director must have approved it.

689
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,657
Yes, I've never seen
anything like this either.

690
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,415
I'm sorry.

691
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,918
We'll talk later. How is he?

692
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,922
He couldn't withstand the pain
and fell unconscious.

693
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,757
He's barely breathing.

694
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,759
It won't be long.

695
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:30,272
The lives they've led
are etched into their faces.

696
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,858
He has a gentle face.

697
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,570
He's lived a good life.

698
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:42,242
People face choices
every moment of their lives.

699
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:46,955
All those various choices
come together to make their lives.

700
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,458
I'm sorry, Mother.

701
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,920
The choice you made
in your youth was honorable.

702
00:52:58,466 --> 00:52:59,801
You have lost so much.

703
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,012
Everyone, charge!

704
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,890
Yet you have protected many lives

705
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,185
and brought about the world of today.

706
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:13,481
Thank you for protecting
the lives of so many.

707
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:17,903
I'm sorry.

708
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,697
All I can do now

709
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:26,328
is to help you pass on peacefully
and comfortably.

710
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:33,168
Lee Young-chun.

711
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,014
Your soul

712
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,434
will be blessed beyond

713
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,021
what your life has been worth.

714
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:56,024
You've had a difficult life.

715
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,569
Thank you for your hard work.

716
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,447
I can't believe

717
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:47,784
so many people came just for me…

718
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,285
Because if it weren't for you,

719
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,871
Jumadeung wouldn't exist either.

720
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:02,298
Could I have a moment?

721
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,061
I've lived regretting the choice
I made that day

722
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,690
for a very long time.

723
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,483
But fighting for my country

724
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:25,655
was the noblest choice I have made,

725
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,034
and it was worth it.

726
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,496
If I were to go back to that time,

727
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,665
I would wear my uniform again.

728
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:41,546
Thank you so much

729
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:45,133
for being here with me
for my final tomorrow.

730
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:47,927
I told you.

731
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,431
That's my job, no.

732
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:53,892
That's our job.

733
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,479
Thank you for everything.

734
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:08,490
What are you crying for?

735
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:21,252
Why are you crying
when I'm going somewhere nice?

736
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,796
Sir…

737
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,591
Thank you.

738
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,025
Sergeant Lee Young-chun.

739
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,408
Thank you.

740
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:08,842
All Reapers.

741
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,553
A moment of silence
for the soul of the fallen hero,

742
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,472
who protected this country.

743
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,093
Mother.

744
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:40,975
Oh, my goodness.

745
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,481
Let me see.

746
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,151
My Young-chun. How have you been?

747
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,529
You weren't sick?

748
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:55,073
-Mother.
-Yes.

749
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,324
I'm so sorry.

750
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,953
I came too late.

751
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,748
No, you're here now.
That's all that matters.

752
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,002
You did well, living out your life.

753
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,006
Mother.

754
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:12,966
Yes.

755
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,509
Mom.

756
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,767
Let's go eat, son.

757
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:26,980
I've prepared a hot meal. Let's go inside.

758
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,998
Are you still upset?

759
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:49,335
Yes.

760
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,379
He suffered so much
in the Land of the Living.

761
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:53,631
And he never received the respect
he deserved until his death.

762
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,133
It all feels so futile and sad.

763
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:58,386
Couldn't you have helped him, ma'am?

764
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:00,763
I'm only involved in life and death

765
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,849
and crime and punishment.

766
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,225
Not the Land of the Living.

767
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,811
I think that's cowardly. It's not fair.

768
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:10,023
The world makes a fool out of people
who are kind and hard-working.

769
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,233
Why do you just stand by?
You have the power!

770
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,359
I am…

771
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,112
I am not fair, nor can I be.

772
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,947
All I can do is to give

773
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:20,742
the appropriate punishment
to those who have sinned.

774
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:24,829
So I can't help
but have hope for your team.

775
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:30,627
You are the only Reapers
who can save those in pain.

776
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:36,007
I don't know if I'm even helping.

777
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,468
At first, I thought that if I held on,

778
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:41,304
I could go back to my own body.

779
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:42,430
But…

780
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:46,184
Now that I've actually seen
people on the edge…

781
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:47,894
It's like a tunnel

782
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:49,395
with no end.

783
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,648
I just can't escape!

784
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,149
There's no end in sight.

785
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:55,443
I feel like trash.

786
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:57,528
How come I'm the only one
who can't make it?

787
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,155
Please, let go of me!

788
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,200
I don't think I realized
how hard this job is.

789
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:04,619
I think

790
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:07,955
this job is difficult and a lot to bear.

791
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:08,873
Yes.

792
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:11,376
It's not an easy job
to change the minds of those

793
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,461
who are so close to the edge
that they're thinking of dying.

794
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:18,966
But if you help each other
in your shortcomings and work together--

795
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,052
Then give me this too.

796
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:23,554
You know, the thing Ms. Koo
and Mr. Lim have.

797
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:24,681
Why can't I have it?

798
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:27,058
-No.
-Why?

799
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:29,102
Come back after you die.
Then I'll think about it.

800
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,020
But…

801
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:35,900
You know that I already half-died

802
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:39,028
that day on Dongjak Bridge.

803
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,996
EPILOGUE

804
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:54,419
No. It's not like I have anyone
to look at the picture.

805
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:56,254
No, it's because I want to have it.

806
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:58,005
We made it all the way here, please?

807
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:58,965
Still…

808
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:02,260
Nope, no "still." Let's go in.

809
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:03,928
Hello!

810
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:10,768
If you could sit up
a little straighter, sir.

811
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:11,853
Wait.

812
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,399
Just a bit here.

813
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:18,109
There we go. Smile. Sir.

814
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:19,944
Yes, that's it. Good.

815
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,114
He's a Person of Distinguished Service,
you know.

816
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:25,867
Goodness, thank you for your service.
I'll do my best!

817
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:27,952
Thank you.

818
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:32,498
Now, eyes open wide.

819
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:35,334
Put on a handsome smile.
We'll take the picture now.

820
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,879
One, two, three.

821
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:20,880
Finding a risk case with just two team
members is impossible.

822
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,048
You saw it yourself.

823
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:24,175
How serious the entire situation
is at Jumadeung.

824
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:27,553
They say to some,
an emergency is a chance.

825
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:31,140
If faking a position is too hard,
can't we go in as a part-timer?

826
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:33,184
I'll look for people born in April.

827
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:35,144
Jeong Bo-ram. Stop stuffing your face.

828
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,229
Kim Yong-jun.

829
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,188
I'm sorry.

830
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:38,147
Shin Ye-na.

831
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:39,941
Lee Dong-ja.

832
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:42,026
This is why working moms can't cut it.

833
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:43,152
It's these four people.

834
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:45,404
Can we find them before it's fixed?

835
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,823
We have to find them.

836
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:50,159
If something were to happen,
it'll probably be today.

837
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:53,788
