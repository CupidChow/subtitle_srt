EPISODE 5: TREE 2

2
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,260
Why do you have such a look on your face?

3
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:55,346
Surely it is not because
you don't wish to marry me?

4
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,765
No.

5
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,016
Then why…

6
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,644
I regret the choice I have made.

7
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:02,771
What do you mean?

8
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,273
As a military officer,
my life will be spent guarding the border.

9
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,691
How can I leave you behind?

10
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,946
Your dedication is what made me
fall in love with you.

11
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,214
What a lovely shade.

12
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,529
What are you doing?

13
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:57,492
I was wondering how you would look
with red rouge around your eyes.

14
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,036
Please wipe it off.

15
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,791
The red suits you very well.

16
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,052
Why do you look at me with that gaze?

17
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,933
I love you.

18
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,693
MAY THE UNION OF THESE TWO FAMILIES
BECOME A SOURCE OF HAPPINESS

19
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,656
Okay, let's begin.

20
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,745
Relax and think.

21
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,039
Then speak when you want to.

22
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,718
-Here.
-It's here.

23
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,303
Here's the soil.

24
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,305
Now pull it out gently like this.

25
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,223
Good.

26
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,685
Okay.

27
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,229
We just need to do one more.

28
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,188
Okay, there we go.

29
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,023
Push it in.

30
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,025
-Okay.
-Done!

31
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,360
DEAR WOO-JIN,
WITH ALL MY HEART, HAPPY BIRTHDAY

32
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,277
I LOVE YOU
FROM NA-YOUNG

33
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,278
Grow well!

34
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,530
Grow big and pretty, little one!

35
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,284
You can't open your eyes, okay?

36
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,954
One, two, three.

37
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:06,871
Ta-da!

38
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,581
This one's done.

39
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,588
-It's not too hot?
-It's so good.

40
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,634
This is nice.

41
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,010
Yes.

42
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,638
Cheers.

43
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,223
Cheers.

44
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,185
That must have hurt.

45
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:31,771
This?

46
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,691
It doesn't hurt.

47
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,110
Look how much I've gathered.

48
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:39,779
Take that!

49
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:41,781
Let's go!

50
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,743
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

51
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,460
-What?
-It's snowing.

52
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,045
It is.

53
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,506
-How pretty.
-So pretty.

54
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,661
-Woo-jin.
-Yes?

55
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,457
There's this saying
in this drama that I like.

56
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,833
When people enter their 30s,

57
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,294
they become trees.

58
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,339
-Trees?
-Yes. Trees.

59
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,676
The important thing is
who makes the flowers on the tree bloom.

60
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:48,639
Meaning your life can change
depending on who you meet.

61
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,602
What does that mean?

62
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,578
What is this?

63
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,496
So…

64
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,207
So what I'm saying is…

65
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:20,171
can I be the one to make
the flowers on your tree bloom?

66
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,801
I'll water it really well
and give it plenty of sunlight.

67
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,221
I'm confident that I can help it grow

68
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,848
and bloom beautiful flowers.

69
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:36,979
I won't…

70
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,233
ever waver.

71
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,072
-Wait.
-What?

72
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,730
What was that?

73
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,526
What was that? It's so wonderful.

74
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:30,992
My answer.

75
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,126
Thank you, Na-young.

76
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,336
Thank you even more.

77
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,807
I can drive, really.

78
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,392
Whatever.

79
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,436
You stayed up all night songwriting.

80
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,397
Come on. Get some sleep.

81
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,901
When you wake up,

82
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,195
the sea will be right in front of you.

83
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,450
When the song is finished,
you'll be the first one to hear it.

84
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,035
Really? You promise?

85
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,579
-I promise.
-That's a promise.

86
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,233
Time's up, right?

87
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,068
Mr. Kang Woo-jin.

88
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,696
Leave the thing in your pocket.

89
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,533
I don't know what you mean.

90
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,922
Do you think this will help you
meet someone dead?

91
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,050
What do you know?

92
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,388
What on earth am I supposed to do, then?

93
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,597
Cheer up?

94
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,226
I have to live my life well
if I don't want Na-young to be sad?

95
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,811
It's all bullshit.

96
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,020
Mr. Kang Woo-jin.

97
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,772
You don't know

98
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,483
what this pain is like!

99
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,902
You can't even imagine it.

100
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:33,948
Never mind, then.

101
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,951
There are plenty of ways to die.

102
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,661
Okay.

103
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,001
It's up to you later if you die or not.

104
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,795
You're right.

105
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,840
How can anyone know when they've never
gone through it themselves?

106
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,633
Everyone just pretends to understand.

107
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,720
Saying it must have been difficult,
it must have hurt.

108
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,141
But that's not what I want to know.

109
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:05,688
There's another reason, isn't there?
Why you've unraveled to this extent.

110
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,654
Because I killed her.

111
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,782
I've killed Na-young.

112
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,869
I killed her!

113
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,337
PSYCHIATRY
KOO RYEON, M.D.

114
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,089
KANG WOO-JIN, AGE 29
SINGER-SONGWRITER

115
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,097
I don't think Kang Woo-jin
will be an easy case.

116
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,599
Did you find Heo Na-young?

117
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,893
Yes. We're with her
in Kang Woo-jin's apartment.

118
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,103
Hold on to her. I'll head over there.

119
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,493
Please, help me.

120
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,954
I'm begging you.

121
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,375
Come on, how can you be so heartless?

122
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,044
How can she go
when her husband wants to die?

123
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,921
I wouldn't if I were her either.

124
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,172
Mr. Choi.

125
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,298
Now is not the time.

126
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,009
I can save Woo-jin.

127
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:18,969
Let me save him.

128
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,013
Can you take full responsibility for that?

129
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,557
-Yes.
-If something goes wrong,

130
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,725
Woo-jin will die.

131
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,061
I can do it.

132
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,772
Seeing you might make him worse.

133
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,107
That's impossible.

134
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,318
Kang Woo-jin said he killed you.

135
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,198
There must be another reason
why Kang Woo-jin is like this.

136
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,497
Ms. Heo, I think you'll have
to explain things to us in more detail.

137
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,583
It'll help us in saving Mr. Kang.

138
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,546
Ma'am, unwelcome guests are on their way.

139
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,675
Well.

140
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,137
What?

141
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,806
Would you look at that?

142
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,475
I told you something was off
right around here.

143
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,729
Hey, there. Hand over the runaway soul
and let's get on with our own jobs.

144
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,148
We're all busy people.

145
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,692
"Hey, there"?

146
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,861
I don't see a "Hey" or a "There" here.

147
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,196
-Mr. Lim.
-Yes, ma'am.

148
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,865
-Can you hold them off?
-Of course.

149
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,284
Why? Are you going to fight?
Can't we talk this out?

150
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,035
Stay back, Mr. Choi.

151
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,996
Go on, ma'am. Quickly.

152
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,664
-Will he be okay?
-Don't worry.

153
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:29,623
I'll see you later.

154
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,596
Long time no see, Ryung-gu.
Fancy seeing you here.

155
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,680
Ryung-gu?

156
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,058
I'm an assistant manager
and you're senior staff, Mr. Lee.

157
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,894
Please address me as your senior.
I'm offended.

158
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,021
We entered the company
at the same time. Piss off.

159
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,524
-Get him.
-I don't think you want to do that.

160
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,692
What? Why?

161
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,027
You must have forgotten

162
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,279
that I used to work at the Book of
the Deceased Management Team.

163
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,033
I think it was about 80 years ago.

164
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,534
We told you to reap the souls of
the pro-Japanese collaborators,

165
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,995
but you brought the souls of those
in the Independence Army instead.

166
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,247
Thanks to me secretly helping you,
the mistake was fixed.

167
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,750
But it was a disastrous mistake,
nonetheless.

168
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,709
You little…

169
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,258
Damn it!

170
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,384
Come on, let go.

171
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,178
Ryung-gu!

172
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,263
We got an earful
because of the runaway soul.

173
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,389
Don't you feel sorry for us?

174
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,059
-Not at all.
-Not at all…

175
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,060
Hey.

176
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,645
Attack all at once.

177
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:35,898
My ear, ouch, my ear.

178
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,595
Get in, quickly!

179
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,013
Let's get in.

180
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,432
Quickly. Thank you.

181
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,736
What's up with the car?

182
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,862
It's a company car.

183
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:24,905
I asked for backup.

184
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,157
Because of this.

185
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,368
If you're tired, I can drive.

186
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,036
Let me just ask you right now.

187
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,831
Why does Kang Woo-jin think he killed you?

188
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,543
The day Woo-jin was born…

189
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,130
was the day his mother died.

190
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,479
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
KANG WOO-JIN

191
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,442
Why should we celebrate the day

192
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,445
you killed your mother?

193
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,867
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
SUNSHINE CLASS KANG WOO-JIN

194
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,036
Damn you!

195
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,457
Ji-yeon wouldn't have died like that
if it weren't for you.

196
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,625
Dad.

197
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,627
You killed her.

198
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,295
You did!

199
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,757
Honey.

200
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,220
Ji-yeon!

201
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,597
DECEASED
KANG JONG-SEOK

202
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,640
It's suicide, right?

203
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,058
Yes.

204
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,188
His mother died giving birth to him
and his father killed himself.

205
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,317
Poor thing.

206
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:47,363
Are they going to send him
to an orphanage?

207
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,167
I'm sorry I'm late.
I'm your uncle, Woo-jin.

208
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,672
Yes. Let your uncle
take care of things here.

209
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:08,342
You haven't eaten yet, have you?
Let's go eat with Auntie, okay?

210
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:09,927
Don't worry.

211
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,888
You're going to live with us from now on.

212
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:15,766
This is your room.

213
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,869
Eat up.

214
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,121
Eat up.

215
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:38,956
That's a good boy.

216
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,167
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

217
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,878
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

218
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,965
-Happy birthday, dear Woo-jin.
-Happy birthday, dear Woo-jin.

219
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,010
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

220
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,345
Make a wish.

221
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,685
Good job!

222
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,604
Shall we take a picture together?

223
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,731
-Yes.
-Okay.

224
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,232
-That'll be nice.
-Here we go.

225
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,943
Everyone together.

226
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,528
One, two, three.

227
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,498
Mom.

228
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,751
Dad.

229
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:29,840
Sis?

230
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,236
That must have been so difficult for him.

231
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,491
I can't imagine how he got through that.

232
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,346
It's my fault.

233
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,933
It's my fault.

234
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,978
It's my fault.

235
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,191
It's my fault.

236
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,071
You don't have to look so hard
for a way to live.

237
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:37,032
When the time is right, it'll come to you.

238
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:41,370
Caller 3328 says, "The sun will shine
on the spot they left behind."

239
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,747
And Caller 2142 says,

240
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,460
"The most important thing from now on
is that you try to love yourself

241
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,796
even more than that person who loved you."

242
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:55,175
We're getting more texts
for Caller 0514 even now.

243
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,177
You're still listening, right?

244
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,096
In that case, instead of words,

245
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,807
I'll play a song for you, Caller 0514,

246
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,226
that encapsulates
what everyone is writing to you.

247
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:10,023
Do you feel all alone?

248
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:17,322
Are you crying?

249
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,246
Then close your eyes

250
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:31,336
The blue skies will come to you

251
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:38,677
Have you lost your way?

252
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:45,267
Are you scared of the darkness?

253
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:51,231
Then close both your eyes

254
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,983
Hold my hand

255
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,068
You'll see the light

256
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,237
He said it felt like the song on the radio

257
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,532
was telling him not to do it.

258
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,425
Excuse me.

259
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:19,885
Could…

260
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,347
Could you teach me how to play the guitar?

261
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,921
Music was Woo-jin's only hope.

262
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,424
But now with his hand wounded…

263
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,054
He has nothing left.

264
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,477
When was your wedding?

265
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,773
We never…

266
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,234
had the ceremony.

267
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,074
Dad, you wanted to meet Woo-jin.

268
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,617
So how is he?

269
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,245
He's great and good-looking too.

270
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,707
So, you're a musician?

271
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,752
-Yes, sir.
-I see.

272
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,881
I used to play the drums when I was young.

273
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,050
I completely forgot about that
because of work.

274
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,218
Is that true?

275
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,803
But why did you stop?

276
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,930
Music doesn't put food
on the table when you have a family.

277
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,850
It's just something you do
when you're young and immature.

278
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,268
Don't you agree?

279
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,146
Yes, sir…

280
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,440
Leave music

281
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,483
as a hobby.

282
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,152
Dad!

283
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,085
Dad.

284
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,503
How could you say that?

285
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,340
You might be happy now,
but it's just for a moment.

286
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,549
Reality is different!

287
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:26,595
I just wanted to see what he was like,
but a no is a no.

288
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,888
An unknown singer?

289
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,431
How embarrassing.

290
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,309
Do you think I had you do ballet
so you could end up with someone like him?

291
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,268
Mom!

292
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,330
Why didn't you pick up?

293
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,210
I left my parents' house.

294
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,419
I'll just live with you.

295
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,844
Grow up.

296
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,305
How can you live with me?

297
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,225
What?

298
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:17,395
You'll only be miserable being with me.
That's how it's always been.

299
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,564
What are you saying?

300
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,151
Are you breaking up with me?

301
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,532
-Yes.
-Why are you doing this, Woo-jin?

302
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,077
Woo-jin, no. I can't.

303
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,079
I can't live without you. Why are you…

304
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,289
-Go.
-Woo-jin. Why are you doing this?

305
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,707
Please, just go!

306
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,751
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

307
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:40,752
Woo-jin.

308
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,504
Woo-jin.

309
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,383
Woo-jin, open the door.
Why are you doing this?

310
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,176
Woo-jin.

311
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,886
Why are you still here?

312
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,306
Woo-jin, I can't.

313
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,351
I can't live without you.

314
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,897
What are you doing here?

315
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,194
Can't you just stop thinking
about everything…

316
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,866
and just tell me you want to be with me?

317
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,290
Can't you?

318
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,754
I really can't live without you.

319
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,011
I can't, Woo-jin.

320
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,189
I'm sorry, Na-young.

321
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,818
I lied.

322
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,030
I'm sorry.

323
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,366
I'm sorry.

324
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,459
YEONHWA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

325
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,843
PATIENT STATUS
KANG ***-JIN, M/29

326
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,143
Woo-jin isn't here.

327
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,438
What if he's gone to try and kill himself?

328
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,565
Ms. Heo, he's probably okay.

329
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,984
Let's look for him.

330
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,670
Ma'am.

331
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,340
Ms. Heo. Let's go, hurry.

332
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,590
I don't see Heo Na-young.

333
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,884
What? Where did she go?

334
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:16,843
She was right here!

335
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,054
Find her.

336
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,294
Please, don't kill me.

337
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,299
Why is an already dead person
asking me to not kill them?

338
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,177
Your life has already ended.

339
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,138
Please.

340
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:03,848
Please…

341
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:05,767
I'll escort you

342
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,603
to the afterlife myself.

343
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:12,774
I'm sorry I'm late.

344
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,277
Get out of my way.

345
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,113
I can't, not yet. I'm sorry, sir.

346
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,076
Ryeon brought you to Jumadeung.

347
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,247
She spoke highly of your talents.

348
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,167
I didn't oppose her then.

349
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:35,797
But to think there would come a day
when you dared to defy me like this.

350
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,049
I'll buy us some time.

351
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,804
I'll be punished anyway.
I might as well make sure this ends well.

352
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:07,912
FUNERAL HALL

353
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,379
Ms. Heo.

354
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,630
Mr. Choi!

355
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,675
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you!

356
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,052
Something's happened. Mr. Lim…

357
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:24,763
Where?

358
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,389
Over there…

359
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:28,933
Jeez.

360
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,769
FUNERAL HALL

361
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,558
You're gravely mistaken

362
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,311
if you think this is the only price
you'll pay for hiding a runaway soul.

363
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,395
Don't you agree…

364
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,482
Ms. Koo?

365
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,525
Let go of him.

366
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,946
His team manager is without her abilities.

367
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,989
He was only following my orders.

368
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,582
Mr. Lim! Mr. Lim, are you okay?

369
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,875
It's bearable.

370
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:43,299
From now on, the RM team
will handle the soul, Heo Na-young.

371
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,054
-You cannot.
-No.

372
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:51,307
If you take her, I'll file an appeal
of how you obstructed the RM Team's work.

373
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,351
Obstruction of work…

374
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,604
Who is getting in the way?

375
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:01,150
Don't you know harboring
a runaway soul is a far greater crime?

376
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,446
A Reaper's Guarantee of Responsibility.

377
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,117
Would that do?

378
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,578
Ma'am!

379
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:17,375
A Reaper's Guarantee of Responsibility…
All to save a single suicide risk case?

380
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:22,046
Under the condition that she doesn't
leave the hospital for the next 12 hours.

381
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,840
No, I'll give you two hours.

382
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,303
Fine.

383
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,933
If that's what you want,
I'll accept your conditions.

384
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,853
Ma'am, you can't!

385
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,022
Why? What is it?

386
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,774
What's a Reaper's Guarantee
of Responsibility?

387
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,737
It's a contract
where the Reaper who receives help

388
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,032
must do whatever the Reaper,
who is helping, demands.

389
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,493
They can't refuse

390
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,371
or run away.

391
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,960
I hope this is worth it.

392
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:15,725
A REAPER'S GUARANTEE OF RESPONSIBILITY

393
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:16,643
KOO RYEON
PARK JUNG-GIL

394
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:31,407
Ma'am, a Reaper's Guarantee
isn't even protected by the Company.

395
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,826
Not even the Director
and her powers can void it!

396
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,371
What's the reason for doing all this?

397
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,289
Who knows what he'll demand in return?

398
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,876
What? Didn't you just call me heartless
and ask me to help Heo Na-young?

399
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,170
Why are you doing all this?

400
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,714
Because we need to save Kang Woo-jin.

401
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:49,676
Even so…

402
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,971
Mr. Lim. You said you don't want
the Risk Management Team dissolved?

403
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,767
Choi Jun-woong, what does our team do?

404
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,771
Save suicide risk cases.

405
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,357
Yes. So let's go find Kang Woo-jin.

406
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:05,942
Okay.

407
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:13,408
FLU! TAKE THE VACCINE TO COMBAT THE VIRUS

408
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,748
-Excuse me, have you seen this person?
-No, I haven't.

409
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,874
-No?
-No.

410
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:22,834
I'll go this way.

411
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,463
Sorry.

412
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:29,674
KANG WOO-JIN, AGE 29
SINGER-SONGWRITER

413
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,592
Excuse me, have you seen this person?

414
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,552
No.

415
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,886
No?

416
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,805
Damn, what do I do?

417
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:00,913
Woo-jin.

418
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,365
Na-young…

419
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:41,537
Na-young, Na-young.

420
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,293
You…

421
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,504
How dare you come here?

422
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:53,049
Na-young! How could you
leave your mother behind?

423
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,801
Just let me say goodbye to her.

424
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,553
You killed her, didn't you?

425
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,263
My Na-young.

426
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,057
You killed my daughter.

427
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,018
You killed my daughter, didn't you?

428
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,311
Answer me!

429
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,979
Why did it have to be my daughter?

430
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,565
How could you leave your mother behind?

431
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,484
Don't you ever forget it.

432
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,611
You killed Na-young!

433
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,739
You killed her!

434
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,366
You're right.

435
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,618
I killed her.

436
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:23,996
You bastard!

437
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,125
-Bring back my daughter!
-I killed her.

438
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,252
I…

439
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:30,753
I killed her.

440
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:32,880
I killed her.

441
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,691
Damn it, where the hell is he?

442
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,694
KANG WOO-JIN, AGE 29
SINGER-SONGWRITER

443
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,590
Ji-yeon wouldn't have died like that
if it weren't for you.

444
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,757
Dad.

445
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,718
You killed her.

446
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:19,760
You did!

447
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,272
It's suicide, right?

448
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,690
Yes.

449
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:36,110
His mother died giving birth to him
and his father killed himself.

450
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,372
It's my fault.

451
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,333
It's my fault.

452
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,544
It's my fault.

453
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,473
YEONHWA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

454
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:10,811
WE MAKE A HEALTHY HOSPITAL
FREE FROM VIOLENCE!

455
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,609
You killed her, didn't you? My Na-young.

456
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,444
You killed my daughter.

457
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,404
You bastard.

458
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,867
You worthless piece of shit!

459
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,995
I can drive, really.

460
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,559
Kang Woo-jin!

461
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:53,980
I told you.

462
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,940
Even if you die like that--

463
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:56,983
What do you know?

464
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,320
Do you know how hellish it is
to be alive and breathing?

465
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,031
What it feels like to lose everything?

466
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,501
I know.

467
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,129
MAY THE UNION OF THESE TWO FAMILIES
BECOME A SOURCE OF HAPPINESS

468
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,506
How it feels like your heart
is so tattered,

469
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,383
there is nothing more to be torn.

470
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,557
How no matter how much time passes,

471
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:35,646
you can't seem to forget,
and the memories just become clearer.

472
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,072
Woo-jin.

473
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,910
It's just as painful for the dead.

474
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,207
So get it together, Kang Woo-jin.

475
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,418
If you die like this,

476
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,504
even if an eternity passes,
you'll never meet Heo Na-young again.

477
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,798
-Never.
-Shut up.

478
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,509
Heo Na-young is dead and you are alive.

479
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,928
-Accept it.
-Why?

480
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,723
Why do I have to accept it? Why?

481
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,062
I killed Na-young.

482
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,230
I hate myself…

483
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,108
so much.

484
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,906
I'm a monster.
I should never have been born.

485
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,699
So why should I accept it? Why?

486
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,828
Because you survived.

487
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,541
Because Heo Na-young saved you.

488
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,586
Woo-jin…

489
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,507
Before a car crash, people instinctively
turn the wheel to their side.

490
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:50,388
But Heo Na-young swerved to
your side to save you.

491
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:05,277
Why?

492
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:07,863
I'm nothing…

493
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,867
Why would she do that for me?

494
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,578
Because she cared about you.

495
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:17,748
Because she cared about you
more than she did for herself.

496
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,626
So she saved you.

497
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:28,634
Na-young.

498
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:30,845
Woo-jin.

499
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,932
Woo-jin!

500
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,361
Let go.

501
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:49,989
Please, let go of me!

502
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,825
Just let me die, please.

503
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,368
Woo-jin, no.

504
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,915
At this rate, Kang Woo-jin will die.

505
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,127
I'm holding you to what you said before.

506
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,087
Yes.

507
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,464
Save him.

508
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:10,092
I'll make sure you two meet again.

509
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,511
Yes.

510
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,721
-Na-young.
-Woo-jin.

511
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,434
That day.

512
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,978
I should have been the one to drive.

513
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,523
I shouldn't have let you go like that.

514
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,692
It's all my fault. If it weren't for me…

515
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,907
Oh no…

516
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,910
It must have hurt so much.

517
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,706
You shouldn't have met me…

518
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,085
It's all my fault.

519
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,046
No.

520
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,506
Woo-jin.

521
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,800
The happiest moments in my life

522
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:36,887
all came after I met you.

523
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,433
I wouldn't have been on this earth
if I hadn't met you.

524
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,102
You saved me that day, you know?

525
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,145
This time, I'll save you.

526
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,982
So please, live.

527
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:52,319
Let me go knowing that you'll be okay.
Will you do that?

528
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:53,862
How…

529
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,699
How am I supposed to live by myself?

530
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,742
You won't be alone.

531
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,035
We'll be waiting together.

532
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,080
No.

533
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,583
No, Na-young, please.

534
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,960
Woo-jin, look at me.

535
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,587
We don't have much time.

536
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:14,341
You'll wait for me there,
and I'll wait for you here.

537
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,594
And when we meet again

538
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,598
I want you to bring me
the most beautiful flower

539
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,100
from your tree.

540
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,102
Can you do that?

541
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:31,984
Okay.

542
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,946
Don't cry too much,

543
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,616
and let's be brave and wait, okay?

544
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,995
No matter how long I have to wait,

545
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,624
I'll only ever love you.

546
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,502
Yes.

547
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,420
Me too.

548
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,215
Live fully, for both of us.

549
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,676
Okay.

550
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:01,847
I'll live a full life

551
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,725
for both of us.

552
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:08,896
What a nice husband you are.

553
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,370
KANG WOO-JIN, AGE 29
SINGER-SONGWRITER

554
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,426
Ma'am?

555
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,638
Ma'am!

556
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:25,639
Ma'am!

557
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:28,267
Ma'am, Ms. Koo.

558
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,981
Ms. Koo! Ma'am!

559
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:43,115
If it weren't for the RM Team…

560
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:45,951
You guys saved both of us, me and Woo-jin.

561
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,829
It's nothing.

562
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:52,249
Thanks to you, I can go now,
knowing he'll be okay.

563
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,002
Have a safe trip.

564
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:55,961
Okay.

565
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,599
Thank you.

566
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,654
I think there's something in my eyes.

567
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,536
They'll meet again one day.

568
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,461
Are you crying?

569
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,048
No.

570
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,259
-You are.
-I'm not crying!

571
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:45,969
Okay, then.

572
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:57,439
You came to me in silence

573
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:03,403
And cried for a long while
Before saying to me

574
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:08,200
"Farewell"

575
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:14,790
"Let's stop this now"

576
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:22,422
Numb, I looked back

577
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:28,262
Drawing the us of yesterday

578
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,683
But when I came back

579
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:39,147
You were gone

580
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:44,736
Tell me it's not true

581
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:51,076
Tell me you'll be back

582
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,081
I hoped that

583
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,501
Our radiance

584
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:05,632
Would turn
Into a flower that never withers

585
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,065
I got the report.

586
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,109
I heard there was some friction
between your team and Ryeon's.

587
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,986
She obstructed
the work of the Escort Team.

588
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,238
It's important to follow the rules,

589
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,866
but don't you think
you could have been more flexible?

590
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,784
All souls have stories.

591
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,328
Why should they be an exception?

592
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:37,372
This case didn't require your presence,

593
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,583
so why did you choose to go?

594
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:43,462
I wanted to see for myself
the people they were trying to save.

595
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:44,921
Is that so?

596
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,591
So what do you think?

597
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:51,970
I despise them more than ever.

598
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:54,806
Why do you think so?

599
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,351
I can't understand
why they choose death so easily,

600
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,978
when it only takes a few words

601
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,689
to give them the will to live again.

602
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,359
Think of how they must be feeling
to choose death

603
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,694
because no one ever said
those few words to them.

604
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:09,863
I can guarantee you

605
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:14,785
that there isn't anyone anywhere
who chooses death easily.

606
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:25,796
Ha Dae-su, the head of Hell,
has filed a complaint again.

607
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:28,256
He begged us to reduce
the number of souls in Hell.

608
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,385
First, the afterlife is bursting
with souls, and now Hell…

609
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:36,598
So I've had this plan in mind
for a long while.

610
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:39,893
We can't ignore the fact

611
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,688
that a significant number
of suicide cases enter Hell.

612
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:46,525
So what if we reduce that number by
preventing the suicides of these people?

613
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:49,986
No. Those people
have already missed their chance.

614
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,989
Why should we give them
another chance at life?

615
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,825
By stopping their death,

616
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,993
they live out the lifespan
they were given.

617
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,788
Wouldn't that help restore the balance

618
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,833
between the afterlife and Hell?

619
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:03,792
We can't do that.

620
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:10,924
Now, now. The "Risk Management Team,"
as I've named it for now,

621
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:12,509
will be run by a few selected Reapers.

622
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:15,178
If it works, we'll add more people.

623
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,431
If it doesn't,
you'll get your way, of course,

624
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,099
and the team will be dissolved.

625
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,726
Who do you plan on having
to manage the team?

626
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:24,688
I have a candidate in mind
for the team manager position.

627
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,567
I heard there's a Reaper who specializes

628
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,486
in escorting the souls of criminals
from the Land of the Living.

629
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,614
I've heard she's one of the best
in the Escort Team.

630
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,201
You don't mean…

631
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:42,956
Yes.

632
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:44,833
Koo Ryeon.

633
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,304
You haven't forgotten your pledge,
have you?

634
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,641
How will you have me fulfill it?

635
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,770
I can use it on whatever I want.

636
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,647
Are you sure you can handle it?

637
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,842
What are you doing?

638
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,677
You're just in time.

639
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,347
I'm writing the disciplinary report.
Come and help me with the ink.

640
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,474
What is this, Joseon Dynasty?

641
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,392
Who writes disciplinary reports
with a brush?

642
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,269
The Director is very old-fashioned.

643
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:49,231
She says you need to write it by hand
to show that you really mean it.

644
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,655
WITH ALL MY SINCERITY, I WRITE

645
00:51:58,615 --> 00:51:59,491
Ma'am.

646
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:00,575
What?

647
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,285
Can I ask you something?

648
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,705
What crime did Mr. Kang Woo-jin
commit in his past life

649
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:08,792
that he lost so many loved ones?

650
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:12,003
One's karma from the past life
has nothing to do with people's deaths.

651
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,130
Then is it because of fate?

652
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,299
THIS REFLECTION IS WITH ALL MY HEART

653
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:17,926
It's not fate either.

654
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:22,305
A person's lifespan is decided
by when they'll die of natural causes.

655
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,474
There is such a thing as fate,

656
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,227
but it's entangled in a complicated
web of cause-and-effect.

657
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:30,272
And there are countless choices
and results that follow them.

658
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,650
I SHALL GO FORTH WITH
A CLEAN AND PURE HEART

659
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,862
As for the truck driver
who caused the accident,

660
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:40,156
if it hadn't been for the company
that made him work non-stop,

661
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:45,036
and pressured him to work faster
to the point he hadn't slept in days

662
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,414
then he wouldn't have
dozed off at the wheel.

663
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:51,418
Then Ms. Heo could have lived out
the years she was supposed to have.

664
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,380
So other than natural causes,

665
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:59,301
deaths are caused by a myriad of
outside factors like crimes or accidents,

666
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:03,054
not karmic debt incurred
in people's past lives or fate.

667
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,559
So Mr. Kang Woo-jin…

668
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,102
AND CONTINUE THIS NEWFOUND PURITY

669
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:12,647
It was a series of coincidences.

670
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,357
But the good thing is,

671
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,360
no matter how many times
those two are reborn,

672
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,155
they will meet again in the end.

673
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,534
Is that what you call destiny?

674
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:28,371
People who are destined
to be with each other are connected

675
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,666
by a red thread beyond their souls.

676
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,504
Unless they break that thread themselves,

677
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:41,051
they will meet that person again,
no matter how many times you are reborn.

678
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,719
By breaking the thread themselves…

679
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:45,972
do you mean suicide?

680
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:51,770
Yes.

681
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:55,815
They are punished
by severing those tied to them

682
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,610
by destiny.

683
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:01,696
That seems harsh.

684
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:05,533
To lose all of the ties to the people
who were supposed to be in your life,

685
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,702
and never see them again,
even in your next life.

686
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,208
You've seen it for yourself,

687
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,460
but it's not sad only
to the person left behind.

688
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:17,504
It's the same for those who leave.

689
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:20,340
WITH WHAT HAS BEEN ENTRUSTED TO ME

690
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,176
So…

691
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:27,389
I believe you must love and care
for those who are around you

692
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,808
during your short stay
in the Land of the Living

693
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,813
as someone who has a tomorrow to live.

694
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:41,277
KOO RYEON

695
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:52,122
I think I've been taking this
too simply until now.

696
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,792
How have the two of you
been able to do this all this time?

697
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:59,671
It's painful, even when I tell myself that
it has nothing to do with me.

698
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:02,465
Have you gotten used to it?

699
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:07,178
No.

700
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:11,474
Even after centuries,
I still hate to see people

701
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,561
torn apart by death,

702
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,064
and in so much pain.

703
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,586
EPILOGUE

704
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:46,718
I still draw you in my mind

705
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:53,641
The way your eyes looked
When they looked back at me

706
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:57,812
Even as I try to erase it

707
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:04,402
It only deepens even more

708
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:11,993
When you cried as you left me,

709
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:18,041
I realized this summer was over

710
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:24,047
You know

711
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:31,012
How I feel

712
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:35,350
Tell me it isn't true

713
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:41,397
Tell me you'll come back

714
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:46,361
I hoped that

715
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:49,781
Our radiance

716
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:54,994
Would turn
Into a flower that never withers

717
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,625
Tell me it isn't true

718
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:08,007
Tell me you'll come back

719
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:11,386
I dream that

720
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:14,848
We, so dazzling,

721
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:19,435
Become a blossom that never withers

722
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:25,483
Become a blossom that never withers

723
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,654
Tell me

724
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:38,455
Tell me

725
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:52,218
I'm waiting for you

726
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:56,347
There

727
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:02,437
Forever

728
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,194
I'm waiting for you

729
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:12,489
At home, all alone.

730
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,657
I'm there in that spot

731
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:18,786
Waiting for you

732
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,206
I'm waiting for you

733
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:25,710
At home, all alone

734
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,342
Thank you.

735
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:13,508
Lee Young-chun. Age 91.
A senior citizen living alone.

736
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,593
Are you really a Grim Reaper?

737
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:20,306
Don't you want to spend your last day
in a meaningful way?

738
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,849
Why don't you stick to what you can do?

739
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,643
Instead of holding on to something
you can't do.

740
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,645
I keep regretting the choice
I made that day.

741
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:30,483
No one can be special before death.
Nor should they be special.

742
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,485
Don't ever show yourself
in front of me again!

743
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:35,655
You expect me to just stand by and watch
when he's in that much pain?

744
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:38,283
What can you do when you can't even watch

745
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,242
his last moment?

746
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,535
Please.

747
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:44,622
