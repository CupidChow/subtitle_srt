1
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,304
I found them.

2
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,223
That’s a relief.

3
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,684
I went to the Tech Support Team
and pulled some strings to get their help.

4
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,774
YOON JOONG-IL, AGE 43

5
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:48,691
CHO SU-JIN, AGE 21

6
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:49,609
KANG HO-IL, AGE 34

7
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:50,527
KYEONG MI-RYEO, AGE 19

8
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,738
You got there just in time.
Otherwise, it would have been too late.

9
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,241
They're very well prepared.

10
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:57,826
How did they meet?

11
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,412
I WISH SOMEONE WOULD JUST KILL ME

12
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,164
SUICIDE PACT

13
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,916
I think they met through a broker.

14
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,544
-What?
-They post on social media saying

15
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,921
they'll teach them a surefire
and painless method

16
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,339
and recruit people.

17
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,427
I think they told them
how to commit suicide

18
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,929
by breathing in the car exhaust.

19
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,852
Do take care.

20
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,061
That's unlike you.

21
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,896
To worry about me like that.

22
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,317
Not you.

23
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,319
I'm talking about the people there.

24
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,024
Who…

25
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,191
Who are you?

26
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,677
Are you okay?

27
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,679
What? Where are we going?

28
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,473
This isn't what we were promised!

29
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,641
Who is that woman?

30
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,314
Wait.

31
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,329
That way!

32
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,586
-Help! I'm sorry!
-Help!

33
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,296
-Help! I'm sorry!
-What's with you all?

34
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,840
Didn't you guys get together to die?

35
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:21,886
-No.
-No.

36
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,096
-No.
-No.

37
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,847
-No.
-No.

38
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,809
I really want to live. Please let me live.

39
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:28,726
Please let me live.

40
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,065
Stop, please.

41
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,692
Please.

42
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:37,568
All humans…

43
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,572
are faced with choices.

44
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,454
And…

45
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,748
each of those choices

46
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,669
comes with consequences.

47
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,203
Help!

48
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,541
Help! Please, let me live.

49
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,126
Wait!

50
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,295
-Wait!
-Please let me live.

51
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,880
Wait!

52
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,259
Wait.

53
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,719
I'll do anything!

54
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,055
Hey, wait!

55
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,227
Please let me live, please.

56
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,359
So are you saying you want to die or live?

57
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,863
Let me live, please.

58
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,074
-Oh, please let me live.
-Let me live!

59
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:07,784
Let me live!

60
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,374
I'll be a good father!

61
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,835
I'm sorry… Please let me live.

62
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,504
I'll do my best from now on!

63
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,757
I want to go home and apologize.
Please have mercy!

64
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,697
EPISODE 1: FALLEN FLOWER 1

65
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,033
Yes. I'm someone who is like nitrogen.

66
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,952
Although nitrogen was once
considered useless

67
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,662
because it does not react
with most matter,

68
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,413
once it's converted to ammonia,

69
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,416
nitrogen becomes a fertilizer that helps
one-third of the plants on Earth grow.

70
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,543
I…

71
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,587
would like to become someone like nitrogen
here at Tak Fertilizer Company.

72
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:03,840
That's creative, right?

73
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,799
It's good.

74
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:05,842
Yes!

75
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,094
Ms. Tak Ji-hye.

76
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,887
Is there anything you'd like to say
before we end the interview?

77
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:13,349
I…

78
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:17,645
I want to make good fertilizer
and help this company continue on.

79
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,445
I'm telling you, it's real this time.
I'm definitely going to get in!

80
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,238
It's the final interview
with only two people.

81
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,240
Do you really think your son won't get it?

82
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,868
I always have issues
with the application screening process.

83
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,870
But I told you, I'm confident
when it comes to one-on-one interviews!

84
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,915
I'm telling you. My answer was way better!

85
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,167
Goodness!

86
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,210
I thought you didn't have any life plans

87
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,920
since you would never leave your room,

88
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,423
but I guess you're finally becoming
a working member of society.

89
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,384
Okay, good job.

90
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,261
You're coming straight home, right?

91
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,639
I'm going to prepare a feast for you.

92
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,849
A feast may be a bit too much.

93
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:55,892
Mom, can you make galbi-jjim--

94
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,814
Right, I'm working now.

95
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,485
-Here, have some more.
-Thank you!

96
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,736
But we didn't order this.

97
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,904
It's on the house.

98
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,407
I'm having a really great day.

99
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,828
What great weather!

100
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:19,665
Smells great too!
And my workplace right here!

101
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,337
Hello, sir.

102
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,508
I'll dedicate my life to the company! Sir!

103
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,179
TAK

104
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,144
Ms. Tak Ji-hye.

105
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,025
I want to make good fertilizer
and help this company continue on.

106
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,492
Tak…

107
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,370
Chairman Tak Jung-gu.

108
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,331
TAK

109
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,584
Tak Ji-hye.

110
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,712
Tak.

111
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,798
Tak.

112
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:12,677
Tak.

113
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,392
HELLO, MR. CHOI JUN-WOONG
THIS IS TAK FERTILIZER COMPANY

114
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,686
WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU
THAT YOU HAVE NOT PASSED THE INTERVIEW

115
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,187
DESPITE YOUR OUTSTANDING RESUME

116
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,606
If you're sorry, then hire me!

117
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,275
Just hire me!

118
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,652
YOU HAVE NOT PASSED…

119
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,153
WE'RE SORRY TO INFORM YOU…

120
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,154
YOU HAVE NOT PASSED…

121
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,239
WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU…

122
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,366
WE HOPE YOU ACHIEVE YOUR DREAM
THROUGH A BETTER OPPORTUNITY

123
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,161
Seriously!

124
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,790
I never wanted to work here anyway!

125
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,646
Look at you, spending money
when you don't even have a job.

126
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,233
As if you're not broke too,
studying for the civil service exam.

127
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,611
That is why

128
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,779
I only spend money

129
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,823
-when it's a bang for your buck!
-When it's a bang for your buck!

130
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,493
You know what you're talking about.

131
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,496
Are you okay?

132
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,752
Maybe I should have
given up on adding things to my resume

133
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,046
and just prepared for
a public service job like you.

134
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,882
You should have picked up
skills that were actually useful

135
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,300
to include in your resume.

136
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,011
TOEIC, TOEFL,
an internship at a major company,

137
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:40,556
all sorts of volunteer work certificates,
winning contests.

138
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,599
Too typical.

139
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:45,394
Licenses for car maintenance,
pet care, and cooking.

140
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,397
Talents like magic tricks,
singing, acting, and voice impressions.

141
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,732
Blood donation certificates…

142
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,859
-I've given so much blood.
-That's true.

143
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,403
You even changed your religion
since preference was given to Christians.

144
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,405
Amen!

145
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,658
Amen.

146
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,121
INCOMING CALL
MOM

147
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,711
Hey!

148
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,130
Where are you going?

149
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,690
INCOMING CALL
MOM

150
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,775
MISSED CALLS MOM (12)

151
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,447
I'm happy to wake up early!

152
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,783
I'm happy to miss
early morning soccer games!

153
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,786
It can even be Monday every day!

154
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,288
If only I can have an employee ID card.

155
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,878
I really, really can't write
any more cover letters.

156
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:16,652
Why…

157
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,195
Why is he leaning against the railing?

158
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,574
I just had to walk here? Why?

159
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,285
Excuse…

160
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,539
No.

161
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,583
Getting involved
will only cause more problems.

162
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,168
Right, more problems.

163
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,304
Sir, what are you doing?

164
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,597
What? Let go!

165
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,349
Sir, just calm down!

166
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,434
Calm down.

167
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,852
Mind your own business and go!

168
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,688
I can't just go! I've already seen you!

169
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:53,772
My uncle.

170
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,399
You remind me of my uncle, that's why.

171
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,109
I don't have a nephew like you!

172
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,737
Sir, please!

173
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,865
Let go! Why are you doing this
when I'm the one who wants to die?

174
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,202
If you're going to die,
why are you trying to die in front of me?

175
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,996
As if today hasn't been crappy enough!

176
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:14,585
Let me just end the day
on a meaningful note! Please!

177
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,961
Get out of my way!

178
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,464
Sir!

179
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,548
-Sir! Wait!
-Let go!

180
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,549
Hey!

181
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,468
-Come on, please!
-You there!

182
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,065
Move!

183
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,284
I told you to get out of the way.

184
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,799
Let me go.

185
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,554
He's alert,
and his bones aren't fractured.

186
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:08,722
Are you a doctor?

187
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,559
No.

188
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,436
I've been watching medical dramas lately,
so I wanted to try out that line.

189
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,480
It means you're mostly fine, so get up.

190
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,984
Are you kidding me?
What do you mean, mostly fine?

191
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,446
Are you insane?

192
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,199
Why are you trying to dive
into the Han River?

193
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,494
Why are you people doing this?

194
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,038
I'm the one who wants to die!

195
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,999
I can't even die as I wish?

196
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,001
I…

197
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,794
I…

198
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,172
don't have any other option but death!

199
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,013
What changes if you die?

200
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,348
What does that solve?

201
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,476
At least I won't be miserable.

202
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,145
Okay.

203
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,691
Then jump off as you wish.

204
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,609
But…

205
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,696
I can guarantee this.

206
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,867
You'll end up in much more pain than now.

207
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,619
Who are you?

208
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,829
Who are you to say such things to me?

209
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,208
Excuse me!

210
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,796
What is wrong with you people?

211
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,341
You should be trying
to talk him out of jumping!

212
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,550
What are you doing?

213
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,844
This has nothing to do with you.
Just go.

214
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,598
How can I not care?

215
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,975
What are you doing? Get rid of him.

216
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,394
We have a plan,

217
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,355
so mind your own business and go.

218
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,649
No, I can't go!

219
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,733
You know what?

220
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,569
I won't go!

221
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,557
Ma'am?

222
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,726
Go.

223
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,769
Go home.

224
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,105
I'll take care of both of them.

225
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,357
Take care.

226
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,527
This isn't my first time diving in.

227
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,780
I'll contact the Book of the Deceased
Management Team

228
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,782
so that the Escort Team can't swoop in.

229
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,254
How many more times do you think
I'll need to do your tie for you?

230
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,425
I told you, this is the last time.

231
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,676
-Really?
-Yeah.

232
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,219
Are you confident?

233
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,595
What, you don't believe me?

234
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,183
Jun-woong.

235
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,610
My son…

236
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,196
Wake up, come on.

237
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,114
Mom…

238
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,616
-Mom?
-Jun-woong!

239
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,036
Jun-woong!

240
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,594
I…

241
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:35,637
I…

242
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,390
Am I alive?

243
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:41,852
I…

244
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,146
I'm alive?

245
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,858
I'm alive!

246
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,526
I'm alive! Alive!

247
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,694
I'm alive!

248
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,072
Thank you God, thank you Buddha.

249
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:57,034
I promise I'll go to church
and the temple on weekends!

250
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:00,245
Thank you. Thank you for letting me live.

251
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,262
What?

252
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,347
But this is…

253
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,140
Me.

254
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,018
Why are there two of me?

255
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,358
Oh, gosh!

256
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:30,984
What?

257
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:31,902
You.

258
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,695
You were on that bridge.

259
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,573
Why are you here?

260
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,951
Doctor! There's a weird person in here!

261
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:39,868
Be quiet.

262
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,538
Nurse, help…

263
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,919
You're noisy even with your mouth shut.

264
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:53,966
What are you?

265
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,975
I mean…

266
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:06,270
this is the 21st century,
and judging from your outfit

267
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:07,896
and your overall vibe,

268
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,899
you're not like a grim reaper,
or something like--

269
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,234
I am.

270
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,534
Team Manager at Jumadeung
Soul Management Department?

271
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,704
It's just like a regular job.

272
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,539
Regular?

273
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,375
Then,

274
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,793
am I dead?

275
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,003
No.

276
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,130
Then am I dying soon?

277
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,381
No.

278
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,509
Are you going to kill me
by calling my name three times?

279
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,845
Please let me live.

280
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,346
Do you want your mouth shut again?

281
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,767
I'll make it easy for you to understand,
so listen.

282
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,520
The Dongjak Bridge incident
was our responsibility.

283
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,189
Sir, what are you doing?

284
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,732
-What? Let go!
-Sir, just calm down!

285
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,901
-Who is that next to him?
-I'm not sure.

286
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,986
-I can't just go! I've already seen you!
-That day.

287
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,863
The homeless man you saved.

288
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,240
We should have dealt with him already,
but we didn't.

289
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,867
Which resulted in the accident.

290
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,410
-And unfortunately, you got--
-That's right.

291
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,704
What happened to him?

292
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,290
Is he dead? Did he live?

293
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,334
He's alive.

294
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,178
So I'm the only one who died.

295
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,429
You're not dead!

296
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,472
Well, anyway.

297
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,349
You were unexpectedly put into a coma

298
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,351
and will wake up three years later.

299
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,310
Three years?

300
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,730
Why am I waking up three years later? Why…

301
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,569
So this is why
people say never make life plans!

302
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,322
What's the point of a job
when tomorrow isn't guaranteed?

303
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,157
If I knew this would happen,
I would've just lived how I wanted.

304
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,451
The company is handling things
and deciding what to do with you.

305
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,994
-Really?
-Let's go.

306
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,454
-Where?
-Jumadeung.

307
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,081
Why are we going?

308
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,208
The Director is contemplating
what to do with you.

309
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,502
-The Director?
-You'll know when you get there.

310
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,092
You'll need a body too.

311
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,072
Wear that.

312
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,258
Be honest.

313
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,093
You picked this out on purpose, right?

314
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:45,554
Right?

315
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,434
Why aren't you telling me
where we're going?

316
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,730
JUMADEUNG MORTICIAN

317
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,737
Wait for me.

318
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,238
Is this it?

319
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,701
JUMADEUNG MORTICIAN

320
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,373
What is this place?

321
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,723
Hello.

322
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,266
TEAM MANAGER KOO RYEON
JUMADEUNG

323
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:43,695
What is this?

324
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,155
Hey, wait!

325
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,532
-What?
-Wait a minute.

326
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,576
Now that I'm about to go in,

327
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,747
I have this feeling that once I go in,
I'll never be able to come out.

328
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,819
Careful. I won't take
responsibility if you fall.

329
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,655
What happens if I fall?

330
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,615
You go to Hell.

331
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:10,115
Check the file and…

332
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:13,160
Farming… Jumadeung…

333
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,414
You can experience
a happy, enjoyable life.

334
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,336
He's the guy from before…

335
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,715
Yes.

336
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,801
-They're octuplets.
-Octuplets?

337
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,185
Hurry up!

338
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:44,816
Thank you.

339
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,821
-This is…
-The Director's office.

340
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,281
By Director, you mean…

341
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,616
The Jade Emperor.

342
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,993
The Jade Emperor?

343
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:59,581
Does he really have long hair
and wear a white robe?

344
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,168
He also has horns on his head

345
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,587
and enjoys a sauna that uses hellfire.

346
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,173
-Really?
-That's it for me.

347
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,883
Let's never meet again.

348
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,637
Okay. Let's never meet again.

349
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,809
JUMADEUNG

350
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,068
Sir?

351
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,780
The Book of the Deceased
for the Naju Kims ends here.

352
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,657
Come down and take a look at this.

353
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,700
My eyes are so tired
from staring at this all day.

354
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,744
What letter do you think this is?

355
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,121
Hey.

356
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,750
-Oh, hello.
-Vitamin A's good for your eyes.

357
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:44,918
Make sure to take them.

358
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,170
And don't forget to eat breakfast.

359
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,463
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

360
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:49,839
Do a good job.

361
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,300
This is the International Sales Team
of Jumadeung's Korea branch.

362
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,468
How may I help you?

363
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,178
…B2047 aircraft crash…

364
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,972
…Mario Sontichai…

365
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,518
There you are.

366
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,353
Take a minute and drink this.

367
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,188
-Now, drink up.
-Thank you.

368
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,564
-Here.
-Thank you.

369
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,108
Okay.

370
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:11,403
I've been going to the bathroom
more regularly thanks to you.

371
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,570
That's great.

372
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,495
-Here.
-Thank you.

373
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,454
Okay.

374
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,374
Oh, dear.

375
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,210
Did you stay up all night again?

376
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,004
This is great for your liver. Drink up.

377
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,588
This is just what I needed.

378
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,548
Oh, here.

379
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,550
Ta-da!

380
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,718
Same here!

381
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,178
-Drink up.
-Thank you.

382
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,471
-All right, have a good day.
-Thank you.

383
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,308
I never imagined

384
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,310
afterlife to be like this.

385
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,820
The afterlife
isn't all that different, right?

386
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,115
You must have been so stressed
looking for a job.

387
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,491
Drink up.

388
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,997
Thank you.

389
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,998
But ma'am…

390
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:05,999
Ma'am…

391
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,420
-Me?
-Yes, ma'am.

392
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,172
I was curious about something.

393
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,507
What's the Jade Emperor like?

394
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,509
Does he really have horns

395
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,970
and enjoys a sauna that uses hellfire?

396
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,308
I haven't heard that one before.

397
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,851
Really? This?

398
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:28,855
Okay.

399
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,417
Welcome to Jumadeung.

400
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,127
Mr. Choi Jun-woong.

401
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,289
Get lost.

402
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,547
I told you to get lost.

403
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,173
Die, then.

404
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,514
Let go!

405
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,350
Which gang are you from?

406
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,644
-Jumadeung.
-What?

407
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,521
I've never heard of that one.

408
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,862
Foolish until your last moment, huh?

409
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,739
Behave and obey the Reaper.

410
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,918
Am I dead?

411
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,629
Oh, God.

412
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,423
Jesus.

413
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,758
Buddha.

414
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,471
So you're looking for a god now?

415
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,598
There is no god to help you.

416
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,349
The only thing awaiting you

417
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,809
is the pain of Hell.

418
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:39,068
Sung Chi-wook, born 12:04 a.m.
on July 16th, 1984.

419
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,279
This life has been collected.

420
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:42,781
Escort him.

421
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,492
I'll take him to the company.

422
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,328
Sir.

423
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,287
What is it?

424
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,080
An emergency summons
from the board of directors.

425
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,124
The Director is attending as well.

426
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,004
It must be because of that team.

427
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,173
JUMADEUNG TEAM MANAGER MEETING

428
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,800
You think you can do whatever you want.

429
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,676
What's the point of
the Risk Management Team…

430
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,807
when they're killing people
who are still alive?

431
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,893
Right. I told you not to make it.

432
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,062
If the problem is overpopulation
in the afterlife,

433
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,772
just increase the life expectancy…

434
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,650
We just adjusted it to 85
and you already want to change it?

435
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,152
People in the living world
are already going on about

436
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,196
how people live to be 100 now.

437
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,322
Come to think about it,

438
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:28,368
it's ridiculous that someone from Hell
became a part of the company at all.

439
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:31,037
What does my origin
have to do with my work?

440
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,750
How arrogant.

441
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,045
My work is to intervene
in the life and death of humans.

442
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,714
If you think that's a problem,

443
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,384
you should take it up with the one

444
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,136
who brought me from Hell
in the first place.

445
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,224
I don't know what agreement
you have with the Director,

446
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,101
but I don't understand

447
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,187
why we need the Risk Management Team
in the first place.

448
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,735
The suicide rate hasn't decreased
since the creation of the RM Team.

449
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,487
That's because we're understaffed.

450
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,573
That's why I applied for more personnel.

451
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,741
But you're the one
who objected every time.

452
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,326
Why waste manpower

453
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,704
on giving opportunities to people

454
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,123
who chose death for themselves?

455
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,877
These people have been pushed by the world
to the edge of the cliff.

456
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,962
Do not make light of their choices.

457
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,506
How is taking your own life
any different from murder?

458
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,217
It is the most selfish act,

459
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,802
with no consideration
of the pain of those left behind.

460
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,720
No.

461
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,597
It is the final cry for help

462
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,849
from those who wish to live
more than anyone else.

463
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:33,766
No.

464
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,310
Suicide

465
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,605
is the biggest mistake a human can make

466
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,524
and a crime
that should never be committed.

467
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,821
You tried to save
a homeless person, right?

468
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,198
How good of you.

469
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,284
I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you.

470
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,660
Jade Emperor… I mean,

471
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,121
-Director.
-No, no, no.

472
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,873
We should be the ones apologizing.

473
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,375
After all, you're the one
who unexpectedly ended up in a coma.

474
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,210
Well, that's true.

475
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,464
So, according to Company Code 435642,
Article 2 here at Jumadeung,

476
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,090
we were thinking about
giving you a choice.

477
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,426
-A choice?
-Yes.

478
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:11,763
You can lie in a coma
for three years like now,

479
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:15,058
or you can work at Jumadeung
and wake up in six months.

480
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:17,936
What?

481
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,855
That job you've always wanted…

482
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,815
Try it here.

483
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:23,900
How's that?

484
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,527
Here?

485
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,655
After you wake up,
you'll receive benefits,

486
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,491
like an automatic pass
into any company you want

487
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:32,825
or passing an important test.

488
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,411
Of course, I'm not sure
if that'll be enough for you.

489
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,455
Really?

490
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:42,251
Yes. You can observe, and even select
which team you want for yourself.

491
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,254
Of course, the team has to accept you too
for you to work there.

492
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,508
Wait a minute. Which team has a spot open…

493
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,344
We've got the Editing Team,
the Tech Support Team,

494
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:56,057
the International Sales Team,
and the Risk Management Team.

495
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,642
So, are you in?

496
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,268
Okay.

497
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,812
Good, you made the right choice.

498
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:01,938
I won't do it.

499
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,732
-What?
-I won't.

500
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:05,942
Why?

501
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:09,612
Jumadeung, Grim Reapers…
All right, that's all fine.

502
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,615
But you promised me a job,
which I've been trying to get forever.

503
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,200
So that made me realize.

504
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,285
That this

505
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,286
is a dream.

506
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:21,624
It's totally a dream.

507
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,043
He's a weird one.

508
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,089
Well, all right.
If that's what you've decided.

509
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,591
I guess there's nothing I can do.

510
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,636
Mom?

511
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,054
I knew it was a dream.

512
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,682
What a ridiculous dream.

513
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,392
Mom, why is your face like that?

514
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,311
And why haven't you brushed your hair?

515
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,438
My son.

516
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,106
Did you sleep well?

517
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,524
What?

518
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,109
Why am I like this?

519
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,736
Why…

520
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,740
Why can't I move? Mom!

521
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,367
Can't you hear my voice? Mom!

522
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,913
Mom! Mom, answer me! Mom!

523
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,790
Excuse me! My mom…

524
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,335
I'll do it.

525
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,505
I'll do that thing. Be a Grim Reaper!

526
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,008
Yes, a wise choice.

527
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,979
What happened to my mom?

528
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,440
Don't worry. It's light anemia.

529
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,196
I really get to wake up, right?

530
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,655
It's just six months?

531
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,157
You're sure it's not for any longer?

532
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,742
Yes, right. Don't worry.

533
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,788
Wait.

534
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:46,918
Wait here.

535
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,394
Mr. Park isn't wrong.

536
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,357
Nor Ms. Koo.

537
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:15,947
In Korea, an average of 40 people
kill themselves every day.

538
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,406
That's 15,000 people each year.

539
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,075
What an embarrassing thing to be
number one in the world for.

540
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,952
We even have the lowest birth rate
in the world.

541
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,621
The population is declining
at the steepest rate

542
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,706
out of the top 32 countries.

543
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,167
Don't you know

544
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,336
what all these figures mean?

545
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,590
It's the end of this country!

546
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,718
Jumadeung will disappear as well.

547
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,846
And we'll go out of business.

548
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,308
Why do our employees work so hard?

549
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:47,270
So that they can be reborn
with a silver spoon in their mouth!

550
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,938
Money, honor, health.

551
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,774
The advantage of being born with
whichever one they want.

552
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,318
But what if there's no place

553
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,904
for them to be reborn into?

554
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,536
Yes.

555
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,454
It's half a success and half a failure.

556
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,248
Neither this nor that.

557
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:14,088
So, this is what we'll do.

558
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,300
The RM Team cannot fail again.

559
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,094
What will you do if they fail?

560
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,764
The team will be dissolved.
Since you're all so against it.

561
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,226
But they'll do well.

562
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,478
Right?

563
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,148
How can you be so sure?

564
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,988
Because that's how
you can get everything you want.

565
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:03,846
What?

566
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,057
Do you have something left to say?

567
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,392
Isn't it enough to have saved their lives?

568
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,603
Sure, you saved them in the end.

569
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,648
But I can't say your methods
were very good.

570
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,651
We've lowered their Negative Energy Levels
on The Red Light, didn't we?

571
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,486
-How else should we do it?
-No.

572
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:22,198
If you know the weight of what it means

573
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,450
to save or kill a person with only a word,

574
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,827
you should know what I'm saying right now.

575
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,704
Our team is short-staffed with everyone
pulling more than their own weight.

576
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,248
You should be praising us.

577
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,459
Don't think that everyone
can withstand that weight.

578
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,088
Then at least give me more people.

579
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,464
Hey, Ryeon!

580
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,840
Let's be clear here.

581
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,634
I'm not refusing to give you more people.

582
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,135
It's just that there's no Reaper
who wants to go to your team!

583
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,596
At least your team's got Lim,
who's worth a hundred…

584
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,683
Well, at least 50 people.

585
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:52,019
Lim clocks out on the dot.
He works eight hours and that's it.

586
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,271
How old is he?

587
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:54,814
One hundred and fifty-four.

588
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,316
He's still so young
and already doing that?

589
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,904
NOH EUN-BI, AGE 29
TV WRITER

590
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:02,863
Go on.

591
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,367
Go.

592
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,453
All right.

593
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,371
Off to work.

594
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,497
Okay, go.

595
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,174
Give me the report.

596
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,260
Name is Noh Eun-bi, age 29.

597
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,554
Currently working as a TV writer
at Sangam-dong.

598
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,930
You heard, right?

599
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,224
If we don't succeed,
the team might be dissolved.

600
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,392
Yes.

601
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,855
They sure look impressive.

602
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:36,897
What's that team?

603
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,149
That's the Escort Team.

604
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,692
They escort souls.

605
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,278
What living people think of
when they hear "Grim Reaper."

606
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:45,740
The best of the best of Jumadeung
are gathered in that team.

607
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,160
That sounds like a great fit for me.

608
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:52,705
For starters, that suit would look great.
A perfect fit!

609
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:56,876
Not at all.

610
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,887
Hi, again. Are you all right?

611
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:09,930
Yes, I suppose.

612
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,475
-We were actually on our way out.
-Yes.

613
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,185
Take Mr. Choi Jun-woong with you.

614
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,478
-I'm sorry?
-Pardon?

615
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,314
Mr. Lim here is enough.

616
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:21,359
That's not what you said earlier.
You said you needed more personnel.

617
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,736
I'll have the half-and-half
tag along next time.

618
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,530
Half-and-half? Tag along?

619
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,241
You're really not hiding
your feelings, are you?

620
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,577
I won't observe
if it's this kind of team either.

621
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,204
No!

622
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,538
What happens if we don't take him?

623
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,291
The RM Team will have to write
a written apology

624
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,210
and explanation of their failure
to do their job.

625
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,462
-We'll take him.
-Mr. Lim.

626
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,339
The Director said it herself.

627
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:46,759
If she says jump, we should ask how high.

628
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,928
Everyone already hates us.
If we aren't on our best behavior,

629
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:52,014
they'll dissolve the RM team
and it's back to Hell for you, ma'am.

630
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:52,973
What?

631
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:54,892
Okay.

632
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,019
Do a good job.

633
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,522
Thank you for everything.

634
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,109
Oh, right.

635
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,694
I've ordered the Tech Team

636
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,114
to upgrade that app, The Red Light.

637
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,282
Okay, that's it for me.

638
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,035
Take care.

639
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:28,551
Don't say anything or ask anything,
and just pretend you're not here.

640
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,387
Don't try to butt in like last time. Okay?

641
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,265
Butt in?

642
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,725
I'm… what was it?

643
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,353
I sacrificed my life honorably!
I dived in to rescue a person!

644
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,440
You need to die to say that.
Do you want me to kill you now?

645
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,985
Ma'am, no.
Think of the train back to Hell.

646
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,987
Mr. Lim, shut up.

647
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,075
You think I won't put the both of you
on that train?

648
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:53,993
I love you.

649
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:05,963
I love you.

650
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,889
You're so handsome!

651
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,437
This is where Ms. Noh Eun-bi works
as a TV writer.

652
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,898
What's this?

653
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,483
NOH EUN-BI, AGE 29
TV WRITER

654
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,650
Eighty percent?

655
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,776
It's their Negative Energy Level.

656
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,279
The higher the number,
the higher the risk of suicide.

657
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,117
He's here!

658
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,300
No!

659
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,325
I told you not to butt in.

660
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,983
What?

661
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,109
What just…

662
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:52,486
What did you just do?

663
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,487
I saved her.

664
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,533
I'm the Grim Reaper who saves people.

665
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,456
Ma'am, you can't keep doing this.

666
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,416
What?

667
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,167
You just used your powers.

668
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,836
There are so many phones
and surveillance cameras these days,

669
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,964
-it's hard to hide stuff from--
-Fine, I'll write a report. All right?

670
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,300
No way. A Grim Reaper that saves lives?

671
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,553
We don't save people who are already dead.

672
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,306
We save those who are about
to give up on their lives.

673
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,641
That's our job
at the Risk Management Team.

674
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:26,854
And it's The Red Light
that tells us who's attempting suicide.

675
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,315
She looks fine. Happy, even.

676
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,442
Not everyone's as simple as you are.

677
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,652
Did you call me simple?

678
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:38,490
I have a very complicated mindset
and thoughts…

679
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:40,534
I'm like that…

680
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,791
I didn't look. I really didn't.

681
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,088
Focus on your work.

682
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,423
Work?

683
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,426
What?

684
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,677
Oh, really.

685
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,596
Let's live honestly. Be honest.

686
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,640
You were focusing on something else
just then, right?

687
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,224
I don't know what you're talking about.

688
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,393
This is great.

689
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,353
-It's good, right?
-It's great.

690
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,687
I'll upload this today.

691
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:09,647
-Yeah, let's go with that.
-Okay.

692
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,565
-Where is it?
-Up there.

693
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,317
Jung Jun-ha.

694
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,528
Focus.

695
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,174
Hey, these producers will be
working with you for the interview

696
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,717
with Kim Hye-won, the writer of Boksun.

697
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,969
Noh Eun-bi is in charge of the interview.

698
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,764
I'm Koo Ryeon.

699
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:45,849
I'm Lim Ryung-gu.

700
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,478
Hello, I'm the rookie producer,
Choi Jun-woong.

701
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,365
I know this webtoon! It's really popular.

702
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,784
The main character avenges
school bullying victims

703
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,244
against their tormentors.

704
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:07,413
Yes.

705
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:10,582
A NAIL-BITING REVENGE STORY AGAINST
SCHOOL BULLIES!

706
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,839
BOKSUN
EPISODE 6: FALLEN FLOWER

707
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,590
WRITING AND DRAWING BY KIM HYE-WON

708
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,260
The stares and voices of the others

709
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,595
as they talk about me

710
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,556
and insult me.

711
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,600
She smells.

712
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,103
What a loser.

713
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,980
My torn school books

714
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,731
and my bag filled with trash.

715
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,446
Guys, we're working in groups today.

716
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:41,488
It's group work.

717
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,786
Pretending I didn't exist.
That was just the beginning.

718
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:56,295
It became a daily routine
to go get my desk from the incinerator.

719
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,815
Do you have any idea how hard it was
for me to get the Kim Hye-won interview?

720
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,233
Don't you know how hard I worked on this?

721
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:19,735
I know.

722
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,988
But I really don't think I can do this…

723
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,617
-And Mr. Seo said he wanted to do it--
-No, he can't!

724
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,202
He's not as good as you.

725
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,205
What? You don't have a reason?

726
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,373
What is it? Are you sick?

727
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,584
You never took off work
even when you were deathly ill.

728
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,003
Will being deathly ill…

729
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,131
get me out of this?

730
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,051
You, really.

731
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,512
If you want to die,
do it after the interview!

732
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,263
All right?

733
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:08,534
People that have read my book have said,

734
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,744
"It's like a weight being lifted off
my chest."

735
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:13,497
"It gives school bullies
what they truly deserve."

736
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,957
"A protector of school bullying victims."

737
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,001
That sort of thing.

738
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:21,421
Above all, I want my book

739
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:25,133
to bring some comfort
to victims of school bullying.

740
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,938
Are you all right?

741
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,440
Yes, I'm fine.

742
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,734
We have a question left.

743
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:46,446
What was it…

744
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,949
"Some people say
the revenge is too violent."

745
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,367
That part.

746
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:53,245
The part with Boksun's revenge?

747
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,999
I actually wanted it to be more violent.

748
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:03,922
I have no wish to defend bullies.
They upended the victim's life.

749
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,257
It should be violent.

750
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:15,934
I'm sorry.

751
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,107
I wonder what's wrong with her.

752
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,651
Is this your first time meeting Ms. Noh?

753
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:26,486
Yes.

754
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:27,988
Why?

755
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:12,783
I mean, she looks nice
but she doesn't feel like a good person.

756
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,035
-She has a bad vibe.
-What are you talking about?

757
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,203
I mean the writer, Kim Hye-won.

758
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:17,788
And your reason?

759
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:20,374
It's just a feeling I have.

760
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,377
What are you, a fortune-teller?
To get that feeling with just a look?

761
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,504
No, I've been doing interviews
for years now.

762
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,339
I've developed this sixth sense.

763
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,091
Many people think they have that ability,

764
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,425
then lose everything
on stocks or cryptocurrency.

765
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,927
That's not what I mean.

766
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:35,681
Noh Eun-bi and Kim Hye-won.
I think there's something between them.

767
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,809
-Go to the Company and get it approved.
-What?

768
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,644
I think we'll need the Key of Memory.

769
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,482
That's right.

770
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,527
When you use a power,
report first and act later.

771
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,029
I'll be off then.

772
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,205
Got it.

773
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,712
We're going into Noh Eun-bi's memory now.

774
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:07,629
What?

775
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,632
What are you talking about?
You can do that?

776
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:12,968
Yes.

777
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:14,928
That's amazing.

778
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:25,605
Ma'am.

779
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,068
Lim, today really isn't the right time.

780
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,779
You want me to take half-and-half
into her memories?

781
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,031
Excuse me,
you keep calling me half-and-half.

782
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,117
I'm human, not some kind of food!

783
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,661
Why? You're half-human and half-soul.
Half-and-half.

784
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,705
I'm sorry.

785
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:45,083
Please keep the promise
that I can go home when the alarm rings.

786
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,755
Okay.

787
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:50,672
Go.

788
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:51,965
I'll be off, then.

789
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,189
Why are you being like this over memories?

790
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,440
What are your memories like?

791
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:09,775
Do you only have good ones?

792
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:11,943
No, not exactly.

793
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,445
It could be very unpleasant

794
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,280
and very scary.

795
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:18,366
That's what it's like in memories.

796
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,495
If you're scared, wait here.

797
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,918
You're forgetting how brave
and unyielding and confident I am.

798
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,544
I even saved a person.

799
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,172
I don't want to observe
a team that hates me this much.

800
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,090
I won't observe, then. I won't observe.

801
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,595
You're still talking, so I assume
you're scared. You just stay here.

802
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,680
I'm not scared.

803
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,349
I'll observe.

804
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:46,394
Remember, you said you'd do it.

805
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,231
I'm warning you.

806
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:53,318
When you go in, don't touch anything
and don't butt in.

807
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,618
CLASS MOTTO
A HARMONIOUS CLASS, GRADE 2 CLASS 1

808
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,663
-Noh Eun-bi sucks.
-Noh-bi is an ugly hobo.

809
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,081
Why are you alive, Eun-bi?

810
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,749
-Eun-bi is un-recyclable trash.
-Get lost, Eun-bi.

811
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,251
Noh Eun-bi is an ugly hobo.

812
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:57,090
What is this?

813
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,006
Get over it.

814
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,092
If you can't…

815
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:27,847
DO NOT LEAVE THE FIRE DOOR OPEN

816
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:40,902
This stop is Guro Digital Complex,
Guro Digital Complex.

817
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,238
The doors are…

818
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:48,827
JUNG JUN-HA COMES TO WORK

819
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,287
WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO SELL?

820
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:54,791
I think

821
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,460
this is the first time
I'm seeing her smile.

822
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,528
EPILOGUE

823
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:10,408
What?

824
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:12,660
Okay.

825
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,080
DESIGNER LABEL HOODIE FOR A GOOD PRICE

826
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,208
I'll buy it.

827
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:35,975
Aguccim…

828
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,562
Aguccim.

829
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,899
Guccim. Aguccim.

830
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,156
ROOM 2118

831
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,707
Like I'm not already busy enough.

832
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:03,419
Yes.

833
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:08,299
It's aguccim.

834
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,551
This isn't a sashimi restaurant.

835
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,803
It is. Aguccim.

836
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:14,305
I told you
this isn't a sashimi restaurant.

837
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,310
The hoodie?

838
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,436
Yes, aguccim.

839
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:23,314
Come on, who sells a designer label item
at that price?

840
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:26,234
Why did you think it was so cheap?
Because it's aguccim, you old hag.

841
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:31,114
Thanks for the money though,
it'll last me a few days.

842
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,229
Damn it.

843
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,821
When you go in, don't touch anything
and don't butt in.

844
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,365
I'm sorry.

845
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,783
I'll help you however I can.

846
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:58,368
SAEBIT GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

847
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,537
Choi Jun-woong!
We need to get out of here.

848
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,746
Where do we need to go?

849
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,248
To the place we entered from!

850
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:04,541
Ma'am.

851
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,167
What do we do now?

852
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,461
We need to find a door
that can create a keyhole.

853
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:11,089
Kim Hye-won. She shouldn't be on TV.

854
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:14,217
Eun-bi, no one sides with losers

855
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,218
like you.

856
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,554
That person will soon end their own life.

857
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,514
It's serious. What do we do?

858
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:20,640
We stop it.

859
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,309
Who are you?

860
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:26,020
If you feel like death is the answer,
then die.

861
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,273
Because I'll send you
to the most dreadful Hell.

862
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,567
