1
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,584
I have done nothing I am ashamed of.

2
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:49,257
But how can I live,
seeing you lose yourself

3
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:54,554
and knowing that I have made you so?

4
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,527
I am afraid this is the end of
what fate has planned for us

5
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,614
in this Land of the Living.

6
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,178
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,577
Get rid of the body

8
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,579
so nobody gets a word of this.

9
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,872
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

10
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,000
Stop.

11
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,377
Stop!

12
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,646
Don't go, Ryeon…

13
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,065
I'm so sorry.

14
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,235
Ryeon.

15
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,987
Ryeon!

16
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,200
You can't go like this.

17
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,798
EPISODE 15: CIRCUS

18
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,014
Even so, you should live.

19
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:46,017
Because the weather is nice.
Because it's cloudy.

20
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,518
So I shouldn't die.

21
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,686
Start from there.

22
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,855
As you live,

23
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,651
there will come a moment
when you realize it was all for today.

24
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,444
So…

25
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,655
live.

26
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,573
Choi Jun-woong.

27
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,034
Do you have any idea
what kind of hell it is

28
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,577
to part ways without a proper goodbye?

29
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,579
It's no different
than choosing an eternal hell

30
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,998
just to escape the pain in the present.

31
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,003
So Ms. Koo gave up
on her own reincarnation

32
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,797
and has been doing this job ever since?

33
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,841
To save people from regrets like her own?

34
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,847
But she must have made that decision
because she couldn't bear it any longer.

35
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:30,103
To have all the ties
with the people she loved destroyed…

36
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,230
Her ties with those people were severed

37
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,566
because she chose death.

38
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,653
However, it also means

39
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:43,992
forgetting everything
and starting over with new relationships.

40
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,578
Does Mr. Park not know?

41
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:57,046
Jung-gil reincarnated with
all his memories of Ryeon sealed away.

42
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,926
Usually, one reincarnation is all it takes
to erase memories,

43
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,012
but Jung-gil came to Jumadeung

44
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,806
with the wound
still buried deep within his soul.

45
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,976
Honey, thank you…

46
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,145
and I'm sorry.

47
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,897
I love you.

48
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:19,027
You don't need to worry about us.
You can go on.

49
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,577
Kim Hui-yeong, born 15:33,
November 4th, 1965.

50
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,287
This life has been collected.

51
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,166
Escort her.

52
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,928
Does this mean I can see my son?

53
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:50,808
My son took his own life five years ago…

54
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,272
You can't see your son.

55
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:01,360
He's probably in Hell now,
walking forever as his punishment.

56
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,407
His ties with you have been severed.

57
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,118
Even if you are reincarnated,

58
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,871
you and your child
can never be together again.

59
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:15,166
Because that is the price
of taking one's own life.

60
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,424
Their fates are too cruel.

61
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,304
And you couldn't help them?

62
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,476
Fate is something
even I cannot intervene in.

63
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:37,396
Because all creatures
have their own predetermined fates.

64
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:42,944
But they're only the signs on the road.

65
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,530
The end of that path
depends on one's own choices.

66
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,825
I wish they could both
be free from their pasts.

67
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,743
I don't know.

68
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,996
Will they live in
a time that stands still?

69
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,415
Or…

70
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,794
will they live in a time that flows?

71
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,351
RYU CHO-HUI, AGE 27
SINGER AND ACTOR

72
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,772
I'd sooner trust a passing dog or a pig
than trust you.

73
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:20,731
What?

74
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,953
RYU CHO-HUI, AGE 27
SINGER AND ACTOR

75
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,372
This one's good, right?

76
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,302
I thought you were on a business trip?

77
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,181
You're cheating on me, right?

78
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,141
Calm down. I can explain.

79
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,894
Go ahead. I dare you
to try and explain this.

80
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,522
Well, it's…

81
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,985
You can't say anything, can you?
It's obvious, even to you.

82
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,738
I'm sorry, but…

83
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,032
I'm in love with her.

84
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,080
-Was that all right?
-It was.

85
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,415
Let's move on to the next scene.

86
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,588
The online comments will go nuts again.

87
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,547
Why?

88
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,883
"How dare you throw wine
at his handsome face!"

89
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,968
"Are you crazy? Are you insane?
Do you want to die?"

90
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,136
What do we do?

91
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,931
Cho-hui, should we ask the director
to cut this scene?

92
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,350
Forget it. It's not like
that'd be anything new.

93
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,228
Careful there.

94
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,399
Okay, I'll start the briefing.

95
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,321
Name, Ryu Cho-hui. Age 27.
Debuted as a singer when she was 17.

96
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,740
Although she wasn't part of
a big management agency,

97
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,450
she gained a lot of attention
from the start.

98
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,994
What?

99
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,957
She was super popular
when I was doing my military service.

100
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,417
Everyone all lost it
whenever she was on TV.

101
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,215
She spoke out a few times about health
problems due to her intense schedule.

102
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,143
Sweet sunshine…

103
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,020
She first tried acting three years ago.

104
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,188
At first, she was so terrible

105
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,149
that it became a national pastime
to criticize her acting.

106
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,944
I'm sorry, okay? I won't do it again.

107
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,320
But her acting improved
as the drama went on.

108
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,822
Eventually, people approved of her acting.

109
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,615
Okay.

110
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,285
-It was good, but…
-Yes.

111
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,411
If you could…

112
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,038
She did a lot of commercials too.

113
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,212
She has quite a few haters.

114
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,007
She didn't do anything
to cause trouble herself,

115
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,301
but she's the type
to say things rather bluntly…

116
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,594
What did she say?

117
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,639
They ride their juniors
but suck up to their seniors.

118
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,474
Those kinds of people
are only strong to the weak

119
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,684
and weak to the strong.

120
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,524
She's just whoring for attention.

121
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,320
You bitch. I bet you think I won't
be able to say anything face-to-face.

122
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,739
But if we had run into each other,
I would've killed you.

123
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:18,284
Stupid ass bitch, stop trying to be cool.
Act your age.

124
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,162
She spoke out about something
that needed to be said,

125
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,705
why did it make the public hate her?

126
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,831
Because she's an idol star.

127
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,584
They probably want her to be
a pretty marionette and nothing else.

128
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,462
I think there are also
some deliberate haters.

129
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,715
When someone writes something positive
about Ryu Cho-hui,

130
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,051
they write something malicious
to make it full of hateful comments again.

131
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:39,764
They flood her social media with comments
demanding that she "explain" herself.

132
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:43,142
It's for the thrill of criticizing someone
alongside the masses.

133
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,563
Why is she even a celebrity?

134
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,316
She thinks she can get away with it
because of her looks.

135
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,692
If you don't want to work, get lost.

136
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,153
Do you know how many people
want to be where you are?

137
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,989
The reporters who write clickbait articles
are also an issue.

138
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,743
The more enticing the article is written,
the more clicks it gets.

139
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,747
Ask the Management Support Team
to set things up.

140
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,791
Let's go.

141
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,343
SUICIDE RISK CASE INFORMATION
NAME: RYU CHO-HUI

142
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,303
CURRENT NEGATIVE ENERGY LEVEL

143
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,189
What the hell were you doing,
letting a picture like this get taken?

144
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,900
She said she was going to see a friend…

145
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,028
We shouldn't be
talking about this in front of…

146
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,446
They're Cho-hui's new bodyguards.

147
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:39,698
I see.

148
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,784
You have eyes, use them!

149
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,743
I'm sorry.

150
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,329
I had no idea she was seeing
the vice president of the Mindong Group…

151
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,288
Jeez.

152
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,501
Who the heck sent this?

153
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:54,755
Why couldn't she date someone her own age,
instead of an old married guy?

154
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,007
And one who's separated
from his wife at that!

155
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,261
What are you going to do about this?

156
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,934
Stop attacking him,
he's done nothing wrong.

157
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,352
Just say it to my face.

158
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,395
Sure, okay.

159
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,729
Why did you do it?

160
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,816
You really want to ruin everything
we worked so hard to build?

161
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,359
What are you going to do if this gets out?

162
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,946
So you're not even considering
the possibility it's not true.

163
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,239
Why else were you there?

164
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,794
I booked a room.

165
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,173
You guys said you were uncomfortable
with people seeing you.

166
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,218
You can't come?

167
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,304
Then what about Ye-rim?

168
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,516
Okay.

169
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,270
Ms. Ryu.

170
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,190
Oh. Hello, sir.

171
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,568
We met when you did the commercial, right?

172
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,694
Yes.

173
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,071
I'm an avid watcher
of the TV show you're on.

174
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,281
Thank you.

175
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,868
-This is my room.
-I see.

176
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,745
-Goodbye.
-It was nice running into you.

177
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,878
I'm on my way.

178
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,296
Cho-hui, I'm sorry.

179
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,257
-I don't think I can make it today.
-What?

180
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,925
My boyfriend's sick.

181
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,343
I'm sick?

182
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,427
Hey, be quiet.

183
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,889
I think I'll need to
take him to the hospital.

184
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,432
Really?

185
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,559
Yes.

186
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,019
-I understand.
-Sorry.

187
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,688
I don't have anything today, so it's fi--

188
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,816
YE-RIM

189
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,442
Liar.

190
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,112
It was just a coincidence.

191
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,573
If this goes badly, they're going
to say you're an adulteress

192
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,074
and a married man's mistress.

193
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,452
I'm not. Why won't you believe me?

194
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,496
What haven't we believed so far?

195
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,373
We covered up the rumors
about you being a school bully

196
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,749
without asking any questions, didn't we?

197
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,879
I came to Seoul by myself when I was
in elementary school to start training,

198
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,630
so I never really attended school.

199
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,007
How am I capable of bullying

200
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,592
when I dropped out of school
right after I debuted?

201
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,343
If you didn't, then you didn't.

202
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,220
Anyway, cancel her entire schedule.

203
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,471
Okay.

204
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,516
You can't. The rehearsal for
my new album release is today.

205
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,894
I stayed up all night
for a year preparing for this.

206
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,896
Today's a really important day.

207
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,690
You're driving me crazy. Seriously.

208
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,652
Just stop them. That's all you have to do.

209
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,904
Cho-hui.

210
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,242
We got bodyguards for you.
We can't have anything happening to you.

211
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,080
Bodyguards? More like watchers.

212
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,417
Take the company car so you don't get
any more compromising photos taken!

213
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,382
-I'm your manager, Choi Jun-woong.
-Hello.

214
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,935
SHE'S RELEASING ANOTHER ALBUM?
CAN'T SHE GIVE THIS A REST ALREADY?

215
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,692
You look tired,
why don't you get some sleep?

216
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,528
I can't, my face gets puffy
if I doze off even for a minute.

217
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,204
Have we met somewhere before?

218
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,247
You look familiar…

219
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:01,961
We…

220
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,047
We were your bodyguards at
your concert two years ago.

221
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,007
Right.

222
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:07,925
I see.

223
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,010
Nice to see you again.

224
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:15,015
Don't you think it'll be too much
to rehearse on top of everything else?

225
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,977
I worked really hard on this album.

226
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,270
You have a lot of rave reviews
from your fans.

227
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,064
You have all those haters,

228
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,608
but you never wavered
or took a break in the last ten years.

229
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,277
Then am I supposed to cry
and make a scene?

230
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,655
Sorry.

231
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,492
Despite all the nasty comments,
I believe that I've been able to

232
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,577
do this work all this time
because I'm talented.

233
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,205
Then you don't have to grovel to anyone.

234
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,586
INCOMING CALL
MY SISTER

235
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,798
Hey, Cho-yeon.

236
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,425
Cho-hui.

237
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:50,843
What is it?

238
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,470
Mom said to call you.

239
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,431
Mom? Why?

240
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,977
I told you never to take Dad's calls.

241
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,353
How can we do that…

242
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,355
He was just here
banging on the front door,

243
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,441
screaming that he'd kill us
if we didn't open it…

244
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,901
I'll take care of it.

245
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,987
Tell Mom not to send him any money.

246
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,948
Okay. I know how hard you worked for it.

247
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,616
Don't think about stuff like that.

248
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,286
I'll call you later, okay?

249
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,384
Well, well. Long time no see, Cho-hui.

250
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,766
Can't you see this is a non-smoking area?
Go away, it smells disgusting.

251
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,897
Hey.

252
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,484
This is why all the male celebrities
are too scared to talk to you.

253
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,277
Don't be like that.

254
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,030
Then what am I supposed to be like?

255
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,699
You're so feisty.

256
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,743
I like it.

257
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,120
That's why you're my type.

258
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,747
What?

259
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,084
Come on, I've asked you to
have dinner with me all these years.

260
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,585
Is that so hard?

261
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,713
It's not like I asked you
to sleep with me.

262
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,801
You bastard.

263
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,098
You don't need to be alone, Cho-hui.

264
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,934
Call me. I'll make you
forget your ex-boyfriend.

265
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,228
That little…

266
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,271
Mr. Choi, don't!

267
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,692
Who do you think that is?

268
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,778
Seol In-u, a ballad singer.

269
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,656
He was a part of that
celebrity group chat scandal.

270
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,616
It's rumored that his management agency
made the case go away.

271
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,660
You could be a celebrity news reporter.

272
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,164
Jeez…

273
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,179
Two, three.

274
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,307
-Hello, Ms. Ryu, we're Lavina.
-Hello, Ms. Ryu, we're Lavina.

275
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,938
Hello.

276
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,524
Ms. Ryu, did you hear our new song?

277
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,236
I saw your comeback performance.

278
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,238
I liked the song.
And the choreography too.

279
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,157
Thank you.

280
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,658
It's an honor.

281
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,495
I've been a big fan
since your girl group days.

282
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,957
Hang in there. Even if it's hard,
working as a group is better.

283
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,252
It's a little lonely on your own.

284
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,261
You're Ri-jin, right?

285
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,180
Your vocal trainer
is Ms. Han Tae-in, isn't it?

286
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,639
She is, Ms. Ryu.

287
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,517
I used to take lessons from her too.

288
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,646
She spoke so highly of you
so I listened to your song.

289
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,064
You are very good.

290
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,485
Thank you.

291
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,448
You're so lucky, Ri-jin.

292
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,909
You got a compliment from Ms. Ryu.

293
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:05,120
I made a social media account
a few days ago

294
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,207
and I need help
from a star celebrity like you.

295
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,751
Could I ask you for just one picture?

296
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,629
You guys wait outside.

297
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:21,929
Park Song-i.

298
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,806
Why don't you take care of your members
instead of your social media account?

299
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,849
Sorry?

300
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:29,144
Don't play dumb. I know
you're the lead bully in your group.

301
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,647
-Ms. Ryu, I don't know what you're--
-Give it a rest.

302
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,816
Badmouthing her in the green room
for her to hear,

303
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,652
talking behind her back to the staff…

304
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,530
Who do you think you are?

305
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,574
You got it all wrong.

306
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:46,203
It might have seemed that way,
but that's not true.

307
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,538
Ri-jin was the one
who went off on her own first.

308
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,707
I only did that
because she missed a schedule.

309
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:54,169
Stop with your pretenses.
I've seen it myself multiple times.

310
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:59,049
You think I haven't seen girls like you
in the past ten years?

311
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,010
Ms. Ryu.

312
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,514
Here's some advice for you.

313
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:13,105
Stop butting into things and just shut up.

314
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,566
You think you'll always be popular?

315
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,945
You're just an old has-been.

316
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,863
Do you think your agency
will cover for you?

317
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,200
It doesn't matter how good
your company is.

318
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,911
The only thing that can
keep you standing is your talent.

319
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:28,912
What?

320
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,914
What have you accomplished on your own
since your debut?

321
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,375
Are you a good singer?
Are you good at dancing?

322
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,836
Or at least great on variety shows?

323
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,299
You're a freeloader, coasting by
on the back of your team members.

324
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,509
How dare you, you little…

325
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,723
Is there a problem?

326
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:52,436
I'll be off then, Ms. Ryu,
I've got to go to my next schedule.

327
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,564
Thank you for your great advice.

328
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,592
INCOMING CALL
DO NOT ANSWER

329
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,219
Of all times, why now…

330
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,645
-What?
-Well, well.

331
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,439
You're answering my call for once?

332
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,108
What do you want?

333
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,527
You brat, is that any way to speak
to your dad?

334
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,446
You abandoned Mom, Cho-yeon, and me

335
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,865
because of your gambling addiction.
You're one to talk.

336
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,826
What? Are you out of money again?

337
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:54,247
Please. Would I even call you
if I had money in the first place?

338
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,085
Why don't you try finding your conscience
instead of money for once?

339
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,921
Watch your language, you brat.

340
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,547
You damn little…

341
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,218
You don't care at all about your dad?

342
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,720
Do the people there know you're like this?

343
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,931
You deserve to be cursed out a bit,
you know that?

344
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,849
Enough people do that without you--

345
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,644
I don't care. Send the money right now.
Before I go to a reporter.

346
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:19,189
All those rude things you just said
were all recorded, you hear?

347
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,949
Ms. Ryu Cho-hui,
your rehearsal's about to begin.

348
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,034
Okay.

349
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,917
Let me know if you can't do it.

350
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,837
I have to, people are waiting for me.

351
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,881
It's just a rehearsal. I can ask them.

352
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,217
No, I have to.

353
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,220
We have to get the steps down
before the actual show.

354
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,320
Just do it like I always do.
Just like always.

355
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,572
Like always.

356
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,393
Could you hold her up?

357
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,795
I'm such an idiot. I can't believe this.

358
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,468
I should have just died like that.

359
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:15,555
Do you think the afterlife will be better
than this world?

360
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,099
Then what do you expect me to do?

361
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,393
There is no one on my side.

362
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:24,356
Everyone thinks of me
as a product to be sold.

363
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,858
You're someone who can't die like that.

364
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,072
What sort of person am I?

365
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,327
You…

366
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,956
look like a twinkling star,

367
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,334
but you're just a lonely, normal person…

368
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,797
who has too many things to bear.

369
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,521
I'd like to help you.

370
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:08,733
Who are you?

371
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,860
You're not a bodyguard, are you?

372
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,780
You'll find out in time.

373
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,241
So…

374
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,286
give us a little time.

375
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,512
I thought a lot of people would be taking
care of her because she's so famous.

376
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,514
But she can't even go to the hospital…

377
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,934
There must have been a lot of sketchy
people around because she's so famous.

378
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,895
It's already difficult for her to
tell anyone how she really feels.

379
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,689
Not to mention
all those malicious comments…

380
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,277
The only way she could handle it
was to hold it in and try to drown it out.

381
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:53,945
Choi Jun-woong.

382
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,657
You stay and watch Ryu Cho-hui
at all hours.

383
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,286
-Me?
-Yes.

384
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,538
You said Ryu Cho-hui got you through
your military service.

385
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,582
Yes, but still…

386
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,250
Don't look so uncertain.

387
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,961
Answer me. Say that you can do it.

388
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:12,797
Okay, I will.

389
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:16,593
Get her something to eat for a start.
Help her get some energy.

390
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,844
Okay.

391
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,767
Why did you send Mr. Choi…

392
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,393
Didn't you see it?

393
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,270
See what?

394
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,775
Could you hold her up?

395
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,115
Never mind.

396
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,786
This might

397
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,122
be our last mission.

398
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,418
I guess it's time

399
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,505
for Mr. Choi to leave.

400
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,966
Yes, that too.

401
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,637
You're relieved, right?

402
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,099
Yes.

403
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,310
What? Are you disappointed?

404
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,647
I'm not sure.

405
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:17,404
Come to think of it,
you haven't been picking your nose lately.

406
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:20,949
-Me?
-Yes.

407
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:23,118
Ever since you met your mother.

408
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,412
Is that so?

409
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,684
I haven't seen you in a while.
Did you go somewhere?

410
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,980
I've been on a business trip to Hell.

411
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,899
Mr. Ha Dae-su's temper is still the same.

412
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,987
Fiery. Disgusting. You know.

413
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,613
All too well.

414
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,658
Jeez. I don't want to
go anywhere near him.

415
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:08,204
Anyway, isn't it time for Mr. Park
to take over his place?

416
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,457
I merely follow the company's orders.

417
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,584
I have a lot of work to do, so…

418
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,504
We must have taken up
too much of his time.

419
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:20,341
By the way, Mr. Ha spoke of
the Risk Management Team.

420
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,593
What did he say?

421
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,595
He asked why the Director
had to make that stupid team

422
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,013
and make trouble for the company.

423
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,556
He is right.

424
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,391
He also spoke of Koo Ryeon.

425
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,186
Something rather surprising.

426
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,313
-What?
-He said…

427
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,398
that she killed herself.

428
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,358
Let go!

429
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,198
So it's true.

430
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,159
That you're going to lead a team
that saves those from committing suicide.

431
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,621
Without even consulting me.

432
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,042
It was an order…

433
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,712
the Director gave me a very long time ago.

434
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,255
Suicide is a form of murder.

435
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,049
It's a brutal murder of themselves.

436
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,384
Their lives could have been
in that much pain.

437
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,095
They might not have had any other choice.

438
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,014
Pain is the essence of life.

439
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:13,269
It's a living human's fate to struggle
and move forward in spite of that pain.

440
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:21,653
I knew she was unqualified,
but I didn't know it was this bad.

441
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:25,615
I know. As if it isn't blasphemous
enough that she came from Hell,

442
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,951
but to think it was because
she committed suicide.

443
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,000
What is it?

444
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,878
I've come to ask you about the thing
you know and I don't.

445
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:43,258
You said dreams are a reflection of
reality from the wounds of your past life.

446
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,803
I have dreamt the same thing
every time I sleep.

447
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,264
A dream I don't know if it's reality,
my past life, or my wound.

448
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,475
But Koo Ryeon was in that dream.

449
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,768
That again.

450
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,146
Does Koo Ryeon have something to do
with the wounds from my past life?

451
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,606
Don't jump to conclusions.

452
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,149
Why won't you tell me?

453
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,902
I'm a bit busy right now.

454
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,574
If you can't answer me, release the lock
on my Book of the Deceased.

455
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,034
I'll check it myself.

456
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,120
No.

457
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,668
I have worked hard for Jumadeung
for many centuries.

458
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,005
I'm well aware of your dedication.

459
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,340
What is the real reason
you created the RM Team?

460
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,675
I told you, to restore the balance

461
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,427
between the Land of the Living
and the afterworld--

462
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,761
How can someone
who killed herself save anyone?

463
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,723
This is hypocrisy beyond mere deception.

464
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,767
How pitiful your existence is.

465
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,563
I made a promise to someone.

466
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,273
They asked that you never be

467
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,609
allowed to see your past life.

468
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,028
What did you promise and to who
while using someone else's life?

469
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,698
Was it with Koo Ryeon?

470
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,618
It was with you.

471
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,038
You asked me to
turn you away from the truth

472
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,582
if there came a time
you'd want to know later.

473
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,543
It is because you asked me to.

474
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,837
You…

475
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,090
pledged the Reaper's Vow to me.

476
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,968
You asked me to
make you forget your memories.

477
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,470
So…

478
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,181
go back and forget about everything.

479
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:16,809
No.

480
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,938
I'll check myself.

481
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,247
It's the Director's orders.
You should go back and rest.

482
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:14,409
What's this? What's up with her?

483
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,453
It's a panic attack.

484
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:25,837
Really?

485
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,256
Who doesn't have a panic disorder
in this field?

486
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,632
Is she off her rocker?

487
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,300
It's not that bad.

488
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,052
She'll get better
after some meds and rest.

489
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,220
Jeez.

490
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,430
You're heavy!

491
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,183
Isn't there a way we can
get rid of her for good?

492
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,978
I just happen to know a reporter
who's determined to catch Ryu Cho-hui,

493
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,396
and he's got something juicy.

494
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,064
I bet he'll publish it
with just a bit of money.

495
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,190
Really?

496
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,902
But did Ryu Cho-hui
pull something on you too?

497
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,530
Please. She didn't pull anything.

498
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,576
I'm just curious what
that arrogant face of hers will look like

499
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,286
once she loses everything.

500
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,872
But you need to help.

501
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,457
How?

502
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,877
Post something on social media,
as if she bullied you.

503
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,629
But I don't have any proof.
What if people tell me off?

504
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,382
Come on.
You still don't know anything, do you?

505
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:15,344
These rabid dogs will grab
any opportunity to pounce on her.

506
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,804
Do you think they care about the truth?

507
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,306
What's important to them

508
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,350
is the destruction
of superstar, Ryu Cho-hui.

509
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,789
Work's not what's important right now,
it's your health.

510
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,917
Here, have some.

511
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,128
Athletes and dancers have joint issues.

512
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,963
And this is fried chicken and tteokbokki.

513
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,552
Come on, you need to eat something
to get your strength back.

514
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,973
I'm such an idiot,
ruining rehearsal like that…

515
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,810
I worked so hard for it.

516
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,271
Ms. Ryu.

517
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,482
Blaming yourself, being hard on yourself,

518
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,192
and tormenting yourself are off-limits.

519
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,987
There's not even enough time to
hear all the praise people have for you,

520
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,364
and here you are, hating on yourself?

521
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,782
You can't afford to do that, Ms. Ryu.

522
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,494
So…

523
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,287
eat this first.

524
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:25,873
Thank you.

525
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:32,130
Don't you know how many delicious things
are there in this world?

526
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,506
You need calories.

527
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,883
Fried chicken and tteokbokki, you
need this stuff to get your strength back.

528
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,637
You can't go without tteokbokki.

529
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,389
Jeez.

530
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,642
I finished this.

531
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,435
The script, could you…

532
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,690
I'll go get it quick while you eat.

533
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,616
What's this?

534
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,869
What's up with this?

535
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,794
You called?

536
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,337
-Sorry?
-Yes.

537
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,716
-We're here because you called.
-Okay, that was quick.

538
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,551
Just a minute.

539
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,513
-This is frozen.
-Goodness.

540
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,640
-Take out the equipment, Mr. Lim.
-Yes, ma'am.

541
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,687
I just saw someone
with a hat pushed down to his face

542
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,106
walking by
with some communication equipment.

543
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,691
-Where?
-By the lobby.

544
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,611
-He had a weird look in his eyes.
-Come on.

545
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,171
I found it.

546
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,134
-Make a copy.
-Okay.

547
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,599
We've gotten rid of one risk factor.

548
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,317
ALL IT TAKES IS A NIGHT WITH A CHAEBOL
TO OPEN THE DOOR TO SUCCESS FOR MS. A?

549
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,365
That picture's totally Ryu Cho-hui.

550
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,991
I bet that second-generation chaebol

551
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,868
saw Ryu Cho-hui working at a bar,
took a liking to her,

552
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,245
and helped her debut as a singer.

553
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,955
She's nowhere near pretty enough
to be that famous.

554
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,748
Just my opinion, don't come at me!

555
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,167
I knew it. She's a terrible actor,
and she's ugly.

556
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,169
I always wondered who would ever cast her.

557
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,588
Did you see Park Song-i's post?
She bullied her too, apparently.

558
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,175
SONG-I OF LAVINA
EXPOSES BEING BULLIED

559
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,510
BY A SENIOR MEMBER
OF ANOTHER GIRL GROUP

560
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,348
RYU CHO-HUI WAS MY ROLE MODEL
SINCE MY TRAINEE DAYS

561
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,557
TODAY I SAY GOODBYE
TO THE WOMAN I ONCE ADMIRED

562
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,059
SHE SPOKE AGAINST BULLYING,
YET SHE BELITTLED AND CRUSHED ME

563
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,691
What's this?

564
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,944
I'm going crazy. The reporter asked for
a ridiculous sum so I asked for some time,

565
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,862
but he already sold it to a news outlet.

566
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,572
Put out a correction, quickly!

567
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,117
You stay put until this dies down.

568
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,078
It's better that you lay low
until this quiets down.

569
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:12,915
Why should I? Why are they
making things up and torturing me?

570
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,917
What did I do so wrong?

571
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,169
Cho-hui, don't get all worked up!

572
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,504
Hey, are you listening?

573
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,172
If this goes badly,
you'll need to leave the show

574
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,883
and pay the contract termination
penalties for the commercials!

575
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,970
The concert is off.
The new album release is on hold.

576
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,279
RYU CHO-HUI, AGE 27
SINGER AND ACTOR

577
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,547
This is Ms. Ryu's car, right?
Are you her manager?

578
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,507
Could you confirm the story about
how she's dating a married man?

579
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,425
What?

580
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,386
-You're Ms. Ryu's manager, right?
-Is it true?

581
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,554
Can you confirm?

582
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,306
Wait.

583
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,475
I'll check, and then I'll tell you.

584
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,936
Can you comment?

585
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,314
-Can you comment?
-Hey!

586
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,774
Can you comment?

587
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,067
Is it true?

588
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:24,862
What?

589
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,116
RYU CHO-HUI, AGE 27
SINGER AND ACTOR

590
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,040
CALLING
MS. KOO

591
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,253
-Ma'am.
-Where are you?

592
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,755
I'm in front of Ms. Ryu's place right now.

593
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,633
Guard her. We'll head over.

594
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,550
Okay.

595
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,473
Isn't that Cho-hui?

596
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,724
-It is Cho-hui.
-It's Cho-hui.

597
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,850
Hey!

598
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,103
Hey, Ryu Cho-hui!

599
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,938
You poured wine on him, didn't you?

600
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,106
You're such a loser.

601
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,274
You should be ashamed.

602
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,550
If this goes badly, they're going to say

603
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,427
you're an adulteress
and a married man's mistress.

604
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,554
You think you'll always be popular?

605
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,349
You're just an old has-been.

606
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,022
If you don't want to work, get lost.

607
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,191
Do you know how many people
want to be where you are?

608
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,818
Why is she even a celebrity?

609
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,611
She thinks she can get away with it
because of her looks.

610
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,822
Do the people there know you're like this?

611
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:52,199
You deserve to be cursed out a bit,
you know that?

612
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,583
Ms. Ryu!

613
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:06,797
Ms. Ryu!

614
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,467
Ms. Ryu!

615
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,061
Where's Cho-hui?

616
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,484
Let's split up.

617
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,526
Okay.

618
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,340
Will stopping time stop her
from wanting to die as well?

619
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:35,261
A pathetic person who took their own life.

620
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,138
A weak and irresponsible person

621
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,474
who threw their life away
because they couldn't take it.

622
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,770
How dare someone like that deceive me
and work under me?

623
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,313
I've never deceived you.

624
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,607
What exactly was the promise you
and the Director made?

625
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,150
Ask her yourself.

626
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,570
How much longer do you plan on
violating the rules of Jumadeung?

627
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:55,948
This is my job.

628
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,157
Just let that one die.

629
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,409
Stop it!

630
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,369
How could you?

631
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,914
How could you
say something like that to her?

632
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,838
I will never just let her die.

633
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,513
I will use the Reaper's Guarantee
of Responsibility you promised me.

634
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,350
It's a contract
where the Reaper who receives help

635
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,769
must do whatever the Reaper,
who is helping, demands.

636
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,648
They can't refuse or run away.

637
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:52,421
You will no longer intervene
in their choices and just watch.

638
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,190
Where are you going?

639
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,198
Who are you?

640
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,785
Ms. Ryu. Here's some advice for you.

641
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:32,372
Stop butting into things and just shut up.

642
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,501
You think you'll always be popular?

643
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,921
You're just an old has-been.

644
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,549
Are you a reporter?

645
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,384
We've never met before.

646
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,347
I don't know where you got this from,

647
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,724
but this is illegal.

648
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,809
Who told you to post that lie?

649
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:56,230
Are you from Ryu Cho-hui's
management agency?

650
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,606
Right. The bodyguard.

651
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,110
I'll pay you twice as much,
come over to my side.

652
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,281
You…

653
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,658
You little--

654
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,794
I'm sorry.

655
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,421
Please, just don't hit my face.

656
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,923
Someone told me to do it.

657
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:23,882
Who?

658
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,476
Seriously, man.

659
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,353
You really didn't hold back
with that article.

660
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,898
Do you know how long I've been waiting
to destroy Ryu Cho-hui?

661
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,609
She thinks she's so high and mighty.

662
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,736
Right. I saw everyone copied the article.

663
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,656
It wouldn't do me any good
if people figured out it was my story.

664
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,284
They're having a field day.
It's been pretty quiet lately.

665
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,039
You are?

666
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,626
-What, you didn't invite her?
-No, I didn't.

667
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,963
So it's you. The one who wrote
that ridiculous article.

668
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,382
And you put him up to it.

669
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,467
How did she get in? Get out--

670
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,060
I see you've committed many crimes.
From sex crimes to drugs.

671
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:20,147
Cut your crap.
Do you know what I did to get here?

672
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:35,287
You know,

673
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:38,248
nothing is going to change
even if we publish a correction.

674
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,208
What do you mean?

675
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:44,630
Stories about Ryu Cho-hui
are exploding right now.

676
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,214
Do you really think
people are going to care

677
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,966
if we put this one correction out?

678
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,054
But it isn't true.

679
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:55,390
The video is already spreading
on the internet.

680
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,726
A correction like this is,

681
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:01,271
well, how should I put it,
a drop of ink in the ocean.

682
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:02,731
It'll get buried quickly.

683
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,566
You're the ones
who wrote it wrong! Damn it!

684
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,486
What do you think you're doing?

685
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:08,820
If I'm being blunt, do you have any idea

686
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,405
how many news outlets
there are in this country?

687
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,199
Are you going to go to every one of them?

688
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:16,078
I will. I'm going to, so hurry up
and put out that correction.

689
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:17,621
I'm telling you.

690
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:19,581
I mean…

691
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:21,792
Are you kidding me?

692
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:23,418
YOU'RE OVER, RYU CHO-HUI

693
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,711
I GUESS I WON'T BE SEEING
THAT UGLY FACE ANYMORE

694
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,754
PASSION AND LOVE?
YOU'RE JUST AN ADULTERESS

695
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:26,963
LET'S STOP WATCHING
RYU CHO-HUI'S SHOWS, DISGUSTING

696
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,632
NOW SHE'S EVEN BULLYING A SINGER
WHO'S HER JUNIOR

697
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:31,802
I'm a law-abiding citizen.
Please, believe me.

698
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,136
A law-abiding citizen?

699
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:36,056
Even though
you posted 140,000 hateful comments?

700
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,183
I'm sorry.

701
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,104
My life's been so hard.

702
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,273
I was tired from nursing
my widowed mother in the hospital.

703
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:48,443
So you took your pain out on someone else?

704
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:52,447
I hated myself for still living like this
at this age,

705
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:56,576
and my debt only keeps increasing,
and I know I'm vermin, but I wanted to…

706
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,412
I wanted to breathe…

707
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,167
I see.

708
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,379
It must have been hard.

709
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,174
Because you were so stressed

710
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:14,845
that you wrote those comments
without knowing what you were saying.

711
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,513
Yes, right.

712
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:17,931
Is that what you thought
I was going to say?

713
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,896
You just wanted someone
to take your anger out on.

714
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,693
Because you wanted to blame someone else.

715
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,203
You're right, it was all a lie.

716
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,289
I'm sorry.

717
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:45,709
I just wanted to let out some stress.

718
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,219
Live the rest of your life
looking like that.

719
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,300
What did my sister do wrong?

720
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,013
She didn't do anything wrong.

721
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,515
So why is everyone saying
these hateful things about her?

722
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,434
Mom said we should all just die together.

723
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:47,229
I can't take this anymore.

724
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,232
I'm sorry. We'll find a way to fix this.

725
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:52,484
How?

726
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,404
How are you going to fix it?

727
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,253
Where have you been?

728
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:15,131
I've been to news outlets, asking them
to take down the articles, but…

729
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:16,883
And Ms. Ryu?

730
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,344
Not yet.

731
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,096
Did you hear anything from Ms. Koo?

732
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,227
I don't know where she is,

733
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,771
but I know what she's doing.

734
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,863
This is Billy,
he's a notorious cyber wrecker.

735
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,197
Cyber wrecker?

736
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:43,577
They're people who choose a target
and make content that attacks them

737
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,453
indiscriminately to get views.

738
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,580
And?

739
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:53,169
Ryu Cho-hui. The star of the breaking
news stirring the internet into a frenzy.

740
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,380
We've got new information on Ryu Cho-hui.

741
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:57,132
Ryu Cho-hui's dad

742
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,885
is this famous thug in the provinces.

743
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,387
He's a gambling addict
who gambled all his money away.

744
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:04,598
I heard he told Ryu Cho-hui

745
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:09,102
that she should be a company
chairman's mistress instead of an actor.

746
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:11,146
She spewed all that crap about how much

747
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,939
she loves acting
in every interview she did.

748
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:14,858
Apparently…

749
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,904
it was acting in bed that she loved.

750
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,071
Hey, Cho-hui.

751
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,407
Why don't you come to me instead?

752
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,784
I'll be good to you!

753
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,203
I make a lot of money, you know?

754
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:40,926
Who are you?

755
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,302
You almost killed me!

756
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:52,187
WHAT? WHAT THE HECK?

757
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,730
SHE SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
IS SHE A GHOST?

758
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,065
WAS THAT CG? WHAT THE HECK
I THINK IT'S REAL!

759
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,031
KOO RYEON

760
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,241
What do we do?

761
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,118
I've reported it
to upper management for now.

762
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:10,538
The Director permitted us
to punish a living person

763
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,332
only when we've rescued a suicide case

764
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:15,293
and if that person is the reason
why they chose to take their life.

765
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:17,545
But these people
are the reason she did it!

766
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:20,507
We haven't rescued Ms. Ryu yet.

767
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,720
Ms. Koo violated
the first rule of Jumadeung,

768
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,973
which is not to intervene in the affairs
of the Land of the Living.

769
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:33,770
Look.

770
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:35,438
PEOPLE ARE GETTING ATTACKED
BY A MYSTERIOUS ASSAILANT

771
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,607
What Ms. Koo did is already on the news.

772
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,528
DO YOU KNOW THE WOMAN WHO ASSAULTED BILLY
AND THEN DISAPPEARED?

773
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,616
Let's find her.

774
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,618
I already tried.

775
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,707
I wasn't strong enough.

776
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:06,678
Ma'am, you need to stop this.

777
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,346
Why should I stop?

778
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,932
You've crossed the line. By a lot.

779
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,517
When have I not crossed the line?

780
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,893
This time is different!

781
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,107
How long are you going to do this?

782
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,152
Until every one of them is gone.

783
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,153
Ma'am!

784
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,241
I won't let you go.

785
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,711
Ma'am, please.

786
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:46,134
Don't get in my way.
I won't forgive even you.

787
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,021
Ma'am…

788
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:05,862
Then again,

789
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:09,532
there are very few Reapers in Jumadeung
who can win against her.

790
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:13,787
We can tell the Director. Ask her to help.

791
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:18,708
Mr. Choi, the Director
is in a difficult situation herself.

792
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,713
There's been an order to arrest Ms. Koo.

793
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:25,965
So you're saying,

794
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,885
you're not going to do anything?

795
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:09,467
You're here.

796
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:10,552
Mr. Ha.

797
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,053
It's been a long time.

798
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,181
What are you doing here without notice?

799
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:19,936
Well, the worried Senior Board
of Directors sent me.

800
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:25,525
Come on, I work without a day off.
You should be throwing me a welcome party.

801
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,193
Don't be so heartless.

802
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,738
So…

803
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,158
how are things going in Hell these days?

804
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,243
Well, they're packed in like sardines.

805
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:39,581
You know, these heinous villains
keep on coming,

806
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:42,500
but you, you aren't
maintaining the facilities.

807
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,628
You're making ridiculous teams
like this Risk Management Team

808
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:46,629
or whatever it is.

809
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:51,050
That girl, Koo Ryeon,

810
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,886
she's been up to a lot of mischief.

811
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,179
Are you having trouble controlling her?

812
00:57:56,431 --> 00:58:00,310
Perhaps you've been in that seat
too long and it's made you soft.

813
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:04,272
So what are you saying
you're going to do with Ryeon?

814
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:08,485
Well, I'll take her before she can disrupt
the Land of the Living any further.

815
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:10,487
To where?

816
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,655
Where she used to be, of course.

817
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,952
Hell.

818
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,906
Ma'am, can't you help Ms. Koo?

819
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:56,533
Ryeon has let me down.

820
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,910
Mr. Ha will go and arrest her.

821
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,328
Please, help.

822
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:01,704
Koo Ryeon deceived me.

823
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,540
Who's fault is it that
Ms. Koo's in this situation?

824
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:04,874
What did you say?

825
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:05,792
Park Jung-gil?

826
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,585
I've seen neither hide
nor hair of you all this time.

827
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,003
What are you doing here?

828
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:13,007
Jumadeung will take care of
its own problems.

829
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,385
I'll accept whatever punishment
you give me.

830
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:16,761
There's no need.

831
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:19,556
Jung-gil has shouldered
the blame for everything.

832
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,891
Koo Ryeon, it's been a long time.

833
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,102
Ryeon.

834
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:27,105
