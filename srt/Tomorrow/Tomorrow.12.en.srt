EPISODE 12: WEST SKY 2

3
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,176
Hello, sir!
I'm the new Reaper, Kwon Sang-su!

4
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,386
You can loosen up.

5
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,346
This isn't the military.
There's no need to salute me.

6
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,514
Right.

7
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,017
My last life was in the military, you see…

8
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,687
I see.

9
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:07,108
Here's the information
on our next client, Ms. Pang Man-nyeon.

10
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,782
Pang Man-nyeon.

11
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,242
This must be your first time
entering a dream.

12
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,619
Yes, it is, sir.

13
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,120
Have you read up on how?

14
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,246
Yes, sir.

15
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,082
The Sales Team moves in units of two.

16
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,376
One Reaper enters the dream of the person
nearing the end of their life

17
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,378
and gets them to sign the contract
regarding their date of death

18
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,047
and life at Jumadeung
before their reincarnation.

19
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,673
That is all, sir!

20
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:34,886
Let's go.

21
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,895
Where's…

22
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:49,651
Oh, right.

23
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,988
Do you happen to know Choi Jun-woong?

24
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,366
I'm sorry, sir?

25
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:57,951
It's nothing.

26
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,120
I think half of you and half of him
would be the perfect mix.

27
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,749
I'll wait here, sir!

28
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,816
NAME
PANG MAN-NYEON

29

CONNECTING

30
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,906
Ms. Pang Man-nyeon.

31
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,867
I'll see you soon.

32
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,784
CONNECTION COMPLETE

33
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,718
You were quite the odd one, Mom.

34
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,971
You didn't care if your child went hungry

35
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,599
and bought clothes and cars instead.

36
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:05,768
Damn it.

37
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,898
You said you'd never live an ordinary life
until the day you died.

38
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:15,445
You said you'd live to be a hundred,
ghosts be damned.

39
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,864
But what is this?

40
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,409
This is so ordinary and uninteresting.

41
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,736
This won't be easy.

42
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,545
What is this?

43
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,714
Are you Ms. Pang Man-nyeon?

44
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,383
Could you stop for a moment?

45
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,270
Ms. Pang Man-nyeon.

46
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,438
I am a Grim Reaper from the afterworld.

47
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,690
SALES TEAM ASSISTANT MANAGER
LIM RYUNG-GU

48
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,401
A Grim Reaper?

49
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,989
Do I have to die?

50
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,657
Yes.

51
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,410
Take a good look at this contract,
and when you sign it,

52
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,537
the Reapers from the Escort Team
will come to guide you.

53
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,416
Sometimes, people remember these dreams
after they wake up,

54
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,793
so just in case, be sure to think about

55
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,129
what you'd most like your family
and acquaintances to know,

56
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,549
like deeds to buildings, land you own
or passcodes to your bank accounts.

57
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,802
Now, could you sign this, please?

58
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,266
Mom.

59
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,101
Mom, can you hear me?

60
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,645
Damn it.

61
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,191
Live true to yourself without any regrets.

62
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,069
That's the answer.

63
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,780
Mom.

64
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,496
Jeez. You know how people say,
"absence makes the heart grow fonder"?

65
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,582
I miss having Mr. Lim around.

66
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,376
Who's the one who said he was happy
to hear less nagging now?

67
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,920
We have more disciplinary reports
to write these days.

68
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,048
Did you forget that you have
to report things before using your powers?

69
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,260
Mr. Lim, why do you keep going
into Jun-woong's body?

70
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:45,595
Get out of there.

71
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,596
That's not funny.

72
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,056
It's not.

73
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,225
I'm craving for some sugar.

74
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,310
What do you want to eat?

75
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,645
You're going to go, ma'am?
Gummies for me, please.

76
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,787
CONVENIENCE STORE ORDER

77
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,081
ORDER COMPLETE

78
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,373
There we go.

79
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,625
Beginning navigation.

80
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,722
Yes, thank you.

81
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,356
LIM YU-HWA, AGE 30
SALES ASSOCIATE

82
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:40,608
What?

83
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,168
Lim Yu-hwa, age 30.

84
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,754
She works at a sportswear store on
the sixth floor of Hanguk Department Store

85
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,548
and alternates between the morning
and afternoon shifts.

86
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,050
The store and the one next to it
were looking for part-timers.

87
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,969
I arranged it so we can start
working there tomorrow.

88
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,053
Okay.

89
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,557
Shouldn't we tell him?

90
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,476
No.

91
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,311
Still, it's his mother…

92
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,773
He left reassured,
having seen Lim Yu-hwa living happily.

93
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,608
It's better if he doesn't know.

94
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,236
And technically,

95
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,238
that is not Mr. Lim's mother.

96
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,740
She just has the same face and name,

97
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,200
but they're different people.

98
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,121
She should be at her happiest now
since she had the baby,

99
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,205
so why…

100
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,042
She definitely looked happy, though…

101
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,381
Who knows.

102
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,069
-Hey.
-Hi.

103
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,698
I got the gopchang-jeongol you like.
You haven't eaten yet, right?

104
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:14,368
Sorry, I was hungry so I ate earlier,
and I've been spacing out until now.

105
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,413
-Really?
-You go on and eat.

106
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,956
I'll have the leftovers in the morning.

107
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,460
Okay, then.

108
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,754
I'm going to rest. I'm tired.

109
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,006
Already?

110
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,007
Yes.

111
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,176
I'm tired after working
for the first time in a while.

112
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,928
Okay, sleep first.

113
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,763
Thanks.

114
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,539
Gosh, my baby is so pretty.

115
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,416
Lim Yu-hwa,

116
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,168
age 30.

117
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,881
LIM YU-HWA, AGE 30
SALES ASSOCIATE

118
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:10,967
What?

119
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,884
Wait.

120
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,470
Is this some sort of error?

121
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,349
LIM YU-HWA, AGE 30
SALES ASSOCIATE

122
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,351
I'm not sure.

123
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,978
Why did her level go down?

124
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,938
Take note of it for now.

125
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:24,897
Okay.

126
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,494
Honeybee.

127
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,590
Is that the TV show
you're hooked on this time?

128
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,176
Why are you here?

129
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:36,761
Did you get into trouble?

130
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,429
What do you mean, trouble?

131
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,348
This place has great pizza.

132
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,058
I brought one over so you could try it.

133
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,684
You're cheating on me, right?

134
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,436
You're changing the subject,
so you did get into trouble.

135
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,687
Come on, I really didn't.

136
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,813
Go ahead. I dare you.

137
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,065
Sure.

138
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,318
Just admit that you were wrong
and beg for forgiveness.

139
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,277
Okay?

140
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,321
Thanks for the pizza.

141
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,615
My gosh.

142
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,408
Man. I'm hungry.

143
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,163
Would you look at the shrimp
on this pizza?

144
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,335
It's so good, maybe because I paid for it.

145
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,378
Say, "ah."

146
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,506
So good.

147
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,216
Delicious.

148
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,218
Love?

149
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,557
So, how is it working in the Sales Team?

150
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:27,520
As you can see, I have time
to watch TV shows and eat pizza,

151
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,479
so it's great.

152
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,273
What if just anyone goes
into someone's dreams?

153
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,235
You can't go in without
a Sales Team employee's number.

154
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,195
What if the dream's a nightmare?

155
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,572
That's why it's better not to go
into dreams if possible.

156
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,907
Because you might find things

157
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,159
about that person's past life
or the one before that.

158
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,703
What happens if you do?

159
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,705
Finding things out isn't really a problem,

160
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,417
but it becomes a problem
if you reveal the information you learned…

161
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,883
Why am I wasting time
explaining something like this to you?

162
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,430
What is it? What did you do this time?

163
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,308
I mean, it's…

164
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,645
"I mean, it's…"

165
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,148
What is it?

166
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,232
It's nothing.

167
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,860
Enjoy your show and the pizza.

168
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,677
Hello.

169
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,853
This one is great because the fabric
is very sweat-absorbent

170
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,104
and dries quickly too.

171
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,190
I'll just look around a bit more.

172
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,025
Of course. Feel free to come again.

173
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,318
-Okay.
-Bye.

174
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,696
Yu-hwa, are you sure you're okay?

175
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,239
Tell me if you're feeling tired.

176
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,533
The store's not busy today,
so you can go home early.

177
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,868
I'm not tired at all.

178
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,788
I just need to go to the storage room
and get some sizes we're missing.

179
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,082
Which ones? I'll go get them.
What do we need to get?

180
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,542
Gosh.

181
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:18,130
I'm really okay, ma'am.

182
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,089
All right, then.

183
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,257
Be careful.

184
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,175
Okay.

185
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,142
Is Ms. Lim not feeling well or something?

186
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,561
No, it's not that.

187
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,022
The thing is,

188
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,149
she lost her baby recently.

189
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,069
-What?
-Goodness.

190
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:44,114
She must be having such a hard time,
both physically and mentally.

191
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,576
That's why we got part-timers,
so try to help her out as much as you can.

192
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,620
Yes, of course.

193
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,081
I'm telling you this so you won't say
anything that could upset her,

194
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,832
so don't act like you know, okay?

195
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,917
Okay.

196
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,973
LIM YU-HWA

197
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,150
I think it's been less than a month
since she's lost the baby.

198
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,528
That's about how long it's been
since Mr. Lim left the team.

199
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,864
That seems about right.

200
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,782
She was almost due at the time.

201
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,618
If she lost the baby right before birth…

202
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,162
From what I heard,

203
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,165
she doesn't eat lunch
and just sits like that.

204
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,585
LIM YU-HWA, AGE 30
SALES ASSOCIATE

205
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,586
It's still high.

206
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,504
Why was it suddenly like that yesterday?

207
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,756
Keep an eye on it.

208
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,634
-We don't know when it might drop again.
-Okay.

209
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,559
My goodness!

210
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,727
Did you already have the baby?

211
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,521
Hello.

212
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,440
My, my!

213
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,067
Look, your stomach
is so much flatter already.

214
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,861
It's because you're so young.

215
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:04,945
How's the baby? Cute?

216
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,948
I'm sure it is, if it takes after you.

217
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,074
Anyway, congratulations!

218
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,410
-Ma'am, can I help you with anything?
-Sorry?

219
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,163
I've never seen him before.

220
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,665
No, I'm one
of Ms. Lim's regular customers.

221
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,626
She knows exactly what I like.

222
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,794
So, who's taking care of the baby?

223
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,923
-It's…
-Ma'am.

224
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,383
Moms should really be with their babies.

225
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,053
Is your mother watching the baby?
Or your husband?

226
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,304
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am.

227
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,349
What?

228
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,351
Excuse me, ma'am, if you could…

229
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,519
Could you come this way, please?

230
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,785
Why don't you go to the bathroom?

231
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,568
It's my boyfriend's birthday,

232
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,779
could you recommend something?

233
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:34,326
What about this one?
It's new this season and quite popular.

234
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,547
Yu-hwa, here you are.

235
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,215
Hi.

236
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,094
How far along are you now, nine months?

237
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,558
Now that I'm bigger,
I just don't feel like I used to.

238
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,935
I get tired so quickly now too.

239
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,770
When are you going on maternity leave?

240
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,564
Shouldn't you be getting some rest?

241
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,941
I'm going to work until my last month.

242
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,944
If I go on leave too quickly,

243
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,948
my baby will still be too little
when I have to return to work.

244
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,659
And it costs a lot to raise a kid.

245
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,703
Still. Don't overdo it, though.

246
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,997
-I'm going to head back.
-Okay.

247
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,923
I want a refund.

248
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,857
I'm sorry, ma'am,

249
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,902
but I'm afraid we can refund clothes
that have been worn.

250
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,613
What are you talking about?
I didn't even try it on.

251
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,408
But I can smell perfume on the clothes,

252
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,744
and there's a gum wrapper in the pocket.

253
00:17:58,827 --> 00:17:59,703
What?

254
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:04,750
So you sold me something
that reeks of perfume and had trash in it.

255
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,502
When I've never even tried it on!

256
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,379
I'm sorry, ma'am.

257
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,925
Are you trying to make me feel guilty
because you're pregnant?

258
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,470
Is that supposed to stop me
from filing a complaint?

259
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,764
You think you're the first one
to be pregnant?

260
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,059
Ma'am!

261
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,937
I won't budge a single step

262
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,022
until you get on your knees
in front of me.

263
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,900
Get on your knees.

264
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,820
Get on your knees!

265
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,093
You're so pretty.

266
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,636
I'm so happy to see you, my daughter.

267
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,151
Let go.

268
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,444
-It's okay.
-It's not my fault?

269
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,196
-Then whose fault is it?
-Stop it.

270
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,405
-Whose fault is it?
-I told you to stop.

271
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,865
Our Honeybee was taken from us!

272
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,950
Whose fault is it that our Honeybee
was taken from us?

273
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:02,910
Stop it.

274
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,330
-Just stop.
-Let go!

275
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,581
Let go of me!

276
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,499
If it's not my fault, whose fault is it?

277
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,754
If it isn't my fault,
whose fault is it supposed to be?

278
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,341
Whose fault is it
that our Honeybee was taken from us?

279
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,134
It's mine.

280
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,303
Yu-hwa, please.

281
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,222
I was the one who wouldn't give up work.

282
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,516
I didn't do anything when I got cramps.

283
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,477
I killed our Honeybee.

284
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,729
I did!

285
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,397
I did…

286
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,150
And yet…

287
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,362
I'm still here, able to eat.

288
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,572
I get to live.

289
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,700
When I couldn't even protect our baby.

290
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,331
I'm sorry.

291
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,125
Mommy is so sorry.

292
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,340
Mommy's sorry.

293
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,386
I'm sorry.

294
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,264
I'm so sorry.

295
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,526
Hi, honey.

296
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,028
Did you get there okay?

297
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,991
You must be tired
from driving all the way there.

298
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,826
You don't have to worry about me.

299
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,411
How are you feeling?

300
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,246
Are you having a hard time?

301
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,000
Going on this business trip,
leaving you home alone…

302
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,001
I'm worried.

303
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,629
It's good for me
since I can be around people.

304
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,050
I'll keep my phone on,

305
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,885
so call me if something happens.

306
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,429
Or if you need anything.

307
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,145
Yu-hwa, are you listening?

308
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,732
Honey, I have a customer.

309
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,900
I'll call you back later.

310
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,124
You!

311
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,251
It shrunk after washing it once!

312
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,419
Who's supposed to wear
this shrunken thing?

313
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,795
Go give it to your own kid!

314
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,298
-Damn it!
-Hey, what do you think you're doing?

315
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,300
And who are you?

316
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,844
Is this how they train employees here?

317
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,262
Don't you know the customer is the king?

318
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,639
What?

319
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:30,640
King?

320
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,975
King, my foot.

321
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,854
Historically, tyrants died like dogs
during revolts.

322
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,899
-Do you want your head sliced off too?
-Are you crazy?

323
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,150
Yu-hwa, are you okay?

324
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,234
Who are you?

325
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,736
Not a king. Just a customer.

326
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,489
Excuse me.

327
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,867
I want all the children's sneakers
you have in this store.

328
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,119
And could you remove
this piece of trash for me?

329
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,662
I can't shop in this racket.

330
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,332
Is that so? Yes, I'll take the trash out.

331
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,500
-Let's go.
-Hey!

332
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,251
Let's go, quickly.
Let's get you out of here.

333
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,754
Are you okay?

334
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,842
This isn't like you. Intervening yourself.

335
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:10,305
Just think of it as your emotional boss
indulging a whim of hers.

336
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,099
People still treating others like that…

337
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,433
What has the world come to?

338
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:25,195
Could you send these over to an orphanage?
Anonymously.

339
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,572
Does the company
do this sort of thing too?

340
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,449
I do, occasionally.

341
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:34,996
But people say it must be
an anonymous donor, or Santa Claus.

342
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,997
But then again,

343
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,291
I guess it doesn't really go
with the image of Grim Reapers.

344
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,503
I'll be sure to remember this
when I go back to the Land of the Living.

345
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,547
Thank you.

346
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,756
That's right.

347
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,467
What's it like working alone with Ms. Koo?
Tough, huh?

348
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,638
Which one are you asking about?
Work or Ms. Koo?

349
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,807
Both.

350
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,476
It's neck and neck.

351
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,438
You make me laugh, Mr. Choi.

352
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,526
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

353
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:08,655
I think the afterworld is too harsh
on people who took their own lives.

354
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,372
So be sure to remember
the value of one's life.

355
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,209
Take care with the delivery.

356
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,460
Well, that's it for me.

357
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,423
Get back safe.

358
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,580
Are you okay?

359
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,749
Mr. Choi.

360
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,251
I'm just a little dizzy.

361
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,046
-I'm fine.
-You don't look fine.

362
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,714
We'll take you home.

363
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,799
I don't think it's safe for you
to go on your own.

364
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,594
You don't have to.

365
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,054
It's okay. Where do you live?

366
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,556
Let me help you up first.

367
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,519
-Thank you.
-Right.

368
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:34,741
Thank you.

369
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,077
I've caused you so much trouble today.

370
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,788
It's all right.
That's what we're here for.

371
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,499
-What?
-Rest up a bit, Ms. Lim.

372
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,959
We'll make you some porridge.

373
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,422
It's okay. You can go.

374
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,007
I'll get better if I get some rest
on my own.

375
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:54,094
Lie down. We can't leave you alone
when you're sick.

376
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,012
I'm really okay.

377
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,265
Get some rest.

378
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:18,994
Ma'am.

379
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,079
Her level is down again.

380
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,914
LIM YU-HWA, AGE 30
SALES ASSOCIATE

381
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,059
Choi Jun-woong.

382
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,103
When her level dropped the first time,

383
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,438
was it day or night?

384
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,606
Night. I'm sure of it.

385
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,735
From the way her level keeps fluctuating,

386
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,695
it must have something
to do with her dreams.

387
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,406
-Her dreams?
-Let's check it out.

388
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,325
But how?

389
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,243
We need to go in.

390
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,204
But I thought
only the Sales Team could go in.

391
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,873
-Never mind that.
-Come on, ma'am.

392
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,334
-You haven't filed a report…
-I'll call you right before I go in.

393
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,002
Bye.

394
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,472
My goodness!

395
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,975
Ms. Koo, what brings you here?

396
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,686
Where's Mr. Lim? Has he left?

397
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,481
Yes, he did his eight hours
and already went home.

398
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,024
Really?

399
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,403
I'll just borrow this.

400
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,073
Ma'am.

401
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,286
Ma'am!

402
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,704
Come on, you can't do this!

403
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,789
Ma'am!

404
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,082
Please, open the door!

405
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,423
NAME
LIM YU-HWA

406
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,434
Choi Jun-woong, I'm going in now.

407
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,815
CONNECTING

408
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,571
Are you hungry?

409
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,865
Hang on tight.

410
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:33,962
I knew it.

411
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:35,505
Yes?

412
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,508
There we go.

413
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,844
Honeybee, let's eat.

414
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,095
Get it together, Lim Yu-hwa.

415
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,556
Who are you? Let go of me!

416
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,183
Don't you know this is a dream?

417
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,437
Why are you doing this? Please stop.

418
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,105
It's a just dream!

419
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,692
How long are you going to stay here,
cuddling your fake baby?

420
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,778
If you get to a point where you can't
tell a dream from real life,

421
00:28:58,862 --> 00:28:59,821
you'll be in real danger.

422
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,452
Don't worry, Honeybee.
Mommy will protect you.

423
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,162
What a strange person.

424
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,172
You okay, Honeybee?

425
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,339
Lim Yu-hwa.

426
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:26,806
Do you understand now?

427
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,100
That this is all a dream?

428
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,106
LIM YU-HWA, AGE 30
SALES ASSOCIATE

429
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:41,196
Ms. Lim, what is it?

430
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,620
Go. You'll wake my Honeybee.

431
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,121
Snap out of it.

432
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,706
That's not Honeybee.

433
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,708
Don't do this, please!

434
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,293
No, that's not true.

435
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,961
How long are you going to
keep escaping to your dreams?

436
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,421
No…

437
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,591
I better wake her up.

438
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,178
Ms. Lim, please wake up.

439
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,388
You have to wake up right now, Ms. Lim!

440
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,306
Wake up.

441
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,229
What's this?

442
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,072
CHOI JUN-WOONG

443
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,077
Mr. Choi.

444
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,203
Mr. Lim.

445
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,955
It's rude to call after hours.

446
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,957
I thought it would be best
to let you know.

447
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,042
Right now, your mother, she…

448
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,395
Ms. Koo, please.

449
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,605
Open the door, ma'am.

450
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,148
You know too!
That this is nothing but a dream!

451
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,358
Ma'am.

452
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,695
Choi Jun-woong, that punk.

453
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,536
I'll do it.

454
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,539
Please, let me convince her to wake up.

455
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,458
We don't have time to coddle her.

456
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,335
You know we'll all die

457
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,086
if we get stuck here.

458
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,004
Please.

459
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,632
Let me be the one to do it.

460
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,556
Don't be scared.
There's no need to be scared…

461
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,558
Please, help me.

462
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,685
That woman keeps saying weird things.

463
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,270
She keeps following me
even when I run away.

464
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,189
Could you take her away? Please?

465
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,441
That's right.

466
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,984
Don't you think it's odd too?

467
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,737
That we're in your home like this?

468
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:29,989
"Honeybee."

469
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,909
Why are you still calling her, "Honeybee"?
What's her name?

470
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,494
Her name…

471
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:38,081
You don't know, do you?
Of course, you don't.

472
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,542
Because other than that nickname,
you never named her.

473
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:46,631
I don't know what you're talking about.
Please leave, right now.

474
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:48,925
Please!

475
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,261
-Ma'am.
-Mr. Lim!

476
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,055
You think I want to do this?

477
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,516
If Lim Yu-hwa dies like this,

478
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,018
the threads of fate
tying her to Honeybee will break.

479
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,604
Then she'll really never be able
to see her again.

480
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,481
Still, please…

481
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,650
What are you talking about?

482
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:11,990
Why would I never be able to see
my Honeybee again?

483
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:18,955
Is this…

484
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,543
really all a dream?

485
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,061
No.

486
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,403
What broke? Oh, man. Seriously?

487
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,031
Damn it.

488
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,282
Look at this.

489
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,199
What happened?

490
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,701
I think the car broke down.

491
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,078
This is driving me crazy.

492
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,246
There's a taxi.

493
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,247
-There's a taxi here.
-A taxi?

494
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,331
Let's take the taxi. Quickly.

495
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,666
Mr. Lee, to the taxi.

496
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,917
Move the patient to the taxi.

497
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,799
LIM YU-HWA, AGE 30
SALES ASSOCIATE

498
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:16,095
To the nearest hospital, please.
And hurry.

499
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,484
We don't have much time.

500
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:31,903
We have to leave soon.

501
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,122
From the moment you came to us,

502
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,667
you were our joy and our blessing.

503
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,880
I wanted to give you all the love I could.

504
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,887
I shouldn't have named you Honeybee.

505
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,432
I think she flew away

506
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,727
because I named her that.

507
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,358
You need to say goodbye to her now,

508
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,652
so that she can come again.

509
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,405
She'll grow stronger in the afterworld

510
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:18,908
and…

511
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,994
make her way back to you.

512
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,997
She doesn't know
what her mom and dad look like

513
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:28,251
because she left
after only spending time in my belly.

514
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,337
So how will she remember and return to us?

515
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,965
Babies can hear

516
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,342
and feel everything

517
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,845
while in the womb.

518
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,515
They can tell how much
their parents love them,

519
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,475
take care of them,

520
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,644
and worry about them,

521
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,231
no matter how young they are.

522
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,234
They sense it instinctively.

523
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,113
Because it's the first love
they receive in their lives.

524
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:24,932
Honeybee, thank you for coming to Mommy.

525
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,692
There we go.

526
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,571
-Look at this.
-It's so cute.

527
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,869
Hey, you're home.

528
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,207
They look delicious!

529
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,500
These are for our Honeybee.
I'll go wash them.

530
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,501
Okay. Hurry.

531
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,598
All the lovely things you told her.

532
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,184
She'll remember it all.

533
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,230
Because you're her mom.

534
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,902
Honeybee's watching you too.

535
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,197
It's just as hard on the kids

536
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,158
when they see their moms sad.

537
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,954
Because they have to see the person
who loved them so much,

538
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,581
suffering and in pain.

539
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,710
So stop feeling guilty
and let Honeybee go.

540
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,848
-Laryngoscope.
-Yes.

541
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,936
-The tube, please.
-Yes.

542
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,731
What if…

543
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,985
I forget what Honeybee looks like
as time goes on?

544
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,904
I'm her mother.

545
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,074
I shouldn't forget.

546
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,828
Despite how long I've existed,

547
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,747
I will probably never fully understand

548
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,959
the love parents have for their children.

549
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:19,505
But I know better than anyone

550
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,467
how children care and worry
for their parents.

551
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:30,558
So I know what Honeybee must be feeling
as she's watching over you.

552
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,483
You did everything you could
to protect your baby.

553
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,903
Don't feel guilty.

554
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,201
Please…

555
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,413
Live.

556
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,612
AMBULANCE ONLY ENTRYWAY

557
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,198
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

558
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,548
Ma'am…

559
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,385
Mr. Lim.

560
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,099
Good work.

561
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,267
Good work, Mr. Choi.

562
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,859
Mr. Lim.

563
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,129
Honey.

564
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,305
Are you okay?

565
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:41,814
To be honest,

566
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,984
I've been having a really hard time.

567
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,405
I secretly resented you

568
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,658
because it felt like I was the only one
hurting and having a hard time.

569
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,411
I wondered

570
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,790
how you could let
our Honeybee go so easily.

571
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,544
So I…

572
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,422
pretended to be fine too.

573
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:08,966
But…

574
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,595
that just made me feel more
and more empty inside.

575
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:17,558
Even though we're supposed to
depend on each other the most.

576
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,688
LET'S MEET AGAIN

577
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,154
Do you have anything more
you want to tell her?

578
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,781
No.

579
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,242
I'm done.

580
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,058
The message will find its way
to her, right?

581
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,434
Yes.

582
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,771
The people I met in my dream told me.

583
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,899
When you write a letter in the sand
on the beach,

584
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,068
it makes its way to the afterworld.

585
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,280
If there's something you want to tell her,

586
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,573
you can do that.

587
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,417
It's cold, isn't it?

588
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,876
Want me to get you a blanket?

589
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,211
Yes. Thank you.

590
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,046
Just a minute.

591
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,576
What?

592
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:42,536
How are you…

593
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,208
Please let me be selfish…

594
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,379
just one last time.

595
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,258
Mother.

596
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,495
Mother.

597
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:27,456
It's me.

598
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,335
Your son.

599
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:34,922
Ryung-gu.

600
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,439
I always wondered…

601
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,567
what my son would look like

602
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,237
as a grown man.

603
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,698
You've grown up to become
an even greater person

604
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,410
than I imagined.

605
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:11,542
I regretted it every moment of every day.

606
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,628
I was too young then.

607
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:17,881
Of all people, having someone like you

608
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:19,716
as my mother,

609
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,177
is humiliating,

610
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,347
shameful,

611
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,641
and disgusting!

612
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:31,687
If only I could remove that dagger
that I plunged into your heart…

613
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,274
Every moment, every day,

614
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,485
I made excuses for myself
and regretted it.

615
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,657
That's why I became a Grim Reaper.

616
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,620
To see you, even for a moment like this.

617
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,540
I didn't understand you then,

618
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,711
because I was too young.

619
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,380
I'm so sorry.

620
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,844
I didn't mean what I'd said then.

621
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:08,015
Not even once

622
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,227
have I ever regretted
being born as your son.

623
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,148
My baby.

624
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,068
Even if I…

625
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,364
go back to that moment in time,

626
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,201
I'd still have given birth to you

627
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,454
and lived as your mother.

628
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:33,624
I'm sorry…

629
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,877
that I left you all alone

630
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,379
to grow up on your own.

631
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,257
I'm sorry, Ryung-gu.

632
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,594
I don't deserve to say this,

633
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,517
but I've missed you so much, my son.

634
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:58,357
I've missed you so much, Mother.

635
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,157
I'm okay,

636
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,743
so please, forget all that pain
from the past

637
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,162
and live a happy life.

638
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,044
The fate linking you and me

639
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,047
will never bring us together again.

640
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,884
This memory will soon disappear too.

641
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:36,103
But the thread of fate between you
and Honeybee hasn't been broken,

642
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,689
so you'll be able to see her again soon.

643
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,450
So please don't worry.

644
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,290
I'll be there to protect you

645
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:58,667
in this life,

646
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:02,879
the next life, and the lives after that.

647
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,675
There's no parent in the world
who'd stand by

648
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:09,303
and watch their child
sacrifice their life for them.

649
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:13,098
It's not too late.
You can quit being a Reaper and…

650
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,728
There's more than enough reason.

651
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,772
Because you gave me

652
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,900
the gift of life, Mother.

653
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,447
Thank you.

654
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,199
Mother.

655
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,532
There were a lot of times

656
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:16,995
when I couldn't understand
why you took their sides so much.

657
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,624
You helped Woo-jin and Na-young meet too.

658
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,876
Knowing very well you'd be punished.

659
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,922
I think I understand now.

660
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,676
That you should consider their situations
as if they were your own.

661
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,596
You're making it sound so grand.

662
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,181
It's cheesy.

663
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,769
But the thing with Na-young,
that was really just me meddling.

664
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,446
LIM RYUNG-GU

665
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,408
MEASURING NEGATIVE ENERGY LEVELS

666
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,493
LIM RYUNG-GU
DOMESTIC SALES TEAM ASSISTANT MANAGER

667
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:04,960
It's good.

668
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,461
I guess they did the update.

669
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,005
What's that?

670
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,883
You can measure Negative Energy Levels
based on the current state of the soul.

671
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,553
That means we can measure
Negative Energy Levels of Reapers too.

672
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,681
But what would you know?
You're on the Sales Team.

673
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,602
So you're saying you checked mine
with that just now?

674
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:23,603
Never mind that!

675
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,939
Here, take this.

676
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:26,982
What's this?

677
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:30,318
You showed your mother her past life
without reporting it to the higher-ups.

678
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:33,321
It's a USB with an incident report sample.

679
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,490
The format's changed a bit
while you were gone.

680
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,790
I'm with the Sales Team, so…

681
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,542
Come on.

682
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:48,336
You're going to come back anyway.
Keep it. Come on.

683
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,172
Says who?

684
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,799
You just said you would consider
the situations of others

685
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:53,717
as if they were your own.

686
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,511
Ma'am, I can't hold it in any longer.

687
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,721
Hold what in?

688
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,765
While you have some talent,

689
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:02,517
you only get yourself into trouble.

690
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:06,271
So why would Ms. Koo take you back?

691
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,860
So I can use him

692
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,820
-how I want.
-How she wants.

693
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,406
So she can use you how she wants.

694
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,450
-Ma'am…
-Great teamwork!

695
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,087
What?

696
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,673
This is the first time

697
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,301
I've seen you smile like this.

698
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,680
That's why you should smile more, ma'am.

699
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:44,392
Smiling invites good fortune
and sends positive energy around like…

700
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,394
Choi Jun-woong. Just pour me a glass.

701
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,064
All right.

702
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,653
-Come on, seriously.
-Really, ma'am?

703
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:06,998
Did you enjoy your lunch break?
We will soon…

704
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:08,667
Look at this.

705
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,294
Aren't they so tiny and adorable?

706
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,297
They all came from this one here.

707
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:19,594
Doesn't it remind you of people's lives?

708
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,222
I don't know.

709
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:25,016
They all come from the same plant.

710
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,977
But it's a whole new life.

711
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,940
Just like people's lives
after reincarnation.

712
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:33,692
Yesterday,

713
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,027
we had a girl escorted here.

714
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,113
The mother lived,

715
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:39,781
and the child died.

716
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:45,954
The mother will hate herself for surviving

717
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,207
and live her whole life in regret
for what happened.

718
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:54,379
I've put the mother
on the RM Team's watch list.

719
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:57,549
I'll drop by occasionally
to see how she's doing,

720
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,676
but I'd like the RM Team
to keep an eye on her.

721
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,429
We need to get her
to live out her current life,

722
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,681
so they can meet in the next one.

723
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:06,975
I understand.

724
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:14,649
A wound like that will take more than
one reincarnation to heal.

725
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,027
The deeper the regret and the wound,

726
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:20,071
the more lives it will take to fade away.

727
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,117
You're here.

728
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,414
I called for him.

729
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,708
I heard he's having trouble sleeping.

730
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:37,172
I thought a hobby like this
might help with your insomnia.

731
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,342
Did you call me here
to show me this, ma'am?

732
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:41,885
Among other things.

733
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,512
Well, that's it for me.

734
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:08,995
What were you saying just now?

735
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:12,666
I told you. I thought it might help
with your insomnia.

736
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:16,294
The thing about how some wounds
take more than one reincarnation to heal.

737
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:20,298
Does that have something to do
with my nightmare too?

738
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:25,053
Is that how you were taught
to wield your sword?

739
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,224
I have to know.

740
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,893
What happened to me?

741
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:32,936
Exactly what happened

742
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,438
that's still bringing me pain like this?

743
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,190
I don't know.

744
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,569
Because you were the only one

745
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,655
to have lived your life.

746
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:48,159
You'd know better than me if it's karma
you need to make up for

747
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,203
or a wound you need to heal.

748
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:16,146
Sir, what brings you here?

749
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,023
I wanted to look someone up.

750
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,525
Did you get the Director's approval?

751
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:24,029
Do you need one
to view another Reaper's Book?

752
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:28,575
Yes, because privacy laws
are just as strict here at Jumadeung.

753
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,081
I'd like to take a look at my Book.

754
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,170
Just a moment, please.

755
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,559
That's odd.

756
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:59,105
You can take a look at your previous life

757
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,150
but the one before that is locked.

758
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,527
It's locked?

759
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,945
It's not common,

760
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,490
but the only person who can look at this

761
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,408
is the Director.

762
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:11,826
How so?

763
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,578
Because the Director locked it herself.

764
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,208
I'll be off then.

765
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,003
Wait.

766
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,923
Are there Reapers besides me
whose previous lives are locked?

767
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,716
Just a moment.

768
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,260
There is one more.

769
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,555
Ms. Koo Ryeon.

770
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:49,989
Dreams take a form different from reality.

771
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,324
I don't understand…

772
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,034
Most people who make the wrong choice

773
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:56,079
regret it for a long time

774
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:58,206
but eventually, they forget.

775
00:56:58,289 --> 00:56:59,749
But sometimes,

776
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:01,709
there are those who are

777
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:04,045
forever haunted by their regrets.

778
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,633
All Reapers remember
the last life they lived.

779
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,135
The same goes for me too.

780
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,971
Yes. Even though I don't want to.

781
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:16,057
In your memories of your past life,
was I there as well?

782
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:18,268
No, you were not.

783
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,241
EPILOGUE

784
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,452
These are the children
going down this time.

785
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:38,788
Hello, children.

786
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,290
-Hello.
-Hello.

787
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,749
-Hello.
-Yes.

788
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:46,588
Okay.

789
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:47,922
Before you go,

790
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:51,301
I'll read you the letters
from your parents.

791
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:52,969
-Okay.
-Okay.

792
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:01,728
Honeybee.

793
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,314
You were our blessing,

794
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,900
and our joy.

795
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,776
Mommy and Daddy

796
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,280
will bloom a lovely flower
and wait for you.

797
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,325
Could you fly to us again?

798
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,119
Let's meet again.

799
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,294
Who's Honeybee?

800
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:27,337
I am!

801
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:32,884
I see. Let's go to your mommy
and daddy now, okay?

802
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:34,010
Okay!

803
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:07,710
