1
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,225
Sir, what brings you here?

2
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,102
I wanted to look someone up.

3
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,605
Did you get the Director's approval?

4
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,108
Do you need one
to view another Reaper's Book?

5
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:11,821
Yes, because privacy laws
are just as strict here at Jumadeung.

6
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,161
I'd like to take a look at my Book.

7
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,249
Just a moment, please.

8
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,722
That's odd.

9
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,185
You can take a look at your previous life

10
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,230
but the one before that is locked.

11
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,565
It's locked?

12
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,025
It's not common,

13
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,694
but the only person who can look at this

14
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,488
is the Director.

15
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,658
-How so?
-Because the Director locked it herself.

16
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,412
I'll be off then.

17
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,083
Wait.

18
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,002
Are there Reapers besides me
whose previous lives are locked?

19
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:09,796
Just a moment.

20
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,340
There is one more.

21
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,510
Ms. Koo Ryeon.

22
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,408
ESCORT TEAM
EMPLOYEE JEON BO-YUN

23
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,831
I've been newly assigned to the team.
My name is Jeon Bo-yun, sir.

24
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,337
It's been a long time.

25
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,089
Have you finally become
a Jumadeung employee?

26
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,133
Do you remember me, sir?

27
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,719
I almost didn't recognize you.
You've changed your appearance.

28
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,724
I thought you wouldn't remember me
because I'd died when I was young.

29
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,059
You are not the only exception.

30
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,395
I remember everyone I've escorted.

31
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:11,190
I was told at the Training Center
that souls find it uncomfortable

32
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,318
if they are being escorted by a child.

33
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,945
I was told I should
present myself as an adult.

34
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,282
Do you think they'll be uncomfortable
with this hair color?

35
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,409
It's fine as long as you do your job well.

36
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,331
Is today

37
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,541
the day that person dies?

38
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,920
Yes, it is.

39
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,884
Seeing you at the end
of such a difficult life

40
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,888
will help them pass peacefully,

41
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,723
so escort them well.

42
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,892
Thank you for your consideration,

43
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:47,810
Mr. Park.

44
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,360
Mr. Park.

45
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,654
I…

46
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,864
I wanted to tell you

47
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:04,118
that you are the person
I admire the most in this world.

48
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,087
EPISODE 13: SPRING

49
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,006
-You're going to see Ms. Yoo Bok-hui?
-Yes.

50
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,884
She has been on our list for a long time

51
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,886
but her level has spiked recently.

52
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,517
It seems the RM Team and the Escort Team
are meant to work together.

53
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:28,977
For this case,

54
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,896
you are to work with
the Escort Team's new Reaper.

55
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,106
The Escort Team?

56
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,525
Why do we have to?

57
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,069
Think of it as a similar case
to Mr. Lee Young-chun.

58
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,322
Your team must save the suicide risk case,

59
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,118
while the new Escort Team Reaper
will escort the newly departed soul.

60
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,037
The soul that the new Reaper
will be escorting

61
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,623
is someone related
to Choi Jun-woong's past life.

62
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,669
-What?
-Not that he knows yet.

63
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,464
Yes. Here she comes.

64
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,635
Hello, ma'am.

65
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,724
You must be Ms. Koo.

66
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,393
-Do you know me?
-Of course!

67
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,729
You're the most famous Reaper
in Jumadeung.

68
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,606
You are renowned among the new Reapers.

69
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,691
Notorious, more like.

70
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,818
Anyway,

71
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,445
-I understand.
-Okay.

72
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,500
Say hello, everyone.

73
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,087
This is the new Reaper in the Escort Team.
She'll be working with us.

74
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,923
Gosh. A newbie?

75
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,468
I used to be like that once too, right?

76
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,014
Nice to meet you.

77
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,142
Okay. Ms. Jeon, right?

78
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,227
Working at Jumadeung is a bit hard,

79
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,812
but don't be nervous. Just relax.

80
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,856
Make yourself comfortable.

81
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,357
Okay. Thank you.

82
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,401
There are so many nice people
in the Risk Management Team.

83
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,281
Hard times really are
soon forgotten, I see.

84
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,201
-Let's get to work.
-Yes, ma'am!

85
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,162
Yoo Bok-hui.

86
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,288
91 years old.

87
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,542
Has one son and one daughter
and a husband who passed away.

88
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,712
She's well-off with no apparent problems.

89
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,380
She's on good terms
with her grandchildren too.

90
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,716
So why…

91
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,762
Who will you be escorting for this case?

92
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,976
Ms. Lee Jeong-mun desperately wants
to see Ms. Yoo Bok-hui

93
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,354
before she passes.

94
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,942
I wonder how the two know each other.

95
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,490
STATUE OF PEACE

96
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,747
MOUNTAIN

97
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,295
Ms. Yoo Bok-hui?

98
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,809
Don't worry.

99
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,895
Our team is cleaning the statue.

100
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,651
Most people just pass by the statue,
but why were you…

101
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,364
There's a childhood friend of mine

102
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,783
that I've been looking for
for a long time.

103
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,410
I've been

104
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:37,915
searching for Yun-i desperately,
hoping that it wasn't too late.

105
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,084
But she…

106
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:41,794
Yun-i…

107
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,133
I only found out recently that she was
forced to become a comfort woman.

108
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,429
May I ask how you found out about this?

109
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:57,310
My grandson is studying history
at university,

110
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,980
and he's very interested
in the Japanese Colonial Period.

111
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:05,318
I happened to look at
the pictures he printed

112
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,446
of the Imperial Japanese Army's
comfort women.

113
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,623
Among the young girls in the pictures

114
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,374
was my friend.

115
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,336
There was no way I couldn't recognize her.

116
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,380
Because she was wearing the scarf
I had given her.

117
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:30,218
It never occurred to me that Yun-i…

118
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,679
had been forced to become a comfort woman.

119
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,016
So whenever I see the Statue of Peace,

120
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,393
it reminds me of my Yun-i,

121
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:43,064
and my heart aches so much.

122
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:44,732
So when it rains,

123
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,527
I put an umbrella over her
so she won't have to sit in the rain.

124
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,986
Don't get rained on.

125
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,864
And when anyone horrible vandalizes her,

126
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,242
I wipe her clean.

127
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,953
That's how I've been living.

128
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,462
Unless I'm wrong,

129
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:11,551
I take it you two are Reapers
from the afterworld.

130
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,097
Yes.

131
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,683
How did you know?

132
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,897
I guess my senses have evolved at this age

133
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,317
because I notice things others wouldn't.

134
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,196
Not to mention the aura you both have.

135
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,618
However, we are not here to escort you.

136
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,414
-Sorry?
-Our duty is to help people live out

137
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,791
their given lifespan.

138
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,877
You were preparing to take your own life,

139
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,923
so you were wrapping up any loose ends.

140
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,759
How did you know?

141
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,177
Is it because

142
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,430
you feel guilty about Yun-i?

143
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,181
Yun-i…

144
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,350
Is Yun-i alive?

145
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,769
-Or…
-She died a long time ago.

146
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,529
If you could look here,

147
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,447
at this woman.

148
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,202
I'd like for you to meet
Ms. Lee Jeong-mun.

149
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,331
I've lived

150
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:29,170
a good and comfortable life,
so I didn't have any regrets.

151
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,134
That is until I found out that I was
the one who had sent Yun-i to that place.

152
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,391
I have no right to see her.

153
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:47,229
Because I have wronged her and Yun-i.

154
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,190
You might come to regret this even more.

155
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,942
Because time waits for no one.

156
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,072
Ms. Lee Jeong-mun
does not have long to live.

157
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,575
She is holding on to life
with great determination

158
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:04,538
because she wants to meet you,
someone who remembers Yun-i.

159
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,585
Why don't you see her before you decide?

160
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,480
Seriously, this is awful.

161
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,274
How crazy do you have to be
to vandalize this?

162
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,236
I just wish it wasn't a Korean
who did this.

163
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,571
Then it'd be like being
stabbed in the back.

164
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:51,961
Are you cold?

165
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,422
You shouldn't have taken off your jacket.

166
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,631
Well…

167
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,175
She looked a little cold.

168
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,557
By the way, how did you come to work
at the Escort Team, Ms. Jeon?

169
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,684
Isn't Mr. Park a bit scary?

170
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:11,897
I first met Mr. Park
during the Japanese Colonial Period.

171
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,859
Things were completely bleak
during that time.

172
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:18,654
We were mercilessly crushed
because our country was weak.

173
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:22,032
But isn't the afterworld divided
by country too?

174
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,159
That's right.

175
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,953
Back then, things were not easy
for Jumadeung either.

176
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,167
"Please, let me live."

177
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,336
"Let me live, please."

178
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,088
You got it exactly right.

179
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,631
If they wanted to live so much,

180
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,134
they should have been born
in the Empire of Japan!

181
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,720
That's right. Stupid Josenjings.

182
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,265
I want to see my mother and sister.

183
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,517
Please, let me return to my homeland.

184
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,060
-Please--
-Shut up!

185
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,981
What are you doing?

186
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,149
He's only a child.

187
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,485
Why do we have to go
to the Japanese afterworld?

188
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,777
Shut up!

189
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,740
What homeland or afterlife is there
for bastards who have no country?

190
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,116
The sheer arrogance of these Josenjings.

191
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,868
Rubbish.

192
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,287
You worthless Japanese bastards!

193
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,414
You are a Josenjing, a vermin!

194
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,875
How dare you insult
the Reaper of the Empire!

195
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,503
You wish to suffer pain even in death,
is that it?

196
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,172
Why do we have to follow you,

197
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,257
even after death?

198
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,300
All right.

199
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,969
If that's your wish, so be it.

200
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,888
I shall cut you all down to your souls!

201
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,014
Stop!

202
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,643
Who's there?

203
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,895
Wait!

204
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,063
That's not a departed soul.

205
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,606
What do you mean?

206
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:36,982
I am the Head Reaper of Souls

207
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,484
of the Joseon Afterworld's
Escort Management Division,

208
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,194
Park Jung-gil.

209
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:44,156
I do not want an unnecessary fight,
so just hand them over.

210
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,785
Stop talking nonsense!
Your country is gone!

211
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,294
Tell your leader.

212
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,506
Joseon's Reapers
shall take Joseon's souls,

213
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,300
and this will no longer be tolerated.

214
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,761
Get out of my way.

215
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,236
Souls of Joseon, follow me.

216
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,988
-Goodness!
-Thank you.

217
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,490
-Let's go.
-Hurry!

218
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,577
He's someone I admire the most
in this world.

219
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,371
He's the reason
I became a Reaper of Souls.

220
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,289
I see.

221
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,334
I wonder why someone like him
hates the RM Team so much.

222
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,211
I don't know.

223
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,797
I'm sure he has his reasons.

224
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,436
This way.

225
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,486
JOSEON WHORE

226
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,615
You…

227
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,119
You are Yun-i's childhood friend, right?

228
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,413
Thank you.

229
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,542
My name is Lee Jeong-mun.

230
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,795
I've been waiting for you.

231
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:13,222
I remember Yun-i telling me,

232
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,893
that she had a close friend back home.

233
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,524
I sent Yun-i to that place.

234
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,651
You?

235
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,448
Yes.

236
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,414
Even though it has been a very long time,

237
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:43,252
very few people come to find me

238
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,255
with a look in their eyes like yours.

239
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,885
I'm thinking there is a story behind it.

240
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,014
It doesn't change the fact

241
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,933
that I have wronged her.

242
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,938
Any reasons I give will only be excuses.

243
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,608
No.

244
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,029
There are people
who don't even make excuses

245
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:14,575
because they are afraid it will
shed light on the wrongs they have done.

246
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,828
It's okay.

247
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,956
You can tell me.

248
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,130
Shall we take a look?

249
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,133
-Ta-da!
-I wonder if it will turn out like yours.

250
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:36,930
Yun-i was a friend
who was like a sister to me.

251
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,606
Yun-i and I were one year apart

252
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,567
and grew up together
ever since we were little.

253
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:53,781
My family was better off,
so whenever I returned from school,

254
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:58,702
she would always ask me
what I'd learned that day.

255
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,373
Yun-i was the only one among us

256
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,294
who knew Japanese.

257
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,673
She had you to thank for that, I see.

258
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,718
Though it was a time of tragedy,

259
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,513
Yun-i and I didn't know any better
and were happy.

260
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,559
I can still clearly see

261
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,647
how we used to laugh and chat then.

262
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,190
-Good.
-Like this.

263
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,441
-There.
-Good.

264
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,400
And…

265
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,778
And you do it like this.

266
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:33,779
Yun-i!

267
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,197
Dad!

268
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,991
-I see Bok-hui is here too.
-Hello.

269
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:38,951
Hello, Bok-hui.

270
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,661
I brought potatoes. I'll boil some.

271
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,079
Sounds great!

272
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,288
Okay.

273
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,833
-It looks so good!
-It looks delicious!

274
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,835
-Hot!
-It's hot!

275
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,044
It's so hot!

276
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,130
Have a bite, Yun-i.

277
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,089
-Okay.
-Here.

278
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,048
Here.

279
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,676
-How is it? Is it good?
-Yes.

280
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,511
-Is it that good?
-You try it too, Bok-hui.

281
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,054
But…

282
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,432
those peaceful days
only lasted for a moment.

283
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,522
Yun-i's father became ill.

284
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,650
He couldn't work anymore.

285
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:17,030
After that, I happened to see an ad
in the newspaper.

286
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,702
I thought it would be
of great help to Yun-i.

287
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:24,246
-They get you a job at a factory in Japan.
-Really?

288
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,665
They provide housing and pay you well too.

289
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,084
I asked Mr. Kinosita about this.

290
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,752
-He said it was a good place too.
-Really?

291
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,629
Thanks, Bok-hui.

292
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,464
It's nothing.

293
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,634
Here, it says, "provides housing,
pays a lot."

294
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:41,430
Like an idiot, I suggested it to Yun-i

295
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,308
without even the slightest bit of doubt.

296
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,979
Here, I'll take it from here.

297
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,278
What?

298
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,197
Make sure to dress warmly.

299
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,324
But this is your favorite.

300
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,910
I'd love for you to have it.

301
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,579
When you're hungry,

302
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,706
use the money I gave you to buy good food.

303
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:11,126
Don't worry. I promise
I'll come back with lots of money.

304
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,300
I'll miss you.

305
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,219
Me too.

306
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,723
Take care, all right?

307
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,312
Time went by

308
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,023
and the country was liberated,

309
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,193
and there was yet another war.

310
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,447
Just living through all that,
I've ended up here.

311
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,953
I was lucky, so I've lived a good life.

312
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,581
I'd had this vague idea

313
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:54,127
that Yun-i would be living
a good life somewhere too.

314
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:58,173
It's too overwhelming, I can't speak.

315
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,259
I didn't know anything

316
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,469
and they dragged me in.

317
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,973
They ripped my clothes off
just to satisfy their urges

318
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,684
and did whatever they wanted,
and I couldn't bear it…

319
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,729
I can't believe
something so awful happened.

320
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:17,109
I lived during that time period too.
I've never heard of anything like that.

321
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,026
Grandma.

322
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,194
Yes?

323
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,112
This all happened.

324
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,863
What?

325
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,449
Surely…

326
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,411
Even when one woman,
who was forced to be a comfort woman,

327
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,788
found the courage
to tell the world what happened,

328
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,958
I still didn't believe it.

329
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,210
But one day,

330
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:40,757
I happened to see what my grandson
had gathered for his thesis,

331
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,343
and in one photo,

332
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,805
I found Yun-i.

333
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,521
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE IMPERIAL
JAPANESE ARMY'S COMFORT WOMEN

334
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:55,939
Ever since that day,

335
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,901
I started looking into other people
forced to become comfort women.

336
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,822
My goodness.

337
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,408
Once I faced the truth,

338
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,494
I couldn't breathe because of the guilt.

339
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:16,835
Yun-i had to suffer
such a brutal indignity

340
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,922
and eventually lost her life.

341
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,258
All because of me.

342
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,972
So I came here, even though I know
that I don't deserve to see you.

343
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,267
Because I wanted to hear about Yun-i.

344
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,356
Yun-i…

345
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,027
was such a cheerful girl.

346
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:54,289
She was someone who never gave up hope.

347
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,642
How pretty.

348
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:19,064
She was someone who would always smile

349
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:24,653
and say that if we didn't give up on life,
spring would definitely come one day.

350
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,381
I'm sure it's not a bad place.

351
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,384
Three years.
I only need to work for three years.

352
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:53,181
I don't want to go. Let me off.
I want to go home!

353
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:57,477
I don't think I can do it anymore.
I want to see my mom!

354
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,533
Thank you.

355
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,918
Is there anyone else

356
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,130
who wants to go home?

357
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,136
Me…

358
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,889
and the other girls on the truck.

359
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:41,062
We could tell we weren't simply going
to a factory.

360
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,401
Don't!

361
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,198
Get a move on!

362
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,075
Get in!

363
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,537
Hey.

364
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,538
You.

365
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,335
Just wait here.

366
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,005
They made us change

367
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,675
and took us to a long corridor

368
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,803
where they put us into rooms, one by one.

369
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,112
What is it?

370
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:16,992
Did something happen?

371
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,035
It's weird.

372
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,038
I'm not menstruating.

373
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,633
Roll up your sleeve.

374
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:40,682
Even now, soldiers are dying
for our dear Emperor.

375
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,393
I am not obligated to treat a Josenjing.

376
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,396
Everyone was worried about her.

377
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,148
-Out of the way!
-But…

378
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:52,861
it was hard for all of us
even to take care of ourselves.

379
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:58,575
I was worried I'd get beaten
if I was found taking care of her.

380
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,578
Fear got the best of me.

381
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,832
Because to them,

382
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,210
we were nothing more
than disposable items.

383
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,714
As long as we weren't too damaged
from the waist down,

384
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:16,009
they made us take soldiers until we died.

385
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:21,598
We were just disposable items that could
just be tossed over the hill when we died.

386
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,897
Go back to your room.
What if they catch you?

387
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,732
-Then,
-It's fine.

388
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:36,696
the girl who started taking care
of her first was Yun-i.

389
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,076
Hey, you over there!

390
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,660
What are you doing there?

391
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,376
Do you want to die?
How dare you try to pull tricks on me?

392
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,669
Wait here quietly!

393
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:55,256
I thought I'd do it myself
to save you the trouble.

394
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,803
If she dies, I'll take care of it.

395
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:12,816
Even after that, she'd get beaten

396
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,402
whenever she got caught
taking care of her again,

397
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:19,489
but Yun-i never stopped
taking care of her.

398
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,329
You'll exhaust yourself doing it alone.
We'll help you.

399
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,958
And one by one,

400
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:34,421
the others started to help as well.

401
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,313
Don't come any closer.

402
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:53,857
Hey.

403
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:58,069
Do you know why this is happening to you?

404
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,822
It's because you're a Josenjing.

405
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,343
The thought of having to take Imperial
Japanese soldiers even in my dreams

406
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,556
made my will to live disappear.

407
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,810
I decided to end my own life.

408
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:45,950
Jeong-mun.

409
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,245
Jeong-mun.

410
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,125
Jeong-mun!

411
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,673
Give it back.

412
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,674
Give it back!

413
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,971
Who do you think you are?

414
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,473
Why are you getting in my way?

415
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,518
How dare you? Who do you think you are?

416
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,563
I mean it, I don't want to live anymore.

417
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:33,248
That little gesture comforted me
more than I could have thought.

418
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,377
I hate this.

419
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,004
I really thought
I would succeed this time.

420
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,675
It's all your fault.

421
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:44,926
If it weren't for you…

422
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,179
I'm sorry, Jeong-mun.

423
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,811
I didn't like how she always worried
about the other girls

424
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:58,314
and constantly tried to take care of them,

425
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,818
when she couldn't even
take care of herself.

426
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,238
I didn't like how she stopped me
from killing myself.

427
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,365
Don't die.

428
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,244
Even if it's a life
no better than a beast's…

429
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,247
Even so,

430
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,000
just as spring comes after winter passes,

431
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,128
if we just hold on and wait…

432
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,756
-Then one day for sure--
-Don't hold onto such useless hope.

433
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,806
If you or I get sick…

434
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,518
we will only be shot to death.

435
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:57,582
Arirang arirang arariyo

436
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,836
-I saw her smiling, singing "Arirang."
-Going over the Arirang Pass

437
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,465
Even after she broke her arm
because a soldier hit her.

438
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:10,720
-I wondered if she'd lost her mind.
-My love, who leaves me behind

439
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,519
Jeong-mun.

440
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,651
Do you know what this is?

441
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,403
You need to show me first.

442
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,448
Ta-da! They're balsam seeds.

443
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,661
I just remembered
how my dear friend, Bok-hui,

444
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,205
and I used to dye our nails with balsam.

445
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,459
Are you going to plant them?

446
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,629
I'd like to, but they'll beat me again
if they catch me, right?

447
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,677
Jeez, you're such an idiot.

448
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,429
You can plant them to your heart's content
once you get back home.

449
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,264
What are you getting disappointed for?

450
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,518
Just hold on to them.

451
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,435
But…

452
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,023
-Okay.
-Perhaps Yun-i's hope spread to me.

453
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:10,321
I found myself dreaming of a tomorrow
that was different from today.

454
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,206
Hey.

455
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,959
You're pretty too.

456
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,212
I don't know,
I feel like I'm missing something.

457
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,296
That was close enough.

458
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,132
I'm going to come back tomorrow.
This isn't enough.

459
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,051
Maybe I'll draw a painting next time.

460
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,490
So you do know how to cry.

461
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,036
Stop crying and sit there.

462
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,537
Jeong-mun.

463
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:00,997
Come on.

464
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,217
I know because they did it to me too.

465
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,219
It'll fester if you leave it like that.

466
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,679
I'll clean it for you.

467
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,232
Jeong-mun…

468
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,572
-We endured those difficult days.
-Hey.

469
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:37,492
We depended on each other,

470
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:42,205
hoping that come tomorrow,

471
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,583
someone might come and rescue us.

472
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,678
Is it true?

473
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,013
Yes. I heard it.

474
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,765
You know it too.

475
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,975
That things are quite serious lately.

476
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,730
The soldiers are going to kill us all
to destroy the evidence.

477
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,023
So let's run away.

478
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,942
If we don't do it now, we'll really die.

479
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,335
Let's hurry.

480
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,307
This way!

481
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,476
Don't let them escape!

482
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,769
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

483
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:47,687
They aren't here.

484
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,397
Find them!

485
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,942
-Hey.
-Hey, over here!

486
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,160
Jeong-mun.

487
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,328
I'll go and buy you some time.

488
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,746
You go on ahead, all right?

489
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,623
No, Yun-i.

490
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,709
No, let's go together.

491
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:10,793
No.

492
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,171
We'll get caught like this.

493
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,464
I'm the only one who speaks Japanese.

494
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,550
I'm going to lie and say I got lost.

495
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,676
So you go on ahead.

496
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,306
Yun-i…

497
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,240
Excuse me.

498
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,160
Hey.

499
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,703
There's a Joseon girl here.

500
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,082
I lost my way.

501
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,751
Please don't kill me.

502
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,211
Is that so?

503
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,755
Hey.

504
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:10,937
We…

505
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,272
I…

506
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,485
couldn't do anything.

507
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,739
Jeong-mun, we need to go.

508
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,452
Whatever that desire to live was.

509
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,456
Whatever fear was.

510
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,709
We couldn't do anything but run.

511
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,927
Could you help me up?

512
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,804
Of course.

513
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,442
Thank you.

514
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:13,457
After walking for so long
that my shoe fell apart,

515
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,210
I arrived home.

516
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,298
Mom.

517
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,216
Dad.

518
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,468
But no one was there.

519
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:30,725
After finding out
where I had been dragged to,

520
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:35,563
my parents became ill and passed away.

521
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,777
She sure has some nerve, that girl!

522
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,990
Hasn't that girl got any shame? Jeez.

523
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,660
How dare she shows herself here?

524
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,455
The nerve of her! I can't believe it.

525
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:56,083
The look of contempt I received
from the people in my village…

526
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,171
Their words were sharper than daggers.

527
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,259
That hurt more than being kicked
by the Imperial Japanese soldiers.

528
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,723
I lived alone my whole life,

529
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,976
afraid that someone would learn
of my past.

530
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,021
I buried the memories away

531
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,523
and lived in hiding.

532
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,401
-And you've been on your own ever since.
-Yes.

533
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,279
I can't live my life lying.

534
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,364
I'm honest.

535
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,616
I was there as a comfort woman.

536
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:34,121
At first, I wondered
why she would tell the world about us.

537
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,333
I thought I would be hurt again

538
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,045
by the way people looked at me and talked.

539
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:44,006
We demand that the Japanese government
admit the truth

540
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,384
and issue a formal apology!

541
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,135
-Apologize!
-Apologize!

542
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:52,473
But there were more and more people

543
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,309
who spoke out for me, for us.

544
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,771
So I decided

545
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,817
not to be ashamed of my past

546
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,194
or hide it any longer.

547
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,825
-Because I am the victim.
-So then…

548
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,076
And then I escaped.

549
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,496
What I…

550
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,416
what we want

551
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,752
isn't such difficult a thing.

552
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:26,757
To admit the atrocities they had committed

553
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:30,761
and make it clear to the world.

554
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,474
To formally apologize for that fact.

555
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,353
But they still say things like,

556
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,023
"It's a pity. We offer our condolences,"

557
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:47,403
for the damage
that had been inflicted on us.

558
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,699
They always just skirt around the issue.

559
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:56,579
If saying things like that
is the only way they apologize,

560
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,790
then what is the point of that "apology"?

561
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,629
As long as I'm alive,

562
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:10,217
I will speak up until the very end…

563
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,431
to reveal the truth.

564
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,105
That is the only thing

565
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,984
I can do…

566
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,491
for the girls who lost their lives,

567
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,077
like Yun-i.

568
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,293
Ms. Yoo.

569
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,338
The Yun-i I know

570
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,716
would give you a warm hug

571
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:54,178
if she ever saw you again.

572
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:02,269
And she would tell you
that it's not your fault.

573
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,398
Yes.

574
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,317
So…

575
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,570
don't torture yourself anymore.

576
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,543
Ms. Jeon, are you okay?

577
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,127
You've been looking so down.

578
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,505
It's time for her to go.

579
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,299
I was hoping
she'd pass peacefully at least.

580
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,010
I'm worried about Ms. Yoo too.

581
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,388
I don't know how to comfort her.

582
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,515
You can let her meet the person
she misses for herself.

583
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,685
Who's that?

584
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,395
You can't.

585
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,564
-Allowing the dead to meet the living…
-I know.

586
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,566
It's against the company code.

587
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,443
But what if it isn't the dead

588
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,696
but a Reaper?

589
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:14,675
There is someone
who has come a long way to see you.

590
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,386
Sorry?

591
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:18,929
Me?

592
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,938
It's the Reaper who will escort
Ms. Lee Jeong-mun tonight.

593
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:31,775
She says she would like
to speak to you first, Ms. Yoo.

594
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,612
Bok-hui.

595
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,373
It's been a long time.

596
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,835
It can't be…

597
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,004
Is that you, Yun-i?

598
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:53,672
It is me.

599
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,591
Yun-i.

600
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,054
Yun-i, who used
to follow you around everywhere.

601
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,931
Mr. Jeon's daughter.

602
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,477
How is it that you're…

603
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,816
Tell your leader.

604
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,986
Joseon's Reapers
shall take Joseon's souls,

605
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,988
and this will no longer be tolerated.

606
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,532
Get out of my way.

607
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,503
Souls of Joseon, follow me.

608
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,005
-Goodness!
-Thank you.

609
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,466
-Let's go.
-Hurry!

610
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:41,553
Sir.

611
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:43,681
What is it?

612
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:47,726
Could someone young as me
become a Reaper too?

613
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,272
Is there a reason you must do so?

614
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,775
You could be reincarnated
into a happy life.

615
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:59,613
But I'll forget the girls
if I'm reincarnated, right?

616
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:01,824
I don't want that.

617
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,992
I want to remember them forever

618
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,205
and escort them in their final moments.

619
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,004
Someone as clever as you

620
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,133
will be able to pass the tests
to become a Reaper without a problem.

621
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,050
But…

622
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:23,220
you might have to wait
longer than you think.

623
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:28,434
I understand.
I can wait as long as it takes.

624
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,027
I knew you would recognize me.

625
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,990
I can't believe I'm seeing you again.

626
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:46,910
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

627
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:51,582
I'm sorry, Yun.

628
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,042
I'm so sorry.

629
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:58,839
I know you can't forgive me, but…

630
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,094
I won't forgive you.

631
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,473
Because there's nothing
to forgive you for.

632
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,478
You didn't do anything wrong.

633
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,068
I'm truly glad that you have a happy life.

634
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:25,699
So please, continue to live a good life,
just as you have been until now.

635
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,705
Let's go see Jeong-mun now.

636
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:35,626
Choi Jun-woong.

637
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,211
You go in too.

638
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,713
You'll find out why once you go in.

639
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:42,424
Okay.

640
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:10,577
You must be the Reaper here for me.

641
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,372
Yes.

642
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,834
How can I leave now?

643
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,504
I promised Yun-i,

644
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:25,801
and the girls who passed before me,

645
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,012
that I would see those bastards

646
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:33,308
apologize with my own eyes.

647
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,978
And if I go now,

648
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:41,149
I'll be too ashamed to face them
in the afterworld.

649
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:45,279
Please, I beg you.

650
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,114
Please…

651
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,159
You don't have to carry that burden alone.

652
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,620
That burden you've carried,

653
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:57,791
we'll live on and carry it instead.

654
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:06,466
Now that I see you,
you look exactly like him.

655
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,052
Sorry?

656
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:13,682
No matter how many years have passed,
I'll never be able to forget.

657
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,357
Stop! Over there!

658
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:24,067
Don't let them escape!

659
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,654
Don't make this more troublesome!

660
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,864
I've caught you, at last.

661
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:31,241
You little brat!

662
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,326
How dare you!

663
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:33,952
I'm sorry!

664
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,750
Josenjing.

665
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:45,339
Who's there?

666
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,784
I'm sorry. We should have come sooner.

667
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,078
Let's go.

668
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,290
We'll take you somewhere safe.

669
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,587
Thank you

670
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,798
for saving us.

671
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:32,344
Thank you for fighting for our country.

672
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,352
Killing a few soldiers like this
won't bring the country independence.

673
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,980
But it's thanks to people like you,
who have bravely endured through it all…

674
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,821
that we don't lose hope.

675
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,204
JOSEON WHORE

676
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,086
Let's go.

677
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:16,471
He saw us and cried

678
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,559
just as you are crying now.

679
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,479
I don't know, ma'am.

680
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,314
I don't remember.

681
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,276
But I'm…

682
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,903
going to shout it out.

683
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,198
To not forget and remember.

684
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:40,036
So you don't have to hold on so hard

685
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:43,957
to that painful life anymore.

686
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,419
You can let it go now

687
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,630
and rest easy, ma'am.

688
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,221
It's Yun-i, ma'am.

689
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,348
The person you wanted to see so much.

690
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,308
What?

691
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,560
What do you mean it's Yun-i?

692
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:05,937
Wait…

693
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,439
That scarf.

694
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,865
Jeong-mun…

695
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:17,908
What?

696
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:22,245
It's understandable for you
to not recognize me.

697
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,916
My face was always swollen back then.

698
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:29,419
And I took on an adult form
after I became a Reaper.

699
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:35,926
Jeong-mun.

700
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,094
Do you remember this?

701
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:40,931
The day these marks were carved onto me,

702
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,810
when I was crying by myself.

703
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,436
So you do know how to cry.

704
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:51,358
I know because they did it to me too.
It'll fester if you leave it like that.

705
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,901
I'll clean it for you.

706
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:05,205
You wiped it clean, drop by drop.

707
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:07,958
Yes. That's right.

708
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,292
That's right.

709
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,002
So it is you, Yun-i.

710
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,547
It is you, Yun-i.

711
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,136
I'm sorry.

712
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,015
I shouldn't have left you behind
like that.

713
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:30,814
When I think of
what you must have gone through, I…

714
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:34,317
I never regretted that, not even once.

715
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:42,367
It must have been so hard,
to keep the fight going.

716
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,247
A lot of people helped.

717
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:53,128
It wasn't hard at all when I thought
of how you and all the girls

718
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,298
would be watching me.

719
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,427
Back then and even now,

720
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,097
we were always together, weren't we?

721
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,142
Right.

722
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,228
We were always together.

723
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,064
Jeong-mun.

724
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:14,858
Like what Mr. Choi said,

725
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:17,110
you don't have to bear the burden
on your own anymore.

726
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,654
You can let it all go.

727
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,991
You can rest easy now.

728
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:35,629
Bok-hui, don't cry.

729
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,761
You still have a lot of time left.

730
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,055
Let's greet each other smiling
when we meet again.

731
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:56,524
Jeong-mun.

732
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,443
Let's go now.

733
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,697
Where warm spring will greet us.

734
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:04,866
Yes.

735
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:29,224
YOO BOK-HUI, AGE 91

736
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:38,149
MS. LEE JEONG-MUN, FORCED TO
BECOME COMFORT WOMAN

737
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,609
BY IMPERIAL JAPANESE ARMY, PASSES AWAY

738
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,610
12 SURVIVORS REMAIN

739
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:50,036
Thank you for all you've done.
Rest in peace now.

740
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,415
I hope you'll forget all of the painful
memories and be happy where you are now.

741
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,419
You friggin idiots.

742
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:59,879
Those comfort women all went voluntarily.

743
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,131
What the heck?

744
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:04,426
Demanding a true apology based solely
on the words of senile women?

745
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:05,677
This bastard must be out of his mind.

746
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,471
They parade these geezers around
whenever there's an event

747
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,890
and when they die, they try to
manipulate us with their deaths.

748
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,684
What's this country come to?

749
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,436
Must be a sad day for the politicians.

750
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,646
Since they keep dying one by one
when they still need to use them.

751
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,189
Pathetic humans.

752
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,693
Those fools will get
their punishment once they get here.

753
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:49,888
I promise to remember.

754
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,099
I promise.

755
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:34,599
MONUMENT OF PEACE
WE WILL NEVER FORGET

756
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,603
EPILOGUE

757
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:40,522
I'm sorry

758
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:43,566
but I'm also grateful.

759
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,362
For never giving up

760
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,823
and living on without losing hope.

761
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:53,493
But there is still much left to do
in the Land of the Living.

762
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:57,288
Are you worried about those still there?

763
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,833
Those who wish to hide the truth

764
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,460
will want the world to forget

765
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,796
and the truth to be distorted.

766
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:08,049
But it's fine.

767
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,760
As long as many more people remember,

768
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,930
we will never lose.

769
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:16,057
Yes.

770
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:20,728
Because the truth
is stronger than anything else.

771
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,022
Right.

772
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,609
I gave Reaper Jeon Bo-yun special leave.

773
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:30,864
Why don't you all
visit your hometown together?

774
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,709
-Jeong-mun!
-Jeong-mun!

775
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,669
Yun-i!

776
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:46,504
-Goodness!
-It's you!

777
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:47,505
I missed you!

778
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,218
I see you've all gained some weight.

779
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,553
-Come on!
-Why would you say that?

780
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,054
You're so mean!

781
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,389
No, you all look wonderful.

782
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,641
It's been a long time.

783
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,768
Shall I go and fatten up too?

784
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:01,811
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

785
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:02,937
Let's go!

786
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,105
Be careful, be careful.

787
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,608
Let's go!

788
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,569
It's so pretty.

789
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,363
Do you put it on your hand?

790
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,201
What's this? This is terrible.

791
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,952
Don't worry, I'll make it look good.

792
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,996
That's what you always say.

793
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,080
This is hard.

794
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,041
Stay still.

795
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,461
-It's done.
-I'll unwrap it.

796
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,296
Hey, stay still.

797
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,131
Fine, I'll help you.

798
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,758
-Ta-da!
-You did such a good job, Yun-i.

799
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,801
-Good job.
-What happened here?

800
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:34,886
-Look at this.
-Mine turned out better.

801
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,679
-It's good.
-It is, isn't it?

802
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,431
But we still have this hand left.

803
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,766
I can see that Ms. Koo
is having a hard time,

804
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:23,977
but I don't think she'll ever tell me why.

805
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,396
I see you are now ready
to look into Ryeon's pain.

806
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:28,565
The barbarians have crossed the border
and are pillaging villages.

807
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,275
He asked for your help.

808
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,526
You must live.

809
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:34,362
We shall be able to return home,
as long as we are alive.

810
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:37,282
Did you hear?
About the Chief Officer's wife?

811
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:39,951
They say she's pregnant
with a barbarian's child.

812
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:41,995
Do you think your own life

813
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,955
is worth more
than the honor of this family?

814
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:44,872
You must decide.

815
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:48,293
Whether you'll die with honor
or die by someone else's hand.

816
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:51,838
