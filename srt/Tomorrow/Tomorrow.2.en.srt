EPISODE 2: FALLEN FLOWER 2

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,127
Why are you being like this over memories?

3
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,378
What are your memories like?

4
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,713
Do you only have good ones?

5
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:48,882
No, not exactly.

6
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,843
It could be very unpleasant or very scary.

7
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,344
That's what it's like in memories.

8
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,097
If you're scared, wait here.

9
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,520
You're forgetting how brave
and unyielding and confident I am.

10
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,564
I saved a person.

11
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,441
I don't want to observe
a team that hates me this much.

12
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,359
I won't observe, then. I won't observe.

13
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,446
You're still talking,
so I assume you're scared.

14
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,864
You just stay here.

15
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,949
I'm not scared.

16
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,785
I'll observe.

17
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,496
Remember, you said you'd do it.

18
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,165
I'm warning you.

19
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,752
When you go in, don't touch anything
and don't butt in.

20
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:04,999
Okay.

21
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,978
Ma'am…

22
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,408
Hey.

23
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,826
It's the writer, Kim Hye-won.

24
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,327
Kim Hye-won…

25
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,333
You can't bump into them.

26
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,293
Or touch them.

27
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:51,129
If they become aware of us,
we get trapped in their memories.

28
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,755
Then we'll never be able to leave.

29
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,141
I guess…

30
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,352
Ms. Noh and Ms. Kim
went to the same school.

31
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,983
This is annoying.

32
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,571
He must be busy, Hye-won.

33
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,657
Just dump him and find someone else.

34
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,658
Whatever.

35
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,328
NOH EUN-BI

36
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,873
-Did you watch "Infinite Challenge"?
-Yeah, it was so funny.

37
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,208
Mr. Park is so funny in Muhan Company!

38
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,377
I know. For me, it was Jung Jun-ha.

39
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,422
His hair looks like a mussel.
It's so funny.

40
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,674
How funny would it be
if we actually saw them?

41
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,426
So it was funny?

42
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,428
-So it was?
-So it was?

43
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,387
I want to see--

44
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,473
Hey.

45
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,516
Are you laughing at me?

46
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,143
Are you?

47
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,937
Are you laughing at me?

48
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,994
Your life must be really fun.

49
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,205
I'm bored as shit with life.

50
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,458
Laugh as much as you want.

51
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,128
I'm sorry. Really.

52
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,174
-I wasn't laughing at you.
-Laugh like you did back there.

53
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,968
Laugh!

54
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,387
Hey, laugh. I'm telling you, laugh.

55
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,138
Laugh.

56
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,348
She says laugh!

57
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,183
Get out of the way.

58
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,435
Hey.

59
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,603
Listen closely.

60
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,401
From now on,

61
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,945
laugh whenever you hear this,
no matter what.

62
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,411
Laugh!

63
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,538
What the hell?

64
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,623
-Hold it in.
-How am I supposed to?

65
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,584
I told you not to
touch anything or interfere.

66
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,296
Do you want to get stuck here?

67
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,718
Damn it.

68
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,929
We'll end the class here.

69
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,686
We'll have a quiz next class
on what we've studied so far,

70
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:12,770
so be prepared.

71
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,899
Quiet!

72
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,443
Oh, you kids.

73
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,279
Well, Eun-bi looks happy.

74
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,282
-What?
-What?

75
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,744
See you next class.

76
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,840
NOH EUN-BI IS PATHETIC
NOH EUN-BI IS TRASH

77
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,467
NASTY
GET LOST

78
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,417
Eun-bi! What happened?

79
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,422
Are you all right?

80
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,470
Let's tell the teacher, okay?

81
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,766
But it's too hard on you
to keep going on like this.

82
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,064
What's this?

83
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,690
I'm jealous.

84
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,653
You can't leave me out, can you?

85
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,570
What is it?

86
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,158
I've decided.

87
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,327
Eun-bi.

88
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,704
From now on, I won't play with you.

89
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,748
I'll play with her.

90
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,584
How's that?

91
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,502
Aren't you happy?

92
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,420
You're free now.

93
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:07,844
It's okay, right?

94
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,056
Eun-bi.

95
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,954
Fine.

96
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,916
I hope we get along, friend.

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,168
Come with us.

98
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:41,502
Eun-bi.

99
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:44,922
Eun-bi!

100
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,176
No.

101
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,432
-Do you want to die?
-No, I'm…

102
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,809
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,269
No.

104
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,854
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,858
I'm begging you.

106
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,486
I'm sorry.

107
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,246
Gosh.

108
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,506
Let's go.

109
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,349
Eun-bi.

110
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,909
I'm telling you.

111
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,453
-Not again?
-It's not.

112
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,914
Hey.

113
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,083
There we go.

114
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,640
This is so funny.

115
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,989
Damn.

116
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:33,906
Hey.

117
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,617
-It's going to smell like milk here.
-Come on.

118
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,535
Damn it.

119
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,078
It's all over me.

120
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,913
-Is it on you?
-What the hell?

121
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:41,914
Hey--

122
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,332
Are you sure it's not on me?

123
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,212
Who are you?

124
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,175
If they become aware of us,
we get trapped in their memories.

125
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,769
SAEBIT GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL
THE 16TH PARENTS' ASSOCIATION

126
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,945
Choi Jun-woong!
We need to get out of here. Hurry!

127
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,201
-Where do we need to go?
-To the place we entered from!

128
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,255
Ma'am, the door…

129
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,465
What do we do now?

130
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,551
We need to find a door
that can create a keyhole.

131
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,831
CLASS MOTTO
A HARMONIOUS CLASS, GRADE 2 CLASS 1

132
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,710
-Noh Eun-bi sucks.
-Noh-bi is an ugly hobo.

133
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,128
Why are you alive, Eun-bi?

134
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,672
-Eun-bi is un-recyclable trash.
-Get lost.

135
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,423
Noh Eun-bi is an ugly hobo.

136
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,140
What is this?

137
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,558
Get over it.

138
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,395
If you can't…

139
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,503
Hey.

140
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,051
JUNG JUN-HA HAS SIGNED IN AT WORK

141
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,720
WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO SELL?

142
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,476
I think this is the first time
I'm seeing her smile.

143
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:45,885
Got it!

144
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:06,906
Are you okay?

145
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,617
I told you not to do anything!

146
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,828
How could I not do anything?
Ms. Noh almost died.

147
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,413
It was just her memory!

148
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,539
I mean, I…

149
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,709
My body reacted
before I could think about that.

150
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,462
I'm sorry.

151
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,505
Give me the key.

152
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:25,716
Here.

153
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,895
Why is it broken?

154
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,816
But I picked it up quickly
and opened the door, you know…

155
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,319
Bite down on your teeth.

156
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,958
Right, Hye-won. I heard you did
an interview on Celebrity.

157
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,418
Kim Hye-won!

158
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,462
You're famous now.

159
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:08,384
Your webtoon gets all those views,
and now that you're on TV,

160
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,427
you're on your way
to becoming a real celebrity!

161
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,930
-Celebrity.
-Come on, you two.

162
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,848
If you want, I'll give you my autograph.

163
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,226
Gosh, you show-off.

164
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,728
Right. Wasn't Noh Eun-bi there?

165
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,313
She's a TV writer there.

166
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,524
Noh Eun-bi? Who?

167
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,526
Goodness, she doesn't remember.

168
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,152
You scare me.

169
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,654
What are you talking about?

170
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,656
You know, click-click.

171
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,661
That loser…

172
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,579
Was that Noh Eun…

173
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,289
That was her?

174
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,668
I didn't recognize her at all.
What a small world.

175
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,088
There's no way she didn't recognize you.

176
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,089
That's weird.

177
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,258
What, did she blow me off?

178
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,386
She must have been scared.
You really did a number on her.

179
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,681
What are you talking about? Me? When?

180
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,916
Above all,

181
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,585
I want my book…

182
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,382
to bring some comfort
to victims of school bullying.

183
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,057
AS MS. KIM SAYS, WE HOPE ALL VICTIMS ARE…

184
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,975
I have no wish to defend bullies.

185
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,898
They upended the victim's life.

186
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,743
WE SEND A MESSAGE OF HOPE TO ALL VICTIMS…

187
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,495
Laugh!

188
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,336
BOKSUN

189
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,881
WE SEND A MESSAGE OF HOPE TO ALL VICTIMS,

190
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:14,551
AND HOPE THAT SOMEONE
LIKE BOKSUN WILL SHOW UP SOMEDAY

191
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,401
Why is the bully happy and the victim so…

192
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,196
There was something broken about her.

193
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,281
She was trapped in the past.

194
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:37,783
Like a prisoner.

195
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,161
Unable to forget, like a fool.

196
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,746
How could someone forget that?

197
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,207
Do they disappear like wounds
or clouds clearing up?

198
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,586
I even addressed her formally.

199
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,588
She's barely human!

200
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,257
How can someone do that?

201
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,675
Did she really not remember?

202
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,260
Doesn't she have a conscience?

203
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,678
Can't she feel guilt?

204
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,680
Those who stomp on others don't remember.

205
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,765
Only those who get stomped on remember.

206
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,601
Anyway…

207
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,437
What do we do with Ms. Noh?
She has an interview tomorrow.

208
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,076
I'm back. Did you get
a good look at her memories?

209
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,370
Oh, it was scary. We almost got trapped.

210
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,122
-And whose fault is that?
-Sorry.

211
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,708
It must have been rough.

212
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,004
No luck finding it today either?

213
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:33,797
No.

214
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,217
Let's get to work.

215
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,142
What's that about?

216
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,952
I didn't know you were that Eun-bi.

217
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:10,876
You're so surprised.

218
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,502
Lighten up.

219
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,963
Or someone might think I harassed you.

220
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,430
Smile, Eun-bi.

221
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,599
You're good at that, right?

222
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,192
It might have been…

223
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,488
just a moment for you,

224
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,491
but for me…

225
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,413
it's been a lifetime.

226
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,207
The trauma.

227
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,341
Well…

228
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,385
Noh Eun-bi!

229
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,512
You've sure grown up!

230
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,268
You couldn't even look at me
in the eyes back then.

231
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,314
Eun-bi…

232
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,441
don't get cute.

233
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,485
Just…

234
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,155
do nothing like you did back then, got it?

235
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,383
That should do it.

236
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,342
Thank you.

237
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,596
I knew you looked familiar.

238
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,140
Why didn't you say anything?

239
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,684
I didn't recognize her at first.

240
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,729
Did you know we went to the same school?
It's a small world.

241
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:59,276
I mean, we had our arguments
since we were both young.

242
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,904
But looking back,
it was all just nothing, wasn't it?

243
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,622
Choi Jun-woong, prepare to shoot.

244
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,713
And stop glaring.

245
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,345
Shall we begin the interview, then?

246
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,242
What was that?

247
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,536
My hearing is a bit sensitive.

248
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,622
That sound was bothering me.

249
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,459
Sorry. I didn't know that.

250
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,835
I'll be careful from now.

251
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,642
I told you not to interfere.

252
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,603
Then am I supposed to just listen?

253
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,313
Yes. Just listen.

254
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:21,316
If you had seen Ms. Noh's memories,
you wouldn't be able to stand that noise.

255
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,818
Rein it in.

256
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,028
Our job now is
to prevent Ms. Noh's suicide.

257
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,323
Right. We aren't here
to punish Kim Hye-won.

258
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,952
Thanks to you,
the future of our team is dark.

259
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,078
What are you on about?

260
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:36,331
You just had to destroy
the Key of Memory, didn't you?

261
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:39,084
That means we can't go
into anyone else's memory anymore.

262
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,503
That.

263
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,797
All right. I'm sorry.

264
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,057
Are you so sick that you've gone crazy?

265
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,977
We need to air this today.
What the hell are you talking about?

266
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:58,937
The show…

267
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:03,316
Can't we just not air it?

268
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,361
Are you insane?

269
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:07,946
You want dead air?

270
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,989
Kim Hye-won.

271
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,241
She shouldn't be on TV.

272
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,828
Do you know how much she tormented me
when we were at school?

273
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:15,745
So…

274
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:19,082
Kim Hye-won bullied you a little
back when you were in school.

275
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,668
You want dead air because
of something that happened ages ago?

276
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,006
Ms. Noh, do you have no sense
of responsibility as a TV writer?

277
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:29,009
I mean, what kind of a professional
gets hung up on a personal matter?

278
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,386
What are you, a kid?
So you fought a bit at school…

279
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,471
Stop blaming others for everything,

280
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,391
and think about why
things happened the way they did!

281
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,483
Why did you hang up?

282
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,653
Tattling like you did back then?

283
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,283
Why? Do you think they'll help this time?

284
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,745
Goodness.

285
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,497
Your face tells me otherwise.

286
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,584
He must have also asked
if you were the problem.

287
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,127
Like our teacher.

288
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,514
Eun-bi.

289
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,977
The world is all the same.

290
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,481
Whether it's at school or at work,

291
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,734
no one sides with losers

292
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,069
like you.

293
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,697
So…

294
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,449
laugh, Eun-bi.

295
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,411
Laugh.

296
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,498
Laugh!

297
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,500
Will you?

298
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,713
Stop.

299
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:50,966
Stop it.

300
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,806
Damn it.

301
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,603
Ms. Noh?

302
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,735
It's serious.

303
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,320
What do we do?

304
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,239
We stop it.

305
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,032
NOH EUN-BI, AGE 29
TV WRITER

306
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:59,576
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY
ROOF ACCESS FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY

307
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,434
Ms. Noh!

308
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:27,395
Don't do it! This isn't right.

309
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,357
Leave me alone.

310
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,443
-Let go of me.
-Why should you suffer?

311
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,945
Why should you suffer
when you're the victim?

312
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,447
Don't go out there.

313
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,992
I'll help you however I can.

314
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:47,916
No.

315
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,587
No one ever helps because…

316
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,507
they're scared it'll affect them.

317
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,010
It's the same then and now.

318
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,721
Nothing has changed.

319
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,143
It's like a tunnel

320
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,187
with no end.

321
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,276
I just can't escape!

322
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:21,991
So…

323
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:25,120
you've decided to jump
from the roof and die?

324
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,330
Is that really the best way?

325
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,167
Okay, then. Die.

326
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,753
If you feel like death is the answer,

327
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:35,630
then die.

328
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,688
Didn't you already
decide to die on your way up?

329
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,607
What?

330
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,694
Are you scared? Now that you're here?

331
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:03,158
Or are you whining so someone will notice
that you're having a hard time?

332
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,162
Am I…

333
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,290
whining?

334
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,459
Are you insane?

335
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,878
What are you doing?

336
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,838
Take him and go.

337
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,382
Who do you think you…

338
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,717
Wait.

339
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,634
Ms. Noh!

340
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,890
What do you think you're doing?

341
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,476
I thought you guys were Reapers
who saved people!

342
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,102
You can't say things like that!

343
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,689
Why don't you just push her to her death?

344
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,777
Calm down and leave it to Ms. Koo.

345
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,737
Damn it!

346
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,449
With time,
you should've forgotten about it.

347
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,284
If you couldn't,
you should've overcome it.

348
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,788
You think everything
will be over if you die?

349
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,373
At least it'll hurt less…

350
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,960
than it does now.

351
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,213
You're right.

352
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,216
It's up to you

353
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,301
whether you live or die.

354
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,539
Try to get over it.

355
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,582
If you can't, try harder.

356
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,085
Have you ever thought of overcoming it?

357
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,713
They bully you because you're so weak

358
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,049
and because you don't have the will

359
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,509
or the bravery to fight.

360
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,221
It's because you're an easy target.

361
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,306
An easy target.

362
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,394
Your existence itself is
a nuisance to everyone!

363
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,731
How can she say that…

365
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,746
You're telling me
you can save people that way?

366
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,373
Leave it to Ms. Koo.

367
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,375
I heard the RM Team was recently created.

368
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,795
We're doing our best.

369
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,547
Are you sure?

370
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,884
That you can save people this way?

371
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,144
Jun-woong!

372
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,407
So what…

373
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,328
So…

374
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,872
What do you want me to do?

375
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,418
How can you say that to me
when you don't know anything?

376
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,296
I tried so hard…

377
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,174
to escape…

378
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:13,139
and live my life.

379
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:19,479
For me,

380
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,983
even smiling was traumatic.

381
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,862
Do you know

382
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,699
how hard I tried to smile again?

383
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:37,121
Do you know what I went through…

384
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,500
to endure things for this long?

385
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,133
But…

386
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:52,804
It doesn't work.

387
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:56,432
Is that so? I'll ask you once again.

388
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:00,687
Do you think everything will end
once you die?

389
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:16,119
I want to live.

390
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:22,375
I want to live too.

391
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,713
I don't want to die.

392
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:35,555
I don't want to die like this either!

393
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,606
Think about the things

394
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,151
I've just said.

395
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,903
About who said those things.

396
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:55,867
Get over it.

397
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,618
Try to get over it.

398
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,536
Try.

399
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,121
If you can't, try harder.

400
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,456
If you can't, try harder.

401
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,250
I WANT TO DIE
I'M SCARED

402
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:09,338
These are the things you said
to yourself every night.

403
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,675
Who…

404
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,677
Who are you?

405
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,180
I'm the person here to save you.

406
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,057
No.

407
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,269
I'm a Grim Reaper.

408

WRITERS SO JU-YEONG,
HAM JEONG-IN, NOH EUN-BI

409

410
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:11,734
You'll live.

411
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,127
I shouldn't have worn heels.

412
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,337
How…

413
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,506
How was it?

414
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:34,632
Falling?

415
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,477
What did you do wrong?

416
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:50,148
Aren't the bullies who made you suffer
for no reason the ones in the wrong?

417
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,152
So get up. This isn't your end.

418
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,990
Do you think you'll be happy
if you avoid misery?

419
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:02,618
There's no salvation
unless you save yourself.

420
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,419
So don't ever let anyone

421
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,921
treat you horribly.

422
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,240
The number…

423
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,785
isn't quite out of the danger zone yet.

424
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,288
Is this a success or a failure?

425
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,333
If it's a failure,
are we really getting dissolved?

426
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:52,585
Gosh.

427
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,629
Jeez, okay.

428
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,803
JUNG JUN-HA COMES TO WORK

429
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,184
I see.

430
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,937
You must be pretty surprised to see me.

431
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:14,023
You don't look all that happy to see me,

432
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,858
but I'm happy to meet you.

433
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:21,072
I wish you'd smile,
but you don't smile often, do you?

434
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,531
I see.

435
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,578
Mr. Jung

436
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,122
That is your life and mine

437
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,540
Mr. Jung

438
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,295
Look at that?

439
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,922
You laughed!

440
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,967
I can tell you're my fan
because you laughed!

441
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,219
Okay, I see.

442
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,806
Can I go now?

443
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,101
I see.

444
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,603
-Thank you, Mr. Jung.
-Sure thing!

445
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,238
Ms. Noh.

446
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,418
Laugh.

447
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,005
Laugh like you did back then.

448
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:29,932
Thank you.

449
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,310
For hanging in there.

450
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,230
For not giving up.

451
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,859
Thank you.

452
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,082
Ma'am.

453
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,668
I've never seen this color before.

NOH EUN-BI, AGE 29
TV WRITER

455
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,300
What does it mean?

456
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:07,762
Right.

457
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,348
I've ordered the Tech Team

458
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,975
to upgrade that app, The Red Light.

459
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,561
Noh Eun-bi…

460
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,813
probably won't try to kill herself.

461
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,107
Not again.

462
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,904
So it means we succeeded.

463
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,580
She never fully explains anything.

464
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,181
The weather should be nice tomorrow.

465
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,524
But…

466
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,195
But what if we had actually failed?

467
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,905
What would've happened to Ms. Noh?

468
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:13,202
She would have gone to hell,
walking forever in endless regret,

469
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,664
listening to those still living mourn.

470
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,417
That sounds really harsh.

471
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,336
What did Ms. Noh do to get punished?

472
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,172
It's not a punishment but a price.

473
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,091
The price of a choice.

474
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:30,845
A choice made by those who are
more afraid of tomorrow than of death.

475
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,348
So they pay the price
by walking in regret.

476
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,021
You two go home.

477
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,274
What?

478
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,195
Where's Ms. Koo going?

479
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,325
This is where things
really get started for her.

480
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,046
Ms. Kim, please come to the set now.

481
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:06,964
Okay.

482
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,184
Ms. Koo?

483
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,695
I'll give you one final chance.

484
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,864
Apologize to Eun-bi sincerely.

485
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,409
This is so annoying.

486
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,455
Why are you doing this now?
What do you want me to do?

487
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,541
I gave you a chance.

488
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,751
But you just

489
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,045
refused it.

490
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,505
Whatever.

491
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,887
People like you always say
you were just joking,

492
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,056
after trampling on someone's soul.

493
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,226
But it's hell for those
on the receiving end.

494
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,352
Do you know that?

495
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,854
-I'm dying…
-Hang in there!

496
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,941
You haven't suffered even a bit
of the pain Eun-bi has felt.

497
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,081
Your life must be really fun.

498
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,042
I'm bored as shit with life.

499
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,381
Laugh as much as you want.

500
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:39,723
Laugh!

501
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,767
Hey, laugh. I'm telling you, laugh.

502
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:43,686
Laugh.

503
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,312
-Stop, stop.
-Laugh!

504
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,816
Please stop.

505
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,114
Hey.

506
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,032
Listen closely.

507
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:00,703
From now on,

508
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,788
laugh whenever you hear this,
no matter what.

509
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,301
What is this?

510
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:19,763
Help.

511
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,141
Help.

512
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,811
I'm sorry.

513
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,355
Please, I'm sorry.

514
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,648
Please don't…

515
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,910
I'm sorry.

516
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,705
I won't ever again…

517
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,214
Please let me live.

518
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,051
It was barely a moment,
and you're begging for your life?

519
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,678
When Eun-bi endured that hell,

520
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,973
crying every day
until she thought about killing herself.

521
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:10,064
Kim Hye-won, the author
of the popular webtoon Boksun,

522
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:13,192
a webtoon about punishing
bullies on behalf of the victims,

523
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,444
is causing a public outcry
as it's been revealed

524
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:19,448
that she was a bully
when she was a student.

525
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,158
An online discussion board
has revealed Ms. Kim's…

526
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,076
No.

527
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,120
From now on, you'll be hated
by those who have never met you,

528
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,290
And those words will eat into your soul.

529
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,876
Still, it would be better for you to live.

530
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:34,672
Because the Hell you'd go to
after death is much more horrifying.

531
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,314
What will Hye-won do now?

532
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,857
What do you think?

533
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:54,900
She's screwed.

534
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:55,984
Good.

535
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,737
She was such a show-off.
She brought it on herself.

536
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:01,323
You don't think we'll get roped
into it as well, do you?

537
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,699
What did we do?

538
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,660
Right. What did we do?

539
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:08,580
You did a lot.

540
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,420
Now, it's your turn.

541
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:32,271
Ms. Kim is remaining silent
on the allegations of bullying.

542
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,773
On another note,
the producers of Celebrity

543
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:38,402
had known about this fact
and yet still decided to air the program,

544
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:41,822
despite the fact that one
of the staff members was a victim,

545
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,615
causing great shock.

546
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,451
Even if such allegations
are found to be true,

547
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:48,287
it will be difficult to take legal action
as much time has passed.

548
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,080
If there is no proof,
those who have come forward…

549
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,583
Yes, this is Noh Eun-bi.

550
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:56,837
It is the victims who are suffering
silently even today.

551
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,964
If you need further information,

552
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,425
I'll do an interview.

553
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,459
I told you it'd work out.

554
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,503
You did cut it close, though.

555
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,464
I wondered why…

556
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:45,219
Why you're suddenly pressuring me,
threatening to dissolve the team.

557
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:49,556
Why else? I want you
to meet that person already.

558
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,395
The person you really need to save.

559
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,940
When can I meet that person anyway?

560
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,399
Is that person even real?

561
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,401
You'll meet that person one day for sure.

562
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:04,238
Because that's how
you'll get what you want.

563
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:09,660
How's the new guy?

564
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,037
He didn't seem to do so bad.

565
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,165
Even a broken clock is right twice a day.

566
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,209
So he's an idiot.

567
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,961
You're right.

568
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,712
But he's not so bad.

569
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:23,257
-Then why don't you work with him?
-No.

570
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,466
I don't want to.

571
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,101
You still haven't decided?

572
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,234
No.

573
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,237
I've decided.

574
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,243
Hello!

575
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,831
He's here! He's finally here!

576
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:57,082
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

577
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,834
My, you look healthy!

578
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:01,169
Oh, our newbie is here!

579
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,213
He's good-looking.

580
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,881
I'm looking forward to working with you.

581
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,550
I'll do my best!

582
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:07,843
EDITING TEAM
CHOI JUN-WOONG

583
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,307
Drink up.

584
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,310
Pull that one frame to the right.

585
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,354
Just a bit to the beginning.

586
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,981
No, to the side.

587
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,109
Just a bit more.

588
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,360
Yes, there.

589
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,695
Good.

590
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:27,988
All right.

591
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,448
You're good.

592
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,533
You just need to get quicker.

593
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,203
You're good, newbie.

594
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:39,249
Just a little more work and he'll be
churning out touching flashback videos.

595
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,500
Good.

596
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,003
It's a good thing you didn't go
to the other teams.

597
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,339
Our team is great for taking
a look back on life.

598
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,381
That's right.

599
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,592
-Oh, how was the RM Team?
-Right.

600
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,594
Aren't they really depressing?

601
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,431
Always dealing with people trying
to kill themselves.

602
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,266
That's no way to live.

603
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,768
But why do they do it?

604
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,519
Are they weak-willed?

605
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,812
Most of the time, yes.

606
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,272
Well, I guess that's true.

607
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,232
When you edit videos for those people,

608
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,652
they only think about their suffering.

609
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,362
I have it tough too!

610
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,197
Nonsense. We've got it harder.

611
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:14,493
They can't bear the littlest things.

612
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,290
I don't want to

613
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:24,586
die like this either!

614
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,171
It's even more true
after seeing it for yourself, right?

615
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,464
No!

616
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,346
Attention, please. Soon, in room 203…

617
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:38,809
They just want to smile
and live normal lives.

618
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,061
It's not that they want to die.

619
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,690
It's that they just didn't want
to live like that.

620
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:46,817
So…

621
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,195
don't talk about them like that…

622
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:56,493
when you don't know anything about them!

623
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,128
-Aren't you going to answer me?
-Right.

624
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,629
Yes. Sure.

625
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:23,770
Why did you have to say that
and ruin everything?

626
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:27,691
Wait.

627
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:32,446
Does this mean I have to stay in
a coma for three years before waking up?

628
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,245
Maybe…

629
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,708
they'll let me off the hook
if I tell them I went temporarily insane.

630
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,581
I thought if I scared you just a bit more,

631
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,085
you'd be begging me to save you,

632
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:11,628
to let you out,

633
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,799
or to please let you forget.

634
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:19,719
Yet you never called for me,
not even once.

635
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,015
Let me live, then.

636
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,350
I don't believe you.

637
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:28,854
Or let me out, then.

638
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:29,980
You're lying.

639
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,607
I'm being sincere.

640
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:33,567
Never mind.

641
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:37,863
How is this place Hell
when you feel no regret or resentment?

642
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,867
Do you remember? The day you arrived.

643
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,493
You asked me for something.

644
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,333
Shall I grant that wish?

645
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:55,255
Then work at Jumadeung from now on.

646
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:58,758
And one day, when the time is right,

647
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,595
the person you must save will appear.

648
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,890
You must save them from their death.

649
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:10,478
That is if you want
your wish to be granted.

650
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:12,939
So…

651
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,609
the choice is yours to make.

652
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,736
So think about it.

653
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,449
Who is that person?

654
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,659
Someone who will take their own life.

655
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,912
Rescue the poor soul,

656
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:30,290
who has forgotten what a gift life is.

657
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:34,544
I understand.

658
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,022
No.

659
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:57,484
Why should we take him back
after he threw that tantrum and left?

660
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,986
Well, you should have
held onto him better.

661
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,447
Then you take him in as a part
of the Book Management Team.

662
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,324
Me? Why our team?

663
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,619
We can't either.

664
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:09,871
All those certificates
but none for Chinese characters.

665
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,583
What about the Tech Support Team?

666
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,293
He doesn't know computers.

667
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:16,419
Shame.

668
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,299
All right, if that's how it is.

669
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,385
Then…

670
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,764
-Choi Jun-woong will go back into--
-I'll take him.

671
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,408
I'll take him.

672
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:01,423
Koo Ryeon.

673
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:06,636
No…

674
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:09,180
I guess it's Team Manager Koo now.

675
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,439
I should have recognized you that day.

676
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:25,697
Let go.

677
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:29,117
No, please. Help me.

678
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:33,288
I didn't want to die like this.

679
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,665
-Let go.
-No.

680
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,333
-No.
-Please…

681
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,293
Let go!

682
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:49,804
Let's not run into each other
unless I'm escorting suicide cases.

683
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,515
It's unpleasant.

684
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,963
EPILOGUE

685
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,402
Wait. I don't have my phone.

686
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,780
Manager.

687
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:50,657
What do I do?

688
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,700
-Do you need help?
-You startled me.

689
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,038
Excuse me, sir.

690
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,873
I'm sorry, but…

691
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,459
could you pass me some toilet paper?

692
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:04,629
I…

693
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,133
also need help.

694
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:10,260
You don't have toilet paper either?

695
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,761
Man, I'm busy enough already.

696
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,059
What are you doing?

697
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,811
Will you help me?

698
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,688
What are you talking about?

699
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:25,316
Then you get two squares.

700
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:29,737
What are you, crazy?

701
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,950
Will you help me?

702
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:37,203
-You have one square now.
-How am I supposed to wipe

703
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,746
with just one square?

704
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,416
Stick it to your butt,

705
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,585
or help me.

706
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:48,423
Damn it.

707
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,925
Mr. Jung…

708
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,177
Me?

709
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,970
…I would like to protect your dignity.

710
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,855
-Where are we going?
-Hurry!

711
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:07,192
Wait! Manager, get my jacket and my phone!

712
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,776
Yes, hold onto them!

713
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,487
Man, this is so uncomfortable.

714
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,863
Come on, what are you doing?

715
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:45,271
From today, the Choi Jun-woong
from the Land of the Living is no longer.

716
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,857
-Give me the report.
-Name, Namgung Jae-soo.

717
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,943
He's been studying for
the Police Academy Exam.

718
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,736
What did I do that was so wrong?

719
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:54,113
How come I'm the only one
who can't make it?

720
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,491
He's Jun-woong's closest friend.

721
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:57,617
Jae-soo.

722
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:03,831
Are you out of your mind, Namgung Jae-soo?

723
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:08,002
I'll send my people in advance,
Team Manager Koo.

724
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,170
Fried chicken should do the trick!

725
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,756
The chicken Jae-soo used to eat with
his dad when he was around six years old…

726
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,967
Even if you're a Reaper,
there's no way to go into the past.

727
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,177
Then we make a way.

728
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,595
You keep an eye on Jae-soo.

729
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,597
