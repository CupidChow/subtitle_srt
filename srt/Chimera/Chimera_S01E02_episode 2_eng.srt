1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:06,970

2
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,280
 Chimera

3
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:28,240
 The characters, locations, incidents, religious sects, etc. in this drama are fiction and have no relation to reality.

4
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,290
Are you really going to keep being like this, sir? 
   May 30, 1984 - Macheon City

5
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:39,470
It was sent from America. They definitely said it would arrive this week.

6
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,570
The experiment is next week. If it's this late, the professor will really fire me.

7
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,730
Even if it's late, it'll still arrive by Monday.

8
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,260
Once it arrives, I'll bring it to you at the school immediately. Okay?

9
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,770
Be careful on your way over. It's dangerous.

10
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,320
You know how much a bottle of that nitrate costs.

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,460
Of course. I know.

12
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,830
It'll be here by Monday at the latest, right? I'm relying on you.

13
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,080
Don't worry! Get home safe!

14
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,370
Ugh. Should I just switch business partners?

15
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,800
  President Cheon Du Hwan said that at the Korean-Japanese summit

16
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,230
 both nations discussed the issue of development.

17
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,540
 Starting with an official visit to Korea by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last year

18
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,100
 the heads of state of both nations ...

19
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,010
What is this thing?

20
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,710
Ah, it must be a lighter.

21
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:02,600
 Episode 2

22
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,490
Are you okay?

23
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,300
I'll escort you home.

24
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,050
I'm okay.

25
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,890
- Will you hold this for me? 
 - Sure.

26
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,540
What is this?

27
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,010
- Chimera. 
 - Chimera?

28
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:47,830
The first explosion was a car. The second was an office. Could it be a coincidence?

29
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,730
What do you mean?

30
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,660
This is similar to the 1984 Macheon City fire incident.

31
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,920
Come to think of it, this must be Chimera too.

32
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,820
Why? Why are the pattern and sequence of events similar?

33
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,880
I know, right? It's weird.

34
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,850
I think we should look more into the incident that happened 35 years ago.

35
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,830
The victim, Son Wan Gi, which newspaper did he work for?

36
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,100
Are you still at work?

37
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,150
You're at Jungsan Police Station?

38
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,370
I'm sorry.

39
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,880
Where have I seen him before?

40
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,400
What are you doing?

41
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,310
You're here.

42
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,350
You can put that down.

43
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,880
Who are you?

44
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,680
I'm Reporter Kim Hyo Gyeong from the UBS press office 
   Reporter Kim Hyo Gyeong

45
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,760
Are you new? I've never seen you before.

46
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,850
I'm from the investigative team.

47
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:41,000
What kind of investigation are you doing by looking at someone else's phone?

48
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,780
I heard there was an explosion in the middle of Seoul. Two in a row, as a matter of fact.

49
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,950
Ah. Really?

50
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,420
What was the cause? Terrorism?

51
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,420
And the culprit? Has the criminal profile been finalized yet?

52
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,670
Excuse me. Kim Ye...

53
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,930
- Reporter Kim Hyo Gyeong. 
 - Yes?

54
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,120
Would you get lost?

55
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,170
Because I'm a patient in critical condition who needs absolute rest.

56
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,750
Son Wan Gi, the first victim. I heard he died in a car explosion.

57
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,980
Hurry along now.

58
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,330
The method is exactly the same as what happened 35 years ago.

59
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,860
How much do you know about Son Wan Gi?

60
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,360
Do you know how he came up?

61
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,700
I got the scoop from 35 years ago.

62
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,340
Here it is. The article that Son Wan Gi wrote.

63
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,730
Arson/murder case in Macheon City, Gyeonggi-do 
   Arson/Murder case in Macheon City 
 Author: Son Wan Gi 
 A look at the suspect being arrested.

64
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,220
Police arrest suspect Lee Sang Wu.

65
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,260
Suspect Lee Sang Wu worked for Taesam Chemical until recently

66
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,200
and was fired after forming illegal unions and inciting other workers.

67
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,390
As a result, he threatened to blackmail the company and he damaged property. 
   What made him a monster?

68
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,020
He is known to have a history of violence.

69
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,760
I already know. You're talking about the serial murder case in Macheon City.

70
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,790
This incident was featured in all four major daily newspapers.

71
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,630
How could I break a story with just that?

72
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,150
Then?

73
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,560
What I know is high-quality information.

74
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,170
What will you do for me if I tell you?

75
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,990
Forget it if you don't want to know.

76
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,080
You startled me!

77
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,620
I'll tell you as a favor.

78
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,060
Since I came to the hospital empty-handed, I'll give you this instead of flowers.

79
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:15,770
The real story that Son Wan Gi broke was the follow-up to that article.

80
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,780
The one he wrote on July 23rd.

81
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,490
On July 23rd, suspect Lee Sang Wu's family 
   Lee Sang Wu's family exclusive 
 Lee Sang Wu, who is he?

82
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,190
Exclusive coverage by Reporter Son Wan Gi?

83
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,700
  The devil hidden behind the ordinary faces of Lee Sang Wu's family

84
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:38,890
What? He even included the suspect's wife's face?

85
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,690
This reporter is a bully.

86
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,380
All the same, this was an ongoing police investigation.

87
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,300
Was it really okay for it to be in the newspaper?

88
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,560
Is there no presumption of innocence in Korea?

89
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,090
This was the 80's remember? The 80's.

90
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,600
You must not know since you lived abroad.

91
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,300
This was during the time of the military regime. There was no such thing as laws or human rights

92
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,070
because the ones in power were thugs.

93
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:06,160
Son Wan Gi was really a terrible person.

94
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,900
I wonder what happened to this guy.

95
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,820
 Stop right there.

96
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,560
 Burning in a fire also means purifying.

97
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,530
 A mythical creature with a lion's face, a goat's body and a snake's tail.

98
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:57,050
 An evil monster that kills humans by spewing fire out of its mouth.

99
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,860
 I'm sure he got bitten by an animal.

100
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,950
 An animal raised by a human.

101
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,100
 But it's bigger than an animal that can catch and eat people.

102
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,700
 An animal smaller than a person.

103
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,210
 Come out.  Hurry and come out.

104
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,060
 Wake up. Wake up, Jae Hwan.

105
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:47,890
 Detective Cha. Detective Cha.

106
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,130
 Investigator.

107
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,670
 Are you okay?

108
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,690
 Investigator

109
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,410
Did you see that?  The chimera design on the house's wall.

110
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:18,750
It's the chimera from the explosion case 35 years ago, right?

111
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:24,660
Is it a simple coincidence that it is similar to thirty-five years ago?  I don't know.

112
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:30,250
A chimera image.  A crime using oxygen.  Both are unusual.

113
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,220
How would the culprit know that I would come and have oxygen ready?

114
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,670
His target might not have been you.

115
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,030
- Then, who is it? 
 - Don't you think the culprit might have his next target?

116
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:53,970
By speaking of a next target, are you saying such a case could happen again?

117
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,120
No.  Is this an occupational disease?

118
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,380
Why don't you look into the people around Son Wan Gi.

119
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,400
The people around him right before he died and close friends.

120
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:19,380
I'm not sure.  Was there anyone close to him? A gambler.

121
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,910
- Oh right, the doctor. 
 - Doctor?

122
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,590
There was someone he stuck together with before.

123
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,200
He purposely lost money.

124
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,860
A doctor.  Which hospital?

125
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,590
I can't say.  I don't even know if a physician is his profession.

126
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,330
A reporter and a doctor.

127
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,460
Why are you being discharged already from the hospital?  Can't you take a break?

128
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,650
They said I was okay so what else is there?

129
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,110
I submitted an application for sick leave, so take it easy for two weeks and don't worry.

130
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,830
Why did you do such a useless thing?  I wasn't even seriously injured.

131
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,310
Hey listen to me, man.

132
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,410
Keep it up and you will develop an orthopedic problem.

133
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,610
- But, old man. 
 - What?

134
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:23,270
Why were you there that day?

135
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,480
Huh?  Where?

136
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,490
The culprit's hideout.  I never told you I was going there.

137
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,490
Ah.  Maybe I heard it from Geon Yeong?

138
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,470
From Geon Yeong?

139
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,790
If you're going to leave, hurry and get out.  I'll take you home.

140
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,650
Take me home? Your car was a total loss too.

141
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,420
I can call a taxi.

142
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,230
Geon Yeong is coming.

143
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,970
- By the way, old man. 
 - What now?

144
00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:00,050
Didn't you say you lived somewhere in Gyeonggi-do for several years about 30 years ago?

145
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,920
- Yes, so? 
 - Didn't you know about the Chimera case?

146
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,020
- What? 
 - Chimera.

147
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,400
Chimera.  A series of arson murders in Macheon City in Gyeonggi-do.

148
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:15,860
I mean, in Macheon three people died because of a series of explosions.

149
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,620
I heard there was a huge clamor.

150
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,010
You punk, again, where do you hear this weird stuff?

151
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,040
You saw that on the internet, didn't you?

152
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,460
Anyway, nowadays, crooks and cops,

153
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,860
are just sitting around and tapping on their devices.

154
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,280
No, that's not it.

155
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:38,520
On the wall of the apartment that exploded, there was a big picture of a chimera.

156
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,880
And I heard that the dead Son Wan Gi was the reporter who covered the Chimera case.

157
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,580
Doesn't anything come to mind?

158
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,890
Stop doing that already, punk.

159
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,480
You died and came back alive.

160
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,450
What is that? Wh-Whose life will be on the line?

161
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:58,720
If something happens to you, what about me? What about your mom, you punk?!

162
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:04,310
If you are going to do as you please like a thoughtless daredevil,

163
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:09,400
do if after I'm dead! Do it after your mom and I are dead, punk!

164
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,460
With that smart brain, huh?

165
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,960
Of all the good places to work!

166
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,910
Okay.

167
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,900
I am the sinner.  I am the sinner.

168
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,260
What's the matter with you now? What did you do wrong?

169
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,350
Please think about your body.

170
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,210
 (Lee Sang Wu) It's not me.  It's really not.

171
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,040
  Punk.

172
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,960
 Come out.

173
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,040
 Hurry and come out.

174
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,980
 Really!

175
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,590
 Out of the way.

176
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,660
 Stop taking pictures!

177
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,900
 It's not me.

178
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,760
 Does it taste good?  Do you remember?

179
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,100
 It's not me.  It's not me.

180
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,010
 Come on. Do you still not remember?

181
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,140
 No.

182
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,000
 Patrolman Han Ju Seok.

183
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,150
 That's not it.  It's Detective Han Ju Seok, isn't it?

184
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,990
 Have you been well?

185
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,760
 How did you crawl so far?  Get going?

186
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,390
 Let's share these. They are American.

187
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:06,520
 So easy to inhale. If anything comes out, contact me.

188
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,180
Does it hurt a lot?

189
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,120
Why have you come so late?

190
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,210
How is he doing?

191
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,020
He's fine. He ate well.

192
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,410
Yes.

193
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,740
I'm sorry.

194
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:23,210
I couldn't escort him home when he was discharged.

195
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,990
You are busy.

196
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,640
I'm sorry.

197
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,010
I'm so sorry.

198
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,720
Have you eaten?

199
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,750
Well, a bit ...

200
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,910
Here.

201
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,630
They are peaches.

202
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:54,350
Even though they are small, they are very sweet.

203
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,020
I know you like them.

204
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,890
Don't buy such things.

205
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,610
There's nothing we can do in return.

206
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,620
Others will come out even when it's cold.

207
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:11,170
You can't eat peaches when the season is over.

208
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,780
Eun Su.

209
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,600
Cha Eun Su.

210
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,610
A seonbae  (senior)  I know ...

211
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:37,390
That hyeong  ("older brother" but in this case a close friend, not a relative)  lives in Vietnam.

212
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,210
It's pleasant living there.

213
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:46,310
It's not because they have a lot of money.

214
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:51,330
People there all live smiling.

215
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,340
Eun Su.

216
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,140
That's how I feel.

217
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:04,550
How about living someplace like that,

218
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:09,580
even if it is for just one day before I die.

219
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,610
Without any worries, your mind at peace.

220
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:23,590
For how much longer will we live in the future?

221
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,100
That's it.

222
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,920
Why?  Did something good happen?

223
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,990
Nowadays, the boss is doing things he hasn't done before.

224
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,300
It turns out our boss is a man. A real man.

225
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,880
What?

226
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,510
Never mind.  You don't need to know.

227
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,150
Seonbae, did you hear from Team Leader?

228
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,480
About what?

229
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,840
Son Wan Gi's case.

230
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,210
They said we should close it.

231
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,020
What? Why?

232
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,170
I don't know.  He suddenly said it this morning.

233
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:13,360
Even though we may have asked to close cases many times, Team Leader has never done that.

234
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,180
Is his resolve weak because he's trying to retire?

235
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,520
That's strange.

236
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,820
On top of that, it's not someone else.  It's you who almost died.

237
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,220
If it were long ago, he's the person who would have made a fuss saying he's going to catch and kill the culprit.

238
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:32,880
Anyway, are you really all right? Even if you can get around?

239
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,700
Why did you come back from your leave?

240
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,670
I don't think it's a time to be resting. I don't think so.

241
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,390
Thanks.   Yeolmoonaengmyeon (Cold buckwheat noodles with young radish) 6000 won

242
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,950
- I'm full. 
 - It was a little salty today.

243
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,340
Long time no see! Gil Dong and Ho Dong.

244
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,930
It feels strange that I changed my attitude after chasing you all the time, doesn't it?

245
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,800
What's the matter now?

246
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,960
We barfed up everything we know.

247
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,280
For the sake of the country. Just cooperate once more, sirs.

248
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:16,630
This is your car, right, huh?

249
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,730
What do you need this for?

250
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,910
What do you think? To catch a culprit.

251
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:30,110
Detective Jang, you are the best for videos.

252
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,650
You lost weight.

253
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:41,580
Eat your meals. You said you want to join violent crimes.

254
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,210
We won't accept you if you lose weight.

255
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,550
Yes sir.

256
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:54,890
But, this car keeps following.

257
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,040
Oh, it's Son Wan Gi.

258
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,650
This is the car from before, right?

259
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,480
Was he tailing like that?

260
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,680
Zoom in so we can see the face.

261
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,670
 16 Go 3305

262
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,460
The lower angle is blurred.

263
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,830
Change the screen.

264
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,960
 Research Lab 
 Chief  Go Jae Moon, Neurosurgeon

265
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,420
Excuse the interruption.

266
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,600
Dr. Go Jae Moon.

267
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,720
Doctor.

268
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,100
The chief is absent.

269
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:47,180
Is that Dr. Go Jae Moon?

270
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,140
He is in a comatose state. Since 3 months ago.

271
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,100
For three months?

272
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,330
 Lee Jung Yeop 
 Seoryun Hospital

273
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,090
Excuse my rudeness, but what is your relationship to Go Jae Moon.

274
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,890
I am going to become head of the department.  Is something going on?

275
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:20,190
Has anyone been driving Dr. Moon's vehicle with the license number 3305 recently?

276
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,100
I can't say.

277
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,130
Don't you have to ask his family about that?

278
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,820
Then, perhaps ...

279
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,760
do you know Son Wan Gi?

280
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:40,840
I don't. What's going on?

281
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,840
Ah, so you don't know.

282
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,100
It's a dead person.

283
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,150
Is that so?

284
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,500
Life and death are different here.

285
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,990
He was burnt to death. Burnt alive.

286
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,000
If you're looking for a murderer, you came to the wrong place, Detective.

287
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,030
For people like us, even if we were to kill someone, it wouldn't be obvious.

288
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,300
Dr. Lee.

289
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,650
Have you seen this before?

290
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,480
Chimara.  It's also called chimera.

291
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,280
What does it mean?

292
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:50,940
Literally, a creature that emits fire from Greek mythology.

293
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,900
In genetics, one individual has two sets of DNA.

294
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:00,640
Could you explain it simply so the general public could understand?

295
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,390
Let's say there is a white mouse and a black mouse.

296
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:12,050
It's normal to have only one color trait, white or black.

297
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:17,000
It means you have two in one body, a white one and a black one.

298
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,730
If that's a person,

299
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:23,610
one person is a doctor who saves people and one person a murderer who kills people.

300
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:27,010
The two could be in one body, right?

301
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,720
That's a case with two personalities.

302
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,020
It would be better to ask a psychiatrist.

303
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:48,830
Seonbae. You said doctor before, didn't you?

304
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,240
It was the gambling house CCTV, right?

305
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,760
I think so too.  But he is very bad news.

306
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,480
A person burned to death but he wasn't even curious.

307
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,460
It's either one of two.  Insane or criminal.

308
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,600
Shall we find out which?

309
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,500
What's this?

310
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,960
The doctor's fingerprint.

311
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,100
 AFIS, Automated Fingerprint Identification System

312
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,280
 International Driving Permit

313
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,770
Jerome J.Y. Edwards. His Korean name is Lee Jung Yeop.

314
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:26,240
Anyway, I thought it was weird that he wouldn't pop up on the AFIS. He's of British nationality.

315
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,440
What is this? Was he born there or did he immigrate there?

316
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,300
I'm not sure. It's not like they have ID cards or anything.

317
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,410
We need his birth certificate.

318
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:39,350
Damn it. If he's a foreigner, we're going to have to ask the other side about his info and criminal history.

319
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:42,910
His scientific background is from Newcastle.

320
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,460
This complicates things.

321
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,090
If he stays here for a bit and then escapes, nothing will come of this.

322
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,900
 Lee Jung Yeop (Jerome J.Y. Edwards)

323
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,940
Wow Seonbae, take a look at this.

324
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,650
This is no joke.

325
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,150
  Extensive List of Research Articles by Dr. Lee

326
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,550
King's College in London?

327
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,030
He must be really successful there.

328
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,710
Do you think someone like this could be guilty?

329
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,050
Investigator.

330
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,730
Are you alright running around like that?

331
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:34,270
Why do you ask? Did someone get hurt?

332
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,300
Are you giving this to me?

333
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:44,300
Ah. I wasn't sure what you liked. Please share these with your co-workers.

334
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,380
You don't have to bring things like this.

335
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,630
What?

336
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,530
It's nothing.

337
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:10,800
But, why did you call me?

338
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,740
Let's head in first. I'll tell you then.

339
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,490
 Lee Jung Yeop (Jerome J.Y. Edwards)

340
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,090
 Interview with Lee Jung Yeop (Jerome J.Y. Edwards)

341
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:29,000
He's a doctor at Seoryun Hospital.

342
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,310
His name is Lee Jung Yeop.

343
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,510
Jerome J.Y. Edwards.

344
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:50,210
I want his criminal record, bank accounts, taxes,

345
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:55,010
his family, friends, relationships, properties, favorite hangouts, shoe size.

346
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:58,690
Just get me anything you can find.

347
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,380
Right. Thanks, Sam.

348
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,120
Okay, bye.

349
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:07,030
What are you looking at? Just go. Go on now.

350
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,070
You're cool. It's totally like I'm watching an American drama.

351
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,470
Your chin is going to drop. Your chin.

352
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
 Autopsy Report

353
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,180
 Autopsy Report:   Cause of Death for Son Wan Gi

354
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,760
Thank you.

355
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,990
Take it easy. It's like you're putting your life on the line for this.

356
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,900
I'm doing this because it's fun.

357
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,040
What? This sort of thing.

358
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,670
There's an excitement that comes along with solving an unsolvable puzzle.

359
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,030
Seonbae, it's time to take your medicine.

360
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:43,610
I forget quite often. That guy is pretty incredible at tasks like that.

361
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,530
Shouldn't you rest for a few more days?

362
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:49,290
No, don't worry about me. I do this because it's fun.

363
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,920
 Prescription and Instructions for Medication

364
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,950
Detective Cha.

365
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,570
Yes?

366
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,930
Son Wan Gi's autopsy report had records of a rib fracture.

367
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:05,920
Yes, it did.

368
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,060
His autopsy report said it was a rib fracture from six months ago.

369
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:14,190
Wouldn't there be a record of a diagnosis or a prescription of some sort?

370
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:18,640
The gambling place has Lee Jung Yeop showing up from six months ago.

371
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,590
Since Lee Jung Yeop is a doctor at Seoryun Hospital...

372
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:25,800
The two must have met at the hospital before.

373
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,850
 Seoryun Hospital

374
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,970
That's Son Wan Gi.

375
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,470
He's in his sixties and was a rib fracture patient.

376
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,220
Here.

377
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,900
 Son Wan Gi 
 Resident ID: 550115-168173

378
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:44,100
If it was six months ago, there isn't anything in the orthopedic clinic.

379
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,290
Try neurosurgery.

380
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,390
He's not there.

381
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:53,830
He should've looked quite shabby, like a homeless person.

382
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:58,000
Hold on a minute. Then I'll check if there are diagnoses in the other departments.

383
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,610
Could I have the patient room status list I asked about on the phone?

384
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,540
Hold on a minute.

385
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,090
Here it is.

386
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,540
Yes, thank you.

387
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,740
How long has that guy been at this hospital?

388
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,600
It's been about six months.

389
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,970
He transferred here from England.

390
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,650
He brought someone with him. I think it was a relative.

391
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,800
A relative?

392
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:53,180
I think that's him.

393
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,980
He definitely said that it was his relative, but it was a bit strange.

394
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,090
What was?

395
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,560
A disturbance--!

396
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,960
He smelled strongly of alcohol.

397
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,210
He caused a scene and cursed. The ER that day was in complete disarray.

398
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:10,240
Could I see the ER records from that day?

399
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,310
The records are here. Son Wan Gi.

400
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:20,500
Dr. Lee Jung Yeop paid the bill himself.

401
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,290
Seonbae, where were you?

402
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,000
What do you think this is?

403
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,450
What is this?

404
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,980
Evidence that Lee Jung Yeop and Son Wan Gi know one another.

405
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,780
Really?

406
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:42,260
That guy saying that he didn't know Son Wan Gi, that was all a lie.

407
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:47,110
This is a bit suspicious, but lying isn't a crime.

408
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,380
I'm sure that he's our guy.

409
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,150
There isn't enough evidence.

410
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:56,360
Should I try tailing him?

411
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,600
What about the old man?

412
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,790
He said that he's not feeling well, he took the day off.

413
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,040
Did he say it was bad?

414
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,720
It must be. He didn't have any strength in his voice.

415
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,610
 However, the day of God's reckoning will appear like a thief. That day, the sky will echo with deafening sounds and substances

416
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:58,560
  will be engulfed in flames. And everything that has happened thus far, will be revealed.

417
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,580
Hello?

418
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,270
Who is this?

419
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,680
Who are you?

420
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,740
I asked who you were!

421
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,840
Come out.

422
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:34,300
Do you think I'll be afraid?

423
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,310
I said to come out!

424
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,220
I'm sorry...

425
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,550
I'm sorry.

426
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,700
I'm sorry.

427
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,510
I'm sorry.

428
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,260
Is he sleeping?

429
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,170
 Old Man

430
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:48,220
Where did this old man go?

431
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,670
Schubert.

432
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:18,310
 Schubert The Winter Trip

433
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:34,030
My mom was pretty.

434
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,220
The old man looks tacky.

435
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:43,850
 11-03-84

436
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,550

 Macheon Police Station

00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,730
But what are you going to do with this old case?

442
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:05,210
- There's something I need to find out. 
 - I see.

443
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,220
Then take your time.

444
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,450
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

445
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:16,250
July 1984. 
  Macheon, Gyeonggi-do 
 Serial arson murder case data

446

Han Ju Seok.

 Cha Jae Hwan

453
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,150
Have you heard from the team leader?

454
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:25,990
No.

455
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,840
What's wrong, Seonbae?

456
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,550
The team leader is missing.

457
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:37,850
What?

458
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:42,790
He's not home nor answering his phone. I haven't been able to reach him since yesterday.

459
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,160
He wouldn't do that.

460
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,050
His cell phone. I'll track the location.

461
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,220
How do you use this?

462
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:02,020
First, turn on the power. The number shows the oxygen concentration level.

463
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,000
Around twenty is normal.

464
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,370
Seonbae, if you pass twenty-five, get out immediately.

465
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:12,110
 Macheon, Gyeonggi-do

466
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:15,310
Have you seen a man

467
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:18,210
in his late 50s near this riverbank?

468
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,600
Or a vehicle that you haven't seen in this area before?

469
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,060
Sir!

470
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,280
Sir.

471
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:12,630
Sir.

472
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:18,880
Sir. Are you all right?

473
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:27,390
Is that you, Jae Hwan?

474
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:30,800
Yes, it's me.

475
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,630
I'm here. You don't have to worry anymore.

476
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:35,180
No, don't come here.

477
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,200
I said don't come!

478
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:55,950
It's all right. The oxygen is normal and there is no flame.

479
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,200
Go.

480
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,600
Just hold on for a moment. I'll free you.

481
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,230
Don't come!

482
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:06,540
Don't come! Please!

483
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:19,560
It's the water.

484
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,130
What?

485
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,000
It's the water!

486
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,100
 There was an unknown fire that broke out just yesterday

487
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:33,490
 at a construction site in Gyeonggi-do, where soot still remains.

488
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:38,900
 The deceased in the fire was found to be an on-duty police officer from the Jungsan Police Station.

489
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,500
 The whereabouts of the first witness, Detective Cha,

490
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,920
 is still unknown.

491
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:51,250
 Meanwhile, it is unknown whether it was a simple accident or an arson accident from what has been identified so far,

492
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:57,550
 but it is known that the police are reportedly investigating both possibilities.

493
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:05,810
 Jungsan Police Station

494
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:12,670
Chief!

495
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,400
Is the murder victim a current detective? Was he a team leader?

496
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,090
Does it have anything to do with the bombing?

497
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:26,400
They said the method was the same.

498
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,240
Then did the culprit from thirty-five years ago come back?

499
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:31,350
Please give a comment. Please give a comment!

500
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:36,990
 Post-mortem and Autopsy Record

501
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:43,920
Did you live without ever sleeping in just to end up here?

502
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,380
You foolish man.

503
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,260
It's also foolish that you are lying here like this.

504
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:57,830
I'm also foolish that I'm relieved I'm the one having to do this.

505
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:22,880
 Sir, take care of yourself.

506
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,850
 It reminds me of that movie.

507
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:29,150
 - Movie? 
 - Yes.

508
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:31,050
 What? Godfather?

509
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,740
 Marlon Brando.

510
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:37,620
 Do you know Okja?

511
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,800
 - Okja? 
 - Yes.

512
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,090
 That's an erotic movie, isn't it?

513
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:48,270
 It's not erotic but it's a bit.

514
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:51,150
 Okja was running around naked in the mountains—

515
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:52,650
 How dare you tease your elder?!

516
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,110
 My ear! My ear's going to fall off!

517
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:57,680
 Get hit with a towel that I washed my feet with!

518
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,840
 Why did you take this out already?

519
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,680
 Isn't your retirement ceremony the week after next.

520
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,970
 I'm going to take it to the dry cleaners before I forget.

521
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:08,310
 I will ask my mom to do it tomorrow.

522
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:11,220
 Why would I have her do that? It's shameless.

523
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:14,910
 Think of it as a thank you for what you did for my mom's store when it got flooded.

524
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:17,580
 That's because you help

525
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,490
 out your neighbors, punk.

526
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:23,190
 You always say you are just good neighbors.

527
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,120
 Do you two not have any thoughts on being more than just neighbors?

528
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:30,120
 Like what?

529
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,860
 Like what about family?

530
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:37,630
 Come on, why don't you go after her? A man needs to fight to win over a woman.

531
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:39,680
 Are you going to grow old as a widower like this?

532
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,860
 Until you are a hundred years old? That's so sad.

533
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:46,980
 Why don't we change for the second half of our lives?

534
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,220
 Just worry about yourself.

535
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:27,310

536
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,480
♫  Some people want to live  ♫

537
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,380
♫  But turn their back on me  ♫

538
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:41,960
♫  The time I lived with me  ♫

539
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:44,800
♫  Some people say to me  ♫

540
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,700
 Chimera

541
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:51,300
 The team leader was the detective in charge of the Chimera case?

542
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:55,130
 What were you all doing while things were going on like this?

543
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:58,800
 He is directly connected to the incident thirty-five years ago.

544
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,010
 Don't be mistaken.

545
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:02,690
 It happened a few days ago. Not thirty-five years ago.

546
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:05,800
 Ressurection for those who believe and death for those who don't.

547
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,640
 Be careful while in Korea.

548
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,400
 Are you doing a background check on me now?

549
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,770
 The black box video in front of Team Leader Han's house is out.

550
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:13,800
 What if the culprit is a doctor?

551
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,990
 You are under arrest on two counts of murder.
