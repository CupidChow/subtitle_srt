 Chimera

3
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:28,270
 The characters, locations, incidents, religious sects, etc. in this drama are fiction and have no relation to reality.

00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,930
 June 15, 1984, Macheon City

5
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,720
I'm sorry.  Please forgive me.

6
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,290
Please believe me, huh?

7
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,710
What's the matter?  I told you what I was ordered to.  You know that!

8
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,010
Hey, don't do that!  Don't!

9
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,120
No!

10
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:44,170
  ~ Episode 4 ~

11
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,500
- Lee Jung Yeop. 
 - Yes?

12
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,810
You are under arrest without a warrant for the two murders of Son Wan Gi and Han Ju Seok.

13
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,050
You have the right to remain silent and to have an attorney.

14
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,400
You'll have to wait.

15
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,510
I have a patient in his 60s who takes care of his two granddaughters. Let me save him.

16
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,830
He has a hemorrhagic cerebral infarction (stroke).

17
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,780
It took an hour for him to be found, an hour to get to the hospital, and in three hours I won't be able to do anything.

18
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,770
What would you like to do?

19
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,710
What is it?

20
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,020
It's just a painting.

21
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,010
 Jungsan Police Station

22
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,000
He didn't ask for an attorney?

23
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,980
What does he intend?

24
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,010
Is it to show he's confident?

25
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,460
If placed in this situation, even the innocent will have all sorts of thoughts.

26
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:35,690
Navy blue suit, wing-tipped brown shoes, tie with a Windsor knot.

27
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,120
That man received a strict upbringing in a conservative family.

28
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,100
He is conventional, values tradition, and is polite.

29
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,620
He's the type that does not express emotion.

30
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,430
So, Investigator, what's your strategy?

31
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,930
Create a tough physical situation

32
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,590
that generates intolerable pressure that will shake the opponent.

33
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:14,150
Make it too cold or too hot.  Brighten the light as much as possible.

34
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,430
You must use silence to add psychological pressure.

35
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,460
When the other person doesn't say anything, you become filled with anxiety and imagine all sorts of things.

36
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,560
Then you end up saying anything to dispel the anxiety.

37
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,650
That's when it is easiest to make mistakes.  Unprepared speech comes out all jumbled.

38
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,860
Will that strategy benefit us? We are the ones pressed for time right now.

39
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,960
The key is not knowing how much time has passed.

40
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,790
There is a huge difference between knowing when an ordeal will end and enduring agony without that knowledge.

41
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:49,490
I know you are very experienced in interrogating terrorists but you know we can't just wait.

42
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,310
Detective Jang, you haven't heard from Interpol yet?

43
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,440
It takes some time to do the background research.

44
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,040
He's never created any problem and doesn't have a criminal record.

45
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,120
I will message you if there is anything urgent.

46
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,690
Then you must stop immediately and withdraw.

47
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,730
 The Story Without An Ending 
 - A Faceless Killer, Chimera -
 UBS Investigative Journalism

48
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:26,000
- Chimera? 
 It was a serial murder case that occurred in 1984 in Macheon, Gyeonggi Province.

49
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,950
Three people died in an explosion. The cause of the explosion is still unknown.

50
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,510
A lighter was the only clue left at the scene.

51
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,570
It's called the "Chimera Case" because there was a chimera design on the lighter.

52
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,340
Is this an unsolved case?

53
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,790
There was a suspect but he committed suicide during interrogation.

54
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,380
It came to nothing because there was no one to prosecute.

55
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:54,250
But not very long ago there were two incidents in a row using the same method.

56
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,030
The incident where the police officer died in a fire.

57
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,210
One police officer and one reporter.

58
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,790
The murdered reporter was the one who covered the Chimera Case.

59
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,810
The murdered police officer was in charge of the case.

60
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,020
A mysterious incident which occurred 35 years ago

61
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,820
occurred now, in precisely the same way.

62
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,450
Who on earth is doing this and why?

63
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:24,400
It's 35 years old... You should have brought something for which the statute of limitations has not expired.

64
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,490
Team Leader, it's significant because the statute of limitations expired.

65
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,560
Would you use it if someone is fascinating?  Is there a falsely accused people story?

66
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,700
Hey, Kim Hyo Gyeong is awesome.  You're so meticulous with a great sense of justice.

67
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:45,140
The same mysterious 35-year-old serial murder is happening again.

68
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,360
Although we don't know the culprit, we are certain about the viewer ratings.

69
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,390
Something is a bit weighty.

70
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,560
This is an incident that occurred during the military dictatorship.

71
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,570
The concept is a sure thing.

72
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,760
They couldn't solve it then. Now we will.

73
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,970
But do you know what the pitfalls are?

74
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,520
Try to unearth a buried, hopeless criminal case.  There will be thousands of complaints from the victim's bereaved family.

75
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,620
It's not even as though you will appear in court instead of me.

76
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,940
Give me just two weeks. I will definitely find supporting evidence.

77
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:26,310
Okay.  Just the facts.  Even though documents are good, testimony is better.

78
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,090
If I'm not satisfied, the story will be killed.

79
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:40,390
Guys, do you know how long it's been since I've been on a current affairs program?  It's seven years, seven years.

80
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:46,430
Everyone, let's be on our toes, huh? No matter how awful we are, we have to be better than Youtube.

81
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,540
What's next?  Class action suits and punitive damages are yours, Yoon Seok.

82
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,330
Kim Hyo Gyeong.

83
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,890
Yes, Seonbae.

84
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,450
- I heard you had lunch yesterday with the executive director.  
 - What of it?

85
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,220
Just.  I wondered if you know something secret.

86
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:14,290
Even though the city desk editor was replaced and the seniors suffered a bitter blow, invariably, you alone remain a favorite.

87
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,320
- I do have a secret. 
 - What?

88
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,120
Do you want me to teach you?

89
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,220
You need to be pretty.

90
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,730
That's what I do.

91
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,950
 UBS Investigative Journalism Proposal

92
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,530
 Plan Objective 
 A serial murder in Macheon, Gyeonggi Province, in 1984.

93
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,960
  Contents ...  Will the unsolved case be solved?

94
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,560
Taesam Chemical.  Seoryun. Seo Hyeon Tae.

95
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,490
Oh Jong Geun, Lim Sang Wook, and Park In Sang

96
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,420
 died in the Chimera serial murder case, 1984

97
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,400
 Incumbent  chairman of the National Assembly's Legislation and Judiciary Committee, Lee Min Gi.

98
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:15,240
 On the 17th in Shinil-dong in Son Wan Gi's car which was bombed, chimera lighter discovered.

99
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,180
 On the 23rd, Han Ju Seok died in a fire. Chimera lighter discovered.

100
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:31,520
 Taesam Chemical employee, Lee Sang Woo, suicide.

101
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,660
  Taesam Chemical employee, Lee Sang Woo, suicide. Wife Deceased

102
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,480
I'm Cha Jae Hwan from the Jungsan Police Department Special Investigations team.

103
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,630
You have been arrested for the two murders of Son Wan Gi and Han Ju Seok.

104
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,460
Do you consent to the recording of this interview without the presence of an attorney?

105
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,460
That's right.

106
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,560
What is your name?

107
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,350
Can I have a glass of water first?

108
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,590
 Never grant his requests. Make sure to take control.

109
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,400
Your name.

110
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,940
Jerome Edwards.

111
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,980
They called you by a different name at the hospital though.

112
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,700
My Korean name is Lee Jung Yeop.

113
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,970
What should I call you?

114
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,030
Whatever you like.

115
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,170
Mr. Lee Jung Yeop. When were you born?

116
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,180
November 22nd, 1977.

117
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,080
- Nationality? 
 - British.

118
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,950
 Certificate of Entry &amp; Departure

119
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,760
According to the immigration records, you came to Korea six months ago for the first time.

120
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,600
You speak Korean quite well.

121
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,520
I have to be able to treat my patients.

122
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:53,020
And I have to be able to communicate with the medical staff. There is a language acquisition clause in my contract.

123
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,890
If you need to verify it, you can check with the hospital.

124
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,250
This is the worst-case scenario.

125
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:11,420
An elite foreigner? Doesn't this mean it's over for us if we make a misstep?

126
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,250
What? So we should just let him go?

127
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,760
What if he catches on and flees to his country? Haven't there been several cases that were never resolved due to things like that?

128
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,920
That's why we have to get something,

129
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,030
whether it's a confession or some more evidence.

130
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,850
How is he so calm?

131
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,450
It must be because we're missing something.

132
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,720
If it were me and I felt wrongly accused, I would have jumped out of my chair and started making a fuss earlier.

133
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,300
Maybe he's different because he's an educated person.

134
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,670
You said he's British.

135
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,880
Gentleman.

136
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,900
You know Son Wan Gi right?

137
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,990
What kind of relationship do you have?

138
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,650
Who?

139
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:05,920
Son Wan Gi. Do you not know him?

140
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,880
I'm not sure.

141
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,610
The person sitting across from him in this video is you, right?

142
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,660
Ah. Reporter Son.

143
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,370
Is this bastard a Korean or a foreigner?

144
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,750
Anyway, admitting the truth when presented with evidence is must be how people of all nationalities behave.

145
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,320
What relationship did you have with Son Wan Gi?

146
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,490
I've seen him a few times at the casino.

147
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:53,850
You've only seen him a few times at the casino, yet you were close enough to pay his hospital bill?

148
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,770
  Hospital Bill Receipt

149
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,020
You paid with your own credit card right?

150
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,050
 Cash Receipts  
 Identification: JB Card (Lee Jung Yeop)

151
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,600
It appears that way.

152
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,410
I heard you told the hospital staff that you were related.

153
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,480
We aren't relatives.

154
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,440
I was just helping out. He seemed like a pitiful person.

155
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,460
You said he was pitiful?

156
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,530
Is that all there is to it?

157
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,130
Yes.

158
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:50,150
Where were you between the night of the 12th and the 13th?

159
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,800
I was probably at the hospital.

160
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,360
And after you left work?

161
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,790
I would have probably been at my accommodation.

162
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:59,210
You saying probably means that you aren't sure. Right?

163
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,890
You said you were Detective Cha Jae Hwan right?

164
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,390
Where were you between the night of the 12th and the 13th?

165
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,380
That was about two weeks ago. What were you doing around this time two weeks ago?

166
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:22,130
What time did you get to work and what time did you leave? What did you do after leaving work?

167
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:28,590
What happened that day? And what was on the lunch menu that day? Can you remember everything?

168
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,840
He's trying to obfuscate by bringing up irrelevant things.

169
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,440
He can't get side-tracked.

170
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,620
Please, just answer the questions that I am asking you.

171
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,350
So, what were you doing on the afternoon of the 18th?

172
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,610
After working at the hospital all day, I must have just stayed at my accommodation after work.

173
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,880
Accommodation?

174
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,310
At home.

175
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,990
Alone?

176
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,200
Alone.

177
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,550
Is there anyone who can prove that you were there?

178
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,580
No. There isn't.

179
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,760
Unfortunately.

180
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,430
There is no one to remember me.

181
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,620
Mr. Lee Jung Yeop. Do you have your own car?

182
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,640
The hospital provided me with one.

183
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,980
I guess you must not like the car.

184
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,770
Since you were driving someone else's car.

185
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,560
You were seen in Go Jae Moon's car on the hospital CCTV.

186
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,330
Why were you driving someone else's car without permission?

187
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,760
Do you not have a car?

188
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:42,590
Leaving any machine unattended will cause problems. It causes engine problems and depletion of the battery.

189
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,930
It was driven for maintenance purposes.

190
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,950
Maintenance?

191
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:57,730
You go about maintenance in a strange way.

192
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:10,330
Why were you following this car while conducting maintenance on the car you were driving?

193
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:16,500
The car in front belonged to the late Son Wan Gi. Just in case you didn't know.

194
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,760
Why did you follow him?

195
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,610
I'm not familiar with the roads here.

196
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:30,530
We were going to play cards together.

197
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,770
His hand! Zoom in.

198
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,140
He's starting to act agitated.

199
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,370
 Jungsan Police Station

200
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,540
You know this person right?

201
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,920
No.

202
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:58,700
Where were you at around 9 pm on the 22nd?

203
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,070
I don't know.

204
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:05,330
Why? You don't remember again.

205
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,780
Do you want me to remind you where you might have been?

206
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,760
This is you, right?

207
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,000
You know where this is, right?

208
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,480
Do you not know?

209
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,560
He's getting less talkative.

210
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,710
Is that a good sign or a bad one?

211
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,210
He's pushing forward slowly.

212
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:58,170
 Keep the pressure on him.

213
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,750
 Keep the pressure on him. Don't give him time to think.

214
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,950
This is Han Ju Seok's house. Why were you there?

215
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,220
And on the same day that he was kidnapped?

216
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,850
I was on a walk.

217
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:27,990
Like I said before, I must have gotten lost because I don't know my way around the roads here.

218
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,560
So it's a coincidence?

219
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,310
Do you know what this is?

220
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,370
It's a lighter.

221
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,510
It's not just any lighter.

222
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,830
You know what this engraving is right?

223
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,850
You know it well.

224
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,160
You said this to me before.

225
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:16,870
Two genotypes in one organism. What did you say it was called?

226
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,890
Chimera.

227
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,880
What is Chimera?

228
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:49,720
A designer product launched by Lumière in 1983.

229
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:59,390
The original is made of titanium, but this is an imitation.

230
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:05,930
The point of this product is that it was made to withstand up to 1000 degrees Celsius. But this is all melted.

231
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,360
I'm sorry...

232
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,250
that you couldn't distinguish between real and fake.

233
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,130
 Sam

234
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,490
We have an occupational disease.

235
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,080
I can't recognize a good thing even if it's right under my nose.

236
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:44,540
But when something is slightly off, I can tell immediately.

237
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,170
An adoptee?  When?

238
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,880
Can you dig up some more for me?

239
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,700
Right.  Thanks, Sam.

240
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,880
A military record?

241
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,690
Is it you?

242
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,180
It's you, right?

243
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,740
Could I have a glass of water?

244
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,150
You killed him.

245
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,710
Don't listen to the opponent's request.  Seize the initiative.

246
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,790
Aren't you hot, Detective?

247
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:48,770
Please turn off the heater right now.  You deliberately raised the temperature.

248
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,360
You brought so many documents in, but you only look at the laptop.

249
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,340
That means that is all the information you possess.

250
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,900
Use silence and manipulate the environment.

251
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,370
Bluff and pretend you have a lot of evidence.

252
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,360
Pressure the opponent psychologically.

253
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,990
That's the elementary level of interrogation technique.

254
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,300
Get him out of there.

255
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,820
What?

256
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,810
 Incoming message.

257
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,500
 Get out of there!

258
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,460
 Immediately!

259
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:36,810
If there's something you want to know, ask a proper question.

260
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,670
Don't tease me after you've decided on the answer.

261
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,760
 Don't say anything and just come out.

262
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,740
Why did you kill him?

263
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,250
Why did you kill him?

264
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,820
Answer.

265
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,540
I asked why did you kill him?

266
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,520
Tell me!

267
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,370
Hey!  Damn it!

268
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,980
Why?  Why?

269
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,250
Why did you kill him? What did he do wrong?

270
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,760
Answer!  Why?  Why?

271
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,100
Answer! Tell me you bastard!

272
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,040
- Seonbae! 
 - Hey, hey!

273
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,770
- Let go, let go. Let go, let go.  
 - Answer me!

274
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:46,810
Let go! Get out! Get out!

275
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,830
SAS, it's SAS.  (Special Air Service, the British Army Special Forces)

276
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,340
He was a member of the Special Forces and served in Afghanistan for two years.

277
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,480
- What was his position? 
 - Survival Instructor.

278
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,180
- Survivol? 
 - Yes, it's called bivouac.

279
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:23,870
It's a method to survive in nature without any equipment.

280
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,200
Whether it is a jungle or a desert, while avoiding the enemy's pursuit, you start a fire,

281
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,650
obtain water and food, and make a weapon.

282
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:32,310
If he became an instructor, he understands interrogation techniques.

283
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,090
He must have been trained.

284
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:38,240
He must be able to withstand a lot of physical and psychological pressure.

285
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,040
This is driving me crazy.  We put on an amateur show before a professional.

286
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,950
Since this happened anyway, we have nothing to lose.  Let's just beat him up!

287
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,900
Does that make any sense?

288
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,270
If we don't, what else are we going to do? Do you have some other option?

289
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,450
Come on, we are trying to think of something fast.

290
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,250
So until when will you do nothing but think?

291
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,440
I'll go in.

292
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,190
Investigator?

293
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,420
Why? Hasn't he messed with our minds long enough up to now?

294
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,080
Seonbae.

295
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,960
It's my fault we didn't have enough information.

296
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,480
I should have known he was in the military from looking at the way he carries himself.

297
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,150
I'll go in and talk about it.

298
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:19,630
No.  It's enough that up to now your assistance has been helpful.

299
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,200
Our team will handlie it from now on.

300
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,410
Let's go grab a bite.

301
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,830
Here.  Eat this first.

302
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,910
It's quite a physical battle.

303
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,750
If you're going to grasp it with your hand, it's going to be hot.

304
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,710
Give me your hand.

305
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,280
Hold it like this.

306
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,220
I'm sorry for before.  I did whatever I felt like doing.

307
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,070
You did a good job.

308
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:30,200
With such a person, it might be better to explode emotionally once in a while.

309
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,800
But there's something that is bothering you.

310
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,680
Isn't there something weird about him?

311
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,840
Such as?

312
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,730
He constantly didn't know and didn't remember.

313
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:54,940
When confronted with proof, then he would change his position and change what he said.

314
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,840
Eye contact made him uncomfortable.   From behavioral psychology, aren't they characteristics of a liar?

315
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,210
I can't say everything is a lie.

316
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:10,260
It was in the UK.  They recorded and compared

317
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,540
a person who made false statements and a person who told the truth.

318
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,440
The conclusion was it was 50-50.

319
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,950
There are circumstances when the person is truthful even though he moves nervously.

320
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:24,430
and circumstances where even though the person is calm and doesn't move, he is lying.

321
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,590
I heard he received professional training.

322
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:34,360
Then he should have been more active in his own defense,

323
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,050
but he didn't do anything. Why would he do that?

324
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:47,160
Just what is his motive?

325
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,960
- Just what is his motive? 
 - What's your motive?

326
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,140
No, the victim wants to prove his damages,

327
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,410
but what if the company won't release the information?

328
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:00,500
If we exclude this, just what is the significance of the class action law? 
   Assemblyman Lee Min Gi

329
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,410
Are you trying to take the teeth out of the law in deference to Seoryun Group?

330
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:07,400
No.  Is there any company that meekly discloses management secrets?

331
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,940
Companies are having a hard time now. Are you going to kill them all?

332
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,650
Who is killing whom?

333
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:18,020
Hey.  If  I, as a ruling party member, have a chance to speak, I will tell you.

334
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:23,520
No, Chairman.  Why do you stifle discussion whenever an issue is raised about Seoryun Group?

335
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:27,080
 Lee Hwa Jeong

336
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,130
When have I ever stifled discussion?

337
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,840
You need to be neutral 
  Park Seong Hwa

338
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,150
Are you protecting Seoryun right now?

339
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,190
What do you mean, "protecting"? Watch your mouth.

340
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,410
If not, why do you keep stopping the discussion?

341
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,760
When we are just wasting our time, shouldn't we skip the meeting?

342
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,950
Where do you come off not speaking respectfully to the chairman?

343
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:47,560
Are you going to keep on picking on the words I use?  Do you want to have a meeting or not?

344
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,030
The citizens are watching right now.  Are you going to do any work?  What the!

345
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:53,900
- That's what I mean! Those very words.  I mean.  Are we having a meeting or what?  
 - Chairman!

346
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,950
 Lee Hwa Jeong

347
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:10,570
Stop and be quiet!  Quiet!

348
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:14,440
Oppa?  Hello?

349
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:20,110
I have to do everything myself.

350
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,260
Wise up Seoryun Corporation!

351
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,310
Wise up! Wise up!

352
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:31,410
Identify the cause of the outbreak!

353
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,480
Identify! Identify!

354
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,560
Compensate the Evergreen victims!

355
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,700
Compensate! Compensate!

356
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,600
 - Evergreen! 
 - Stop it! Stop it!

357
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,640
 Identify the cause of the outbreak!

358
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,680
 Identify! Identify!

359
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,790
 Compensate the Evergreen victims!

360
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,760
 Compensate!  Compensate!

361
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,860
 - Seo Han Tae 
 - Murderer

362
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,980
 - Seo Han Tae. 
 - Murderer.

363
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,080
This was filmed  in front of the main gate this morning.

364
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,300
I believe the trigger was that last month, the head of the victim's group, who was in his 50's,

365
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,460
burned himself to death.

366
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,220
What's the media doing?

367
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,860
On the portal, there is even a web cafe for the Evergreen victims' group.

368
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:16,500
In the week following the burning, the membership soared to two thousand.

369
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,910
Two thousand?

370
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:23,090
Some say a petition campaign should be launched to demand that the prosecutor investigate.

371
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:28,920
- Legal team.  Is it still not a problem? 
 - No.

372
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,010
Quit talking without thinking!

373
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,240
I heard the National Assembly will discuss the class action law.

374
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,370
If it passes, won't that be fatal to us?

375
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:42,840
Even if the bill were enacted, it wouldn't matter to us.

376
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,120
It wouldn't matter to us?

377
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:49,550
It will stop mattering if it isn't proven that the main ingredient of Evergreen, TH-5, is harmful.

378
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:53,340
We just need a medical conclusion that the product manufactured by us

379
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,110
is not related to the outbreak.

380
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,570
Conclusion?

381
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:02,780
All of the nation's leading research institutes seek donations from us.

382
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,580
Research results depend on sample selection.

383
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:10,170
The professors are all veterans in producing results.

384
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,880
The future is the problem.

385
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:17,110
If we continue to produce the Evergreen line, there will be another victim.

386
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:20,590
Hold Evergreen for a long time but

387
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:24,050
move slowly toward discontinuing it.

388
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:31,090
That's easily said.  Don't you think of the cost of developing the brand?

389
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,290
Renew the brand.  Let's rename it again.

390
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,300
What?

391
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:42,360
Change everything, the packaging, label, brand, and logo, so that even the thought of Evergreen won't come to mind.

392
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:47,790
Don't touch the essence, the process for production, and the container for the contents.

393
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:52,070
Minimum cost, you know?

394
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,740
Yes, sir.

395
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,960
She is coming.

396
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,200
Alpha.  Alpha is coming.

397
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,510
She is going up.

398
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,600
Welcome.

399
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,320
 Demonstration site of controversy over harm allegedly caused by  Seoryun Corp's TH-5

400
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,950
What are you going to do about that?

401
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,970
Without a permit, it's an illegal demonstration.

402
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,660
We will handle it according to the law.

403
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,970
I met the bereaved family of the person who burned himself to death and delivered the consolation money.

404
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:43,150
- Contact each victim's family and find out what they want. 
 - Yes, sir.

405
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,510
Do it quietly like flowing water.

406
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:50,990
Quietly avoid even the rustle of falling leaves until the new headquarters building opening.

407
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:00,790
What is it?  Isn't the meeting over?

408
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,490
Can Chief Bae do this to me?

409
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:13,060
In front of me, he is just "Hyungsunim, Hyungsunim"  (Elder sister-in-law)  while giving lip service.

410
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,980
But what amazing doctor is making you throw a fit?

411
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,980
- The one who did Hong Geun Cheol's mother-in-law's surgery. 
 - Oh.

412
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,860
Do you think rising stars of that quality are so common?

413
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:31,440
Young, handsome, with a title from a foreign university which Koreans kneel and die for.

414
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,230
Thanks to him, our hospital is making an image.

415
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:39,600
Without notice to me, early in the morning Bae's minions stormed in and turned the hospital upside down.

416
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:45,370
He was handcuffed as he left the operating room where the whole hospital staff could see. Oh, god.

417
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,400
- What does this do to my image? 
 - My goodness...

418
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,040
What the hell kind of incident did he get arrested for?

419
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,070
Suspicion of murder.

420
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,860
What?

421
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,580
Hey.  Kids nowadays are violent.

422
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:14,710
It's neither drugs nor booze.

423
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,190
Did I tell you not to hang around Chief Bae?

424
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,950
Just because he's a junior from school, you and Oppa have hung around with him a bit,

425
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:24,190
now he thinks he's on the same level as us.

426
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:27,290
Yes, Bae Seung Gwan.

427
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,820
I really didn't know, Hyeongnim.

428
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:37,040
Well, it looks like the guys went out on their own to make an emergency arrest in the early morning.

429
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,230
I also had a special lecture at the police university in the morning, so I only just got the report.

430
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:49,440
If I had known he was a doctor at your wife's hospital, I would have prevented them from doing anything at all.

431
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,660
I wouldn't let anything bad happen.

432
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,740
I will take care of it soon.

433
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,800
Don't worry. Salute!

434
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,570
 Why did you follow him?

435
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:16,630
 I did follow him but it was because we were going to play cards together.

436
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,770
 I'm not familiar with the roads here.

437
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,710
You bastards!

438
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:00,280
You punk, who says you can make an arrest without asking me first?

439
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,280
I was going to let you know as soon as you got to work.

440
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,320
Does he look like some sort of street thug?!

441
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,070
He's a doctor. An ace at Seoryun Hospital.

442
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:17,440
You should have thought about whom you were arresting. Do you know how valuable he is?

443
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,820
Don't drag this out, release him right now.

444
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:27,470
Release him? What do you mean?

445
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,440
All you have is circumstantial evidence.

446
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,320
There are sufficient grounds for arrest.

447
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,110
There is a risk he'll flee or destroy evidence.   (TN: Either ground is sufficient to arrest and hold for 48 hours without a warrant.)

448
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,040
After getting the warrant, then if we release–

449
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,760
Do you think you'll get a warrant?

450
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,480
Don't make things worse and just let him go.

451
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:49,180
Why won't we get a warrant?

452
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,520
Why not?

453
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,280
Oh, because Seoryun is backing him?

454
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,860
Are you saying it's a waste of time getting a warrant because a Seoryun scholarship recipient is running the Central Prosecutor's office?

455
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,930
- Hey Cha Jae Hwan. 
 - If we release him now, don't you think we'll look like a joke?

456
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:13,360
It's not enough to be treated poorly by prosecutors, so should we take orders from the rich now too?

457
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,480
- Hey! 
 - This is why people call police jjabsae*! Damn it! 
  (*derogatory name for police, "fuzz")

458
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,600
Are you crazy? Huh?!

459
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,910
How dare you.

460
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:26,500
- Please stop. 
 - Calm down. Calm down.

461
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:30,490
You are Cha Jae Hwan, right?

462
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:33,270
The one that Han Ju Seok had under his wing.

463
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:36,200
Yes, sir.

464
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,010
I'm Team Leader Han Ju Seok's kid.

465
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:47,030
Chief, you were close to Team Leader Han too.

466
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:50,060
I heard that you brought Team Leader Han, who used to be a policeman at a substation,

467
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,720
to the crime department even though he didn't want to,

468
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,660
because you thought he was smart and could keep secrets. Isn't that right?

469
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:02,080
Chief, you were the one who brought him here.

470
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:06,160
We are family, right?

471
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,640
Even if the mutt I was taking care of died,

472
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,860
I wouldn't do this!

473
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:15,030
That's enough. Let's go.

474
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:18,960
You're not just anyone. You shouldn't be doing this to him. Right?

475
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,190
Why don't you answer me? Answer me!

476
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,000
These days there's no discipline for these guys.

477
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,060
Chief.

478
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:50,400
Please give us until midnight with Lee Jung Yeop.

479
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:56,480
I even made an emergency arrest, but if we let him go after not even a day, we will look like a joke.

480
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,540
There are people watching us

481
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,550
and the guys will become frauds.

482
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,400
Seoryun's legal team will be here soon. Take care of it before then so there are no problems.

483
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:32,870
Mrs. Jang! Are you going somewhere?

484
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:35,250
We have to serve lunch.

485
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:39,730
Why are you being like this? I told you I had to go to a funeral today.

486
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:42,310
You even gave me condolence money.

487
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:46,510
Yesterday you made a fuss saying that I didn't send the payment to the customer.

488
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:50,940
Mrs. Cha. What's going on with you nowadays?

489
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,460
Hmm? Goodness.

490
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,840
- Mrs. Cha. 
 - Welcome.

491
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:13,160
I didn't come to eat. Sit down for a moment.

492
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:20,650
About that dead old man's house.

493
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:24,220
Where should I start?

494
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:29,800
What kind of family does he have? I hope he had relatives.

495
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:35,800
It's been a while since the funeral, and we can't leave it like that forever.

496
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,780
I'd like to take out his things.

497
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,500
Sure.

498
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,420
I know it must be upsetting after what happened to him,

499
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:52,040
but what are we to do? We have to pay rent and make a living right?

500
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,680
Yes.

501
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,610
I'll leave it in your hands.

502
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,210
You don't have to see me out.

503
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:12,730
Mrs. Jang, you said you were going to the funeral today right?

504
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:15,720
Take this on my behalf since I can't go in person.

505
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,130
Mrs. Jang!

506
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:31,920
You've had quite an ordeal.

507
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,950
It's nothing.

508
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,080
Sit.

509
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,520
You said you're a doctor from England?

510
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,680
Yes.

511
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,040
I heard that you performed the surgery on Dr. Hong Geum Cheol's mother-in-law.

512
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:52,550
When you go into the operating room, every patient is the same no matter where you are.

513
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:59,030
You're very straightforward.

514
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:05,330
Hey, punk. You guys are misunderstanding this man.

515
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:09,730
We apologize.

516
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:19,470
Internally and externally it will show that you came in as an expert reference.

517
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:24,670
You can go home soon, so don't worry, and make yourself comfortable.

518
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:25,910
Thank you.

519
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:29,980
And if anything has made you uncomfortable thus far, go ahead and tell me.

520
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,650
Oh right. You have to eat.

521
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:36,400
What do you like? Steak? Pasta?

522
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,630
No. I'm okay.

523
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:52,580
As you go through life, sometimes you get unlucky with bad situations out of nowhere.

524
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:58,050
If you don't let those things go then it will only make things harder for you.

525
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:02,270
After all, we'll be seeing each other again, right?

526
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,670
Do you still not understand what I'm saying?

527
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:13,940
I have a very close relationship with Chairman Lee Hwa Jeong.

528
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,120
Her father-in-law, Chairman Seo, was my seonbae in high school.

529
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,740
Do you not know because you're a foreigner?

530
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:30,640
Anyway, let's go have a meal when things calm down.

531
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:44,900
It's six o'clock, punk. Are you a chicken?

532
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:49,640
Stand up straight!

533
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,130
I-I-I'm sorry.

534
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:54,330
What did the ancestors of the 9th generation of the Dumun Gongpa of the Hyeongju Bae clan,

535
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:58,140
who served as a left state councillor during the Joseon Dynasty, always say?

536
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:04,110
The right mindset comes from the right posture, right?

537
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:09,130
What are they trying to do when these young people are weak?

538
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,580
 Bae Seung Man

539
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,060
I have to go to the bathroom.

540
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:19,400
 Is it five minutes to 6 o'clock?

541
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:24,910
 Look how crooked you are. Stand up straight!

542
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,150
 Building a democratic welfare state that embodies a just society.

543
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:32,270
Your order of two Americanos is ready.

544
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:39,020
- Thank you. 
 - Goodbye.

545
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:44,840
What's going on with Lee Jung Yeop? What is he doing?

546
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,940
His mouth is closed tight. He's not even eating.

547
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:51,940
We only have about an hour left at the most.

548
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:55,770
Then don't we have to push him hard?

549
00:49:55,770 --> 00:50:01,330
I'm going crazy. I can't even look up the communication records because the warrant hasn't come through.

550
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,450
What about his browsing history?

551
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:07,880
It's a foreign portal site that doesn't use SNS.

552
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,760
The site is mostly used by foreign companies. It looks like getting access will be tough.

553
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,890
What about the hospital? Is there anything else from there? Anything on the patient medical records?

554
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:30,110
Seonbae Geon Young was looking into that.

555
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,250
Where did that jerk go?

556
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,110
 Interrogation

557
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:39,540
Hey! Where have you been?

558
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,830
I went to go get some coffee.

559
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,240
Coffee? This jerk really went by himself.

560
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:49,070
It was for Lee Jung Yeop. He has luxurious tastes so he sent me to buy expensive coffee. He even made me buy two cups.

561
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:53,810
- That's crazy. 
 - How despicable.

562
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:58,030
Hold on. Did you say you bought two cups?

563
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:15,230
What is he doing?

564
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:19,810
I think he's giving an invitation?

565
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:25,790
To whom?

566
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:41,690
Your suit is nice.

567
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:47,680
I'm Profiler Eugene Hathaway.

568
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,510
That's unexpected.

569
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:53,700
I was expecting someone more powerful.

570
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,860
Are you disappointed?

571
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,040
No. You were just different from what I expected.

572
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:06,100
You are not a Korean police officer. For whom do you work?

573
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:10,470
I'm with the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation. I was dispatched to the Central Police Agency.

574
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:12,650
FBI?

575
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,820
It's cold.

576
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,830
You should have come earlier.

577
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:25,590
Why, are you busy?

578
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:28,740
I will be out of here in a little while.

579
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:32,650
Yes, I know.

580
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,990
You said your name is Eugene, right?

581
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:44,690
Where are you from? Not your nationality, but your ethnicity.

582
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:48,660
Are you Korean? Mixed race?

583
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,520
Why do you want to know that?

584
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,570
If you want to hear the truth, you also have to tell the truth.

585
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,810
Building rapport. You should know it well.

586
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:57,750
 Rapport - Intimacy or trust formed with the other party.

587
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,510
What's going on?

588
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:02,480
Why is he suddenly talking so much?

589
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,990
Is it because he's in front of a woman?

590
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:17,090
I was born in Korea and then adopted.

591
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,070
Did you know?

592
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:29,230
You were born in Korea and adopted, right?

593
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,460
Do you have a question?

594
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,780
What are your parents like?

595
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:36,260
They were good people.

596
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:40,350
They were good people.

597
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,000
You're using the past tense. They're still alive.

598
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,800
Why? Do you think I was abused?

599
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,640
Why do you think that?

600
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,800
Francis Bacon.

601
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:03,490
Do you like contemporary art?

602
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:10,320
This artist's work is not commonly seen in Korea. How did you get your hands on it?

603
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,800
Did you buy it yourself?

604
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,100
No. It was a gift.

605
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,990
Why Francis Bacon of all artists?

606
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,920
Some people don't like this artist.

607
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:30,650
Just because I like grotesque paintings doesn't mean I had a twisted childhood.

608
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:32,720
What was your childhood like?

609
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,880
What are your parents like?

610
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:41,810
Answer me.

611
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:45,650
If you answer, then I will answer your questions.

612
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:08,020
They were

613
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,920
good people.

614
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,640
You used the past tense.

615
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,050
Why did you come to Korea?

616
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,130
Because it was a good opportunity.

617
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:22,780
Because in the UK, being a doctor is like being in public service.

618
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,140
What about here?

619
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:27,330
It's a job that makes money, and they're very well liked.

620
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:30,630
Are you saying that Koreans are your money makers?

621
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:32,540
You don't like Korea.

622
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,600
Oh, do I have to like it?

623
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,630
Do you like it?

624
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:39,580
I try to understand.

625
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:45,070
Understand? Liking something is in the area of emotions.

626
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,050
Understanding is this side.

627
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:50,060
To like is this side.

628
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:52,610
These are completely different.

629
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:59,370
Do you have a problem with this side?

630
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:02,720
Are you analyzing me?

631
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,650
Are you offended? I didn't mean to.

632
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:11,540
I'm not offended, I'm disappointed.

633
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:16,840
Lee Jung Yeop, you are more of a coward than I thought.

634
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,430
Thank you for the coffee.

635
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:24,770
Wait a minute.

636
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:28,230
What do you want to say?

637
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:32,080
If you call for me then talk. Don't mess around with me.

638
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:37,260
What is important now?

639
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:42,800
What do you need to know?

640
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,180
Who the culprit is?

641
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:50,150
No. What's really important is

642
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,280
who's next.

643
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,710
Are you warning us of the crime beforehand?

644
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:09,240
Lee Jung Yeop. Are you the culprit?

645
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,670
If you're not, do you know who the culprit is?

646
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,680
No.

647
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:30,320
You should not ask who did it but why they did it first.

648
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:35,820
Nothing on this Earth just happens for no reason.

649
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:42,390
It's memories that make us human, because everything that is happening now is a result of the past.

650
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:45,710
The past?

651
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:47,670
What past?

652
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:49,890
Whose past?

653
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:04,030
Who are you?

654
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:25,190

655
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:29,810
♫  Some people want to live  ♫

656
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:33,260
♫  But turn their back on me  ♫

657
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:39,670
♫  The time I lived with me  ♫

658
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:42,210
♫  Some people say to me  ♫

659

660
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:49,750
 Officially, from now on, whatever you do has nothing to do with our investigation team.

661
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:52,530
 Actually, I met someone I wanted to meet.

662
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:56,610
 Chimera died thirty five years ago.

663
00:58:56,610 --> 00:59:01,720
 What if he's not the culprit but someone chasing the culprit?

664
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:06,540
 Don't lose me. That's all you have to do.

665
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,420
 Okay, attention!

666
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,730
 I'm crazy. Damn it.

667
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,300
