 Chimera

00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:28,210
 The characters, locations, incidents, religious sects, etc. in this drama are fiction and have no relation to reality.

  ~ Episode 8 ~

5
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,000
Why are you telling me this now?

6
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,600
This is driving me crazy.

7
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,350
What were you doing those long years before you showed up?

8
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,790
It was a big decision for me, too.

9
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,990
There must be a reason why you made that decision.

10
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:08,930
You were where you could even live and comfortably forget everything.

11
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,490
I believe in my father's innocence.

12
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,260
The families of law-breakers all say the same thing.

13
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,430
My son, my husband, couldn't do something like that.

14
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,190
I'm certain. Because I heard it myself.

15
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,270
When?

16
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,750
 35 years ago

17
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,090
Dad, does it hurt a lot?

18
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,600
No.  I'm okay.

19
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,460
Dad.

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,860
Son.

21
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,680
Don't cry.

22
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,900
I'm...

23
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,140
I am innocent.

24
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,280
People who are innocent get released. That's the law.

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,260
Dad, come quickly.  Mom is sick.

26
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,320
Okay.  I will go home soon.

27
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,590
So, don't cry.

28
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,500
You have to take care of Mom until then. Okay?

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,050
My Tae Yeong is a brave man, right?

30
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,880
You're going to have a younger brother soon.

31
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,930
You will be a hyeong  (older brother) , right?

32
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,560
Are you going to be a coward?

33
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,850
No.

34
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,050
Then you need to be brave, right?

35
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,180
- Let's go now, quickly. 
 - Dad.

36
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,490
We should go before those scary guys come.

37
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:10,000
Tae Yeong. You don't have to listen to everything people say.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,030
Do you understand?

39
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,890
Just a second.  Just a second.

40
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,290
Make the right choice. At the rate things are happening, you may be left alone.

41
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,000
Even if that happens, you must not lose your integrity.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,920
Do you understand?

43
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,160
- Dad. 
 - Tae Yeong.

44
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,900
- Tae Yeong. 
 - Dad! Dad!

45
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,890
Dad, Dad.

46
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,890
I remembered that Han Ju Seok was a good person.

47
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:04,220
I hoped he would tell me the truth,

48
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,840
but I found him too late.

49
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,160
Detective Cha.

50
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,710
I'm certain my father did not commit suicide.

51
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:24,140
He definitely told me that he would come home.

52
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,030
Does such a person commit suicide two days later?

53
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,490
And abandon his family?

54
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,560
It's going to be hard to uncover the truth.

55
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,900
There's not much evidence left.  They didn't do an autopsy either.

56
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,990
The corpse was cremated.

57
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,970
All the relevant people are dead, too.

58
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,040
 Remarks:  Arresting Officers:  Ham Yong Bok, Han Ju Seok, Bae Seung Gwan

59
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,060
Geon Yeong.

60
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,690
On Friday night, around 21:00 (9 pm), 113 Hwai Street, Jungsan-gu,

61
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:32,370
there was an explosion of unknown cause at the construction site of Seoryun Group's new building.

62
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,430
According to the Jungsan Fire Station, who were dispatched to the scene,

63
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,900
only a field office exploded. It burnt to the ground.

64
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,970
What about the casualties?

65
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,290
Two people on the site died. Another will die.

66
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:53,010
But why is this being assigned to us?

67
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,920
If there is any fire in the Seoul metropolitan area, are they all our cases?

68
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,640
We're so busy we could die. Damn it.

69
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:04,670
Around 21:00 (9 pm), the time of the incident, the UBS broadcasting station received a suspicious phone call.

70
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:09,860
The caller said he was "Chimera."

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,820
They said the Chimera called?

72
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,680
Wasn't it a practical joke? There are so many weirdos nowadays.

73
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,310
He said to check the aerial view of the scene.

74
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:26,130
This ... is a photo from Jungsan Fire Station. 
  Aerial View of Seoryun Tower Construction

75
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,180
 Can't you understand?

76
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,390
 Chimera.

77
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,000
 I said I am Chimera.

78
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,970
 I said I am Chimera!

79
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,160
Isn't that another prank call?

80
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,700
The time he called is the same as the Seoryun Tower construction site explosion.

81
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,390
He was calling at almost the same time it exploded.

82
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,830
That means it's the truth. He didn't say anything else?

83
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,190
He just said that and hung up.

84
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:15,310
Hey.  You should have dragged it out and got more out of him. You have no skills.

85
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,690
If it is real, shouldn't we let the police know?

86
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,550
Listen to it again.  Is there anything left out?

87
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,220
 Can't you understand.

88
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,830
 Chimera.

89
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,410
 I am Chimera.

90
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,570
What do you mean Chimera?

91
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,180
It's the lighter, right?

92
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,170
Check it out properly!  Is it the lighter from 35 years ago?

93
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,370
Are you positive Lee Jung Yeop was at work that day?

94
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,680
Look thoroughly into what he was doing.

95
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,390
All right.  Call me later.

96
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,360
Hanging up.

97
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,440
Wear this.

98
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,690
Why? Is it to make it obvious that I was summoned while asleep?

99
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:23,240
A person died. If you look too neat, it doesn't look good.

100
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,910
Being grief-stricken is such good marketing.

101
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,500
Shirts?

102
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,560
This is better.  Wear this.

103
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,580
You're making me do all sorts of stuff.

104
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,650
- What about the victims? 
 - A site manager and two employees of subcontractors.

105
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,900
The site manager and one subcontractor employee died. One is in critical condition.

106
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,100
Please treat all of them as full-time employees of the main office with insurance compensation and funeral expenses.

107
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,520
For the critically injured person, announce you will assign the best medical staff from our hospital.

108
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,890
What?  You have a bed to spare?

109
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,410
We have many unused VIP rooms.

110
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:01,820
You should meet with the bereaved families and visit the patient at the hospital.

111
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,010
You're good at doing dramatic things.

112
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,560
Why did this happen as soon as we started construction on the new building?

113
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,350
If we stop the use of equipment and manpower like that, we will lose hundreds of millions of won each day.

114
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,040
In order to meet the completion schedule, I need to reset all the plans I made.

115
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,870
- What a headache! 
 - Think positively.

116
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,590
Because it's not an accident but an act of terror, how fortunate you are!

117
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,220
How common is it for us to be victims?

118
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,710
But why is it Chimera of all monsters?

119
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,030
I guess the bomber has the same hobby as you.

120
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,750
This person, really ...

121
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,760
This time, it looks like it's bothering you. Getting angry and throwing a fit.

122
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,840
Lighten up.

123
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,800
I'm sorry, sir, I can't tell you that.

124
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,450
As soon as the results of the investigation are released, we will post a press release so that you can see it at that time.

125
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,600
You don't need to evacuate.

126
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,000
- You can trust us. 
 - Sir, why are you cursing? How old are you?

127
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,780
There's nothing we can do.

128
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,630
- I'm too old for this. 
 - You're saying that it's God's will?

129
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,990
- Exactly! Why did I even pick up a phone call like this? 
 - Why are you saying this to me!

130
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,710
- No... 
 - Yes. Yes.

131
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,690
Yes. This is Jungsan Station.

132
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,430
Yes.

133
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,840
I'm sorry. We're also doing our best.

134
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,750
Don't speak thoughtlessly.

135
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,640
No one here is just playing around.

136
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,610
If we all just go home, who will be left to catch the criminal! Are you going to catch them?

137
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,470
Go ahead! Record me! Do whatever you want!

138
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,100
Don't even try calling again.

139
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,270
  - Calm down 
 - I'm seriously going to track your location.

140
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,120
 Gas45

141
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,880
This explosion was caused by gasoline.

142
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,410
About 5 or 6 20-liter bottles worth?

143
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:28,450
If there was that much, they were planning on blowing up the whole thing.

144
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,950
Yes.

145
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,660
So how was the fire started?

146
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:37,520
Actually, there is something odd about that. There is no ignition device.

147
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,710
According to the survivors,

148
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:44,040
the chief went for a drink of water, and as soon as he smelled it he asked what it was.

149
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,320
And they said it just exploded by itself.

150
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,970
Without anything else? Just by itself?

151
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,600
Yes.

152
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,110
Oh! And something odd happened at the scene.

153
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,950
- What is this? 
 - Adhesive tape and cellophane.

154
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,520
Sulfuric acid was also detected.

155
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,500
This seems like some sort of chemical ignition device.

156
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,380
I heard that it's been intense over there lately.

157
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,330
It would be odd if it was comfortable.

158
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,960
That's true. I'm sure that the chief of that team wouldn't have come if it was nothing.

159
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,880
Excuse me? Are you talking about our chief from Jungsan Station?

160
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,980
Yes. Chief Bae Seung Gwan.

161
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,960
He came by himself when we were analyzing the ingredients of the package bomb.

162
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,560
He really didn't look too happy.

163
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,830
The substance that exploded was gasoline, but there were no signs of ignition.

164
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:18,440
I think that was the detonator. What do you think it is?

165
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,620
I don't know what it is, but I think the culprit used it to delay ignition.

166
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,250
Delayed ignition? 
   Delayed ignition: Slowing the point at which a fire will start to burn.

167
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:30,300
They filled the bottle up with gasoline, but what would have happened if they'd lit the fire on the spot?

168
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,320
The criminal would have burned too.

169
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,670
That's why they delayed ignition—to give themselves time to escape.

170
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:42,690
They must have carefully calculated how much time they would need, down to the second.

171
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:50,640
What about the lighter? I heard that another Chimera lighter was found.

172
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,750
It was a bit far away from the explosion site, stuck on a bird's eye view of the building site.

173
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,090
At a place where it would be guaranteed to be noticed.

174
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,020
A noticeable place?

175
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,620
That's odd.

176
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,560
Until now, the criminal has been leaving a lighter near the victim

177
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,350
to make the victim feel fear.

178
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,230
But this time, it's not about the victims is it?

179
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:25,710
Being aware of a third person's perspective and focusing on it.

180
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:38,320
The weather is nice outside. Would you like to go outside and do a chemistry experiment?

181
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,640
What kind of experiment?

182
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,180
Synthesizing Vitamin D.

183
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,490
Here. It's hot. Be careful.

184
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,250
Thank you.

185
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,420
Last Tuesday, I went to Hanmyeong University.

186
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,780
I saw you come out of the lecture but I pretended that I didn't know.

187
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,970
I saw you meeting someone.

188
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,520
Were you not going to tell me about it?

189
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,600
I promised to keep it a secret.

190
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,560
Don't misunderstand because nothing special happened.

191
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:50,720
More than that, I'm more curious about what you think.

192
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:59,000
Did you not trust me enough to tell me as a person and as a detective?

193
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:07,060
Is a person like me not qualified to be your colleague?

194
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:12,860
But a promise is a promise.

195
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,960
It's not because I can't trust you.

196
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,520
I usually don't trust anyone.

197
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,700
It's not that I came to Korea because I wanted to.

198
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,000
I hated coming more than dying,

199
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,690
but I made a mistake and was forced to come.

200
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:46,650
Listening to my heart, I trusted someone and made a big mistake.

201
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,410
I don't want to make the same mistake a second time.

202
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,420
When other people do something wrong, they get a second chance.

203
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,920
But that doesn't apply to someone like me.

204
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,790
He asked me to help him.

205
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:11,330
He came to Korea because there is something he must do.

206
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,510
He asked me not to lose him.

207
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:21,130
He didn't say anything specific. That's everything.

208
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:35,760
Actually, I also met Lee Jung Yeop yesterday.

209
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,200
He said he was Lee Sang Wu's son.

210
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,640
- What? 
 - He says he is Lee Tae Yeong.

211
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,970
He told you that personally?

212
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,490
And?

213
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,960
And?  I don't know.

214
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,620
He told me he is Lee Tae Yeong.

215
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,170
But for him, there is no advantage in telling me, so I wonder why he told me.

216
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,990
And it's weird.

217
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:20,060
Shouldn't I be happy thinking, "This guy is the culprit, I got him"?

218
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,560
But I feel sorry for him.

219
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,590
Why do I keep thinking he didn't do it?

220
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:36,500
Thinking such thoughts, it's ... to our late Team Leader Han it's so regr—

221
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,990
I don't know.

222
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,560
I ... I'll have juice.

223
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,700
- You quit, right? 
 - Of course.

224
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:25,440
You have two outs.  If I catch you again...

225
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,090
I really didn't drink it. If I drink again, I will yank out the steering wheel.

226
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,940
What do you think about Go Gwang Su?

227
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,950
He works very hard but he's a total loner.

228
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,510
He has never eaten with us.

229
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:46,840
I don't know what he is thinking inside.

230
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,350
I told him to resolve it quickly, but he's taking his time.

231
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,650
Did you find out about Lee Jung Yeop?

232
00:19:54,650 --> 00:20:00,020
Yes.  That Lee Jung Yeop guy.  There is neither any woman nor any money problem.

233
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,320
But it seems he has been earnestly searching for someone.

234
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,740
Searching? For whom?

235
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,970
Ex police officers.

236
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,300
Employed in the past at the Macheon Police Station.

237
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,170
What should I do?

238
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,240
- About what?  
 -  With Lee Jung Yeop.

239
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,620
Continue to look into him. Focus on who he meets with.

240
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,920
But, why Lee Jung Yeop?

241
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,310
Are you going to put him under arrest again after you released him?

242
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:42,660
Im Pil Seong. At your age, you have a lot of curiosity, right?

243
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,920
It's just ...

244
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,090
Be diligent.

245
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,850
Don't skip the trivial details and be thorough, okay?

246
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,540
Yes, sir.

247
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,870
And don't get caught by Go Gwang Su.

248
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,610
- What's going on? Calling someone at 5 in the morning— 
 - Come in.

249
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,100
How dare you tell a detective to come over whenever you want.

250
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,740
Is black tea okay?

251
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,630
"Black tea", you mean "cha*"? 
  (Tea in Korean)

252
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,530
Rather than that, is there something to chew? Chewing, huh?

253
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,270
You summoned me at dawn

254
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,100
and your hospitality is really bad.

255
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:18,420
I don't eat anthing at home.

256
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,490
You are very familiar with this house, every nook, and cranny.

257
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,270
Let's see if your living situation has gotten better.

258
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,330
This house–

259
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,110
I think it's gotten even bigger.

260
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,490
Jeez.

261
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,300
I'm returning that painting.

262
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,570
Why?

263
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,760
I don't like it as much as I used to.

264
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,630
How much is it?

265
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,570
A billion won.

266
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:17,440
I heard this time the chimera lighter turned up at the explosion site again.  Is it true?

267
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:24,020
Is that why you summoned a busy person, to ask if it was true?

268
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,820
If you're curious, watch the news.

269
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,000
I want to know who the culprit is as much as you.

270
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,050
Detective Cha. I'll give you what I have,

271
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,300
so give me what you have.

272
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,940
Why should I do that?

273
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,320
You're still my number 1 suspect.

274
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,520
I know that you don't trust me.

275
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,680
I am the son of the person whom you think is the chimera.

276
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,590
You need for the real culprit to be found if I want to get out of the line up of suspects.

277
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,300
Your goal is to find the real culprit.

278
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,190
So?

279
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:15,080
My goal ...  is to catch the real chimera from 35 years ago and reveal my father's innocence.

280
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:22,380
The chimera in 1984 and the chimera in 2019 are connected.

281
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:27,550
If we go after them from both directions, we will meet them.

282
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,840
What do you want?

283
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,040
Let me help you.

284
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,950
That's how you will help me.

285
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:58,320
You can not see the personal records of a faculty member.

286
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,640
We're doing an investigation.

287
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,740
Do you have a search warrant?

288
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,700
Or send us an official letter requesting cooperation.

289
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:37,350
Are schools always this obstinate?

290
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:43,930
The victims of the chimera case were a part of the university's research team. They won't be happy about the investigation.

291
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:49,670
There must be someone here that knows something.

292
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,730
There is one person who might know.

293
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,240
Why did you want to buy me a meal out of the blue? Especially at an expensive place like this.

294
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,070
I'm doing this to encourage my hoobae  (junior).  What would you like?

295
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,410
Well, anything.

296
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,400
Something that'll come out fast.

297
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,410
You came, Seonbae  (Senior).

298
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,470
Yes, Yeong Jun.

299
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,180
Your face looks good.

300
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,160
I got a tan while golfing.

301
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,500
Shall we do that together?

302
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,420
This is my seonbae.

303
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,900
This is the ace of our newsroom.

304
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,990
Hello. I'm Kim Hyo Gyeong.

305
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,630
I'm Han Jong Wun. 
  Seoryun  |  Han Jong Wun  |  Director of the Office of Planning and Coordination

306
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,650
Have a seat.

307
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:56,550
The planning and coordination office must be busy these days.

308
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,320
It's not a familiar situation.

309
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,250
There are always accidents and incidents but the issue is the scale of the problem.

310
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:08,080
There's a possibility this case will escalate into a problem within the business.

311
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,110
A problem within the business?

312
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,830
There are people who cause unnecessary controversies.

313
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:19,420
So, isn't that why the role of the media is important?

314
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:27,480
Reporter Kim, I heard the story you're preparing this time is really interesting.

315
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,680
I heard it's a serial murder story from 35 years ago.

316
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,820
I'll look forward to the broadcast.

317
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:45,370
There may be content included that may make you feel uneasy.

318
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,430
Hyo Gyeong.

319
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,080
What could there be to make me uneasy?

320
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,210
It's only an old murder case.

321
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,270
Don't you think so?

322
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,240
What should we eat?

323
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,580
What you ate last time is okay, right?

324
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,840
Yes, yes, that is good.

325
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,730
What do you think?  He's a nice person. That Hyeong is a super smart guy.

326
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,840
Yes, that's probably why he received the Seoryun scholarship.

327
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,150
Team Leader, you work so hard.

328
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,770
Working on broadcasts and cracking the whip over people like me.

329
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,080
Hey, what is this?

330
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,890
According to what the director of the planning and coordination office said, about the TH-5 story,

331
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,400
I heard you want me to remove it from the program.

332
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,220
I'm saying let's watch our tone of voice.  Is there anything wrong with being cautious?

333
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,600
Thanks to you, I ate well. I'll head out first.

334
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,850
Why? Where are you going?

335
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:52,670
Did I eat something too luxurious?  I'm not digesting it well.

336
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,630
A copycat?

337
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,560
Up to now, Chimera kept themself completely hidden.

338
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,320
But it's different this time.

339
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,710
They even called the media

340
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,040
while calling themself Chimera.

341
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,350
If not, could it be that it became the time to reveal their identity?

342
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:23,580
More importantly, it's noteworthy that bombing the Seoryun construction site is clearly a self-assertion.

343
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,250
The construction site for Seoryun's new building is a very symbolic location.

344
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,810
If that is so, then why did they target such a place?

345
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,950
Is it because the culprit places a lot of importance on the place?

346
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,470
That's right. That was too simple.

347
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:39,150
And he called the media and revealed their identity.

348
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:43,820
Up to now, Chimera never made such a direct claim.

349
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,530
What about the lighter?

350
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:49,700
Even at the prior bombing site, there has always been the signature lighter.

351
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,800
Isn't that enough of a self-assertion?

352
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,900
A signature is your own mark.

353
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,510
So it's like a trademark for a brand.

354
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,670
Usually, a trademark is placed where it can't be seen.

355
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,070
It's not recognized on the surface,

356
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:08,480
but it quietly shows its presence to an interested person or buyer.

357
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:15,020
But in this case, the method, should I say,  was as blatant as writing a phrase on the front of a t-shirt?

358
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,540
This crime ... is self-aggrandizing.

359
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:24,640
It's completely different from the reclusive and philosophical chimera.

360
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:30,420
But why is this man claiming that he's Chimera?

361
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,420
Well, Chimera is famous so maybe he wants to be him.

362
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,870
He's an attention seeker.

363
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:40,350
That's why this person may be more dangerous.

364
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:45,100
- What? 
 - As the number of people injured increases, attention will too.

365
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:51,260
For now, I think we should first investigate people with a grudge against Seoryun.

366
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,880
Ah, what took you so long?

367
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,350
I skipped my afternoon appointment to come here.

368
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,170
Should I leave?

369
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,930
Ah, stay. It's because I'm thankful.

370
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:23,580
But who is this?

371
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,400
He is my doctor.  I am getting his advice on TH-5.

372
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,610
- So, you are a doctor? 
 - Yes.

373
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:37,440
Which department are you in?   Which hospital do you work at?

374
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:42,000
Now, now,  we don't have a lot of time. Let's get going for now. Let's go.

375
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,100
Of course, on the school side, we should keep this hush-hush.

376
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,410
Of course, during a year, the total number of projects Seoryun has ongoing is large.

377
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:57,160
The dormitory building also, which you saw on the way here, was erected by Seoryun too.

378
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:02,470
Our school took the lead in the development of TH-5,

379
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:05,640
but because it became dangerous and people died,

380
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,350
the atmosphere here, too, was somber.

381
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,360
Oh,  here it is.

382
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:26,000
That's me, that's Professor Park and the rest of the team members.

383
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:30,000
Three people died from here, right?

384
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,830
Park In Sang, Oh Jong Geun, Lim Sang Wuk.

385
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,950
It's a little strange to be saying this about someone who is already dead,

386
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:39,590
but Professor Park had a lot of problems.

387
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,960
What problems?

388
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,760
He was incompetent but he would do anything to please his superiors who showed him money.

389
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,980
These two people were also  Professor Park's henchmen.

390
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,690
It wasn't a normal team.

391
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:54,600
What a shame for Seong Hui.

392
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,770
Is she this woman here?

393
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,990
She did all the work by herself.

394
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,590
She was a real genius.

395
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:10,400
Then, this woman Ryu Seong Hui and Baek Eun Cheol, are the two still alive?

396
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,940
Couldn't you perhaps tell us where they live now?

397
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:17,200
I doubt it. At the time, Seong Hui lived near the campus.

398
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,680
There's a rumor her house burned down and she died.

399
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,010
She died because of a fire?

400
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:28,100
Then there may be four Chimera victims.

401
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,460
There were many rumors so nothing is certain.

402
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,010
There are even people who say they saw her alive somewhere after she re-married, in a different neighborhood.

403
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,420
If she remarried ...

404
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:41,400
She was living as a young widow with a child.

405
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,540
Then what happened to the other person, Baek Eun Cheol?

406
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:48,700
I heard this guy studied abroad right before the case

407
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,690
and settled down there.

408
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:02,590
Was there any reason for resentment against Professor Park's team members at the time?

409
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:06,420
I can't say. I don't know,

410
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,590
because all the staff members are dead.

411
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,250
Ah! There is one person remaining, Seo Hyeon Tae.

412
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,240
Seo Hyeon Tae?

413
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,710
Seoryun Group's chairman, Seo Hyeon Tae?

414
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:21,150
Seo Hyeon Tae is the eldest son of the Taesam Chemical founder.

415
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:24,580
At the time his title was director.

416
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,490
Taesam wasn't very active then.

417
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:32,580
But after the successful development of TH-5 through academia-industry collaboration,

418
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,200
its status changed.

419
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,020
Thanks to that, he married the Seoryun chairman's daughter and the company merged with Seoryun.

420
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:45,110
Did Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae stay close to the team members then?

421
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:48,330
It wasn't just close.  Every night they worked all night together

422
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,200
and were all passionate about their work. Well ...

423
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,810
That is why he is a chaebol* chairman.   (* Family owned industrial conglomerate.)

424
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,500
What do you mean Seo Hyeon Tae?

425
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,990
The victims of the Chimera Case 35 years ago, Oh Jong Geun, Lim Sang Wook, and Park In Seong,

426
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:15,600
these three were the developers of TH-5.

427
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,110
All three of them were on the same team?

428
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,690
What is TH-5?

429
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:22,350
You idiot. Watch the news, Dummy.

430
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:25,260
It's the harmful ingredient in Evergreen.

431
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:29,620
- Oh, the person who burned himself alive, that one? 
 - Yes.

432
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,390
I think there were problems from the development stage.

433
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:39,290
Taesam Chemical worked with Han Myeong University's research team 35 years ago on the development of TH-5.

434
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:42,470
At the time, the person in charge of development was none other than

435
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,190
Seo Hyeon Tae.

436
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,520
So what?

437
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,410
Are you saying the next target is Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae?

438
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,520
- I'm just saying it is a possibility. 
 - Isn't that a huge leap forward?

439
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,680
If that person were the next target, why is he still alive?

440
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,140
He would have died 35 years ago like the other victims.

441
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,220
Did you intend to give us more work?  Damn it.

442
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,630
You're not even sure so why are you so excited?

443
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,050
Seonbae Cha may be right.

444
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,660
Investigator Eugene also said Seoryun Group is a target.

445
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:23,830
Hey. Did you join his fan club, too?

446
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,820
I'm going to try to meet him.

447
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,230
Welcome, welcome.

448
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,870
Hello, I'm Cha Jae Hwan from Jungsan Station Special Investigation Headquarters.

449
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,000
- I am Lee Geon Yeong. 
 - Have a seat. 
 - All right.

450
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,400
Ah...

451
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,250
My outfit is kind of off, right?

452
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:59,550
Today there is a charity game to support childhood cancer.

453
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,160
Do you like baseball?

454
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,540
- I don't like it but I'm good at it. 
 - What?  (TN: People usually say, "I like it but I'm bad at it.")

455
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,660
There's no sport that I can't play.

456
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:14,050
Then, I should invite the Jungsan Station family sometime.

457
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:17,160
It would cheer up sick people a lot.

458
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,110
We are prohibited from participating in official events.

459
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,690
Your secretary's office must have been received a notice.

460
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:28,260
The explosion at the construction site of the new building

461
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,540
may have been aimed at Seoryun Group.

462
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,900
Of course, we cannot guarantee your safety.

463
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,710
That is the reason I am asking this.

464
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:43,630
Have you been threatened, recently or in the past,

465
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:46,560
or had resentment expressed against you?

466
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,660
- What's your name? 
 - It's Cha Jae Hwan.

467
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:57,090
Detective Cha, there are a lot of people who hate me.

468
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:00,420
I can't do anything if they are interested in me.

469
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,190
There's no downside to being careful.

470
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,960
Shouldn't the police be responsible for the citizen's safety?

471
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:15,750
What are you doing just sitting and telling me to be careful?

472
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,990
Well, I'm sure you are aware of this,

473
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:30,400
but recently there was an unpleasant incident at our company.

474
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,090
Are you referring to the incident where the protestor set himself on fire?

475
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:36,920
Is there anything that makes you uneasy or anything unusual?

476
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,010
Or is there anything suspicious?

477
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,360
Well ...

478
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,990
There is nothing in particular.

479
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,770
Is that so?

480
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,150
If you think of anything, please call us.

481
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,470
Even if it's something very trivial.

482
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,130
Do you like the writer Frederick Forsythe?

483
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:37,850
 The Last Ace  is out of print in Korea.

484
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:41,450
Didn't I lock the door?

485
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:45,080
The door was open.

486
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,720
I'm reporter Kim Hyo Gyeong from UBS Press Bureau.

487
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,230
I'm Eugene Hathaway.

488
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:59,600
It's hard to get an appointment. You're very hot now.

489
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,110
What?

490
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:06,820
The rumor has gone viral that you solved the chemical mysteries of the Chimera Case.

491
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,510
But I didn't do that alone.

492
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,670
Anyway, have a seat.

493
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:17,540
I don't need either coffee or tea.

494
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,250
Let's keep it simple to save time.

495
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,950
You know about the Chimera well, right?

496
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,020
What?

497
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,650
Because you've been following the case,

498
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:40,060
I think you know everything about the Chimera better than everyone else.

499
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,930
I doubt it.

500
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:48,320
Once the first recent incident happened, we received a special program assignment,

501
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:53,430
The title is "Unfinished Story, Chimera"

502
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,480
What is it?  Is the title bad?

503
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,670
Or, is your expression not going to change?

504
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,880
Is there something I can help you with?

505
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:13,070
It's still under investigation, so there is a lot of data that can't be revealed to the public.

506
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:16,550
I'm attempting to help with the investigation.

507
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:24,150
The incidents occurring now are the same as the three cases that occurred 35 years ago.

508
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:29,060
I think the recent cases are connected to the 35-year-old cases.

509
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,050
What do you think?

510
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:37,330
You're so certain.

511
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:48,200
I am sorry to have to say this, but we don't know much about what happened 35 years ago.

512
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,330
It's the same for us, too.

513
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:56,530
It's been 35 years, would there be any information left?

514
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:01,200
That's why I am asking to get information while I work on the program.

515
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:11,740
Absolutely, there must be someone who knows something.

516
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,260
What do you think?

517
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,090
The identity of Chimera from 35 years ago ...

518
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,840
don't you want to expose it together with me?

519
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,780
A radio program?

520
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,500
It's a popular current affairs show called "Kim Se Jeong's World Magnifying Glass."

521
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,830
They asked me to bring a guest.

522
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:44,150
Isn't a broadcast sort of ...

523
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:47,770
It's radio. There's no stress.

524
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:50,820
Let's do it together.

525
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:59,300
Please look at the script I will be sending you and call me.

526
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,900
- Detective Cha! 
 - Oh.

527
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,770
Whoa, whoa. What's the matter with you?

528
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:12,510
What's going on?

529
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,970
What brings you here?

530
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:21,470
And what's going on with you, Reporter Kim?

531
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:24,390
I came to see Eugene.

532
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,570
Are you two close?

533
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:30,340
- No. 
 - No.

534
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,700
Did you get home safely yesterday?

535
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:44,490
Oh, well, I got home okay.

536
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:46,450
Aren't you leaving? I'm sure you're busy.

537
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:53,090
It's true that I'm busy, but what are you two doing after seeing me off?

538
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:56,310
Nothing...

539
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:01,870
If you are going to discuss secrets, let's share them later.

540
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:04,600
Did you forget about cooperating?

541
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,470
You clearly promised that morning.

542
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:21,410
No, that morning doesn't mean what you think.

543
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,080
You must be close to that reporter. You're even cooperating with her.

544
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,110
Oh, it's not that we're close. It's just, well...

545
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,980
Throw it!

546
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,600
Is this what you call an ignition device?  It's basically a flame.

547
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,050
Correct. A Molotov cocktail.

548
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:12,830
Put a flammable liquid into a glass bottle and cover the mouth with cloth,

549
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:15,120
light it and throw.

550
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:19,350
But why is a flammable bottle called a cocktail?

551
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:24,960
They were used to disable the Soviet tanks that invaded Finland during World War II.

552
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,750
At the time, the Soviet Foreign Minister, Molotov

553
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:31,120
In propoganda, they called the bombs they dropped on Finland "bread."

554
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:36,630
There is a theory that the angry Finns responded with the cocktail.

555
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:38,800
That sounds a bit old-fashioned.

556
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,160
The culprit used a Molotov cocktail as an ignition device?

557
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,490
The principle is similar for a Molotov cocktail, but the method is different.

558
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:48,080
Also known as "Modified Molotov Cocktail."

559
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:51,740
What's the difference from the ordinary Molotov cocktail?

560
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:55,850
It gives the culprit time to leave the scene.

561
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:58,990
It was like a time bomb.

562
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,660
It is a chemical time bomb.

563
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,400
- You saw a strip of cellophane tape at the scene, right? 
 - Yes. Yes.

564
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:08,710
That's the key point of the delayed ignition method.

565
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:13,400
I will demonstrate. This is potassium chlorate and sugar.

566
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:19,210
First, I will pour a drop of sulfuric acid into the bottom of an empty bottle.

567
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:31,020
Then, I add gasoline or ethanal, a combustible substance.

568
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:35,210
This is ethanol.

569
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,240
- It looks like water, right? 
 - Yes.

570
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,710
Next is the fire starter.

571
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:59,180
Among several bottles there is only one bottle containing a Molotov cocktail.

572
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,560
The rest have gasoline in them.

573
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,930
When the bottle with the Molotov cocktail explodes, the rest of the bottles will explode, one by one.

574
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:08,010
They probably marked it on there.

575
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:11,030
What is the function of the red tape on top of the cellophane?

576
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:13,180
Can you time it?

577
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:18,660
They needed to ignite the fire to make it explode, but that's why it was dangerous for them.

578
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,590
That is why they chose the delayed ignition method.

579
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,520
Delayed ignition refers to delaying the time of the explosion.

580
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,760
When the bottle is turned over,

581
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,200
the sulfuric acid from the bottom moves toward the lid and comes into contact with the cellophane.

582
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,250
The instant the cellophane is dissolved by the sulphuric acid,

583
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:35,870
and the potassium chlorate and the sugar meet the acid—

584
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,950
It takes from 3 to 40 seconds for the sulfuric acid to dissolve cellophane.

585
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:56,750
That's when culprit leaves the scene.

586
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:01,750
This Chimera feels different because it's a big explosion.

587
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,310
Right.

588
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:06,330
The feeling is completely different from the prior incidents.

589
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:10,300
Investigator, then, would you say this is a completely different case?

590
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:15,360
There's a possibility but I cannot say it for certain.

591
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,410
I see...

592
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,430
- Who is it? 
 - My mom.

593
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:29,060
She's not someone who would call me now.

594
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,750
Yes, Madam.

595
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,500
Oh, hello Ahjumeoni.* 
 (*Respectful address to an older woman)

596
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,470
To Mom?

597
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,510
- Was there a fire?  
 - Excuse me.

598
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:46,210
Mom.

599
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,800
Mom.  Mom, are you okay?  Are you hurt?

600
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,500
You're here?

601
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,570
Why did you come?

602
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:00,270
What is going on?

603
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,240
It's nothing much.

604
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,830
I put something on to cook and forgot about it.

605
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:12,560
Where's the scrubber?  The metal scrubber.

606
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,780
- Leave it. 
 - Stay here.

607
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:25,130
Mom, what were you trying to do?

608
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:26,970
Beef bone.

609
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:30,050
Beef bone?  Why all of a sudden?

610
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,840
It's been a while since we've had it.

611
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,780
I was going to cook a pot of it and give some to the police officer.

612
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:42,630
Huh?

613
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:46,270
Don't tell him I burned it while it was boiling.

614
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:48,990
He will worry again.

615
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:58,990
But ... why didn't he come with you today?

616
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,870
Yes, this is Bae Seung Gwan.

617
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:24,830
Yes.

618
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:30,870
Oh, no. There was no family to contact.

619
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:37,670
If you let me know the funeral cost, I'll take care of it.

620
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,790
Yes.

621
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:57,410
Poor guy.

622
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:02,390
I'm sorry, Yong Bok.

623
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,450
I am sorry.

624
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:16,450
I'm sorry...

625
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:22,760
Yong Bok, I'm sorry.

626
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,040
 Do you remember?

627
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,690
 Thirty-five years ago,  1984,

628
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:38,680
 early summer before the LA Olympics

629
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:43,090
There was an incident in Macheon City that terrified all of Gyeonggi Province.

630
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:46,690
The three explosions, three dead victims.

631
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:50,940
We call the mysterious incident for which the method of the crime, even less so, the culprit's identity are yet unknown,

632
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:56,830
the Chimera Case.

633
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,280
But it's becoming a hot topic again

634
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,290
because the same kind of incident is happening recently.

635
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:08,480
Hello, I'm Kim Se Jeong, the MC of the World Magnifying Glass.

636
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:15,800
Today, we will spend time tracking down the secrets of the so-called Chimera Case.

637
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:18,780
Yes, the people who are together with us today,

638
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,060
from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation,

639
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,120
who's been following the Chimera case for a long time,

640
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,890
Profiler and Investigator Eugene Hathaway.

641
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:28,860
Yes, and a reporter from UBS News, Kim Hyo Gyeong.

642
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:31,350
These two are at the studio.

643
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:34,990
First, would you introduce yourselves to the audience?

644
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:37,900
Hello, I'm Eugene Hathaway.

645
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,270
Nice to meet you.  I am Kim Hyo Gyeong.

651
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,450
 Let me ask you directly.

652
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:09,500
   Reporter Kim, why is the case called the Chimera case?

653
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:13,900
 A lighter with a chimera design on it was found at the scene of the explosion.

654
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,850
 It's something like a sign unique to the criminal.

655
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:21,180
 Like a brand. 
 - You could say that.

656
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:27,910
But what is meant by saying a similar incident is happening again in 2019?

657
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:31,020
The three murders in the last month or so are

658
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:34,970
consistent with a similar MO of the Chimera Case from 35 years ago.

659
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:38,000
When you say consistent with, it's not that they are similar,

660
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,940
but that they are completely identical, Investigator?

661
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:44,230
I think the first two cases are the same.

662
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:47,900
However if you look at the parcel explosion in Gyeongpo a few days ago,

663
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,240
it can be seen as a form of taking a step forward.

664
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:55,200
Now, I can't help but talk about the explosion at the new Seoryun building construction site

665
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,750
that happened three days ago.

666
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:03,310
Never having done this before, starting from this case, the culprit called and said he was the Chimera.

667
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:06,070
 What do you think about the incident.

668
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:11,920
Officially, I'm not at a stage where I can discuss it yet.

669
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,850
Then, Investigator, what is your personal opinion?

670
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:21,610
Telling you what I think personally,

671
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:31,060
there's a high probability that this incident was a copycat incident.

672
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:35,080
 A copycat?  What's the reason you  think that?

673
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,850
Previously, the incident targeted a specific person.

674
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:41,180
This time, the target is unclear.

675
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:45,750
This means the culprit's goal is also unclear.

676
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:48,840
 The goal is unclear.

677
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:53,140
I have a different opinion.

678
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,410
Yes, go ahead, Reporter Kim.

679
00:54:55,410 --> 00:55:00,820
I agree with the Investigator that the incident is a copycat.

680
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:05,360
But I think the culprit had a definite goal.

681
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,970
From your perspective, what do you think the culprit's goal is?

682
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:14,520
The culprit called the station from the site of the incident.

683
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,770
He said he's the chimera.

684
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:20,140
I think his intentions were revealed right there.

685
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,430
What are his intentions?

686
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:28,420
It's attention.

687
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,460
Attention?

688
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:36,220
Putting it simply, he craves attention and wants to become famous.

689
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:40,390
Attention?  That's interesting.

690
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:43,620
Can you explain it in more detail?

691
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:48,700
 That's dangerous! That can provoke the culprit!!

692
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,330
I think he is a loner.

693
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:58,820
He has no friends and is socially inept.

694
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:02,520
Someone who is lonely and isolated?

695
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,400
He probably spends most of the time

696
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,390
searching the internet for explosions or incidents.

697
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:14,160
Of course, he is either unemployed or does not have steady employment.

698
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:19,390
Well, It's hard to imagine they can have a normal relationship with someone of the opposite sex.

699
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:22,810
 So he's never been in a romantic relationship.

700
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:25,210
 That's an interesting analysis.

701
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:32,820
It's a groundless assumption.

702
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:39,400
What she just said is not based on any objective fact.   What she is saying is imagination.

703
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:44,340
Then, what kind of person do you think the culprit is?

704
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:47,860
"Based on objective fact."

705
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:54,990
The culprit is someone who has been preparing and waiting for the right moment for a long time.

706
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:58,560
Contrary to what you said, there is a high probability that he is employed in an occupation where he must go to work on time,

707
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:04,620
and it's highly unlikely that he stood out, threatened anyone, or is a loner.

708
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:08,430
Why do you think that?

709
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:11,140
Terrorism is a crime of faith.

710
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:16,050
The patience of those who have faith is beyond your imagination.

711
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:19,410
To them, they don't even care about their own lives.

712
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:25,770
That is precisely the difference between someone who has faith and someone who pretends to have faith.

713
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,640
We just received a call from someone who says he is the Chimera.

714
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,350
Since we are out of time, I'm connecting him directly.

715
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,400
While you were talking, someone called the studio,

716
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:06,640
saying that he is the Chimera and wants to talk to you.

717
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,590
I'm sorry, I know it's a busy time.

718
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:34,150
It seems my mother is sick.

719
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,770
Yes. I'm going to take her to the hospital today.

720
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:41,010
If anything happens, call me. Bye.

721
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:57,430
Mom, the porridge is done.  Wake up.

722
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:15,620
Hello?

723
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,350
Hel-hello.  Please say something.

724
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:24,600
The phone is connected.  Please speak.

725
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:32,830
 This is being broadcasted, right?

726
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:35,960
Yes, the broadcast is being aired.

727
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,160
Are you the Chimera?

728
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,260
Yes, that's correct.

729
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:46,190
Was the explosion at the construction site of the new building in Jungsan-gu your doing?

730
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:50,790
Excuse me.  We want to believe you sir.

731
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:54,660
Can you tell us a few things that we can verify?

732
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:02,160
 Did you see the lighter?

733
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:06,750
 I stuck it where you would be sure to see it. In the aerial view of the construction site.

734
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:10,680
 Twenty liters of water bottles.  Five full of gasoline.

735
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,910
 Initially I was going to take six.

736
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:16,150
 But they were so heavy I couldn't carry them all.

737
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,160
 He is correct.

738
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:29,010
Hello?

739
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:34,590
I know you telephoned because you wanted to say something.

740
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:37,410
 Exactly.

741
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:44,920
 You keep asking about this incident.  Why is your thinking so limited?

742
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:48,050
 Do you think this is the end?

743
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:51,930
Does that mean the next crime has been planned?

744
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:53,990
 That's what I am saying.

745
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:59,590
What's your plan?

746
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:02,800
 Seo Hyeon Tae.

747
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,870
 What?  Who?

748
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:09,770
The head of Seoryun Group.

749
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:12,740
Seo. Hyeon. Tae.

750
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:33,050
Mom.

751
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,960
Can't you wake up?

752
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:42,450
You need to eat something so you can have some energy to go to the hospital.

753
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:49,390
Are you very sick?

754
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:03,360
You came.

755
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:21,610
Director Seo.

756
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:31,180
What?

757
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:46,020

758
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,660
 Chimera

759
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:10,500
 It's completely different from Chimera.

760
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,230
 There is something you haven't told me about my father's death, isn't there?

761
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:18,370
 I'm willing to take dangerous risks but aren't you?

762
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:19,930
 What's your identity?

763
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:20,990
 A monster.

764
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:24,300
 Let's find the blacklist from the Seoryun legal team first.

765
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,060
 If you do something foolish, we will all die together.

766
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:27,650
 Team Leader, please investigate him.

767
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:29,690
 It's the investigator's house.  I think he's with her.

768
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:32,120
 You're not the Chimera. You're a phony.

769
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,650
 What do you know?  What do you know?

770
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:36,990
 Should I tell you the truth?
