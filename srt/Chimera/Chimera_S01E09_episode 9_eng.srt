1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,020

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,260
 Chimera

3
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,170
 The characters, locations, incidents, religious sects, etc. in this drama are fiction and have no relation to reality.

4
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:34,680
 Episode 9

5
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,680
 Hello?

6
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,200
 I know you telephoned because you wanted to say something.

7
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,230
 Exactly.

8
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,460
 You keep asking about this incident. Why is your thinking so limited?

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
 Do you think this is the end?

10
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,600
Does that mean the next crime is planned?

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,520
 That's what I am saying.

12
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,040
What's your plan?

13
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,430
 Seo Hyeon Tae.

14
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,380
 What?  Who?

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,490
The chairman of Seoryun Group.

16
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,390
Seo. Hyeon. Tae.

17
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,650
Mom, who?

18
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,220
Huh? Oh.

19
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,460
What?

20
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,500
Umm ... Mom you just called me "Director Seo."  Who is that?

21
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,760
I did?

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,820
Yes.

23
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,710
What are you talking about?

24
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,700
Why did you make juk*?  I can just eat rice. 
 (*rice porridge)

25
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,750
Investigator, let's go together.

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,700
What was your plan? Why did you say he's someone who does not have a normal relationship with the opposite sex?

27
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,520
You deliberately said that to the culprit to enrage him.

28
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,230
Would he have called if I just followed along and said something from the script?

29
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,990
I know your job is to cater to the public's curiosity,

30
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,490
but shouldn't the public interest be considered in times like these?

31
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,690
Public Interest.

32
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,050
Do we have different meanings for what public interest is?

33
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,250
Isn't it in the public interest to catch criminals?

34
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,290
He's a terrorist who intends to kill.

35
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:49,140
A single word that you casually say can provoke the criminal and turn it into an extreme situation.

36
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,460
It's a matter of people's lives.

37
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,500
Should I have done nothing because I don't want to do my job?

38
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,090
I'm ready and willing to take the risk.

39
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,660
Investigator, aren't you?

40
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,810
The end cannot justify the means.

41
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,020
I thought you were as interested in Chimera as I am.

42
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,970
From Criminal Identity Profiling to Crime Method Analysis,

43
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,730
like my assignment, you are working hard.

44
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,280
Because I was asked for advice.

45
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,270
You are very concerned for a foreigner who's going to be leaving Korea.

46
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,060
-Team leader. 
 - Put it there.

47
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,970
- Oh, check the top of the bookshelf. 
 - Yes, sir.

48
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,190
There is nothing unusual.

49
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,810
- I think we'll have to look at it again.
 - Okay, sir.

50
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,430
- What's all this madness? 
 - We'll finish soon and leave.

51
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,740
The security in this home is so tight and there's no chance of breaking in, even for the Chimera.

52
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,360
I heard you checked the CCTV at the construction site?

53
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,030
Is it Lee Jung Yeop?

54
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,690
Although it was nighttime and he couldn't be identified because he's wearing a hat,

55
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,030
well, if you think about it, it's that guy.

56
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,730
What about his whereabouts?

57
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,040
- If you check his alibi, you'd know. 
 - He was on duty at the hospital.

58
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,230
If he was determined, no one would know if he slipped out for a while.

59
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,400
But the pattern of his whereabouts is a bit strange.

60
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,010
He went to Hanmyeong University.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,330
Hanmyeong University? Why did he go there?

62
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,630
They say that he asked about the TH-5 developers from  35 years ago.

63
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,000
TH-5 developers?

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,670
Yes, sir.

65
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,360
He is looking for a survivor among them.

66
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,830
As far as I know, the research team are all dead due to the Chimera.

67
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,700
They are.

68
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,530
They're all dead for sure.

69
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,730
 Does that mean the next crime is planned?

70
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,600
 That's what I am saying.

71
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,950
 What is the plan?

72
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,690
 Seo Hyeon Tae.

73
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,450
 Pardon? Who?

74
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,430
 The chairman of Seoryun Group, Seo. Hyeon. Tae.

75
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:10,420
Have you changed your opinion from the last time that he is a copycat?

76
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:15,360
Stating disorganized remarks in an angry tone and talking as if showing off.

77
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,840
He is an emotional type who cannot hide his anger.

78
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,260
He is completely different from Chimera.

79
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,830
This type has a lot of convictions for violence and Road Traffic Act violations.

80
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,450
Pardon? What does the Road Traffic Act have to do with it?

81
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,760
When you drive, your real personality comes out.

82
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,590
Oh, so he has a grudge against Seoryeon Group or Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae.

83
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:40,830
Find the person that is angry among those who have a grudge.

84
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,990
Hey. That's really easy.

85
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,490
What?

86
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,000
It could be an employee of an affiliated company who had a dispute with the company or someone who was fired.

87
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,640
There is a high possibility that unfairness has been complained about for a long time, but the complaint was ignored or denied.

88
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,630
He has a sense of despair that he can't get relief legally or from society.

89
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,480
It drove the culprit to take extreme measures.

90
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,780
He surely has posted articles on a website or left comments on an SNS site.

91
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,350
He must have sent a letter of complaint or registered letter to the company.

92
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,360
Perhaps, several times.

93
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,760
The perpetrator has been trying to reveal himself.

94
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,590
I have requested cooperation with the investigation from the Seoryun internal computer network

95
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,770
and the employment contracts from their human resources management.

96
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,260
Let's list the number of suspects focusing on litigation-related issues.

97
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,460
Yes, sir.

98
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,320
- Once the suspects are identified, please review them again. 
 - Yes, sir.

99
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,980
That's it.

100
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,770
- Excuse me... 
 - Yes, Investigator.

101
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,860
Where did Detective Cha go?

102
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,040
Ah. Seonbae went home because his mother is sick.

103
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,910
Ah, what kind of sickness does she have?

104
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,330
I can't say.  I don't know the details.

105
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,450
- Should I call him to ask? 
 -  No, I'll ask when he gets back.

106
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,930
Okay.

107
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,240
A copycat?

108
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,220
So, you're saying that this guy isn't the Gyeongpo delivery bomber?

109
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:08,860
Yeah, that's how the FBI person saw it. It makes sense.

110
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,260
Damn.

111
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,370
But why did you want to meet?

112
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,400
Oh, that is...

113
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,110
- Lee Jung Yeop. 
 - What?

114
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,710
Lee Jung Yeop did not go to Hanmyeong University alone.

115
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:31,510
- Then? 
 - With Detective Cha and the woman investigator, the three of them went together.

116
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,360
- Who? 
 - Detective Cha Jae Hwan of our team.

117
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,510
You know, the guy Team Leader Han Ju Seok always had with him.

118
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,960
But why is he with Lee Jung Yeop?

119
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,740
I have no idea.

120
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,950
- Hello. 
 Oh, yes. Cha Jae Hwan.

121
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,950
You're working hard. Is everything okay?

122
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,250
Oh, yes, well ...

123
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,480
Okay.

124
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,550
Umm, Chief.

125
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,010
- Yes?

126
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,340
About Ham Yong Bok who died not long ago.

127
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,430
You worked with him in the past in Macheon City, right?

128
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,150
Well, I did.

129
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,880
But why do you ask?

130
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,900
He was fired 35 years ago.

131
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,050
The reason for his dismissal was negligence in his management and supervision.

132
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,090
Do you perhaps know what the reason was for that?

133
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,760
Hey, punk.  How should I know?

134
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,630
Think about capturing Chimera.

135
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,140
You're not doing what you should be doing.

136
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,310
Why wouldn't I be opening the business?

137
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,190
I'm not sick, my body is just aching.

138
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,920
I'm leaving now.

139
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,460
My sewing box ...

140
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,360

 1984

142
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:37,910
 Officer Han.  Thank you for taking care of Da Som when she was sick last time.

143
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,420
 If it weren't for you, we would have been in big trouble.

144
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:46,520
 It's not much, but please try the marinated crab.

145
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,510
 Da Som, you're so adorable.  My Da Som.

146
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,310
 Do you know that?

147
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,790
 Am I wrong?  No way.

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,310
Excuse me! Student!

151
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,550
Yes?

152
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:58,120
Do you know where the Faculty of Science Research Building is?

153
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,200
The Faculty of Science?

154
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,960
Faculty of Science?

155
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,800
One moment please.

156
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,360
 Faculty of Science

157
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,260
  Natural sciences at a university 
 Areas of study include mathematics, astronomy physics, chemistry, zoology, botany and geology.

158
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,990
Ah, you mean the school of natural sciences?

159
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,920
Please follow me.

160
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,850
Thank you.

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,980
It's this building.

163
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,670
Ah. Yes. Thank you.

164
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,190
Sure.

165
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,820
 Research Institute, College of Natural Science

166
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,900
 Teaching Faculty 
 Professor Jeong In Seong

167
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,980
 Chemistry Research Team 1 
Teaching Faculty Professor Park In Sang

168
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,660
Are you looking for someone?

169
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,460
 If you're going to do this, get out of my team right now!

170
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,290
 Seong Hui, please overlook this just this once.

171
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:37,020
 My life is on the line.  If I don't obtain a patent this time, it's all over.

172
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,500
  I can't do that, Director.

173
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,280
 Seong Hui!

174
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,980
Ajumma  (older woman; aunt) ?

175
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,270
Ajumma?

176
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,930
Are you okay?  Ajumma?

177
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,800
 Emergency Center

178
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,200
Mom!

179
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,600
Are you perhaps the patient's guardian?

180
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,330
- Hanmyeong University?

181
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:13,940
Yes. The student reported that she fainted there in the graduate building.

182
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,150
They say she was looking for someone.

183
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,940
There is damage.  I think it was a long time ago.

184
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:05,370
Thirty-five years ago she had a major car accident.

185
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,830
She can't remember anything before the accident.

186
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,550
After that, weren't there any particular signs?

187
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,250
As far as I know, none at all.

188
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,190
Is it serious?

189
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,230
It looks like delirium.

190
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,480
Is that very bad?

191
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,390
The symptoms of delirium

192
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:29,220
are cognitive impairment and illusions or hallucinations.

193
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,380
They may suddenly appear and then the patient gets better.

194
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,900
Why does it happen?  Is it possible to treat it?

195
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,150
Among the elderly, it is treated with major surgery.

196
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,880
Severe illness can cause temporary delirium.

197
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,580
If the body has stress it can't handle,

198
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,630
you can regard it as a temporary malfunction of the brain.

199
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:54,520
With regard to your mother, that accident might be the cause.

200
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:00,060
Or, did something happen recently to give her a big shock?

201
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,980
My mother and Team Leader had had a close relationship.

202
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:18,680
Even before I was born, they were like family.

203
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,350
My mom didn't express it but she relied on him a lot. So did I.

204
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,410
It's useless to have a son.

205
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,130
I didn't realize anything until it reached  this point.

206
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,250
Your mom needs some time to receive her IV.  Would you like some coffee?

207
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:55,860
Did you perhaps listen to the radio?

208
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:00,090
Well, they've been talking about it on the news all day.  They say it's the Chimera's voice.

209
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,060
What do you think? About the guy.

210
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,130
- Is he real? 
 - I can't say.

211
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:11,560
The Chimera publicly says his next target is Seo Hyeon Tae.

212
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:17,530
The direction of the investigation seems to be leaning toward a copycat,

213
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,040
but how did he pick Seo Hyeon Tae?  Out of the blue.

214
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,250
You know he was a developer of TH-5.

215
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:27,110
He was close to the team members.

216
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:34,400
Up to now the people involved in Lee Sang Woo's death 35 years ago have been Chimera's targets.

217
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,130
Son Wan Gi, Han Ju Seok, Ham Yong Bok.

218
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,140
Given that, the next target is, naturally, ...

219
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,020
naturally, who is it?

220
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,210
It's not Seo Hyeon Tae.

221
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,430
Detective Cha.

222
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:56,240
There's something about my father's death that you haven't told me, isn't there?

223
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,190
You said before that my father may have died unfairly.

224
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,600
What did you mean by that?

225
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:19,340
Actually, I looked at the investigation records for the 35-year-old Chimera Case in Macheon City.

226
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,060
There was a suicide note written by Lee Sang Wu.

227
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,520
Wh-What did it say?

228
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,220
Although Lee Sang Wu wrote it himself,

229
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,900
it's not a suicide note.

230
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,540
Are you positive?

231
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,540
Who writes his resident registration number on a suicide note?

232
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,890
And the content doesn't make sense.

233
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,880
It has a feeling of writing down whatever someone said to him.

234
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,930
It's obvious it was written under coercion.

235
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:05,360
It's a shame, there's no evidence to reveal the truth.

236
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,130
There wasn't even an autopsy.

237
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,690
There is a way.

238
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,180
There were more than thirty people who investigated the Chimera case.

239
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,070
Among them, there were three who were the most senior.

240
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,930
The investigators did as they pleased under the protection of prosecutor Lee Min Gi.

241
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:31,650
Do you know who were the three amateurs there in their 20's,

242
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,120
who had no experience?

243
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,900
Han Ju Seok, Ham Yong Bok, Bae Seung Gwan.

244
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:47,280
If Bae Seung Gwan killed my father 35 years ago,

245
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,320
and if he tried to cover the case completely by murdering Han Ju Seok and Ham Yong Bok,

246
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,400
I can't believe that.  Chief Bae is—

247
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,100
Consider this.

248
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,900
Does anyone know as much as Chief Bae about the case? The rest are dead.

249
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,720
What should we do?

250
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,550
Let's look first shake up the people whom Bae Seung Gwan is afraid of.

251
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:21,890
You're not saying Seoryun? Chaebol *... are chaebol crazy? Will they help us?  * (Owners of industrial conglomerate)

252
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,300
There's a way to pressure Bae Seung Gwan by shaking up Seoryun.

253
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,380
If we find the missing puzzle piece.

254
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,460
What is that?

255
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,490
The last researcher who disappeared from TH-5 research team. Ryu Seong Hui.

256
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:46,440
 Hanmyeong University

257
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,480
Oh?  The Firefighter.

258
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,490
Are you Investigator Eugene?

259
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,650
What brings you here?

260
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,740
I'm giving a lecture in a police administration class. It's related to firefighting.

261
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,790
Oh, is there?

262
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,510
Yes.

263
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,280
I listened to the radio.   It was interesting.

264
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,730
The radio. Did you listen to it?

265
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,170
Yes. That's what I say.

266
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:24,190
It was on the real-time charts. You're amazing.  You can talk to a criminal on the phone.

267
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,910
Did you get any clues from the experience?

268
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,250
We're investigating.

269
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,470
Have you figured out how the delayed ignition method?

270
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,380
I don't believe I have ever said anything about the delayed ignition method.

271
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,530
Oh, I heard it somewhere else. From people in my line of work.

272
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,400
From firefighters?

273
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,280
Ah.  That's what I say.

274
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:53,390
If there is anything I can do to help, please call me.

275
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,010
Sure.

276
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,330
Then, I'll leave first as it is time for my lecture.

277
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,180
- Take care of yourself. 
 - You, too.

278
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,350
Humanities and social scence?

279
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:34,180
I'm sorry.  I heard when you transfer a lecture fee to a foreign bank, you need a bank code.

280
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,150
Yes.

281
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,710
If you're going to stay in Korea for a long time, it would be easier to open a domestic account.

282
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,500
No.  I'm not staying long.

283
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,080
Yes.

284
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,060
Here.

285
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,810
What time is Firefighter Kang Sang Gu's lecture?

286
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:06,270
- Who? 
 - It is Firefighter Kang Sang Gu.

287
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:09,250
I heard it's a lecture in police administration.

288
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:14,940
I doubt it.  We've never had a special lecture by a firefighter.

289
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,770
Oh.

290
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:27,790
This is the CCTV footage from in front of the elementary school near the scene of the incident.

291
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,050
Using a reflective spray on the license plate makes it unidentifiable.

292
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:36,640
If there is a distinguishing characteritic, can you see the broken taillight?

293
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,040
What's the route?

294
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,850
Well, that,  ...  it suddenly disappeared.

295
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,170
What?

296
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,970
From Dongpyeong Sreet, Jungsan-gu, going to the intersection along Shinhwa Street,

297
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,920
it vanished.

298
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,740
- Did he abandon the car in the vicinity and run away. 
 - Right.

299
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,150
- Project the map of Jungsan-gu. 
  - Yes.

300
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,450
I think here ... he's still here.

301
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,580
- What do you mean by that? 
 - Wait a minute.

302
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,510
Among the people at the Evergreen victim's gatherings, either the victim or spouse,

303
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:21,750
there is a person whose household address is in Jungsan-gu.

304
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:28,650
Let's first search the blacklist from the Seoryun legal team.

305
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,790
Is it Choi Min Sik? Choi Min Sik?

306
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,580
Here.  It's not an Evergreen victim.

307
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:46,250
Among the Seoryun C &amp; T employees, one is a resident of Jungsan-gu.

308
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:50,420
- Seoryun C &amp; T? 
 - It's an Evergreen production plant.

309
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,140
The couple worked at the plant and they both were diagnosed with cancer.

310
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,220
They filed a lawsuit against Seoryun and lost.

311
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:01,210
 Name: Kim Ji Won 
Address:  51-2 Yeongjin-ro, Jungsan-gu, Seoul.

312
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,640
Hey, man.  They're in their 60's.

313
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,400
Do your work properly.

314
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:11,770
The culprit is in his mid to late 20s and early 30s and is about 170 cm tall.

315
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,540
Not the couple, but his son.

316
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:24,920
 He is 34 years old and has a multi-conviction record with traffic violations and drunken violence.

317
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,480
 He ran a water delivery service until recently.

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,220
- Who is it? 
 - It's a delivery.

320
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,510
What is it?

321
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,310
Hold on, hold on.

322
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,710
- Freeze, bastard. 
 - Why, why?

323
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,940
We're arresting you without a warrant as the bomber at the Seoryun building construction site.

324
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,520
- What?

325
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,180
- Don't move. 
 - Okay, okay.

326
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,750
- Stay still. 
 - Okay.

327
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,300
You are here?

328
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,430
Uh, Where did everyone go?

329
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,230
Everyone's on the run because the suspect's out.

330
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,140
- Ah, the suspect?
 - Yes.

331
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:19,830
This person, Pyo Ji Seong is in the Seoryun intensive scrutiny file.

  Evergreen Litigation  
 This is a blacklist made by Seoryun.

333
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,160
It was given to us by the Seoryun legal team.

334
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,080
They sent threatening e-mails to the company or came and made a fuss.

335
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,400
- Those people have been put on a separate list.

Yes. It's Jungsan Fire Station?

347
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,780
Do you have an employee there called Kang Sang Gu?

348
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:36,000
Ah, his position is the team leader and he's in his early 30s.

349
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,000
Yes.

350
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,050
Ah, you don't.

351
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,240
Yes, I understand

352
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,560

 Kang Sang Gu

354
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,590
The police are on the conglomerate's side

355
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,490
to frame innocent citizens.

356
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:36,560
Hey, call the reporters. Call the reporters, you bastards.

357
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,660
Sit down. Sit down.

358
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:42,440
If you keep doing this, Pyo Ji Seong, you will make it worse for yourself, okay?

359
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,430
Do it just once more and we will add a charge for obstruction of justice.

360
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:48,580
The cover of the truck matches the cover of his truck.

361
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,260
Until last year, he was running a bottled water delivery company.

362
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,360
It is said that the dealership was closed as the license was revoked for drinking.

363
00:34:54,360 --> 00:35:00,800
There is a record of continuously sending threatening emails to the Seoryun group.

364
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:08,220
There were bottles of reagents believed to be explosive materials in the utility room of the house.

365
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,370
Hey, get out of the way! Get out of the way!

366
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:17,710
Come on, let's go

367
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,110
Wait a minute.

368
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:24,430
 Did you see the lighter?

369
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:28,930
 I stuck it where you would be sure to see it. In the aerial view of the construction site.

370
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:35,450
 Twenty liters of water bottles. Five full of gasoline. Initially, I was going to take six.

371
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,670
 But they were so heavy I couldn't carry them all.

372
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,010
 Hello?

373
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:47,940
 I know you telephoned because you wanted to say something.

374
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,400
 You keep asking about this incident. Why is your thinking so limited?

375
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,690
 Will it end with this?

376
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:58,090
 Does that mean the next crime has been planned?

377
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,130
 That's what I am saying.

378
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,420
 That's what I am saying.

379
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,070
 That's what I am saying.

380
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,100
 That's what I am saying.

381
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,400
 Among firefighters?

382
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,000
 That's what I am saying.

Does someone named Kang Sang Gu perhaps work here?

The result of the reagent analysis is sesame oil?

407
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:00,680
That's right.  The "reagent" we found at Pyo Ji Seong's house is sesame oil.

 Inspector Eugene

409
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,190
Yes, Investigator.  I'll call you a little later.  Yes.

410
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,280
So, this is not a bottle of reagent.

411
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,590
It's a bottle of sesame oil.

412
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:23,290
It's homemade Korean sesame oil which is scarce nowadays.

413
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,400
Don't you smell something savory somewhere?

414
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:10,150
You guys are terrific!

415
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:13,860
I heard you discovered hard-to-find Korean sesame oil.

416
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,930
Shut it already.

417
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:17,900
Let's just go. Go.

418
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,280
- What is it? 
 - Ass—

419
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,760
What's wrong with you? You're a grown—

420
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,840
Let me go.

421
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,650
I'm going.

422
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:29,740
I'd like to read the 1984 research articles on TH-5.

423
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,150
- 1984 research papers? 
 - Yes.

424
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:38,760
Among the papers in chemistry, could you locate all the articles related to TH-5 and print them out?

425
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,200
Yes, I will.

426
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,680
We meet somewhere like this.

427
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,460
What brings you here?

428
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:29,100
The president here is my friend.

429
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,140
What are you looking at?

430
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:59,560
The breeze here is so pleasant. I come here sometimes.

431
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,160
I rarely bring someone with me.

432
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,220
I am honored.

433
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,210
Recently you seem to come to Hanmyeong University often.

434
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,660
I see you're very aware of my movement.

435
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,060
You even put my card in my car.

436
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,690
If I didn't know where you frequent, I would be a fool.

437
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,590
Don't be offended.

438
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:23,540
It's for risk management.

439
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,600
I'm fine.

440
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:32,910
I saw you reading research. Are you finished studying?

441
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:39,750
It's not complete, but I have a hypothesis.

442
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,610
A hypothesis?

443
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:47,520
Did you know that  the patent for TH-5 was originally for industrial use?

444
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,680
If you use a product patented for industrial use in household goods,

445
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,190
it would be problematic, right?

446
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:59,250
Moreover, if the owner of the company that produced the product knew that,

447
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:02,860
wouldn't it possibly be the subject of judicial action?

448
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,560
Wake up from that dream.

449
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:17,330
If that could be proven, all the Evergreen victims would have become rich back then.

450
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,140
What if I have a way to prove it?

451
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:28,780
How much do you know about the Chimera incident of 35 years ago?

452
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,810
Have you heard about the suspect who was arrested at the time?

453
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:36,660
They say he committed suicide inside the detention center,

454
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,800
but I think someone killed him.

455
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:54,120
That's interesting, but I don't think this is a matter to be telling me about.

456
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,570
Isn't Lee Min Gi, who was the public security prosecutor for the case, your older brother?

457
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,460
The director of Taesam Chemical, the developer of TH-5,

458
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:04,510
where the suspect worked, is your husband.

459
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:08,260
Those two people would probably know the truth, wouldn't they?

460
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,300
I just want to know

461
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:16,280
what happened.

462
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,510
When you make a threat, you need to risk your own flesh and blood.

463
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:37,920
What does the truth matter?  How much?

464
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,740
Is it enough to risk your life?

465
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,820
Don't you have at least that much determination?

466
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,400
What's your identity?

467
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:51,460
It is a monster.

468
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:57,930
With a lion's heart, eagle eyes, and a woman's hands.

469
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:00,920
What kind of monster?

470
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,970
A sphinx? A griffin?

471
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,990
Or, if not,

472
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:09,820
a chimera?

473
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,370
A neurosurgeon.

00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:48,730
 Subject of Intensive scrutiny 
 Name: Kang Sang Gu

475
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:55,740
 Activity records / 30 threatening emails from 2013 to 2015.

476
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,880
- Ha Na. 
 - Yes?

477
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,280
Did you post this one on the wall?

478
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:06,000
No.

479
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,730
Oh. Did Investigator Eugene put it up?

480
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:10,940
The investigator?

481
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:13,670
She dropped by yesterday.

482
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,680
Please answer the phone.

483
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,860
Because you're an expert, you must know this very well.

484
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:06,070
If the volume is this large, let's see how far it will go.

485
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:26,730
Oh, yes, yes, Investigator.  It was so hectic, I am phoning you now. I'm sorry. Yes.

486
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:30,060
Oh, Darling. I just got home.

487
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,680
Pardon?

488
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,640
It's Investigator Eugene, right?

489
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,000
Yes. Are you done now?

490
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,330
M-Me?

491
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,550
I'm sorry, but don't come over today.

492
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:48,640
I suddenly have an important appointment.

493
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,620
Miss Eugene.

494
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:56,450
Come over with your friends later, do you understand?

495
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,840
 Subject of Intensive Scrutiny.

496
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,600
 Kang Sang Gu

497
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:21,530
- Ha Na. 
 - Yes?

498
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:24,040
Trace the location of Investigator Eugene's phone. Quickly.

499
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,140
Yes.

500
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:27,980
- Team Leader, please investigate him. 
 - What?

501
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,710
This guy may be the Chimera.

502
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:34,540
When you verify the location of her phone, send back up.

503
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:37,690
- Where are you going? 
 - To her house. I think the culrpit is with her.

504
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:39,390
What?

505
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:52,030
Why are you sweating so much?

506
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,610
 You should focus on what I am.

507
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,630
 I ...

508
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:20,340
 You just saw the facts.

509
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,440
  Help me.

510
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:47,660
Investigator?  How are you doing?

511
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:55,360
If you're curious, check it out for yourself.

512
00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:00,230
The Chimera file is the red one.

513
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,370
Open and look at it.

514
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:33,930
Aren't you curious about how far the investigation team has gone?

515
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:09,330
I was going to proceed well all the way to the end.

516
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:13,870
This bomb was originally made to kill that reporter.

517
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:15,520
It would have been nice if you had stayed still.

518
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,460
Why did you keep poking where it hurts? Why did you make the situation worse?

519
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:24,510
Have you changed your goal?

520
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:26,570
What about Seo Hyeon Tae?

521
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,360
What's unique to Chimera?

522
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,510
Was Chimera ever at the scene of the crime?

523
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:36,160
What's the advantage of a chemical crime?

524
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:39,650
The advantage of a chemical crime

525
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,300
is that the criminal doesn't have to be present.

526
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,300
That's what I say.

527
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:50,940
Does that mean the bomb is already installed

528
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:53,230
at Seo Hyeon Tae's home?

529
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,810
I can't say.

530
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,470
Yes, it's me.

531
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,910
Was the culprit arrested?

532
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:29,650
Who is it?

533
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,930
Are you sure?

534
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,430
Make sure there isn't any further problem.

535
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:41,330
Call me as soon as the results come out.

536
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:42,880
Okay.

537
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,660
 Kang Sang Gu was born in 1983. His mother, Jo Nam Sun, and father, Kang Won Seop,

538
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:53,430
 worked at Taesam Chemical in the production line manufacturing TH-5.

539
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:55,590
 Then his father was diagnosed with blood cancer.

540
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:58,750
 His lawsuit dragged on for ten years and in the end, was lost.

541
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:01,450
His father Kang Won Seop died in 2013.

542
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:05,380
His mother Jo Nam Sun has been afflicted with vascular dementia for several years.

543
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:08,390
Kang Sang Gu repeatedly sent threatening emails until 2015.

544
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:12,650
He suddenly stopped and was quiet.

545
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:15,950
Did something happen in 2015?

546
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,010
Well, that ...

547
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:21,020
Spit it out!

548
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:25,650
He started a blog called "Fire, Fire, A Firefighter's Diary."

549
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:57,650
What is in the thermos?  ANFO blasting agent?

550
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,270
What do you think?

551
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:03,410
It's not as though ANFO's detonator is a cell phone.

552
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,030
It doesn't sound like Chimera.

553
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,310
There's no rain or wind.

554
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:10,100
What?

555
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,020
You're not Chimera.

556
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,030
You're a phony, right?

557
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:21,440
From the start to the end, you impersonate others and are not yourself.

558
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,610
You aren't even a real firefighter.

559
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:31,950
Why did you pretend to be a firefighter? Among many occupations.

560
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,470
What are you doing?

561
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,590
I'm a police officer.

562
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:55,980
Please evacuate the residents of Building B in column B.

563
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:58,730
Don't sound the alarm. Do it quietly. Understand?

564
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:00,400
Yes. Yes.

565
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:04,500
Sir, do you smoke?

566
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,070
Pardon?

567
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:11,990
Should I speak honestly?

568
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:18,290
You must have wanted to become a firefighter, but it wasn't possible.

569
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:20,440
That's why you pretend.

570
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:22,610
Right?

571
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:26,620
Why wasn't it possible?

572
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:32,520
It's Seoryun, or speaking precisely, it's because of TH-5.

573
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,180
Isn't that correct?

574
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:37,420
That's why you want to get revenge on Seoryun.

575
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:43,870
Color blindness is usually caused by genetic factors.

576
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:47,010
It's carried by the maternal X chromosome,

577
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:50,770
but congenital color blindness can be caused by a non-inherited factor

578
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:55,530
if there is exposure to certain chemicals. If there is a modification of the maternal chromosome

579
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:58,710
- Shut up. 
 - there will be red-green colorblindness.

580
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:03,110
From the start, there was never any red file on the desk.

581
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:07,710
Do you know?

582
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:13,220
At the scene of the construction site incident, what color was the tape left with the chimera lighter?

583
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,270
I ... I ... why wouldn't I know?

584
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:31,250
Red. Red.  It was definitely red.

585
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:33,340
You can tell by just looking at it.

586
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:36,290
Red is R, green is G, blue is B.

587
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:39,620
You have to mark it like that to distinguish the colors.

588
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:45,030
You couldn't become a firefighter because you were born color blind.

589
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:46,850
Is that indeed it?

590
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:50,670
Painter Charles Merion left great pictures even though he was color blind.

591
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:52,990
Disability is an excuse.

592
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:57,550
You've never even tried to become someone in the first place.

593
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,940
Shit.  What do you know?  What do you know?

594
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:39,060
Yes.  Are you there? It's security.

595
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:46,100
If you do something foolish, you'll go with me. Understand?

596
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:49,780
Yes.  Is something wrong?

597
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:54,730
Yes regarding the condominium association special installation, they are requesting your signature.

598
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:56,020
My signature?

599
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:59,190
Yes.  Didn't you see the notice in the elevator?

600
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:02,910
I did every apartment but this one.

601
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,960
Send him away.

602
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:13,810
I'm a bit busy right now.

603
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:17,790
Yes.  You weren't there both yesterday or the day before.

604
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:25,730
But this, all the residents over there ... it can only happen when we get everyone's consent.

605
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:28,620
Please cooperate, yes?

606
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,090
What should I do?  He's not leaving.

607
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:46,160
I'll say it once more,

608
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,610
do something foolish and we all die. Understand?

609
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:31,500
Oh dear. It's so hard to see you.

610
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:36,430
Here.  You can sign here.

611
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:40,630
I just need to sign my name?

612
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:44,150
On the bottom you say yes or no.

613
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,200
 Bomb

614
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,350
Thank you.

615
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:57,390
Thank you so much.  Yes.

616
01:01:57,390 --> 01:01:59,060
Ah, it's done now.

617
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:01,100
That's all right?

618
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:04,290
It's done, yes.

619
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:11,850
What is this?

620
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:19,400
Bastard.

621
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:54,650
Don't move.

622
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:04,080
If you do anything foolish, we all die, bastard.

623
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:14,580
Do you know you brought this on yourself?

624
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:39,270

625
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:44,560
♫  Some people want to live  ♫

626
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:48,170
♫  But turn their back on me  ♫

627
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:53,860
♫  The time I lived as myself, not me  ♫

628
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,950
♫  Some people say to me  ♫

629
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:59,570
 Chimera

630
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:03,630
  It's not a bomb that you installed in Seo Hyeon Tae's house, is it?

631
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:07,580
 I should have died then, but guess who survived?

632
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:10,100
 Is Yu Seong the whistleblower?

633
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,130
 Isn't that why he hid himself?

634
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:15,830
