1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:06,980

2
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,320
 Chimera

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,180
 The characters, locations, incidents, religious sects, etc. in this drama are fiction and have no relation to reality.

4
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,910
- Yes, yes. 
 - Why didn't you answer the phone?

5
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:50,600
I sent a message to you last night.  Lee Jung Yeop is safe.

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,110
Where is he now?

7
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,980
At my house.

8
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,520
Please be careful.  You may be under surveillance.

9
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,920
Hello?

10
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,440
Reporter Kim?

11
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,500
I have to catch Bus #19, but I'm late.

12
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,620
Oh, where are you going?

13
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,470
To the school.

14
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,900
The— the school?

15
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,040
Hanmyeong University.

16
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:07,090
 Cha Eun Soo is her new name.

17
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,200
 Chimera will disappear forever

18
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,390
 along with the name Ryu Seong Hui.

19
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,290
Lee Jung Yeop?

20
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,860
- What's the matter? 
 No, no.

21
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,780
Chi ...

22
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,570
 Episode 14

23
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,880
Are you... okay?

24
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,420
Are you in a calmer frame of mind?

25
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,130
Where were you going to go?

26
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,170
Is something wrong?

27
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,590
What is this?

28
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,850
Something suddenly came up at home.

29
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,770
I'm sorry.

30
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,080
Your mother?

31
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,980
Yes. I'm sorry.

32
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,580
What's wrong with his mother?

33
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,360
Dementia.

34
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,430
Jae Hwan, let's talk.

35
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,210
Who doesn't have personal issues?

36
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,670
You're not asking.

37
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,660
Whether we caught him or missed him at the terminal yesterday,

38
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,240
aren't you curious?

39
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,850
Does Detective Cha know this fact?

40
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,320
If he knew, he would not have brought me here, right?

41
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,080
I was struggling to find this, and it was so close.

42
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,440
You said Ryu Seong Hui has dementia, right?

43
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,970
It's progressive.

44
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,940
She is continuing to lose her memory

45
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,580
and later she might only have Ryu Seong Hui's memory left.

46
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,550
Then the chimera of 35 years ago will return.

47
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:14,850
Why did she kill the research team members?

48
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,600
I think she was threatened because she was a whistleblower.

49
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,180
I heard there was a fire at her home.

50
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,590
At that time, her child died too.

51
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,470
If the research team members set the fire intentionally to kill her,

52
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,160
and if the child died during that fire.

53
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,320
Let's not rush to speculate.

54
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,800
What are we going to do about Detective Cha?

55
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,690
For now, don't say anything.

56
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,970
I'll... think about it.

57
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,060
How could I not say something?

58
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,670
As long as you're in their home, it's only a matter of time before he knows.

59
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,480
I'll be hang onto these.

60
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,340
Reporter Kim.

61
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,710
You won't reveal it, will you?

62
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,310
Someday the whole world will know.

63
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,460
We need to inform Detective Cha before the world knows.

64
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,850
I need a bit of time.

65
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,520
I don't understand.

66
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,650
Why are you worrying about him right now?

67
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:37,040
Are you in a position to worry about someone else?

68
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,130
Mr. Lee Jung Yeop, why did you come to Korea?

69
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,120
Aren't you here to reveal the truth about your father's death?

70
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,360
Evidence that your father was innocent has appeared right in front of you

71
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,660
but I'm supposed to give you time?

72
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,780
The person you're thinking of and worrying about right now

73
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,690
is the son of real culprit who got your father killed.

74
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,370
Isn't that unjust?

75
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:14,900
Don't you think the pain you've experienced during the years you have lived is unfair?

76
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,900
Don't forget why you came back to Korea after 35 years.

77
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,420
I've been waiting for 35 years

78
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,180
so can't I wait a few more days?

79
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,990
Detective Cha is the only person who has helped me and the only person I trust.

80
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,230
Please just wait a bit longer.

81
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,910
While I'm thinking about what to do with these documents in the future,

82
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,570
Lee Jung Yeop,  just worry about yourself.

83
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,610
And you can't stay here any longer.  I'm going to find a safe house for you.

84
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,630
I'll pick you up as soon as it is arranged, so stay here. Don't even think about going out.

85
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,250
What about your father?

86
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,470
He must be worrying a lot about me.

87
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:20,290
I am very sorry to your family in many ways.

88
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,120
From now on, if you need help you call me.

89
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,310
Not anyone else.

90
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,130
Don't reveal it yet.

91
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,310
I heard something weird yesterday.

92
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,190
What was it?

93
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,800
I heard it from a colleague at the Hwaju station.

94
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,150
- The Hwaju Police Station? 
  -  Yes. Yes. The Hwaju  Police Station.

95
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:06,270
The prosecution investigators said Lee Jung Yeop stole the gun.

96
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:11,840
But, the search party found the gun on the first day of the search.

97
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,960
Lee Jung Yeop removed the bullets from the gun, threw the gun away and left.

98
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,770
- They didn't report that a gun was found. 
 That's what I'm saying.

99
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,180
Then, a report was never made?

100
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:27,950
I really don't know, but they definitely collected the gun and recorded it on-site.

101
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,970
Unbelievably, the gun vanished.

102
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,270
Didn't they just misplace it?

103
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:39,440
Hey, it's not something else.  It's a gun. A gun.  Is that something you just lose?

104
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,560
It would be unique if someone didn't intentionally steal it.

105
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,640
Heyy.  How would outsiders touch it?

106
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,010
Did an insider steal it?

107
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,410
I think our prosecutor in charge is strange.

108
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,980
I mean he was demoted to go around the countryside and he returns.

109
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,150
Why is he suddenly summoned to Seoul?

110
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,520
It's not even the season to exchange greetings.

111
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:14,460
This is from the top.  For sure it is someone there.

112
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,190
What do you mean it was fabricated?

113
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,930
Listen carefully.

114
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:39,120
Someone made up this escape incident to kill Lee Jeong Yeop.

115
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,580
Who would do that?

116
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,830
When you see the prosecutor's office is on the move, I think it is someone on Seoryun's side.

117
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,130
Seoryun?

118
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,910
Does team leader know?  Isn't this something we shouldn't be doing just among ourselves?

119
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:56,130
Don't say anything. Pretend like you don't know anything about it.

120
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,980
Why? Shouldn't you say something to the team leader?

121
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,080
Sunbae ...

122
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,700
Sunbae, there's no way you met with Lee Jung Yeop?

123
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,350
You didn't hide him somewhere, right?

124
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,960
You're really crazy. You're crazy!

125
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,630
If so, you will be thrown in jail.

126
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,840
Damn it, I know.

127
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,800
Isn't there any way to get stuff like contact information?

128
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,900
I definitely think someone instigated this.

129
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,540
You know too.  All the evidence and witnesses were scooped up by the prosecutors.

130
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,420
Just think about it!

131
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,380
The cell phone! The phone is at headquarters.

132
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,150
A phone? What phone?

133
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,220
The one used by the investigators.  The one Lee Jung Yeop stole.

134
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,440
The one that was found on the bus to Gangwan Province?

135
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,790
Yes.  It went to digital forensics.  It's probably with the cyber investigation unit.

136
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,570
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

137
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,890
- Do you have colleagues at headquarters? 
 - I do.

138
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,630
Find out quietly.  Quietly.

139
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,520
Come out after a while.

140
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,970
I'll check and call you back.

141
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,450
I'll be back.

142
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,240
It's the numbers in the phone call history of the investigators.

143
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,000
They were phoning this number a lot recently.

144
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,320
That's the number for the last call.  
  010-219-3663

145
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,060
You want to try it?

146
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,680
Ah, that's a surprise.

147
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,880
 Ho Dong

148
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,710
Ah, really.

149
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:21,240
Ah, really? You've worked hard.

150
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,810
He's coming out, Hyung-nim.

151
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,100
Okay.

152
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,640
But then.

153
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,320
What's that? Fire alarm?

154
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,080
Go check it out.

155
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,470
Hey, long time no see!

156
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,630
Who is this?  I see you all at a place like this?

157
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,430
Hey, damn.

158
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,600
Who are you, bastard?

159
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,650
Really.

160
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,630
Self-defense.  It's self-defense.

161
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,160
Okay, okay, okay!

162
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,050
Self-defense. Its self-defense.

163
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,070
Please don't move.

164
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:57,810
Hey, assault and inflicting bodily injury on a prosecutor's office investigator?

165
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:02,040
I've been beaten up for twenty years

166
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,320
but what you received won't even require a few weeks for recovery. Self-defense, right?

167
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,190
 e-Ticket Itinerary &amp; Receipt

168
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,450
I guess you're going to New Zealand.

169
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,380
With this money.

170
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,990
Hey, you're from Jungsan Station, right?

171
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,320
This is police brutality, do you know?

172
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,170
Why are you speaking to me informally?

173
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,800
How much did he give you?

174
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,850
What did you receive? Overseas real estate,

175
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,980
A study abroad fund.

176
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,460
When you're investigated, it will all come out. These days foreign countries work well with us.

177
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,130
Investigators,

178
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,160
if you're going to be extradited anyway,

179
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,100
why get all tired traveling back?

180
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:03,830
Confess here.  Who planned the escape incident?

181
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,890
What are you talking about?

182
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,370
We are on the way to our vacation.

183
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,850
Vacation! Vacation?

184
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,900
Your tickets are for one way flights?  Are you paddling back on a boat?

185
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,090
We are law-abiding people.

186
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:36,310
Leave while we are talking nicely.

187
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:42,680
Really, I spoke nicely.

188
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,150
I treated you politely.

189
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,360
- Knock knock! 
 - Damn it, why are you here so late?

190
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,790
But there's no chicken place in this neighborhood.

191
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:01,840
If there isn't a chicken place, you should have bought something else. You should have ordered delivery.

192
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,220
Hello.

193
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,110
What are you doing?

194
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:10,100
Let's eat first.  You must be hungry.

195
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,860
I treated you too harshly before, Investigators.

196
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,560
Here!

197
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,970
Sorry, Little brother.  I treated you too roughly.

198
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,160
Cheers! To us!

199
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,980
All right everybody, look this way, one, two, three,

200
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,350
Okay! One more! One, two, three!

201
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,700
Hey, hey!

202
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,830
Let's see it.

203
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,370
- Oh, it came out well. 
 - You bastard.

204
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:49,110
You look good. An image of cooperation with the detectives at investigation headquarters with a clap clap boom.

205
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,410
What kind of bullshit?

206
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,190
Who should I send this to?

207
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,490
Team Leader Mun?  Choi Jong Ho, the prosecutor?

208
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,470
No, I should send it straight to Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae.

209
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,610
Did I tell you?

210
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,670
I'm really close to Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae.  He and I are drinking buddies.

211
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,920
Do you believe he will believe what you say from just one picture?

212
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,230
Hey, man, shut up!

213
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,680
Crazy bastard!

214
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,000
That's right.

215
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,220
Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae.

216
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,990
He orchestrated this, didn't he?

217
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,280
Thank you for the drink!

218
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,680
What's up?  You haven't contacted me for a while and then this call.

219
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,300
Are you getting married?

220
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,560
What do you mean married? You've been well?

221
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,850
Yeah, well.

222
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,470
Seriously, what's the matter?

223
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,850
I want to throw a hot item your way.

224
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:17,070
What is this? Why is the news reporter of a major network broadcaster dealing with an internet broadcaster?

225
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,840
I've been blocked by the network.

226
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,100
Something dirty or something dangerous.

227
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,320
Scary.

228
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,040
Something dirty would be better.

229
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,940
Do you want me to give you a million views?

230
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,510
An exclusive interview with a fugitive.

231
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,380
The former doctor who is currently in the news who escaped?

232
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,180
The chimera suspect?

233
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:52,520
He's not the real culprit.  And it wasn't a simple escape.

234
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,660
Tell me the key point and skip the complicated history.

235
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,390
What happened before is fascinating.

236
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,680
How fascinating is it?

237
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,350
Seoryun.

238
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,440
Seoryun.

239
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,780
 It's been three days

240
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,080
Yes, I know where it is.

241
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,230
 since an armed suspect for murder escaped.

242
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,710
Then, I owe you a favor, Reporter Kim.

243
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,370
 The police are struggling with the investigation.

244
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,720
Then I'll see you there.

245
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,570
 It appears the fugitive is already out of the area being searched.

246
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,500
Okay.

247
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,370
 The predominant expert opinion is that the police will find it difficult to avoid responsibility

248
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:36,120
 for the increasing public anxiety.

249
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,820
Excuse me.

250
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,360
Why are you following me?

251
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,040
You over there, you're following me, aren't you?

252
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,260
Why are you following me?

253
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,850
Why have you been following me since the middle of the day?

254
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:26,090
In the present circumstances, could women walk anywhere on the street?

255
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:37,670
Mister. Should I call the police?

256
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,460
Should I call the police?

257
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,870
Stop!

258
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,880
Stop there!

259
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,180
Yes, Reporter Kim.

260
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,840
What?

261
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,530
Where are you?

262
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,380
Grab him!

263
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,730
Get him there!

264
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,980
Yes, yes. Okay.

265
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,920
Yes, I'm near the JM building. Where are you?

266
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,610
Where is he?

267
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:00,420
I can't find him.  He disappeared after being chased around here.

268
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,110
Are you insane? Why did you have him leave the house?

269
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,930
Let's save someone first before the scolding!

270
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:10,910
They were like professionals.

271
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,450
Hey, come here.

272
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,260
Hey!

273
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,130
I think they went over there.

274
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,230
Wait.  Go to the building security office and ask for help.

275
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:17,310
I'll stall for time.  Hurry.

276
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,380
Grab him.

277
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,850
What are you doing?

278
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,480
What are you doing?

279
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,610
I am a police officer.   Step back.

280
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,200
Go! Damnit.

281
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,070
Drop everything you're holding in your hands.

282
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:17,940
Under Criminal Act 258 Aggravated Bodily Injury

283
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,600
do you know it is ten years in prison for each of you for holding that?

284
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:28,580
Detective, let's just go our separate ways. You don't want something bad happening to you.

285
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,580
You're not listening, are you?  Okay.

286
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,370
There will be an additional charge under Criminial Act Article 136 for Obstruction of Official Duty.

287
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:40,380
There are twenty people downstairs who are coming up right now.

288
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,310
You're all going to die.

289
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:51,370
I'm counting to ten.  Before I reach ten, drop everything and kneel down.

290
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,620
One.

291
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,610
Two.

292
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,520
Three!

293
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,890
- Four... 
 - Hey!

294
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:31,430
The alarm definitely went off there.

295
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,670
Where are they?

296
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,260
Isn't it a different building?

297
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,490
There's a big parking building next door.

298
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:40,820
No.  It rang continuously in the parking lot for this building.

299
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,370
Wait!

300
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:50,380
Oh! What is that?

301
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,550
 Safety Zone Police Siren

302
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,620
Where's the intercom system mic?

303
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:03,340
- I'm sorry? 
 - The speaker! Where's the speaker?

304
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,430
It's the police riot squad

305
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,440
Retreat!  Retreat!

306
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,520
What? What are you doing?

307
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,460
Are you okay?

308
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,680
I told you to stay home?  Why did you leave?

309
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,990
Were you seriously hurt?

310
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,980
Wait.

311
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,590
Why?

312
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,820
What's wrong?

313
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,650
Don't come near me!

314
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,630
Lee Jung Yeop?

315
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,940
 Air Conditioning and Heating

316
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,630
Cha Jae Hwan...

317
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,160
 Cerberus, from Greek mythology, is a dog with three heads of monsters.

318
00:36:55,690 --> 00:37:00,850
 Cerberus never sleeps and guards the door to Hell.

319
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:15,120
 All of his family members were hideous and violent monsters.

320
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,310
 Both his father and mother,

321
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:21,510
 and his three siblings.

322
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:26,010
 Although his family brutally killed people and committed evil,

323
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:33,270
 they say only Cerberus did not murder.

324
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,860
 Why was that?

325
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,270
 After being born a hideous and cruel monster,

326
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:43,650
 he must have frightened people and been hated by them.

327
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,110
 Why didn't he live as a monster after he was born?

328
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,560
Why is he still alive?

329
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,080
You said you were confident.

330
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,260
but are you confident?

331
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:08,170
What will happen if he saw your face, you asshole!

332
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,870
You're sorry?

333
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,750
Will this be resolved with your apology?

334
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,420
You must accept the blame.

335
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:31,750
What is it? Why did you call me all the way here?

336
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:36,360
It isn't something I could tell you at home.

337
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,390
What is it?

338
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,050
Lee Jung Yeop was shot.

339
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,100
Did you know that?

340
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,130
What happened?

341
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,070
It's not me.

342
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,270
Then, is it my husband?

343
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,850
Is that right?

344
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,930
But why he is going overboard?

345
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:13,450
Even if TH-5 crashes and burns, the group needs to respond.  By shooting him?

346
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:17,360
Hey! Be quiet.

347
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,520
Someone will hear you.

348
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:24,630
He's out of his mind right now.

349
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,960
He's in a state of panic.

350
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,560
What the heck is it?

351
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,310
What is Seo Hyeon Tae really afraid of?

352
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,290
Damned if I know.

353
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:44,460
I think I know the problem.  The chimera.

354
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,570
What?

355
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,710
The chimera design which is always left at the scene of the murder.

356
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:59,160
On his shoulder there is a chimera tattoo.

357
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,330
At first, I thought it was a coincidence, so I just ignored it.

358
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,300
Hey, not many know about Hyeon Tae's tattoo.

359
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,990
The woman he dated a long time ago.

360
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:17,450
What was her name?

361
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:20,240
She was dowdy.

362
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,890
Who?

363
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,040
Ryu Seong Hui?

364
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,310
You know about her?

365
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:32,570
Dad did a background check on her, not me.

366
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:35,460
I heard he dated her briefly before we got married.

367
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:39,560
Don't worry. She died.

368
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,280
When?

369
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,770
35 years ago.

370
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:50,230
35 years ago?

371
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:53,280
1984?

372
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,730
Where were you?

373
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:18,120
Oh, well, I left because a tip came in but it was nothing.

374
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:22,950
If you're going somewhere report to me!

375
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,000
How dare all of you do whatever you please.

376
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:32,240
Get it together.

377
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,160
You punks are slacking off.

378
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,650
I'm sorry.

379
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,680
Hey. You went off somewhere to have a drink again didn't you?

380
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,380
No, do I look like an alcoholic to you? Am I always drinking?

381
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:02,490
Did you hear the news?

382
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:06,180
Lee Jung Yeop got shot.

383
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,230
Oh ... really?

384
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:11,940
But the shooter is still at large.

385
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:17,550
Hey. Say you shot him and get a special promotion.

386
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:23,110
Special promotion, no way. It'll be a relief if you aren't disciplined for using a gun.

387
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,950
Then is the case closed?

388
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:29,610
Closed? He's not even dead.

389
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,620
He's not dead?

390
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:49,780
Yes, this is Jang Ha Na from the Jungsan Police Station investigation unit.

391
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,600
Yes.

392
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:55,580
What?

393
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,370
Um, Team Leader. That was a call from the Songlim Patrol Unit.

394
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:11,560
It was Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae who fabricated the escape.

395
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:17,490
If he's trying to kill Lee Jung Yeop, then it won't be safe here either.

396
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:22,580
It's not safe for him either.

397
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:28,890
It's been three days since Chimera sent the glitter bomb warning.

398
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:31,990
It definitely is time for him to make a move.

399
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:37,800
Then their goal is ... Chief Bae.

400
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:41,560
We can't even put surveillance on him for 24 hours.

401
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:52,970
But where did Reporter Kim go?

402
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:57,120
I sent her home to rest because it was really hard on her.

403
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:05,230
 Detective Lee Geon Yeong

404
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,030
It's Detective Lee.

405
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,310
Yes, Geon Yeong.

406
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:21,780
Investigator, it's just that there's someone who claims to be Chimera.

407
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:30,370
I think that ... you should probably come in and see for yourself.

408
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:32,080
I will be right there with Detective Cha.

409
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,880
Wait! Don't tell Detective Cha.

410
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,140
Just come alone.

411
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,650
Ma'am, please let me know if I can get you anything.

412
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:26,010
Please give me some cold water.

413
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:33,450
She came in herself and said she was Chimera.

414
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,350
But that's Detective Cha's mother.

415
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,910
Yes.

416
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:48,600
I looked up her medical records and found out she's been diagnosed with dementia.

417
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:06,210
But her statement was too detailed to be disregarded from a dementia patient.

418
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:08,990
There is evidence as well.

419
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:11,150
What evidence?

420
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:14,560
She was in possession of something odd.

421
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,600
Iron oxide and aluminum powder.

422
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,040
Thermite.

423
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,180
How dangerous is this?

424
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:29,450
When iron oxide and aluminum meet to produce Thermite, a high temperature reaction of 3000 degrees or higher occurs.

425
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:34,370
If the thermite reaction is in a paper cup, it can melt a metal bowl.

426
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:40,180
Then, if you possess both, doesn't it mean you have an intentional motive?

427
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:46,830
Hello, Ma'am.

428
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,420
Do you remember me?

429
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,950
I saw you at your home yesterday.

430
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,940
I'll introduce myself again.

431
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:04,270
I'm a profiler for the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, Eugene Hathaway.

432
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:12,580
Is a profiler different from a detective?

433
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:19,780
To explain briefly, a profiler analyzes the behavior of criminals.

434
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:26,420
Please talk to me comfortably.

435
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:40,420
Would you like some more water?

436
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:46,770
Can you help me?

437
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:00,950
It is really okay not to contact Seonbae Cha?

438
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:04,280
It's not a big deal.  She is a patient.

439
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,470
There's no way she is the real chimera.

440
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:13,280
No matter how bad her dementia is, why, of all things, has she turned herself in as the chimera?

441
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:19,190
Right now Seonbae is obsessed with the chimera. Couldn't it be something she overheard in passing?

442
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:23,890
Everything she said is so logical that it seems it's not made up nor something she overheard.

443
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:26,750
That's why the patrol division turned her over to us.

444
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:30,660
Let's wait and see for now.

445
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,390
How can I help you?

446
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:45,100
When you feel comfortable, take your time speaking.

447
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,940
There's no time for that.

448
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,250
Pardon?

449
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:53,700
Because I am disappearing.

450
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:57,280
What do you mean by disappearing?

451
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,600
They said my memory ...

452
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:06,600
is disappearing.

453
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:15,500
Yes, you're suffering from dementia.

454
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,740
If you need a doctor, should I call one?

455
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:21,200
No, it must be the police.

456
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:25,900
When you feel threatened like this,

457
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,940
are there times you feel uneasy and hallucinate?

458
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:35,900
There is going to be a murder.

459
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,290
You must prevent it.

460
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:48,940
Are you saying someone is going to be killed?

461
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,210
Yes.

462
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:00,080
Who is?

463
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,210
Seo Hyeon Tae.

464
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:08,870
Seo Hyeon Tae?

465
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:12,390
I'm talking about Seoryun Group's Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae.

466
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:17,170
Whom are you saying will hurt him?

467
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,230
Chimera.

468
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,560
Detective Jang, record it.

469
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,080
Yes, sir.

470
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:50,250
Did you just say "Chimera"?

471
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:54,130
I am talking about the culprit,

472
00:50:54,200 --> 00:51:02,500
who burned to death  Oh Jong Geun, Im Sang Wuk and Park In Sang in 1984.

473
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:06,720
I mean that chimera.

474
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:12,390
Does that mean you know who the chimera is?

475
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,710
Who is it?

476
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,300
Ryu Seong Hui.

477
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:32,730
Ryu Seong–?

478
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:38,530
Is it the Ryu Seong Hui who was on the same research team as the victims?

479
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:50,490
Ma'am.

480
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:53,690
She is already dead.

481
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:58,470
No. That woman did not die.

482
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:00,860
She's lived in hiding.

483
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,640
For 35 years.

484
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:08,240
Are you saying Ryu Seong Hui is alive?

485
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,370
Then you probably know where she is.

486
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,690
She is here.

487
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,010
Now.

488
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,270
In this room.

489
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:38,790
Did you just say you, yourself, are Ryu Seong Hui?

490
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:48,830
On August 31, 1984, Ryu Seong Hui committed suicide.

491
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:53,810
However, I miraculously survived.

492
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:57,300
I lost my memory

493
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:02,150
and have lived like that in hiding for 35 years.

494
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:07,780
That woman inside of me is going to wake up now.

495
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:11,580
When I, Cha Eun Su, lose my memory,

496
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,560
then

497
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:20,760
Ryu Seong Hui will return.

498
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,050
You're saying when Ryu Seong Hui returns, she is going to commit a murder.

499
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:36,150
Why do you think that?

500
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:40,030
Because 35 years ago

501
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:43,380
I failed.

502
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,540
Finally, I will finish it.

503
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:52,740
Getting revenge.

504
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,380
 Chief, this is Cha Jae Hwan.

505
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,960
 The surgery was successful and Lee Jung Yeop just regained consciousness.

506
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:22,620
 But Lee Jung Yeop says he has something to tell you in person.

507
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:26,110
 I think you need to come over here.

508
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:33,740
 The call cannot be answered right now.

509
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:39,030
 I'm sorry, I can't talk on the phone right now.

510
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,010
It's me.

511
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:56,350
Don't wait for me today and go home. I will drive home on my own.

512
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:57,930
All right.

513
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:59,880
Goodbye.

514
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,130
Cha Jae Hwan.

515
00:55:57,710 --> 00:56:00,130
Chief, what brings you here?

516
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:03,130
I heard Lee Jung Yeop gained consciousness.

517
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,940
What?

518
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:15,390
I never sent this text message.

519
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:17,830
This isn't even my number.

520
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,590
I will look into who sent this.

521
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:30,220
You should go home and get some rest.

522
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:37,540
Because of the fake bomb incident, your home and office are being thoroughly guarded.

523
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,870
You will be safe.

524
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:45,190
There are all sorts of weird people now.

525
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:53,390
Chief.

526
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:02,660
Is there anything else you wanted to tell me?

527
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,590
About what?

528
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:08,490
You know something.

529
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:18,060
Cha Jae Hwan, do you think I'm a joke too?

530
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,630
Excuse me?

531
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:22,800
Do I look like a joke to you?

532
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:32,960
Yeah, I probably do.

533
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:40,280
Jae Hwan, do you who the bravest person in the world is?

534
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:45,320
Someone who can deal with a dozen thugs with knives?

535
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:48,260
It's not.

536
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:55,600
It's someone who can go to the victim and say

537
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,300
"I'm sorry, it's my fault."

538
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:04,140
Why is that so hard?

539
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:11,560
Live your life upright.

540
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:16,280
Don't throw away your pride to have more than others.

541
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:23,200
This right here. Got it?

542
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:20,600
What a mess tonight.

543
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:39,720
 Mom, I can't go home tonight.

544
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,320
 Don't wait for me.

545
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:46,530
 Don't skip dinner. Make sure you eat.

546
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:51,320
 Make sure you check the gas before sleeping–

547
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:57,020
 Make sure you check the gas before sleeping–

548
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,580
 Chief, it's Cha Jae Hwan.

549
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:07,550
 But Lee Jung Yeop says he has something to tell you in person.

550
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:15,740
 It's been three days since Chimera sent the glitter bomb warning.

551
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:18,780
 It definitely is time for him to make a move.

552
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:54,390
 Section 4

553
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:03,170
Chief.

554
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,200
Get out!

555
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:04,680
 In mythology, the three siblings of Cerberus were born in the form of monsters.

556
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:08,790
 They had a violent temper and brutally killed people.

557
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,800
 One of the Cerberus siblings was a woman.

558
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,920
 She had a lion's face, a goat's body,

559
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:41,240
 a snake's tail, and killed people by spewing fire from her mouth.

560
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:06,110
 Her name is Chimera.

561
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:16,390

562
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:22,180
♫  Some people want to live  ♫

563
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:25,650
♫  But turn their back on me  ♫

564
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:31,590
♫  The time I lived as myself, not me  ♫

565
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:34,320
♫  Some people say to me  ♫

566
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,640
 Chimera

567
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,320
 Has anyone been as close as I am to finding him?

568
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:43,720
 Look in the mirror, see the look in your eyes right now.

569
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:46,830
 I have something to protect.

570
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:50,140
 What were you going to say before you got shot?

571
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:55,650
 But what if all of this is a fact that we have to accept? To live with?

572
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:58,550
 After Seung Gwan is me.

573
01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:01,520
 Who is Kim Hyo Gyeong? Who is she?

574
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:06,550
 Do you want me to kill the one person you love?
