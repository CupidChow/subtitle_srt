1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,990

2
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,230
 Chimera

3
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,200
 The characters, locations, incidents, religious sects, etc. in this drama are fiction and have no relation to reality.

4
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:34,760
 Episode 15

5
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,150
If you were truly the Chimera 35 years ago,

6
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,070
tell us facts that only the perpetrator would know.

7
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,980
Could you give me a pen and paper?

8
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:49,030

9
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,680
These are in the sequence of Chimera's crimes.

10
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,960
Explain one more thing.

11
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,210
The first crime method used was oxygen.

12
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,500
Why did it change?

13
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,930
Because it was too powerful.

14
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,280
It's not fair to just die

15
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,000
without knowing that you are dying.

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,100
My baby was tortured by toxic gas and the heat.

17
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,190
She died in agony.

18
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,310
Does that mean you had a child other than Detective Cha?

19
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,080
Did that child die in a fire?

20
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,500
If so, was it arson that was the cause of the fire at your home?

21
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,860
Who set the fire?

22
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,490
Oh Jong Geun.

23
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,440
Im Sang Wuk.

24
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,450
Park In Sang.

25
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,500
Why them?  They were your colleagues.

26
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,970
Correct. We were colleagues.

27
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,700
Those people ...

28
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,830
should not have done what they did to innocent people.

29
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,920
If you're human,

30
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,290
you should not  have done that.

31
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,910
They begged me to spare them when they were about to die.

32
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:38,830
Why should I believe them saying that the fire was a mistake?

33
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:46,360
Those beings deserved to die.

34
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,050
So did you kill them yourself?

35
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,500
Why didn't you go to the police?

36
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,940
Trust the police?

37
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,650
The police never told me the truth about anything.

38
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,840
Did you regret that decision?

39
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,680
Regret?

40
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,880
Not at all.

41
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:21,060
As for me, I got peace.

42
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:37,220
Then why is Cha Eun Su trying to stop Ryu Seong Hui?

43
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:42,160
The last revenge must be completed in order to get complete peace.

44
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,160
For me

45
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,030
there is something that I must protect.

46
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,650
I can't hurt

47
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,730
my innocent child.

48
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,850
So prevent it.

49
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,450
She's not finished yet. The Chimera will never quit.

50
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,190
What can't you quit?

51
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,480
The remaining

52
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,750
last target.

53
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,340
The one who instigated the arson,

54
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,690
after he cowardly hid behind Professor Park In Seong,

55
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,550
he alone survived.

56
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,750
Seo Hyeon Tae.

57
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,950
 I can't hurt

58
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,500
 my innocent child.

59
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,610
 So prevent it.

60
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,370
 She's not finished yet. The Chimera will never quit.

61
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,160
What do you think?

62
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,600
Although it's hard to absorb by common sense, the connection is clear.

63
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,790
Then the suspect who died 35 years agoâ€”

64
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,930
was falsely accused? Wow.

65
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,790
Hey, this is going to have a huge impact

66
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,030
if it turns out that Chimera is a police officer's family member.

67
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,600
Is that important right now?

68
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,780
What about Sunbae Cha? This is seriously crazy.

69
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,370
Doesn't he already know?

70
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,620
Ayy.  No way.

71
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,420
But they live in the same house so it would be strange not to know.

72
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,670
What do you mean by that bullshit?  It defies logic!

73
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:04,130
Why are you saying it can't be?  It's common sense, isn't it?

74
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,690
- What? 
 - Don't go overboard.

75
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,090
Yes.

76
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,810
The Chimera is back 
 (Muni Channel
 Valkyrie)

77
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,930
Yesterday, there was an explosion at a hospital in downtown Seoul.

78
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,780
The victim is an incumbent police chief.

79
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,150
 A chimera lighter was at the scene.

80
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,220
Has the serial killer, the Chimera, started to move again?

81
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:43,060
Today, Reporter Kim Hyo Gyeong who's been covering the chimera case for a long time is with us.

82
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,590
Hello.

83
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,710
Yes, hello.  I am Kim Hyo Gyeong.

84
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:54,380
At the scene where Chief Bae Seung Gwan died, a chimera lighter was also found.

85
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,790
We brought the body to our morgue.

86
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,670
Tell the bereaved family that we will prepare the funeral.

87
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,280
Yes, sir.

88
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,280
What about Lee Jung Yeop?

89
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,120
The surgery ended well but he isn't conscious yet.  He's in the recovery room.

90
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,570
 Urgent. Please check.  Kim Hyo Gyeong is talking about the Chimera Case on the Valkyrie internet broadcast.

91
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:35,380
Chairman. Reporter Kim Hyo Gyeong is on a live streaming broadcast.

92
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,570
- I think you should check it out. 
 - Who?

93
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,200
She is the daughter of Kim Hyeong Guk, the lawyer in the Chimera Case.

94
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,130
Do you know that "Mr. A," a suspect in the Chimera Case, escaped while being escorted to the Prosecutor's office?

95
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:55,070
If he was the one who escaped, I heard he was shot while trying to flee.

96
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,490
The problem is that Mr. A was a prime suspect in the Chimera Case

97
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,490
but he has an alibi when the explosion occurred yesterday.

98
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,220
Then, has the real culprit again become unidentified?

99
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,750
If that is so, who shot Mr. A?

100
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,380
That's not the only suspicious point.

101
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,710
There's the issue of the prosecution intervening and falsely accusing Mr. A, driving him into a criminal act.

102
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,720
The prosecution?

103
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,930
The prosecution tried to cover up whatever happened.

104
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,250
There is suspicion the prosecution tried to kill Mr. A in the process.

105
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,040
Wow.  What exactly does the prosecution want to hide?

106
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,960
Mr. B, the suspect in the 1984 chimera case died

107
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,470
while under investigation.

108
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,150
If you are talking about the suspect from back then, didn't he commit suicide?

109
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:47,340
But the cause of death was not suicide. They say it could have been torture and murder.

110
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:52,060
The prosecuting attorney in charge of the investigation then was Lee Min Gi.

111
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,340
Oh, if it is Lee Min Gi, he is the chairman of the National Assembly's Legislation and Judiciary Committee.

112
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,420
If what you said is true, it could have a huge impact.

113
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,280
In the second episode, as a Valkyrie exclusive,

114
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,420
we intend to reveal that the Chimera Case of 35 years ago

115
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,630
is connected to a leading chaebol. ( TN: Owner of industrial conglomerate )

116
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,770
 Yes.  I'm really looking forward to that.

117
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,670
 We'll be back with more shocking facts.

118
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,770
 Everyone, please press like and subscribe.

119
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,530
 This is Valkyrie.

120
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,090
 Thank you.

121
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,210
Chimera.

122
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:44,500
The detonator was made to work with a sound, to react to the sound of the engine with an explosion.

123
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,970
What are the ingredients of the explosive?

124
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,920
It's black powder.

125
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,630
- Are you talking about the gunpowder used in firearms? 
 - Yes.

126
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,720
Yes.  I think it was attached to the bottom of the body.

127
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,560
As you can see, this is a magnet.

128
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,130
This was attached to the bomb with tape.

129
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,940
It didn't require much time, did it?

130
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,950
Right. Some time was required before it filled with oxygen.

131
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,290
He could just stick this on and leave.

132
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,040
He probably did not have much time to linger on the scene.

133
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,300
He didn't have much time to linger. Briefly.

134
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,230
It was brief.

135
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,920
 Investigator Eugene

136
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,930
The results of the analysis of the fired bullet casing came out.

137
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,980
It was collected at the site of Lee Jung Yeop's shooting.

138
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,340
 National Forensic Agency

139
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,510
- It was collected at the scene? 
 - Yes.

140
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,220
But this wasn't the 38 caliber used by the police.

141
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,100
It's a 9 mm.

142
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,330
Geon Yeong!

143
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,700
The analysis of the shell casing came out and it was 9 mm.

144
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,900
I think it's from the black market.

145
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,090
Can you investigate it?

146
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,120
Um, Sunbae...

147
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,880
Investigator.

148
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,810
Black powder was used in the bomb that exploded yesterday at the scene.

149
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,420
The black powder is...

150
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,050
Sunbae!

151
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,620
I'll tell him.

152
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,940
What is it?

153
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,940
Tell me what?

154
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,960
What???

155
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,770
 They begged me to spare them when they were about to die.

156
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,900
 Why should I believe them saying that the fire was a mistake?.

157
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:43,840
 Those beings deserved to die.

158
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,650
 So did you kill them yourself?

159
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,770
 Why didn't you go to the police then?

160
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,140
  Trust the police?

161
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,960
  The police never revealed anything even if it were true to me.

162
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,580
We still don't have any reason to be sure right now.

163
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,920
Now that it's confirmed you can...

164
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,270
Where is she?

165
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,220
Stop messing around. Geon Yeong, where's my mom?

166
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,560
Detective Cha, let's talk for a moment.

167
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,950
Yes, give me a moment.

168
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,730
Hey, Lee Geon Yeong.

169
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,800
Since the investigator doesn't know all of the details, you should have explained everything to her.

170
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,460
Mom is a patient.

171
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,640
She's not all there now.

172
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,970
And it doesn't always make sense.

173
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:50,600
Investigator, how can you interrogate someone with dementia?

174
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,890
My mom is driving me nuts.

175
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,010
I'm sorry, too.

176
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,710
I've been obsessing over chimera and made the investigation confusing.

177
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,390
My mom...

178
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:06,080
Hey, Lee Geon Yeong! Where is my mom?!

179
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,020
Aren't you going to tell me?

180
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,620
Huh?

181
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,270
Cha Jae Hwan.

182
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,630
You're on probation.

183
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,570
We reached out to a trustworthy facility.

184
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,900
Who's decision was this?

185
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,930
Without permission from the guardian.

186
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,310
Who the hell are you to make decisions for my mom?

187
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,210
That's what she wanted.

188
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,230
Don't bullshit me.

189
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,350
Bring her out right now.

190
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,630
Bring her out so I can see her right now!

191
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,960
Are you all crazy?

192
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,890
Am I crazy, too?

193
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,850
Why are you acting this? Han Cheol?

194
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,610
Pil Seong?

195
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,920
You all know! Investigator, please tell them.

196
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,530
My mom sold kim bap at at the Nae Hyoo Market for over 30 years.

197
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,760
Everyone at the market knows her!

198
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,960
What kind of personâ€”?

199
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,440
This doesn't make any sense!

200
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:43,430
It really doesn't.

201
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,860
You would know best, right?

202
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:54,480
Think about it. Does it make sense or not?

203
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,120
I don't need to.

204
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,250
I don't need to.

205
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,830
I'm going to get my mom. Where is she?

206
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,000
Where is she?

207
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,010
You can't tell me?

208
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,030
I get it. Well, I'll just find out myself, then.

209
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,570
- Take him 
 - Yes, sir

210
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,770
You've waited a while, haven't you?

211
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:09,310
The patient has declined all visits.

212
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,550
Declined?

213
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,950
She doesn't want to see anyone.

214
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,030
I'm her son.

215
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,260
Did you tell her I was her son?

216
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,840
I told her.

217
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,320
For today, please just leave your number.

218
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,780
Forcing the patient to meet is not good for her either.

219
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,770
Thank you.

220
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,750
The analysis showed there was black powder in the explosive.

221
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,190
A combination of potassium nitrate and sulfur charcoal.

222
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,480
Isn't potassium nitrate found in fertilizers?

223
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,750
Yes, it is found in labs often but due to concerns of minors purchasing it.

224
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,320
They've stopped selling it.

225
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,190
Minors?

226
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:10,610
These days you can find out how to make explosives on the internet.

227
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,740
Wow, kids these days are scary.

228
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,860
This is listed as a dangerous substance and the purchases are recorded.

229
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:33,130
I've pulled a list of recent purchases from agricultural vendors.

230
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,440
What is this? They're all over the country.

231
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,760
How are we going to look into all of these?

232
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,720
First, let's look into Seoul and the Gyeongi area.

233
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,380
Let's check uncommon places or newer places.

234
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,880
What about the security cameras in the area?

235
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,860
They somehow chose paths with no cameras and we can't see their face.

236
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,310
We can see they're over 5'7" and slender build.

237
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,680
Based on their gait and agility.

238
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,580
They appear to be in their late 20s to early 30s.

239
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,900
For now, let's narrow it down a bit.

240
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,400
If we can narrow down a suspect, we can do a formal gait analysis.

241
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:26,610
Jae Hwan, let's talk for a second.

242
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,280
How do you feel about taking a break?

243
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,550
What?

244
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,020
I'll work on the investigation.

245
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,270
You can work from the office and get off work on time.

246
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,520
Are you asking me to lay off this case?

247
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,030
I know you've been working hard.

248
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,580
You're also more dedicated than anyone else.

249
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,050
But, why me?

250
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,840
During such a sensitive time, I can't deal with all of the gossip too.

251
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,910
You believe what you heard from a demented patient?

252
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,050
Are you going to be a burden on your colleagues as well?

253
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,410
Burden?

254
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:31,230
Am I a burden to the team?

255
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:38,390
We will catch the Chimera no matter what. We're going to catch them.

256
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,130
So you should... just go.

257
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,480
Team Leader.

258
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,340
You won't regret this?

259
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:55,790
Has anyone else gotten as close to that guy as I have?

260
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,260
No. Not at all.

261
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:03,240
I watched Han Ju Seok and Bae Seung Gwan die right before my eyes.

262
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,590
1 Minute?

263
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,030
No. Even if I was 30 seconds faster.

264
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,360
That bastard pretended to be me.

265
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,400
That bastard knows exactly what's going on.

266
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,800
He was in such a rush, he didn't have time to hide in the parking lot.

267
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,210
We're almost there. Almost done.

268
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,980
All of it.

269
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,960
Do you know why gamblers can't quit?

270
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,880
The lows. They believe they just need to get pass it.

271
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,550
But what do you think happens when you get obsessed?

272
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,960
They're crazy. That person.

273
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:53,260
Hey man. Take a look in the mirror.

274
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,180
See the look in your eyes right now.

275
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:25,320
 Jungsan Police Station

276
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,250
Can I come in for a second?

277
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,110
Yes, of course.

278
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,350
How long have you been here?

279
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,660
Well, just...

280
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,860
Do you want to get some air?

281
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:04,990
That guy sent a text message to the chief and pretended to be me.

282
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:10,900
He didn't have enough time to kill the Chief so he even called  him to the hospital, completely avoiding the security at the station.

283
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:15,450
Do we know of anyone who knew that Lee Jung Yeop was going to be in surgery?

284
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:18,570
It's me, Reporter Kim,

285
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:22,820
and when he went into the operating room, I contacted you and Team Leader Go

286
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,970
and Team  Leader Go shared the information with Team 1.

287
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,310
If he pretended to be you,

288
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:36,220
it means he knows that you were protecting Lee Jung Yeop.

289
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:40,120
We are close to the culprit.

290
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,940
Close.

291
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,180
Eugene.

292
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:59,650
What do you think about what my mom said?

293
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,480
She rambled as she described the events,

294
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,860
but she stated facts that only could be seen from the culprit's perspective.

295
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,490
Detective Cha.

296
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,250
I'm sorry.

297
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:41,050
This time it's neither interesting nor curious.

298
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:45,340
I now think this is the way for the sake of your mother and you.

299
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,830
Today I visited Hanmyeong University.

300
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,830
I obtained a picture of Ryu Seong Hui.

301
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:58,160
Do you want to check it out?

302
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,860
I've seen this picture, too.

303
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,340
But this isn't it. It's not.

304
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,910
It can't be my mother.

305
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:31,280
Rye Seong Hui's death was recorded in March, 1984.

306
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:35,300
Your mother got a new resident registration number in November, 1984.

307
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:40,600
When a resident registration was missing,  you registered and got a new number during a reporting period.

308
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,360
That happened from time to time.

309
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,990
In order to do that, you had to pass a police identification confirmation.

310
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:50,420
How did she pass?

311
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,470
Her fingerprints are probably the same as Ryu Seong Hui.

312
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:02,110
By any chance, did Han Ju Seek help her?

313
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,640
He remembered your mother's case from 35 years ago, didn't he?

314
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,660
Even if your mother didn't know, wouldn't Han Ju Seok know everything?

315
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,250
About a person named Ryu Seong Hui.

316
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,610
And obviously,

317
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:24,970
I think he was trying to protect Cha Eun Su.

318
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,840
I don't want to believe that.

319
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,090
I can't believe it.

320
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:42,500
But what if all of this is a truth which we have to accept?

321
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,290
If we must cope with it?

322
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,000
 What was the Chimera case?

323
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,980
- What? 
 - Chimera.

324
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,720
 It was a serial murder case that occurred in 1984 in Macheon, Gyeonggi Province.

325
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,980
 Eun Su. That's how I feel.

326
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,670
 How about living in a place like that?

327
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,980
 Even if it is for just one day before I die.

328
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,360
 Schuber Der Winterreise

329
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:28,610
 - Is that a lighter? 
 - You startled me!

330
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:38,170
If that were true,

331
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:41,100
Team Leader Han knew everything.

332
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,920
Even that Lee Sang Wu wasn't the real culprit,

333
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,010
and

334
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:55,330
if this is the truth,  both Team Leader Han and my mom

335
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,910
are not the people I knew.

336
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,820
What should I do?

337
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,620
Whom can I trust now?

338
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,870
She doesn't eat much and she doesn't recognize people.

339
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,780
Please go see her.

340
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:03,220
Even so, even if it's for a short time, she might recognize family.

341
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,350
Thank you.

342
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,360
 Cha Eun Su

343
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,450
Madam Cha!

344
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,950
Mom?

345
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,570
Mom!

346
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,810
I brought your underwear and a top.

347
00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:00,080
You're always catching cold.

348
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,070
You came here so you wouldn't be a burden to me, right?

349
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,590
Don't you know I know how you think?

350
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:23,340
After this case is finished, I'm going to take a long vacation.

351
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,830
Let's go on a trip together.

352
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:30,660
And I'll do everything.

353
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,310
I can do everything.

354
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,430
Many families don't employ caregivers.

355
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:41,140
I'm sure I can do everything.

356
00:32:55,420 --> 00:33:01,540
What about your meals?  I heard you don't eat a lot.

357
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:06,080
Don't you like the taste? Do you want me to buy you something?

358
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:14,270
Do you want me to buy sushi?  You like sushi.

359
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,190
I can't eat properly either.

360
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,860
Why are you doing that?  Why aren't you wearing any socks?

361
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,270
Look how cold your feet are!

362
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,700
I'm okay.

363
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:12,510
Mom... Do you recognize me?

364
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:21,430
If I knew you were coming, I would have gotten ready.

365
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,400
Why are you here?

366
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:35,610
You thought I knew nothing until the end?

367
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:39,950
That I wouldn't know what you did to me?

368
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,450
Mom. It's me.

369
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:45,770
Your son, right? Cha Jae Hwan.

370
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,510
Professor Park told everything.

371
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:54,570
It's you, right.  You instigated it.

372
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,590
isn't that right?

373
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,790
Mom.

374
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,570
You're not human!

375
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,990
- I can't forgive you. 
 - Mom!

376
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,080
Seo Hyeon Tae, you ordered it.

377
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,070
- You killed my baby. 
 - Mom!

378
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,970
- I can't forgive you. Die!

379
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,710
Die Seo Hyeon Tae

380
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,780
Stop!

381
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,350
- Die! Die! 
 - Mom!

382
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,950
- Die!!! 
 - Mom...

383
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,160
- Die! 
 - Stop!

384
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,990
- I'm going to get my baby back. 
 - Stop!

385
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,710
- Give me my baby back! 
 - Stop!

386
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,860
- Bring my baby back! 
 - It's okay. Okay.

387
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,270
- My baby Da Som. 
 - Stop.

388
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,690
Da Som!

389
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:38,200
- Da Som! 
 - Stop, stop!

390
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,060
- Stop it. 
 - Da Som.

391
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:27,370
I have good news and bad news.

392
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:34,570
The bad news is that Chimera has returned.

393
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,690
The good news is ...

394
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,020
I found Ryu Seong Hui.

395
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:50,690
The chimera of 35 years ago whom you were searching for

396
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:54,200
is Ryu Seong Hui.

397
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,990
And...

398
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,650
that person was my mom.

399
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:13,790
Why aren't you responding?

400
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,270
At the time

401
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,390
what were you going to tell me?

402
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,660
Before you were shot.

403
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,700
Why were you going to say to me?

404
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,030
Why were you looking at me like that?

405
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,830
Because I was pitiful?

406
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,380
If not ...

407
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,210
Both my mother and I ...

408
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,580
Say something.

409
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:11,220
Why not? I'm family.

410
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,380
You can't visit even if you are family.

411
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:20,590
But someone is alive after dying.  Why can't  I see the face of a family member for a second?

412
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,110
Hyo Gyeong...

413
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:39,830
Please let me see his face at least.

414
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,390
Can you hear me?

415
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,520
What are you dreaming about?

416
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,120
It must be something good.

417
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:11,600
I cannot forgive someone who tried to hurt you.

418
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,030
I will wrap this up.

419
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,150
I promise.

420
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,960
You really are asleep.

421
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:57,060
If you wake up, a lot of things will be different.

422
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,630
Oppa.

423
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,220
Hello, Geon Yeong?

424
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,590
Hyung, why weren't you picking up?

425
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,110
It's just that the gun that shot Lee Jung Yeop

426
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,900
is a contraband that goes through our country to the Japanese Yakuza.

427
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,040
There are times when one or two get around in Korea.

428
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,110
Do you remember the real CEO of Yeongpo?

429
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,520
Yes, the Yeongpo in Chinatown, where we went out as backup last year.

430
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:30,780
Yes, the people there said that the real CEO carried around a German pistol and bragged about it.

431
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:35,550
But last year, when he got robbed, all the weapons were seized.

432
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:38,060
Seized? We didn't seize anything.

433
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,940
I know, the Yeongpo guys said they never saw the gun either.

434
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:47,460
The ones who went out as backup that day were you, me, Han Cheol, and Pil Seong.

435
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,640
It was us four.

436
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,420
Hello?

437
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,270
Hello?

438
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:04,400
You scared me! What are you doing here?

439
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,200
What? Oh... N-nothing.

440
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,860
What's up with him?

441
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,730
Chairman, please help me.

442
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:24,520
I did everything for you.

443
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,500
Did I ever ask you to do anything for me?

444
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,600
Chairman!

445
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,240
Do I have some kind of relationship with you?

446
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:40,860
Bae Seung Gwan bought a drink for the guy who drove the car. That means nothing.

447
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,460
If I get caught, I'll really be done for. Please.

448
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,860
Help me out, just this one time.

449
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,490
You-You told me ...

450
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:51,840
that before Lee Jung Yeop gets arrested that he needs to die.

451
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,230
You told me that while you poured me a drink.

452
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:56,910
What kind of bullshit is that?

453
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:00,280
Chairman. Seriously, why are you doing this?

454
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,880
How could I at my own discretion just shoot someone like that?

455
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,320
I did it because you asked me to.

456
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,910
Who said I asked you!

457
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:11,040
You are a serious problem!

458
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,380
Chairman ... Chairman, please help me.

459
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,140
Please helpâ€“

460
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,830
Oh, jeez.

461
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:31,590
Chairman, this isn't what it looks like. It's not.

462
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:35,370
I gave the job to a guy like that... Drag him out of here!

463
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:38,260
Chairman! Chairman!

464
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,740
Please help me! Chairman!

465
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:52,200
Aren't you going to Seung Gwan's wake.

466
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,560
There are a bunch of evil journalists camped out for blood.

467
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,790
You want to feed them?

468
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:04,360
Jae Su will be disappointed.

469
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,670
I sent a wreath.

470
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:13,720
40 years of friendship in vain when I can't even go to this wake.

471
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,510
Is this the time to talk about friendship?!

472
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:19,890
It looks like I'm going to be dropped as the chairman of the judiciary committee.

473
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,770
The reporters are camped outside of my house you can't even walk.

474
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:29,750
When I got in the car to start the engine today,

475
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,870
it was scary.

476
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:35,030
How can a person live like this?

477
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:41,980
If it's not Lee Jung Yeop, who is the culprit?

478
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,150
Maybe ...

479
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:50,940
you aren't the one who ordered he be shot, are you?

480
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,620
Why did you go overboard?!

481
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:05,860
Guns are easy to track down! It's obvious in Korea!

482
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,360
What are you going to do?

483
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:14,240
I guess I was scared.

484
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,700
That guy ...

485
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,150
Now it's his turn to come to me.

486
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:38,660
Do you remember the night it rained a lot?

487
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,130
The day when Lee Sang Wu died,

488
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:48,050
August 8th, 1984.

489
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:53,620
 Hyeong, what happened?

490
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,910
 Hey! What happened?!

491
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:02,200
 He's not breathing.

492
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,810
 Lee Sang Wu

493
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:20,970
 Isn't he dead?!

494
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:23,780
 Did you do it?! Huh?!

495
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:26,580
 Get a hold of yourself!

496
00:47:55,330 --> 00:48:02,460
 He was breathing again but was unconscious. We couldn't take Lee Sang Wu to the hospital

497
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,520
 because it would reveal that he was tortured.

498
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:32,320
What are you ... saying?

499
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:47,170
I was on my knees in your front yard for three hours that day.

500
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:52,310
Your father was a great man.

501
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:59,350
I was going to stay there until he accepted me as family, no matter how hard it would be,

502
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:06,670
or if he really wouldn't accept me as his son-in-law.

503
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,940
After that

504
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:17,970
I went to find you to have a drink at dawn

505
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:23,650
but you went home that day, when normally you stay up all night working.

506
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:30,590
I should have gone home then.

507
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,800
Why did I do that?

508
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,650
Why did I think I needed to see him before going?

509
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:50,020
 But he smiled at me.

510
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:54,510
 He looked at me and that bastard ...

511
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:56,310
 It was you, right?

512
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:01,010
 You killed them, didn't you?

513
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,380
 That's what you said.

514
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:13,290
 He laughed.

515
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,970
 That bastard looked at me

516
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:20,030
 and smiled.

517
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:28,810
You ... Don't tell me you ...

518
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:32,310
Hyeon Tae, you did?!

519
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,520
 Confess!

520
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,700
 I said confess!

521
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,580
 Tell them you did it!

522
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,520
 Tell them everything was done by you!

523
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,460
 It was you. Why did you kill them?

524
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,140
 Why did you kill them, you bastard?!

525
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,780
 It was you. You killed them.

526
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,850
 Why did you do it? Why did you kill them?

527
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:03,030
 Confess! Hurry up!

528
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:05,660
 Hurry up and confess, you bastard!

529
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:37,420
 They probably believed that Lee Sang Wu died without ever regaining consciousness.

530
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,840
 The chimera knows about it.

531
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,430
 The fact that I killed Lee Sang Wu.

532
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:52,140
Seung Gwan died probably thinking he killed him.

533
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,420
After Seung Gwan,

534
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,160
I'm next.

535
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,610
 Can you watch the internet live broadcast now?

536
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:25,180
 It's a broadcast by Reporter Kim, the channel is called Muni's Valkyrie.

537
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:28,710
 She is talking about Chimera from 35 years ago.

538
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:31,750
 Reporter Kim, in the last episode, you said that you would focus

539
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,580
 on the connection between the chimera case and the global conglomerate Seoryun, right?

540
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:37,210
 Yes, I did.

541
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:41,160
 A conglomerate and a serial killer don't seem to match.

542
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:46,720
 The connection between Seoryun and Chimera dates back 35 years, back to 1984.

543
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,030
 Seo Hyeon Tae, who is now the head of the Seoryun Group,

544
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:53,550
 was a director of a chemical manufacturing company called Taesam Chemical at the time.

545
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:55,860
 Prior to the merger with Seoryun Group,

546
00:53:55,860 --> 00:54:00,470
 Taesam developed a new substance called TH-5 with a research team at Hanmyeong Universityâ€“

00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:22,990
 Hello, I'm safety protector Kim Hyo Gyeong.

556
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:27,870
 You know that there have been cases of casualties due to the recent leakage of harmful gases

557
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:30,840
 such as hydrofluoric acid or fires caused by fuel explosions, right?

558
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,350
 Even though we deal with various hazardous materials,

559
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:37,720
  we often do not know what kind of danger they pose.

560
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,990
 Today, shall we learn about the dangers of chemicals

561
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:43,670
 that we commonly use in our daily lives?

562
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:48,050
 The dangers of chemicals include explosive, flammable, oxidizing,

563
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:52,450
 corrosive, polar toxicity, and irritant.

564
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:56,840
 Today we learn about the explosive substance potassium nitrate.

565
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:04,420
 If you put this in a mortar of coal and grind it, black powder is created like this.

566
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:09,520
 I'm going to mix this black powder

567
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,360
 with potassium nitrate and sulfur.

568
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:36,830

 The 4th in the industry of Smart National Defense promotional video

570
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,800
 Today, shall we learn about magnesium based explosions?

571
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:01,340
 Magnesium is a type two dangerous substance that explodes when it is mixed with silver nitrate

572
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:03,940
 and reacts with water.

573
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:07,910
 There was an explosion at a magnesium manufacturing plant.

574
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:09,970
 In the case of these metallic fires,

575
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:14,670
 you can use sand or wet towels to extinguish the fire.

576
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:17,140
 I will show you.

577
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,610
I added magnesium

578
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:22,420
and silver nitrate.

579
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:27,700
And let's see how it reacts when you add water.

580
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:39,960
 Today we will learn about how to handle white phosphorus.

581
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,950
 Recent headlines show rumors

582
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:46,240
 that white phosphorus smoke grenades have been used at protests abroad.

583
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,650
 When white phosphorus interacts with oxygen, phosphorus pentoxide forms,

584
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:52,820
 and the smoke generated blocks the view of the surroundings.

585
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:55,990
  which is the purpose of this type of grenade.

587
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:40,320
Hanter Production, is a small production company that makes current affairs education programs.

588
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,710
It was outsourced by the Ministry of National Defense TV and produced videos since 2012.

589
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:45,660
It's mostly for internal training videos.

590
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:48,440
How long did Kim Hyo Gyeong work there?

591
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,180
She worked there for three years until 2012. She was a director.

592
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:54,180
When did she start at UBS News agency?

593
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:58,070
She was recruited in 2013 as a science expert journalist.

594
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:02,140
- Science expert? 
 - Yes.

595
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:05,650
It looks like Reporter Kim Hyo Gyeong went to a science high school.

596
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:09,150
She also participated in the International Olympiad as part of her chemistry club.

597
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:11,800
She majored in chemistry in college.

598
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:19,400
I will send you Kim Hyo Gyeong's phone number so try tracking her location.

599
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:40,080
- What's going on? 
 - There seems to be a gas leak from the kitchen on the first floor.

600
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,400
Can you help me? I'm short-handed.

601

Cha Eun Su.

602

604
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:51,440
 Do you know that "Mr. A," a suspect in the Chimera Case, escaped while being escorted to the Prosecutor's office?

605
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,770
 Yes. If he was the one who escaped, I heard he was shot while trying to flee.

606
01:00:56,770 --> 01:01:00,190
 The problem is that Mr. A was a prime suspect in the Chimera Case

607
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:04,500
 but he has an alibi when the explosion occurred yesterday.

608
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:08,090
 Then, has the real culprit again become unidentified?

609
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:11,910
 If that is so, who shot Mr. "A"?

610

 Message: But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will disappear with a roar;

611
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:27,930
 the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare.

612
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,120
 Confess! Confess!

613
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,090
 Confess you bastard!

614
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:41,820
 Why did you do it?

615
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:19,440
 I'm sorry.

616

 Lawyer Kim Hyeong Guk 
 Korean Bar Association

617
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:40,390
You can't move yet.

618
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:42,350
You came?

619
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:48,230
Are you okay? How are you? Are you hurting anywhere?

620
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:50,210
I'm all right.

621
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:54,260
I brought you some change of clothes.

622
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:58,860
If you don't have any infections, you can be discharged soon.

623
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,030
You were lucky.

624
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:04,870
Also, you were cleared of the charges.

625
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:07,500
Another case happened.

626
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:15,150
I shouldn't say things like this but I'm really glad it did.

627
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,700
I guess someone died again.

628
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:22,780
Don't worry about that anymore.

629
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:30,720
- Ajeossi. 
 - Yes?

630
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,160
Who is Kim Hyo Gyeong?

631
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:41,150
Who is she?

632
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:53,450
Hello. I wanted to meet you ...

633
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:55,540
Chimera.

634
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:04,400
It's strange to see you in person.

635
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:10,070
I had many thoughts before I met you.

636
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:18,310
Should I just kill you?

637
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:23,390
Or should I save you and let you see hell?

638
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:30,170
I lost my family because of you.

639
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:33,980
So isn't it fair for you to suffer the same thing?

640
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,190
Yeah, Geon Yeong.

641
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:52,100
 Kim Hyo Gyeong is located at the nursing home right now.

642
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:54,180
Did you say a nursing home?

643
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:56,530
 The one where your mother is at.

644
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:07,810
Do you want me to kill

645
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,750
the one person you love?

646
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:56,510

647
01:05:56,510 --> 01:06:00,250
â™«  Some people want to live  â™«

648
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:03,880
â™«  But turn their back on me  â™«

649
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:09,370
â™«  The time I lived as myself, not me  â™«

650
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:12,580
â™«  Some people say to me  â™«

651
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:15,530
 Chimera

652
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:17,720
 Have you ever met the devil?

653
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:21,370
 Your answer might stop me.

654
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:23,520
 You have to stop Kim Hyo Gyeong.

655
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,360
 Rather than running away like a dying dog, fight like a bear and die.

656
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:30,940
 Was Kim Hyo Gyeong's act simply a cruel crime?

657
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:32,840
 How come we're all the same?

658
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:33,900
 Did you do it?

659
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:39,030
 Do you think you can kill me? Go ahead and try.

660
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:41,140
 All right, choose

661
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:43,630
 your destiny.
