1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,250
 Chimera

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:28,210
 The characters, locations, incidents, religious sects, etc. in this drama are fiction and have no relation to reality.

4
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,580
  Episode 7

5
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,160
 Myths of Greece and Rome

6
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,500
 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief

7
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,800
 in which the heavens will disappear with a roar;

8
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,840
 the elements will be destroyed by fire,

9
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,990
 and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare.

10
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,290
Isn't there some kind of relationship between the dead Lee Sang Wu and the culprit

11
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,420
who is now recreating the Chimera case from 35 years ago?

12
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,660
Everyone who was murdered was involved in the arrest and death of Lee Sang Wu.

13
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,560
The reporter, who revealed the identity of Lee Sang Wu's family,

14
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,290
and the detective, who arrested Lee Sang Wu.

15
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,060
If the target of the crime is the prior Chimera investigation team

16
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,990
and Lee Sang Wu died after being falsely accused, then the motive for the crime emerges.

17
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,640
Revenge for the death of Lee Sang Wu.

18
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,060
 119 Emergency Vehicle

19
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,400
Yes, yes.  I think we'll arrive in ten minutes.

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,700
His condition is critical.  It's like a chemical burn,

21
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,090
but his flesh keeps dissolving.  I have no idea what the cause is.

22
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,290
No, it wasn't at a factory.  It happened at his home.

23
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,100
Yes, I understand.

24
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,190
- Seonbaenim. 
 - Yes?

25
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,660
Gyeongpo Hospital's emergency room is also full.

26
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,050
Really? Then let's go to another hospital ... find one which specializes in burn treatment.

27
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,540
Yes, I understand.

28
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,780
The false confession means that someone fabricated Lee Sang Wu's cause of death.

29
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,670
Why did someone hide their signature?

30
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,140
Only the investigation team would know.

31
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,130
Neither a witness nor any record exists, and they skipped the autopsy.

32
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,230
The medical examiner's report was fabricated.

33
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:56,790
There must be people who gave the headquarters' director's final approval to this case investigation report,

34
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,650
and I don't think it's connected to just one or two people.

35
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,530
How extensive was the investigation team's involvement?

36
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,980
The names of Han Ju Seok, Ham Yong Bok, and the chief.

37
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,430
Investigator,

38
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,990
for now, let's keep our discussion just between us.

39
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,960
I'll look into more details.

40
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,810
A parcel bomb?

41
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,850
What are you saying?

42
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,820
Where?

43
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,290
Gyeongpo City?

44
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,420
 This is the site of an apartment in Hajin-gu, Gyeongpo City, damaged from parcel terrorism.

45
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,000
 At 11 AM today, 59-year-old Mr. Ham was seriously injured

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,200
 by explosives delivered by a courier.

47
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,860
 Although the fire is almost completely extinguished due to the rapid response of the firefighters,

48
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,190
 they are having difficulty controlling the situation because of the chemicals emanating from the package.

49
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,960
 While some witnesses and firefighters, who responded to the alarm

50
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,660
 inhaled dangerous fumes are being taken to the hospital,

51
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,530
 we know that Mr. Ham is in critical condition.

52
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,600
 The fire department will maintain control of the immediate surroundings.

53
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,210
 Until the explosives' components are identified, elderly and the incapacitated are ...

54
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,020
- Move on.  
 - I am an officer. An officer.

55
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,360
Wow, do they send bombs in parcels now?

56
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,250
Stop for a second.

57
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,920
Can you show us the pictures of the chimera lighter?

58
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,470
Detective Lee, confirm the delivery address.

59
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,010
- Determine the dispatch route. 
 - Yes, sir.

60
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,170
Detective Jang, contact the Gyeongpo station and

61
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,080
get the parking lot elevator CCTV recording.

62
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,680
Yes, sir.

63
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,750
Detectives Cho and Lim, make a list of experts on construction site explosionsâ€”

64
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,430
I'll make a list of experts for military explosions too.

65
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,500
What about the victim?  Can he make a statement?

66
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,390
After receiving emergency treatment in Gyeongpo, he is in such critical condition

67
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,190
that he is being transferred to Seoryun hospital.

68
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,440
The victim ...

69
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,400
Who is he?

70
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,350
So?

71
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,520
Are you saying you just went, not checking where the guy named Ham Yong Bok lived,

72
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,380
following him to Gyeongpo, where his head was about to blow up?

73
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,130
I was looking into a variety of leads.

74
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,650
You  should have followed him first.  You missed it and just came back?!

75
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,560
The victim Ham Yong Bok is an ex-cop.

76
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,670
- What? 
 - Thirty-five years ago he worked at the Macheon City station.

77
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:15,290
Ham Yong Bok was a member of the Chimera investigation team 35 years ago.

78
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:20,530
He was on the same team as the dead Team Leader Han.

79
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,210
He arrested the prime suspect Lee Sang Wu.

80
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,000
During the investigation, Lee Sang Wu committed suicide at a detention center.

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,120
But the suicide is doubtful.

82
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,520
There was no autopsy and a remaining file document, the alleged suicide note, was crudely fabricated.

83
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,500
Fabricated?

84
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,420
Then, it wasn't a suicide?

85
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,770
As of now, that's what I think.

86
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,880
The death of Lee Sang Wu 35 years ago is the starting point

87
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,870
of the serial murders which are currently happening.

88
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,750
What did you expect?

89
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,690
Did you think they would admit they were wrong and beg for forgiveness?

90
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,060
It's not that they won't do it. It's that they can't.

91
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,890
It's our position that right and wrong are important.

92
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:34,590
For them, it's their lives that are more important.

93
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,910
Go home.

94
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:47,220
Forget about everything here.  It's not too late.

95
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,240
What about you?

96
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,890
Have you forgotten everything and just lived?

97
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,990
As for me,

98
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,900
I can't forgive them.

99
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,440
Because you are so stubborn, you are surely your father's son.

100
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,290
Your father and I were accepted at a law school.

101
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,550
A university in Seoul.

102
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,940
What was he going to do when he couldn't afford to go to college.

103
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:30,050
He couldn't bear to tell his family. While talking only to me, saying I was his friend,

104
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,200
he cried because he wanted to go to school.

105
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,160
Even guiding his younger siblings, born one right after the other, in a modest household,

106
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,340
he must have had many thoughts.

107
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:50,300
If he had been a little more selfish, your father would have had a different life.

108
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,310
He was so kind.  Kind.

109
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,420
But then,

110
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,290
there's nothing I can do.   Nothing at all.

111
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,130
Both the case data have disappeared, and the people involved are dead.

112
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,940
The only thing that is left is your memory.

113
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,220
I knew then that I couldn't do anything.

114
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:32,390
I shouldn't have yelled at your mother saying that I was innocent.

115
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:37,630
Ahjeossi.  It's not too late to reveal my father's innocence.

116
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,390
If we find the real chimera, the real culprit of 35 years ago,

117
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,230
my father's false accusation will be stripped away and that the case against him was fabricated will be revealed.

118
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,830
My father's innocence, which you couldn't prove as my father's attorney then, can be revealed now.

119
00:09:54,530 --> 00:10:02,220
Do you think such people will just watch their wrongdoing come to light?

120
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,960
They have become bigger and more powerful than before.

121
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,960
You won't be the victor in any fight.

122
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,430
It's not that I'm telling you to forgive them.

123
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,530
Don't squander your life on it!

124
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:39,200
I'm sorry that visitation is permitted only in the presence of a supervisor,

125
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,060
but you must be done within five minutes.

126
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,540
The patient's condition is critical.

127
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,820
It will be difficult for him to last more than 48 hours.

128
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,800
Yong Bok.

129
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,640
Yong Bok. It's me.

130
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,600
Yong Bok.

131
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,730
It's me, Hyeong, do you recognize me?* ( Older brother, used among close friends as well as blood relatives)

132
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,100
I know.

133
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,350
What happened?  Who did that?

134
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,530
Yes,  tell me.

135
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,670
That guy ...

136
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,560
returned alive.

137
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,930
He will ...

138
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,050
kill all of us.

139
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,760
What are you saying?

140
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,950
Who has been alive?

141
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,630
The sky is gone.

142
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,490
The flames

143
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,630
will make everything vanish in a hot fire.

144
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,390
Every deed

145
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,720
will be revealed.

146
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:35,620
 A unique smell presumably from a substance used in the parcel bomb terrorism in Gyeongpo

147
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,300
  traveled as far as the front of the front door of the apartment which was the site of the incident.

148
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,450
Wow, a parcel bomb?

149
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,390
This is an age where you can't even open a package as you please.

150
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,160
If one decides to do it,  isn't it possible to carry off a major terrorist attack?

151
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,150
They aren't talking about the Unabomber in a different country.

152
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,500
 The likelihood of terrorism

153
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,160
Hyo Gyeong, Yun Seok.

154
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,750
  is being raised.

155
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,820
You know this time a painting of a chimera at the site of the Gyeongpo package explosion has come out, right?

156
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,870
Before the airing of our regular "Search" program, the director ordered that we air a special program.

157
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,590
What?  A special program?

158
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:17,950
Don't you understand what I'm saying?  The executive director is addicted to the chimera.

159
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:21,580
Kim Hyo Gyeong.  How far have you gotten in preparation? Can we do it next week?

160
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,350
I think next week will be hard.

161
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,460
I'll try to have it done by the week after.

162
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,820
- Yun Seok, drop what you're doing and join her.  Share the data with him.
 - Yes, sir.

163
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:38,760
And you, see what will happen if you leak information around the city desk or anywhere else again.

164
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:44,610
Hey.  Even if there were a lot of serial killers, has there ever been a serial terrorist?

165
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:49,500
This is a crime of developed countries.  We are the first to pop that.

166
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,460
But is this case a chimera case?

167
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:56,070
They say the design came from a painting on the site, not a lighter.

168
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,130
You know it's a fire. A fire. Why is the chimera a chimera?

169
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:03,440
It's a monster that kills humans by shooting fire! This is the concept.

170
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,250
Has the chimera, who killed people with explosives 35 years ago, made a comeback?

171
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,610
Why has he returned after 35 years?

172
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:15,850
You need to focus on stuff like this. Did you just start doing this?

173
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,860
Until we get enough content to air, don't dream of going home.

174
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,920
Think back to the day when you entered the local newsroom at the police station? Do you understand?

175
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,850
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

176
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,460
That's it.

177
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,600
Listen carefully.  I'm saying it for caution's sake.

178
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,000
Don't think about including Seoryun's Evergreen incident in the story.  Our commercial income will plummet.

179
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,690
Excuse me?

180
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,590
If we're talking about the Chimera, how can I leave that out?

181
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,260
Who is the terrorist? What's the motive for the crimes?

182
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,870
Those are the points.  Why are you talking about a disinfectant there?

183
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,830
You, just follow the murder cases.

184
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,120
I'm going to keep my eyes on you.

185
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,290
Chief, are you going somewhere?

186
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,590
No.  Where are you going?

187
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,480
I'm going to the conference at the forensics agency.

188
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,540
I heard they analyzed the components of the package bomb.

189
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,760
- Okay.  
 -  Yes, then.

190
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,260
Gwang Su.

191
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:58,080
Those are the ignitable substances detected at the site in Gyeonpo.

192
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,790
- What is this? 
 - White phosphorus?

193
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,830
Yes. It used to be called a 'perfect match.'

194
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,440
If you struck it anywhere, it lit up. That is white phosphorus.

195
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,270
In the 19th century, people who worked in match factories got lung damage

196
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,890
and all their skin peeled off.

197
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:19,590
Oh!  You know the little match girl, right?

198
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,260
Are you talking about the fairy tale?

199
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,710
Yes.  This is the real setting of the story.

200
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:28,370
The factory paid her using matches instead of wages.

201
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,390
The girl goes around selling the matches and she dies.

202
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,990
In the fairy tale, it comes out that she freezes to death.

203
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:39,340
Actually, if you find out,  she was the first industrial death victim.

204
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,200
There was no need to tell that. Who uses this stuff?

205
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,800
Now it's classified as a dangerous substance. It's only used for military purposes.

206
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,940
How dangerous is it?

207
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,390
It's a substance that ignites on its own at 50 degrees Celsius.

208
00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:01,030
Once it adheres to the skin, so long as it isn't cut off,  you can watch it penetrate deeper.

209
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,760
Where can you get that when you said it's only used by the military?

210
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,780
I know. For ordinary people, besides being unable to obtain it, it's also difficult to handle.

211
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,080
Then, the people who handle this ...?

212
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,590
Because it's used mainly as a smoke bomb or a fire bomb component,

213
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,950
would it be anyone from the military?

214
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,860
What sort of person would use something like white phosphorus?

215
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,690
I can't say.

216
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:44,360
Isn't it possible if you're a physician?

217
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,960
What?

218
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,800
No, it's nothing. It's nothing.

219
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,130
 The discloseure that the components of the delivery package bomb in Gyeongpo

220
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,000
 are not easy to purchase by an ordinary person has caused more repercussions.

221
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:27,660
 Because of this, the government cannot avoid liability for negligence in the management and supervision of chemicals.

222
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,760
 In the midst of focus growing on how the criminal obtained this dangerous substance,

223
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,190
 a painting of a chimera ...

224
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,990
- Turn off the light. 
 -   was found on the site.

225
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:43,230
Turn off the light now.  It's already bright. The electricity bill will go up.

226
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,360
Turn it off.

227
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,160
Come on!  The bill isn't that big, geez.

228
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,740
 According to a police official, at the scene of the Jungsan-gu incident,

229
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,060
  a lighter with a chimera design, which was left behind by the culprit, was discovered.

230
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,640
 It's being asserted that the person in charge of the investigation kept silent about the lighter.

231
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,210
 If the allegation that the investigation authorities tried to investigate

232
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:10,130
 a connection between the parcel bomb incident in Gyeongpo and the chimera case turns out to be true,

233
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,970
  the impact of the incident is expected to increase significantly.

234
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:18,230
 The authorities continue to investigate thoroughly the recent arson and murder cases in Jungsan-gu

235
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,950
 while maintaining tight security.

236
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:28,230
 In 1984 Chimera terrorized the Macheon area in Gyeonggi Province,

237
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,980
 in a serial murder case with three victims.

238
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,500
 A apartment in Hajin-gu, Gyeongpo, was the scene

239
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,140
Rotten corrupt cops.

240
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,580
They don't know how to do anything but take bribes.

241
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,000
See?  What did I say? I told you I had to change everything.

242
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,170
 of a cruel and bold crime.

243
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:53,020
 At 11 AM today, 59-year-old Mr. Ham was seriously injured by explosives delivered by a courier.

244
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,760
 Although the fire is almost completely extinguished due to the rapid response of the firefighters,

245
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,960
 they are having difficulty controlling the situation because of the chemicals emanating from the package.

246
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:11,300
If you are soaked, you must tell me you are soaked.  What do I do if you cover it up?

247
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,230
Why the heck are you sitting in it?

248
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,130
Sang Gu, I'm sorry.

249
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,830
I'm sorry.

250
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,060
Mom.  Why do you keep making things twice as hard?

251
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,060
 MBC News.  Police are investigating the similarity between the Chimera Case and the Gyeongpo explosion.

252
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:55,120
It's a mess.  Yeah.  A total mess.

253
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,920
I have to cut them all out.  I ...

254
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,430
I-I'm going to wake you all up, wide awake.

255
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,540
 Special Lecture on Criminal Psychology 
 FBI Terrorism Specialist Eugene Hathaway 
 Hanmyeong University

256
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:15,330
Detection of explosives starts with CCTV verification.

257
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:20,890
You can determine whether the explosives are military grade or chemical by the smoke or flames.

258
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:33,070
ANFO produces brown smoke and C4 produces black smoke.

259
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:37,430
Even if people lie, fire doesn't.

260
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,040
This is a bomb detonator.

261
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,260
Smart terrorists can even make their own.

262
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,820
Of course, there are also cases where a detonator is not necessary.

263
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,680
If chemical substances are used, ignition is possible

264
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,710
just by temperature, humidity, or external shock.

265
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,660
What about white phosphorus?

266
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,830
Ah. White phosphorus.

267
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,100
It's been said that white phosphorus was used in the delivery bomb case.

268
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,100
That wouldn't have been the kind of white phosphorus used by the military.

269
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,980
Most likely,

270
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,510
 Fenian Fire

271
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,510
It's probably Fenian Fire.

272
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:35,940
When white phosphorus is stabilized, it is dissolved in benzol or carbon disulfide.

273
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,930
Between those two, carbon disulfide is flammable enough to catch fire if left in contact with the air.

274
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,430
It's a very dangerous substance.

275
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:47,760
When carbon disulfide and white phosphorus come into contact, you get a bomb.

276
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,250
First, white phosphorous is dissolved with carbon disulfide and applied to a book.

277
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,300
The moment the book is opened, the carbon disulfide volatilizes.

278
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,310
And then the white phosphorus, that was stable, ignites.

279
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:47,290
After that, the flammable carbon disulfide vapor explodes.

280
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:01,620
This method was also used by Irish secret societies in the 19th century.

281
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,520
 Fenian Fire

282
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,480
That's why it's called Fenian fire.

283
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,560
Excuse me, Professor?

284
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,210
Is it okay to teach us all of this?

285
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,670
Why? Do you want to try it yourself?

286
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,710
Luckily, it's impossible.

287
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:29,140
It could explode early if you carried it around in this kind of weather.

288
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,770
The criminal would have also risked his life.

289
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,680
Without faith, terrorism is impossible.

290
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,680
Kang Sang Gu?

291
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,250
Thank you.

292
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,270
Hello, I'm from Jungsan Police Station.

293
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,230
 Cha Jae Hwan 
 National Police Agency  
 I see.

294
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,580
What brings you here?

295
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,530
I want to check the purchase history of the graduate school's chemistry department.

296
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,000
What dates?

297
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,430
It looks like white phosphorus was purchased for testing last month.

298
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,150
- Last month? 
 - Yes.

299
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,000
Hold on one moment, please.

300
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,100
The chemistry department purchased it on the 17th.

301
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,790
Is it possible to know where it was used and for what experiments?

302
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:32,890
It was purchased by Professor Kwon Ji Wook's team, but it looks like it hasn't been used yet.

303
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,100
- Are you sure? 
 - Yes.

304
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,140
Should I get you the purchase invoice?

305
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,830
Yes, please give me all of the purchase invoices for white phosphorous.

306
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,280
Sure.

307
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:55,140
Is-Is this because of the delivery bomb in Gyeongpo?

308
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,560
Who said so?

309
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,600
No one said that was why.

 Introduction to Firefighting 
 Introduction to Firefighting for Firefighters

312
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,230
Are you going to keep coming to the lectures?

313
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,380
Why? Does it make you uncomfortable?

314
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,660
No. It's not that. I just thought that you would be too busy.

315
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,600
I know that you went to Gyeongpo.

316
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,860
You met Ham Yong Bok, right?

317
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,210
Did Detective Cha say so?

318
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,520
You're only choosing to do dangerous things.

319
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,060
Do you really think that I did it?

320
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,560
That isn't a question that I can answer.

321
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,510
You're always dodging the important questions.

322
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,990
What is that you want to say?

323
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,750
Just... Well...

324
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,170
I'm just here to make light conversation.

325
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,280
The kinds of chats that friends have.

326
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:39,220
You asked me to help you right?

327
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,550
To be honest, I don't really know how I can help you.

328
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:49,030
I'm an outsider and I'm not in a position to do anything.

329
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:52,830
Sometimes being an outsider is an advantage.

330
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,180
Do you have a problem with the Korean police?

331
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,950
Or any bad memories?

332
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,130
Do you always analyze people like this?

333
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,260
Have you never met someone without your guard up?

334
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,470
Mr. Lee Jung Yeop,

335
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:31,850
If you want to be friends, isn't it natural to be transparent first?

336
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,160
I'm just looking for answers.

337
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,870
But there are some people who don't want those answers to come out.

338
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,860
Son Wan Gi asked me for money.

339
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,750
He cut off contact with me once he got the money.

340
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:55,210
By the way, Han Ju Seok died before I ever even met him.

341
00:28:55,210 --> 00:29:00,050
And after that was Ham Yong Bok. I'm always one step too late.

342
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,640
You're not the one who killed them.

343
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,600
So why did you go looking for them?

344
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,840
Those people were all related to Lee Sang Wu's death.

345
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,200
Why is Lee Sang Wu's death so important to you?

346
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,300
What is your relationship with Lee Sang Wu?

347
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:27,420
Make the right choice. If you do, you will be left alone.

348
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,650
Even so, you must never lose your integrity.

349
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,660
Who said those words?

350
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,100
The lecture was interesting.

351
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,350
See you next week.

352
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,050
Detective Jo. Did you discover anything?

353
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:17,990
As for the International University of Science and Technology,

354
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,150
you were correct that they bought white phosphorous three years ago.

355
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,520
But they used all of it for experiments.

356
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,370
What about Hanmyeong University?

357
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,810
Cha Jae Hwan.

358
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,370
Yes?

359
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:34,370
They did buy some white phosphorus but haven't used it yet.

360
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,210
What about the book? Did you find out where it was made?

361
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,600
Yes. About that.

362
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,380
It can't be tracked since it was ordered online using direct deposit.

363
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,710
What about the person who sent the package?

364
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,180
Both the sender's name and the address were stolen from other people.

365
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,690
Were there any DNA or fingerprints on the package?

366
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:58,430
It was clean.

367
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,290
Nothing's working out.

368
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,250
There's something you need to see.

369
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,920
This is CCTV from in front of Ham Yong Bok's girlfriend, Jeong Sun Jeong's house.

370
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,420
This video is from four days ago.

371
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,900
This jerk.

372
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,910
Is there any way to make the face clearer?

373
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:28,370
I'll zoom in and try increasing the sharpness.

374
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,290
 100%

375
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,210
Lee Jung Yeop!

376
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:03,240
And this is the CCTV from the other side of the building 15 minutes later.

377
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:10,660
 CAM 10 
 09-02-2019

378
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,610
 Seo Hyeon Tae

379
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,230
What is this asshole's identity?

380
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,900
He graduated from King's College of Medicine in London.

381
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:44,330
He met my wife at a conference in San Francisco two years ago and made an impression.

382
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:48,980
And she was going back and forth to England to recruit him.

383
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,620
Things went too smoothly.

384
00:32:53,620 --> 00:33:00,650
So you're saying that he might have deliberately approached Hwa Jeong a few years ago?

385
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,930
Hwa Jeong. That idiot.

386
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:08,540
This guy isn't a simple thug.

387
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:12,470
He must have military expertise in addition to his high intelligence.

388
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,060
He must be special forces.

389
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,230
What does this guy want?

390
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:26,780
You said he was adopted right? At what age? Does he have family here?

391
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:30,000
I looked into it, and he's an orphan. He doesn't have family here.

392
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,170
So you're saying that a guy with no connections at all was asking about the dead Lee Sang Wu?

393
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,570
He must have something to do with him.

394
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:45,950
It might be best to avoid getting involved.

395
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,490
Just chase him away.

396
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:53,330
Isn't he a foreigner? Wouldn't he have come here on a work visa?

397
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,830
Tell Hwa Jeong to cancel his contract.

398
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,970
Fire him using what excuse?

399
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,970
Should we just throw him out for no reason?

400
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:06,000
Just throw him out for no reason? This guy is a murderer!

401
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,010
How many people did he kill? From Han Ju Seok

402
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:12,830
to Yong Bok. I can't send this asshole off nicely.

403
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:16,850
Seung Gwan! Is it a time for you to be worried about the dead?

404
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,270
Do you know how many phone calls Hyeon Tae and I had to make today?

405
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:24,810
The Blue House Secretary and the National Intelligence Service called as soon as they heard about the white phosphorous!

406
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,590
We had to stop them from looking into it!

407
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,150
It looks like you're going to lose control over your investigation.

408
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:33,150
- Get a grip! 
 -That's why I'm saying that I'll go catch him first!

409
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:36,350
We don't even know whether he is actually the perpetrator or not!

410
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:39,170
Wait. Hyeongnim. Are you still doubting it after seeing this?

411
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:42,350
Can you get a conviction with this alone?

412
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,790
You should go fix that habit of acting emotionally.

413
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,880
I thought you would get better as you got older.

414
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:57,780
Did you get someone to tail this asshole?

415
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,910
Yes.

416
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,650
What are you thinking?

417
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,060
I'm going to go meet him.

418
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,560
What?

419
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,190
I have to see him with my own eyes and judge

420
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,630
what kind of man he is.

421
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,560
 35 years ago

422
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:40,830
Director Seo Hyeon Tae. Didn't you promise me?

423
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,840
Lee Sang Wu. Put that down.

424
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,760
I only believed what you said.

425
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,350
But now I've been fired.

426
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,780
Calm down and put that lighter down first!

427
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:56,790
All we did was work hard.

428
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:02,280
Didn't you promise that if the merger was completed and we moved to a new factory

429
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,530
that we'd all be 100% employed?

430
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,390
You made the promise yourself, Director Seo Hyeon Tae.

431
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,620
Don't come closer.

432
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,610
- Director. 
 - Let go!

433
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:12,280
Don't touch me.

434
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,230
- Help me. 
 - Don't hold on to me.

435
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,170
- Director 
 - I said let go!

436
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,840
Let go you asshole!

437
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,660
This bastard. Where does he think he is?

438
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,330
Get out of here, bastard!

439
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,540
 Investigator Eugene

440
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,360
Wrist! Head!

441
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,070
Head!

442
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,650
Wrist! Head!

443
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,520
Head!

444
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,830
Thanks for the drink.

445
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,400
Sure.

446
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:44,550
I heard your personality shows when you use a sword. You're so merciless.

447
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:48,890
I'm really shabby. I'm not getting better even if I practice.

448
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,420
But you looked very meticulous.

449
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,560
I'm very clumsy except when I'm working.

450
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,600
Just this week, I thought I left my car keys in the classroom and went back there maybe three times?

451
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,760
Maybe even four times?

452
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,120
You must not have a lecture today.

453
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,700
I don't.

454
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,500
You lecture at Hanmyeong University, right?

455
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,250
It's a special course only being offered for two months. How did you know that?

456
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,660
It looked interesting. Can I go to the lecture?

457
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:25,650
At your level, you already know all of the things taught in that class.

458
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,180
Investigator.

459
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:38,170
What do you think when you see Lee Jung Yeop?

460
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,690
- Lee Jung Yeop? 
 - Yes.

461
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:44,340
I've been confused lately.

462
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:51,220
Before, all I thought about was that he was guilty and I had to catch him.

463
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,650
These days, because of Team Leader Han's death,

464
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:59,630
I've been wondering if I lost my judgment about things.

465
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:04,850
I was certain that this guy must be the culprit,

466
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,250
but when I think about why I'm confused that he isn't...

467
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:13,250
I realized that it is because I don't know anything about Lee Jung Yeop.

468
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,590
What do you think?

469
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:23,020
You said before that he might be chasing the culprit instead of being the culprit himself, right?

470
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,800
Well, I don't think I understand him yet either.

471
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:36,420
I'm not saying I want to do anything.

472
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,160
I just came because I was frustrated.

473
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,820
How about taking the opposite approach?

474
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:50,750
Lee Jung Yeop was adopted in 1984.

475
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:56,160
I think that Lee Jung Yeop's father has some connection with Lee Sang Wu.

476
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,770
How about looking into Lee Sang Wu's dead family?

477
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,120
 Macheon Community Center

478
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:13,400
Lee Sang Wu's death certificate was processed on August 8th, 1984.

479
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,770
His family?

480
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,940
His wife was Jeon Yeong Sin.

481
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:22,430
Ah, she died in the same year.

482
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:30,360
Were there any other family members?

483
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,450
Wait a moment.

484
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,990
He had a child, a boy.

485
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:43,300
Born in 1977.  Name, Lee Tae Yeong.

486
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,040
 Father: Lee Sang Wu/ Mother: Jeon Yeong Sin/ Given Name: Tae Yeong

487
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,880
Can I know the child's whereabouts?

488
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,810
 Light of Hope Orphanage

489
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,440
Lee Tae Yeong.

490
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,910
Here it is.

491
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:01,230
At least the date here was well maintained.

492
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,220
As other orphanages closed,

493
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,180
even the children's records disappeared too.

494
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:11,860
Can you tell me where the child Lee Tae Yeong went?

495
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:16,270
Usually, they didn't keep a record of where the child was sent,

496
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:20,250
- but I'm certain about this one. 
 - Where did he go?

497
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:26,050
He died. Pneumonia.

498
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:37,750
 Died of pnenumonia, October 3, 1984

499
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,160
This is the best set menu, so I went ahead and ordered it.

500
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,840
You're not choosy, are you?

501
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,340
Not about food.  I am about people.

502
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:52,230
This place is our chairman's favorite.

503
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:56,590
This is my favorite restaurant which I don't share with just anyone.

504
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:01,840
I asked the chef to take care of the dinner gathering with you.

505
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,950
Thanks for the invitation.

506
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:23,300
It's hard to dine with the chairman.

507
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,650
What wind blew you here today to pay for dinner?

508
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:31,410
I wanted to see the famous Doctor Lee in person.

509
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,300
Hearing just how amazing a man you are,

510
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,530
I wondered if my wife was talking about my favorite painting.

511
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:40,950
Are you talking about Francis Bacon?

512
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:46,150
Wasn't I right to go with someone who recognizes the value of art?

513
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:57,170
I heard you came alone to Korea.

514
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:00,180
Don't you have relatives or acquaintances?

515
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,440
No, I don't.

516
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,300
Aren't you dating anyone? Should I play matchmaker?

517
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,970
It's because my family was so humble. My father did physical labor at a factory.

518
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:15,340
Oh, "blue collar."

519
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,760
Does that matter nowadays? Isn't that right, Chairman?

520
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,170
Yeah.

521
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:25,520
I also once ran a factory.

522
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,990
What field did your father work in?

523
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:32,090
It was chemical.

524
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,460
Is he still working?

525
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:45,810
He worked for over ten years and then was fired.

526
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,950
I heard that while their company merged with a larger company

527
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:53,300
over half of his colleagues lost their jobs together.

528
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,380
The negotiations about being rehired were already over,

529
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:00,380
but suddenly the company president went back on his promise.

530
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:05,950
I heard that after he took action with that issue, futilely,

531
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,590
he was fired for fighting against the company.

532
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:19,640
He must have had a lot of resentment against the world during that time.

533
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,680
I see.

534
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,580
How is your father doing?

535
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,580
Of course.

536
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:40,710
I'm sure around this time near the Time Bridge he's enjoying a cold beer.

537
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,430
 That white phosphorus and carbon disulfide compounds, classified as hazardous substances

538
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:05,000
 managed and regulated by the government, were used in the crime

539
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,610
 was confirmed and it is shocking.

540
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:12,800
 This afternoon the police executed a search and seizure warrant on C-Tech, a defense contractor.

541
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,450
 C-Tech is known as a company that supplies mainly military ammunition, explosives,

542
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:20,840
 and smoke bombs used for firefighter and rescue training.

543
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:27,050
 An intense investigation is expected into the details of manufacture, import and distribution

544
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:31,650
 of various hazardous chemicals including white phosphorus, the principal ingredient of fire and smoke bombs.

545
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,510
Fenian Fire.

546
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,330
 Fenian Fire

547
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:58,270

548
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:06,350

549
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:38,520
I stole your time for nothing.

550
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:43,630
It was I who asked you to go. It was a nice day, and we went for a drive.

551
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:51,470
What are you going to do now?

552
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:55,360
I have no idea.

553
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:58,680
Detective Cha.

554
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:03,130
Don't try to take on the entire case by yourself.

555
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,430
Hold on.

556
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:20,520
Do you have something to say?

557
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,360
Miss Eugene.

558
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:27,570
Why are you going around with me?

559
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,520
What?

560
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:37,250
For a good-looking and busy person, actually, it's not even your business.

561
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:40,760
Saying it's going to be solved, well, there's nothing in it for you.

562
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:50,390
That's why I want to do it.

563
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:52,060
Why?

564
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:55,440
Why do you want to do that?

565
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,250
If I'm honest, you'll be offended.

566
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:05,260
Please say it.  I won't be offended.

567
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:12,610
Although this case is going to make you suffer,

568
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,740
for me, it's interesting.

569
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:21,050
You don't like me, do you?

570
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,000
I'm not sure.

571
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:32,290
I don't know if it's because I'm not as educated.

572
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,280
What you said ...

573
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,410
I don't really understand.

574
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,330
Get home safely.

575
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,010
You...

576
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:47,000
You...

577
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:50,150
You...

578
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:56,480
I am sorry.

579
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:59,490
I'm sorry.

580
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:06,470
Forgive me.

581
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:08,120
Please.

582
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:12,060
Please. Please...

583
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:15,680
I'm soâ€”

584
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,440
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

585
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,920
I'm sorry.

586
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,180
Please save me.

587
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:27,400
Please save me.

588
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,700
Please save me.

589
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,950
You don't disinfect your wound at all, do you?

590
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:10,710
Nor are you taking your medicine.

591
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:13,600
If you don't, it'll get worse.

592
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:23,840
Ham Yong Bok won't last for more than a few days.

593
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,110
How do you feel?

594
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:32,290
About seeing someone who is expected to die?

595
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:35,050
It's like a chronic illness for a doctor.

596
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:40,650
How is your investigation going, Detective Cha?

597
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,420
Do you want everything to go well?

598
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:50,700
Yes, genuinely.

599
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,520
I went to Macheon City today.

600
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:10,830
Do you know where that is?

601
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:17,730
It's the place where Lee Sang Wu, who committed suicide 35 years ago as a suspect in the Chimera case lived.

602
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:21,350
So, did you find something?

603
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:24,740
Actually,

604
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,290
I went to find his son.

605
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:34,370
I thought maybe he'd be alive.

606
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:39,180
And if he was alive, where and how he has been enduring it all.

607
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,150
Did you find him?

608
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:48,560
No. I didn't.

609
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,180
They said he was dead.

610
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:01,160
What were you going to do after finding his son?

611
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:05,700
I have something to tell him.

612
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:14,960
There are people who want to reveal the truth about your father's death.

613
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:27,300
Your father might not have committed suicide.

614
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:33,800
He could have been framed and killed.

615
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:42,700
How unfair and resentful your family must have been.

616
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:50,140
Although it's been thirty-five years, that there are people who understand

617
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:56,030
and remember what happened.

618
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:39,330
Why are you delivering at night? There's still a lot left.

619
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:43,630
Starting tomorrow I will be on vacation.

620
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,120
Hold on.

621
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:50,980
There's some left.

622
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,730
What do you mean? It's almost gone.

623
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:11,560
Thank you.

624
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:19,390
Do you know how overseas adoptions took place in the 1980s?

625
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:25,650
Private adoption agencies sent away kids for $3000 each.

626
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,820
If they weren't an orphan, they'd get in trouble later so on the documents they were definitely all orphans.

627
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:35,210
Parents? Unknown.

628
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:41,470
But sometimes, there are unexpected mishaps due to God's pranks.

629
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:47,160
They already received the money but a child who was adopted gets sick.

630
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,960
For example, with something like pneumonia.

631
00:58:54,760 --> 00:59:00,140
If a child can't get on a plane due to pneumonia, they send a child named Lee Tae Yeong

632
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:05,160
with the same age and body size instead.

633
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:08,660
Under the name of Lee Jung Yeop.

634
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:33,550
Twenty. Nineteen.

635
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:37,650
Eighteen. Seventeen.

636
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,250
Hey.

637
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:41,850
Do you want a cup of coffee?

638
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,030
Why would I drink coffee in the middle of the night?

639
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:47,620
Coffee in the middle of the night is the best.

640
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,680
What is this?

641
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,520
Four. Three.

642
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:58,170
Two ... One.

643
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:10,650
What is this?

644
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:44,580
 A bird's eye view.

645
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:51,850
The expensive sneakers that the adoptive parents bought from England were tailored for Jung Yeop's feet.

646
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:56,020
They were too small for Tae Yeong.

647
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:59,260
He forced himself to wear them.

648
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:03,960
Every step he took hurt like hell.

649
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:08,990
And then he got on a plane to England.

650
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:13,720
That's my last memory of Korea.

651
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:27,570
Yes, this is UBS News station.

652
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:32,160
Who did you say you are?

653
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:42,020
Could you please say it again slowly?

654
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:44,780
You didn't understand?

655
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:46,920
Chimera.

656
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,640
I'm the Chimera.

657
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:57,030
I said I'm the Chimera!

658
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:06,980
Hello?

659
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:07,960
 Chairman.

660
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,010
Why are you calling so late?

661
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:12,040
There's been an accident. An explosion.

662
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,560
What?

663
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,720
What are you saying?!

664
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:23,570
The Shinseok construction site was blown up.

665
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:37,800
Thirty-five years ago, a child named Lee Tae Yeong, who lost his parents and his name, died.

666
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:44,160
And in 2019 the son of the dead returned...

667
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,540
under the name Lee Jung Yeop.

668
01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:04,180

669
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:26,340
 Chimera

670
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:29,850
 I want to know who the culprit is as much as you do.

671
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:31,120
 What do you want?

672
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,290
 Please let me help you, Detective Cha.

673
01:03:33,290 --> 01:03:35,270
 I asked if it was that day thirty-five years ago?

674
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:38,360
 Because people like me are not qualified to be your colleague.

675
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:39,740
 A copycat?

676
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:44,650
 So far, the Chimera has been thoroughly hiding. But this time it's different.

677
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:48,570
 Don't you want to reveal the identity of the chimera from thirty-five years ago with me?

678
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:51,060
 Does this mean that the next crime is planned?

679
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:55,800
 The head of the Seoryun Group, Seo Hyeon Tae.
