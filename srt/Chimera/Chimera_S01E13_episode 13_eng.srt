1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,940

2
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,320
 Chimera

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,110
 The characters, locations, incidents, religious sects, etc., in this drama are fiction and have no relation to reality.

4
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,920
Right now, people think that Lee Jung Yeop was taken because of the fake bomb.

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,330
But if anyone finds out, it will only be a bigger problem.

6
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,670
What the hell are they trying to do?

7
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,310
They're probably trying to protect themselves.

8
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,820
Protect?

9
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,680
From whom?

10
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,700
 Lee Seong Ho

11
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,590
Don't worry. The search party will be here soon.

12
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,320
 Episode 13

13
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,100
Why are they going out?

14
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,580
- What's going on? 
 - They said Lee Jung Yeop escaped.

15
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,530
Hey, pull out.

16
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,420
Let's move.

17
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,910
- Why? 
 - They said Lee Jung Yeop escaped.

18
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,940
He escaped.

19
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,620
I heard he had a bomb. What happened?

20
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,330
That's not possible.

21
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,350
We even had the EOD team search his body,

22
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,390
including his belongings, clothes, and shoes.

23
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,140
Where did he get the bomb from?

24
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,150
- We need to do some more investigation at the scene to know that—
 - Hey.

25
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,060
What if there's someone on the inside helping Lee Jung Yeop?

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,750
You take care of your team down there.

27
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,690
They could be doing something else when you are not watching.

28
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,070
Seonbaenim.

29
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:45,190
My team is not responsible for this incident.

30
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,350
What?

31
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,990
The case was officially taken over by the prosecution.

32
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,220
Isn't it their fault that the incident happened while they were escorting him?

33
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,360
They criticized and took the lead while we took the blame!

34
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,450
Are you going to just watch them act like gangsters and take this?

35
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,080
Who are they to take our case?

36
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,790
If Lee Jung Yeop had been in our custody from the beginning, this wouldn't have happened!

37
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,440
Please defer the disbanding of the investigation team.

38
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,760
The Chimera case isn't over yet.

39
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,730
Stop talking nonsense and get ready to go back to headquarters.

40
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:33,630
Seonbaenim! We did all the work and someone's taking over.

41
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,000
Are you going to just watch?

42
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,760
Please defer the disbandment.

43
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,110
 Police SWAT

44
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,370
 You're saying he suddenly came at you in the car?

45
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,130
 Yes.

46
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,500
With handcuffs on?

47
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,880
I think he got them off but it happened so fast.

48
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,460
There were no handcuffs in the car.

49
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,050
You think he left them in the car? I'm sure he threw them somewhere nearby.

50
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,300
And he stole your gun and ran away?

51
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,620
Yes.

52
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,800
There's a bus stop when you go down. Why would he take the mountain path?

53
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,040
He's probably trying to cover his tracks.

54
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,120
Did you two follow him right away?

55
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,600
Yes.

56
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,990
You're very brave.

57
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,690
You chased a felon with a gun, unarmed.

58
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,180
Why didn't you call for backup right away?

59
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,000
He stole our cell phones.

60
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,140
I caught up with him in the mountains but—

61
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,480
He ambushed you and attacked?

62
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,810
He had a bomb.

63
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,840
A lithium bomb.

64
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,910
Didn't you search him when he was at the detention center?

65
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,860
You said he stole your gun.

66
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,720
Why would he use a bomb and not the gun?

67
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,560
His trail disappeared.

68
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,760
Disappeared?

69
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,670
The dogs can't find his scent.

70
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,420
He would have gotten rid of his scent.

71
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,980
What?

72
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,580
He's an expert. He is a former Special Forces member.

73
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,670
 A suspect under investigation was being escorted by prosecutor investigators and escaped.

74
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,590
 It was revealed that Mr. Lee, who was being investigated for three murders,

75
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,600
 escaped from a convoy heading to the prosecutor's office around 10am today

76
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,510
 and fled into the mountains near Hwaju City.

77
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,100
I really don't even want to imagine this,

78
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,670
but doesn't this accident seem like it was something staged?

79
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,230
Geon Yeong, that doesn't make sense.

80
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,680
- Why would they? 
 - I don't know.

81
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,730
It's as if Lee Jung Yeop knows some big secret or something

82
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,220
and they're shutting him up.

83
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:48,450
I mean there's no black box from the convoy or CCTV footage nearby.

84
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,400
It seems like they searched for this place separately.

85
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,640
Don't you think so, Team Leader?

86
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:59,080
It's just a suspicion. Do you have any evidence?

87
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,030
And anyway, there's nothing we can do right now.

88
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,790
It's not our jurisdiction and we lost the power to investigate.

89
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,270
I can't eat because it's so messed up.

90
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,090
The disbandment of the investigation team will be delayed.

91
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,330
I've already talked about it with the chief.

92
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,770
The prosecutor's office is in charge of the investigation, but they're not going to go to the scene.

93
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:32,830
Police are bound to be mobilized for an escape in a criminal investigation.

94
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:37,590
But do you think the prosecutors will give us information?

95
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,880
Where is the situation room?

96
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,810
It's at the Hwaju Police Station,

97
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,860
but I think I'll be able to find one or two contacts there.

98
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,050
Let's start with getting information from the Hawju Station.

99
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,420
Let's quietly follow along and keep it between us.

100
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,330
Why are they here again? Damn it.

101
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,660
Detective Cha!

102
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,670
What happened? I heard he escaped.

103
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,000
Come.

104
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,420
That... it doesn't make sense.

105
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,750
The scene of the accident is strange, and the statements of the prosecutor's investigtors don't match.

106
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,200
Are they really prosecutors' investigators?

107
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,560
Did you check?

108
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,140
They aren't fake.

109
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,290
Did they do something to Lee Jung Yeop?

110
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,420
No. Rather it was the ivestigators who got hurt.

111
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,070
What were you doing?

112
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,250
- What? 
 - What were you doing when you just handed over the suspect?

113
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,550
And you just believed those guys?

114
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,400
Well, the prosecutors have the power to investigate and wanted to take over.

115
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,210
You should have held onto the case.

116
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,420
Are you a pushover? What are you going to do now?

117
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,100
What are you going to do if something happens to him?!

118
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,440
What's wrong?

119
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,250
That's what I'm wondering.

120
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,150
Did you hear the news?

121
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,710
They said he's an armed fugitive.

122
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,580
Are they sure he has a gun?

123
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,520
That's what it looks like for now.

124
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,850
I'm sure he knows that it'll make him more dangerous if he has a weapon.

125
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,910
Why would he take the gun?

126
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,410
I'm worried about that too.

127
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,180
Worst-case scenario, he could be killed.

128
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,080
There are other strange things.

129
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,640
The location of the discarded handcuffs is weird too.

130
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,910
They said they got into an accident while fighting in the convoy.

131
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,940
Then the driver or the passenger in the front seat should have gotten hurt.

132
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,980
They're perfectly fine.

133
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,550
It's also suspicious that the investigators followed him up the mountain.

134
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,990
And they reported it late.

135
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,100
Did he really escape?

136
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,400
What does he gain from escaping?

137
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,880
It's going too far without having a deliberate motive for it.

138
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,170
As soon as Lee Jung Yeop came here a bomb exploded.

139
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,890
It was fake but ...

140
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,000
Anyway, I don't know what kind of motive or purpose Lee Jung Yeop has

141
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,470
or why he brought a lithium bomb in the Bible,

142
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,740
but we need to find out.

143
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,500
I think it's better not to move hastily.

144
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,590
We still don't know who's involved.

145
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,810
I think we should be careful of the investigation team for the time being.

146
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,870
Let's wait for now.

147
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:56,340
If he's caught in an unfair situation or cornered, I'm sure he'll call us.

148
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:39,050
 Police

149
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,720
Signal fires are used to show your location.

150
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,400
He did it on purpose?

151
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,890
He must have used it as bait.

152
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:59,400
He lured the search team up so he could come down.

153
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,370
Where the hell is he trying to go?

154
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,380
You can't find him?

155
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,890
You can't find him?!

156
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,590
Is that what you're reporting to me right now?!

157
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,210
If you can't find him, set the mountain on fire!

158
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,070
I'll give you 24 hours, so figure it out before then!

159
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,740
Damn it!

160
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,690
I don't think he's there.

161
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,920
He's already fled.

162
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,230
They don't have the fighting spirit.

163
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,270
How many men did you have?  Couldn't one of them catch Lee Jung Yeop?

164
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,570
I told them not to let their guard down.

165
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,090
The gun was taken.  A cell phone was taken.

166
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,030
Jeez.

167
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,990
That could be a good thing.

168
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,390
Taking that cell phone

169
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,500
means that he is going to turn it on at some point.

170
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,470
Just wait and see.

171
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,980
Seung Gwan, is something wrong?

172
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,430
That man

173
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,900
is inhuman.

174
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,520
He is a ghost. A ghost.

175
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,070
Hey ...

176
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,000
Hey, hey, quit drinking.  Is this a time to be doing that?

177
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:04,480
Whether I die from drinking or from an explosion,

178
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,800
isn't it all the same thing?

179
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,240
He is the Chimera.

180
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,850
He killed Ju Seok and he killed Yong Bok.

181
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:17,320
Do you know why I am still alive?

182
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,780
I'm going to stop him and kill him.

183
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,600
What bullsh*t.

184
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,830
Look at the letter he sent me.

185
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,260
"Memento mori."

186
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,270
You are next!

187
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,930
Stop it!

188
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,140
You get so scared easily ...

189
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:44,350
Scared easily ...

190
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,780
Hyungnims,

191
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,790
have you seen a body burn to death?

192
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,300
Huh?

193
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,610
What about the smell?

194
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,730
Have you smelled it?

195
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,980
Hyungnims,

196
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:08,140
you shouldn't be so relaxed. Huh?

197
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,880
If I'm killed, who will be next?

198
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,830
Among you—

199
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,710
This bastard.  How can you be drunk!

200
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,610
That guy ...

201
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,100
do you think he doesn't know who the prosecutor was?

202
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,420
You bastard! Really, I should ...

203
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,620
Hyeon Tae.  Bring a bamboo sword.

204
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,570
It's been a while. Should we get your head straightened out?

205
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,960
Hey, hey, Min Gi.  Calm down.

206
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,160
You'll wake Hwa Jeong.

207
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,010
Hyungnim. Hyungnim.

208
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,120
Hyung Min Gi.

209
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,670
Hyung.

210
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:54,080
Do you really believe he is the real culprit?

211
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,490
Was Lee Sang Wu really the Chimera?

212
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,130
Or if not?

213
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,800
- What will you do? 
 - You bastard.

214
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,690
What is this crazy talk? You bastard!

215
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,330
Don't you remember?

216
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,690
At his house?

217
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,690
Neither gasoline nor a lighter, whatever,

218
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,370
nothing was found.

219
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,910
Huh?

220
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,600
Take a look at the evidence my men found recently.

221
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,410
It's incredible.

222
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:40,900
Such crimes are committed by a genius.

223
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,430
Not trash like Lee Sang Wu!

224
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,730
That guy, that guy knows!

225
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,670
Huh?

226
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,220
I'm sure.

227
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,420
He really knows.

228
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,400
I ... that ...

229
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,550
What? What is it?

230
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,190
I really didn't know he would die.

231
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,900
I was just going to discipline him.

232
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,890
I'm guilty of killing.

233
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,300
I'm guilty of killing.

234
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,900
I, I  committed the crime of killing.

235
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,800
Did you kill him?

236
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,050
Are you saying you killed Lee Sang Woo?

237
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,640
Tell me!

238
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:00,180
I did it! I did it!

239
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,710
I did it. I did it!

240
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,410
I did it!

241
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,030
 Breaking news 
 Serial murder suspect Lee Jung Yeop escaped.

242
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,670
 All Tickets

243
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,270
 Restroom 
 Toilet

244
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,380
 The gift was delivered.

245
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,220
Grandmother, what time is your bus?

246
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,590
 Unregistered phone number:  The gift has arrived.  Do you want to confirm it now?

247
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,640
 Unregistered phone number:  The gift has arrived.  Do you want to confirm it now?

248
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,690
 Hwaju  ↔ Goseok

249
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,740
 Hwaju ↔ Gangneung
 Hwaju ↔ Goseok

250
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,350
Did he really go to Gangwan Province?

251
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,130
Why did he turn his phone, which was off all along, on all of a sudden?

252
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,160
And why would be going to Gangwan Province? There's no reason.

253
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,020
Is it a strategy to lure us to another place?

254
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,690
Then, where is he really going?

255
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:13,450
Hey, Cha Jae Hwan. You tell us.

256
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:16,460
- What? 
 - You're close to him.

257
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,440
Yeah, you're not saying much today.

258
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:26,250
Close?  He's just my mom's physician.

259
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,230
When they feel threatened,

260
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,860
what do criminals do?

261
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:43,310
Return to the safest place and hide?

262
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,850
If it is a safe place, his home ground?

263
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,480
 1984 Chimera Serial Murder Case: Investigation Team 
  Prosecutor Lee Min Gi, → the current chairman of the National Assembly Judiciary Committee. President - Jang Woogeun

264
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,840
 Team Members: Kim Sung Kyu, Nam Woo Hyun, Kim Myung Soo, Jang Dong Woo, Bae Seung Gwan, Ham Yong Bok, Han Ju Seok, and others

265

 Taesam Chemical Employees - Lee Sang Wu (Suicide)  → Wife died 
 ↓Son

266
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,260
Seonbae.

267
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,370
Give me a second.

268
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,520
What's the matter with you?  Out of nowhere.

269
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:32,180
Seonbae, you have a lot of friends at the prosecutor's office.

270
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:36,240
Haven't you heard anything about the escape incident?

271
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,410
Well...

272
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:45,150
If you get me anything, I will support you in getting a correspondent position in LA.

273
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,390
All roads into Seoul are under surveillance.

274
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,950
What about train stations and bus terminals?

275
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,910
It's highly probable that he's at the Gangnam Terminal departing from Hwaju.

276
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,900
It's crowded so it is a good place to hide.

277
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,370
Detective Cho and Detective Lim are in charge of the East Seoul Terminal.

278
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,090
The rest of us are going to Gangnam.

279
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:08,950
There's a possibility that he is already here, so let's secure the CCTV footage.

280
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,160
Seonbae.

281
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,550
Make it short.  I have to go out now.

282
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:39,150
Do you know where the prosecution investigators who picked up Lee Jung Yeop are right now?

283
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,820
The Seoryun VIP rooms.

284
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,220
They were escorting a suspect and lost him.

285
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,330
He was taken away with the excuse he was going to be interrogated by the prosecutor's office.

286
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:53,440
Right now they are sitting in the VIP hospital room having a drinking party.

287
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,540
At a Seoryun Hospital, too.

288
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,650
You see it, right?

289
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,710
Whose work of art this incident is.

290
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:11,110
Even Chief Bae could not have done this alone.

291
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:16,220
This escape incident was fabricated by someone whom the police and prosecutor give a wide latitude of action.

292
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,110
You're talking about Seoryun, right?

293
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:23,270
When deporting of Lee Jung Yeop would have been enough, why would Seoryun go this far?

294
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:28,050
The Chimera incident of 35 years ago is not just a serial murder.

295
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,370
TH-5 is connected to it.

296
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:34,760
A fraudulent patent application using fabricated research results.

297
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,860
That is our guess.  There's no way to prove it.

298
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,460
No,

299
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,730
I think they not only killed Lee Sang Wu

300
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,840
but also Ryu Seong Hui too.

301
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,870
And right now, they are also trying to kill Lee Jung Yeop.

302
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,660
If you leave him on his own, he'll be in danger.

303
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,250
Why are you so worried about him all of a sudden?

304
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:21,770
You've always been overly interested in the chimera.  You also have far too much information

305
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,970
and your source is confidential.

306
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,300
There is something I don't know, right?

307
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,710
Do you have a personal grudge against Seoryun?

308
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,960
I do.

309
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,480
What's the reason?

310
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:48,690
I ... am a murderer's daughter.

311
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,140
What?

312
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:57,350
I am the daughter of Lee Sang Wu, who died 35 years ago.

313
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,660
What did you say?

314
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,230
That's right.

315
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,700
The person who is being hunted right now, Lee Jung Yeop, is my oppa   (older brother) .

316
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,900
That's ridiculous.

317
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:20,640
Lee Sang Wu only had one child.  The only son was Lee Tae Yeong.

318
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,600
Again and again, you're trying to fool me.

319
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:40,550
When Lee Sang Wu died, his wife was nearly ready to give birth.

320
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,660
How could she endure life

321
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:51,750
in the misery of the death of her husband and being pointed out as the family of a murderer?

322
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,900
She died from a pulmonary embolism.

323
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,150
People took her corpse to the hospital,

324
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,490
and the baby was resuscitated.

325
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,910
The doctors cut open the dead woman's body

326
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,200
and removed her infant.

327
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:18,140
Some say it was a miracle.

328
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,750
Others said it was grotesque.

329
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,120
As for me ...

330
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,290
on which side do you think I am?

331
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:49,430
The dad I have now, took the child born under such tenuous circumstances and raised me.

332
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,940
I didn't tell you about my dad, did I?

333
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,300
Kim Hyeong Guk,

334
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,680
my dead dad's best friend,

335
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,790
and his lawyer back then.

336
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,270
His lawyer?

337
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:11,070
The lawyer in the Chimera case 35 years ago?

338
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,790
 Hwaju Station

339
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:53,720
 Unknown number: The gift has arrived.  Will you confirm it now?

340
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,610

 Hangrim Small Theater 
 Richard Kimble's Small Gift

343
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,990
Richard Kimble?

344
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,000
Richard Kimble.

345
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,790
 Investigator Eugene

346
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,710
Yes, Investigator.

347
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,640
Theater ticket?

348
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,590
Who sent it?

349
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:44,240
Richard Kimble.

350
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,250
Who?

351
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:50,000
Haven't you seen the movie, "The Fugitive"? The one with Harrison Ford?

352
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,940
His character's name in the movie is "Richard Kimble."

353
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,720
A doctor who is falsely accused and hunted.

354
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,480
What time? Where is the show?

355
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,710
 Police

356
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:12,210
Detective Cha, let me go with you.

357
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:18,820
Reporter Kim, please wait. There will be a moment when I will need your help.

358
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:23,240
Right now, we don't even know where the enemy is. If we move together, we are all exposed.

359
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,040
Please don't worry. I will bring him back.  Safely.

360
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,970
What if you can't?

361
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:39,380
If you fail and something happens to him?

362
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:44,200
Your brother is not the only one

363
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,870
fighting for his life.

364
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:57,190
Trust me. It's different from 35 years ago.

365
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:05,630
Only if the Chimera is caught,

366
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,070
and you are the one to catch him, will I then feel like it is true.

367
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,170
 "Autumn Day Scenery"/ 2019-10-04, 19:00/Hangrim Small Theater

368
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,830
What's going on? Why are you here?

369
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:52,860
Mom, He is strange.  He's being chased by a creditor.

370
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:57,100
Hey, in this world, is there anyone who doesn't have a story?

371
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,920
Even so, he gets along just fine with Lee Yeong.

372
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,440
You don't even talk to Ji Yeong.

373
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,750
Anyway, if that quack doctor gets caught by me, he's dead. I'll just—

374
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,810
Leave it alone. Isn't he a doctor?

375
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:10,610
It's a relief it's a misdiagnosis.

376
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:13,030
I have an upset stomach and indigestion,

377
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,620
because you eat ramyeon day in and day out. You shouldn't do that.

378
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:19,760
If you cooked me a delicious meal, I wouldn't have gone out to eat.

379
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:49,150
Running around and hanging out in some random neighborhood, you brat!

380
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,170
Are you okay?

381
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,610
I will be okay, right?

382
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:08,130
When they threatened to have you deported, why didn't you just leave?

383
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:11,430
If you had left, they wouldn't have gone this far.

384
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,390
Should I have?

385
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,770
But I had to be sure.

386
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:25,040
That they are going so far means I am getting closer to the truth.

387
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,490
What's so important about the truth?

388
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,670
What's so important about the past?

389
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,110
Is it more important than your life or your future?

390
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,790
Just leave Korea.

391
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:43,760
There are many people who forget everything and move on.

392
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,500
I tried that.

393
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:53,630
I ran away.  To the hospital.  To the battlefield.

394
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,870
But that didn't work.

395
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,180
Now I can't stop.

396
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,710
I have no choice but to see the end of this.

397
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:12,910
Miss Eugene.  Have you made a lot of mistakes?

398
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:15,650
You said you were chased out because you made a mistake.

399
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:19,200
Help me atone for it.

400
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:23,510
So that a wrongly accused person doesn't die right in front of my eyes again.

401
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,260
Let's talk.

402
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,280
Accept help.  It's too hard to do it alone.

403
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,200
I came alone.

404
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,880
Let's talk.

405
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:49,030
What are you going to do? What can you do alone?

406
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:51,250
Please trust me.

407
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:57,540
If you go like this, you will get hurt.

408
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:08,060
Everyone I meet dies, and now they are trying to kill me.

409
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:14,020
From now on, it's my problem.

410
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:17,740
- Why is that your problem? 
 - Detective Cha!

411
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,360
You were using me, right?

412
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,030
At the detention center, then,

413
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,400
and going so far as to use my anxiety about my mother,

414
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,820
did you plan on weakening my resolve from the beginning?

415
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,950
Did you do that intentionally to make me bring you your Bible?

416
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,490
Shoot.

417
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,030
I said to shoot.

418
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,040
You don't trust me anyway.

419
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,370
I said to shoot!

420
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,870
Don't test me.

421
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:31,010
Have you eaten?

422
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,900
Mom.

423
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,160
Come in.

424
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,450
Come on in.

425
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,160
Leave your shoes here.

426
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,640
The room is a bit ...

427
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:25,130
All Koreans live like this.

428
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,940
Now, let's see.

429
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,400
 Certificate of Merit

430
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,700
All right.  Try this.

431
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,090
This should fit.  Put this on.

432
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,740
And,

433
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,210
don't be apologetic.

434
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,430
Quickly change and come out.

435
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,140
Go and take a seat.

436
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,330
We've met before, right?

437
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:35,660
Did I?  Me?

438
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:39,740
Yes, I think I gave you directions at Hanmyeong University.

439
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,820
Right?

440
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:46,010
Well.  I've never been there.

441
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:49,240
You must have seen someone who looks like me.

442
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,750
I think I am correct.

443
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,960
Why would I ever visit a university?

444
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:35,780
It's not bad, so eat a lot.

445
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,700
Thank you.  It's very delicious.

446
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:47,320
But it hasn't rained. Is there a water leak in your house?

447
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,800
- On the ceiling... The-the bathroom in the apartment above is— Anyway... 
 - What?

448
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,780
The floor became a sea of water at his house.

449
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,860
Oh no...

450
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,780
He will leave after a few days.

451
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:14,370
Make yourself at home. Don't worry about us.

452
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:15,290
I'm sorry.

453
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:17,500
No need to be sorry.

454
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:27,030
But, you two look so good together.

455
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,290
- No. Not at all. 
 - What?

456
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:42,030
Not at all.  It's not so, Mother.

457
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:45,360
That's being very rude to the lady.

458
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,940
Why?

459
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:52,520
Eugene, he's not at all your type, right?

460
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,120
What?

461
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,450
I don't know.

462
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:03,660
Mom, she has such high standards.

463
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:16,050
But Miss, are you a police officer working with my Hwan?

464
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:25,560
I'm not a police officer.  I'm a dispatcher.

465
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,360
Is that so?

466
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:31,290
As long as you're not a police officer.

467
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,690
I'm glad I didn't say anything wrong.

468
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,310
- Mother. 
 - Hm?

469
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:49,050
- Eat, Mother. 
 - I will.

470
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:51,150
- Eat a lot. 
 - Thank you.

471
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,650
Head back home now.

472
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,990
I'll take you as far as there.

473
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,690
Earlier, that gun ...

474
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:10,350
Oh, yes.  I took out the bullets.

475
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:12,710
Just in case there is an accident.

476
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:19,070
But will it be all right?

477
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:24,670
For now, I will keep him at my home, but who knows when he'll run off or to where.

478
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,810
Umm, Investigator.

479
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,890
Lee Jung Yeop ...

480
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:37,980
Are you saying he is Reporter Kim Hyo Gyeong's real brother?

481
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:46,360
No wonder. I thought her interest in chimera was excessive.

482
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:52,130
Should I tell Lee Jung Yeop?

483
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,250
I'm sure he will try to meet her immediately.

484
00:48:56,250 --> 00:49:00,540
So for the time being I think it's better not to tell him until he is safe.

485
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:11,430
Is this what happens when you look for your family?

486
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:33,170
Is it okay to treat a guest like this?

487
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,980
When you lose at rock-paper-scissors, accept it like a man.

488
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,450
Let's play another game. If I'm not in this bed—

489
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:42,110
Forget it.  I don't want to.

490
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:58,940
They bought off the prosecution and controlled the media in order to instigate a murder.

491
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:02,380
Why are the Seoryun people going this far?

492
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,650
There must be something they really fear.

493
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:10,860
He seemed like a good person.

494
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:13,730
- Who? 
 - Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae.

495
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:15,230
I had a drink with him before.

496
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:16,630
- You drank with him? 
 - Yes.

497
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:19,760
- Just the two of you? 
 - Yes.

498
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:26,220
Be careful. I think he was trying to get information out of you while drinking.

499
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,310
What do you take me for?

500
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:31,790
I didn't say much.

501
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:36,170
He only asked about my mom and was concerned about me.

502
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:41,010
Don't be fooled.

503
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:46,530
Those people aren't the type who drink and open their hearts.

504
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:51,170
Come to think of it you are a bit clueless—

505
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:55,250
How should I say it? You are a bit naive.

506
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:58,960
Later, you will be the only one hurt.

507
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:05,350
Of course.  I'm Korea's best pushover.

508
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:09,480
I'm giving a fugitive a place to sleep. If I get caught, I'll be done for.

509
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:14,430
If you get caught, just say you caught me. Thanks to me, you'll make it to the top.

510
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:16,570
I should.

511
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:30,930
I have something I want to ask you.

512
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:32,610
What is it?

513
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:37,250
How would you feel if you had a sibling?

514
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:40,170
What?  Out of the blue?

515
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:44,340
You know everything about my family.  Let's be fair.

516
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:48,310
I have a younger sibling.

517
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,680
A younger sister?

518
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,690
No, a younger brother.

519
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:59,570
He's full of love so he is a social worker.

520
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:04,040
Because he is a pacifist, he hated it so much when I said I was enlisting.

521
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:06,980
But why did you go into the army?

522
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:11,270
I can't say. Did I want to look good to my dad?

523
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:13,910
I mean wasn't going to medical school good enough?

524
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:19,990
If you were in Korea, your parents would be so pleased they would carry you on their backs.

525
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,750
I don't know why they pushed me so hard.

526
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,450
I was wondering...

527
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:39,350
How would you feel if a family member you thought was dead were alive?

528
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,940
What did you say?

529
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:47,470
Just wondering how would you feel if a family member you thought was dead were alive?

530
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:52,230
Detective Cha, what if your family member whom you thought was dead was alive?

531
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,960
I'm not talking about me.

532
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,360
It's weird, right? The question is weird.

533
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:02,550
You shouldn't be asking that question.

534
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:09,210
Go to sleep. Turn off the light.

535
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:13,360
You're so cranky.

536
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:59,950
 Don't go anywhere! Just stay at home.

537
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:03,890
 I'm going to get rid of your false accusation.

538
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,220
Are you okay?

539
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:44,740
I have to take bus 19 but I'm late.

540
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,940
Are you going somewhere?

541
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,850
I'm going to school.

542
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:51,030
Sch-school?

543
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:53,730
Hanmyeong University.

544
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,880
Hanmyeong University?

545
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:59,510
I have to leave Da Som alone. It's late.

546
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:01,940
Da Som?

547
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:08,000
Take care!

548
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:06,200
 1984

549
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:12,960
 Macheon Police Station.  Han Ju Seok

550
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:29,060
  Voice of Young Han Ju Seok

551
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:32,040
 June 15.   It's her.

552
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:36,080
 It's her. It's definitely Ryu Seong Hui.

553
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:40,860
 It's not a dream.  I saw her.

554
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,840
 Why was she there, of all places?

555
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:49,320
 At the scene of a brutal and vicious murder.

556
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,910
 June 23rd

557
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:57,340
 Should I believe what the neighborhood thugs are saying?

558
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:02,040
 It was a woman who bought an oxygen tank. Witnesses also said that.

559
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:07,950
 It was a woman who was hanging around  in the area the night before.

560
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:14,290
 June 30, 1984

561
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:19,560
 July 21st

562
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:24,310
 Lee Sang Wu.  Is he really the Chimera?

563
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:30,090
  He says he is innocent. I hope I'm not making a mistake.

564
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:34,270
 July 25th

565
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:37,210
 Lee Sang Wu's son keeps coming to see me.

566
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:39,450
 A seven-year-old in the winter.

567
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:42,810
 He begs me to let him see his dad just once.

568
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:46,410
 I can't look at him because I feel bad for him.

569
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,440
 July 29th

570
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,910
 I keep thinking I am complacent.

571
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:59,110
 I think we arrested an upright person.

572
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:04,120
 The newspaper articles are all out and the pressure from superiors is heavy.

573
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:08,850
 Hyung Seung Gwan is so worried he can't sleep.

574
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:16,650
 August 8th

575
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:18,720
 In the end ...

576
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,650
 Hyung Seung Gwan caused a big problem.

577
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:24,370
 Although Yong Bok said he will take the blame for everyone,

578
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:28,850
 what about the crime of killing a person?

579
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:37,540
 August 20th

580
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,840
 My belief was right.

581
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,410
 She didn't die.

582
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:47,780
 Although I wanted to sit because my legs were shaking so much, I followed her.

583
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:59,930
 I stepped into her place without her permission.

584
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:02,380
 I shouldn't have done that.

585
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,850
 I shouldn't have looked at it.

586
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:07,300
 The evidence of her crime.

587
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,300
 Who will bear the burden of this crime?

588
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:18,440
 How could there be a fire-breathing demon inside a pitiful woman?

589
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:23,890
 Is she really the murderer who brutally killed three people?

590
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:30,110
 Even though all the evidence points to her, I can't accept it.

591
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:31,880
 Why on earth

592
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:36,920
 did she kill the researchers at Hanmyeong University in such a horrible fashion?

593
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:22,900
 September 1st

594
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,800
 Who can condemn her?

595
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:31,630
 She is not the starting point of all the crimes.

596
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,850
 Voice of elderly Han Ju Seok

597
01:00:56,850 --> 01:01:01,450
 Cha Eun Su is her new name.

598
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:08,250
 Chimera now will disappear forever along with her name Ryu Seong Hui.

599
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:26,330
 Lee Sang Wu is innocent. He is innocent.

600
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:32,620
 We killed an innocent person.

601
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,390
 Let's keep this a secret forever. Let's not regret it.

602
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:47,650
 I will always protect Seong Hui and the unborn child in her womb.

603
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,070
Lee Jung Yeop.

604
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:06,500
What's the matter?

605
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,540
No. No. Chi ...

606
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:41,940

607
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:47,030
♫  Some people want to live  ♫

608
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:50,730
♫  But turn their back on me  ♫

609
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:56,300
♫  The time I lived as myself, not me  ♫

610
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,580
♫  Some people say to me  ♫

611
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:02,720
 Chimera

612
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:06,540
 Someone fabricated this escape incident to kill Lee Jung Yeop.

613
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:10,320
 I've been waiting for 35 years. Do you think I can't wait a few days?

614
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,500
 It's been three days since Chimera sent the glitter bomb warning.

615
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:16,400
 I'm right. That person ordered it.

616
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,300
 Why is he still alive?  Are you sure about this?

617
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:20,980
 What should I do?

618
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:24,790
 - Whom should I trust? 
 - Cha Jae Hwan.

619
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:28,380
 Just what the hell is Seo Hyeon Tae really scared of?

620
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:29,540
 Chief.

621
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,610
 Get out!
