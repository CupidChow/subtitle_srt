1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,030

2
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,350
 Chimera

3
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,920
 The characters, locations, incidents, religious sects, etc. in this drama are fiction and have no relation to reality.

4
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,240
I'm throwing it on the count of three.

5
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,810
One.

6
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,050
Two!

7
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,950
  Oh. Oh. What is he doing?

8
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,150
Hey, hey, run.

9
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,030
Run.

10
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:21,510
 Episode 6

11
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:29,520
The 1984 Macheon serial bombings, otherwise known as Chimera.

12
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,640
Three were killed in unidentified fatal blasts, and they were all part of the same university research team.

13
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,990
The suspect was arrested a month later but committed suicide during the investigation.

14
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,160
That's all the information we have.

15
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,390
Sam? Sam?

16
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,160
 I'm listening.

17
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,340
It's happening all over again.

18
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,200
Do you think it's a copycat?

19
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,160
 You said you had a suspect. The doctor.

20
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:11,120
Well, we don't have a motive. And he was also seven back in 1984.

21
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,590
 A seven year-old serial killer?

22
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,250
 Sounds like an interesting book title.

23
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,580
I'm serious, Sam.

24
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:26,460
 John Venables, Robert Thompson in the Bulger case,

25
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:31,560
 A two-year-old victim was dragged to the train tracks and brutally beaten to death. Just for fun.

26
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,790
 The perpetrators were only ten at the time.

27
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,420
So keep all possibilities open, right?

28
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,900
 You look excited?

29
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,860
 Is everything okay?

30
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,250
- The book or work? 
  - Both.

31
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,550
It's alright.

32
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,190
Well, how are the people there?

33
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,490
Definitely interesting.

34
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,960
I'm trying to see and not read them.

35
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:13,220
Well, I hope you get to meet them, not just see them.

36
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,490
Yeah.

37
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,690
  Can you help me?

38
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,300
  Don't lose me. That's all you have to do.

39
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,210
  Detective Lee Geon Yeong 
 Central Police Agency Inspector Kim Gyeong Gam

40
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,270
 Detective Cha Jae Hwan

41
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:35,040
 Calling Detective Cha Jae Hwan

42
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,620
  Calling... Detective Cha Jae Hwan

43
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,950
 Can you promise me one thing?

44
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,510
 That you will keep our conversation private?

45
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,390
 Calling Detective Cha Jae Hwan

46
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,420
 Sometimes, other than the facts,  look at the person.

47
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,290
 Don't do it.

48
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,070
 You should have focused on what I am.

49
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,350
 You just saw the facts.

50
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,760
 You're not me.

51
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,430
 No.

52
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,460
 Don't do it.

53
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,540
 Calling Detective Cha Jae Hwan

54
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,020
Are you awake?

55
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,840
Are you dizzy or feeling nauseous?

56
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,520
- Where... 
 - You're in the hospital.

57
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,020
Do you not remember coming here?

58
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,560
How did I get here?

59
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,920
Last night, the ambulance brought you and your companion.

60
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,630
- Companion? 
 - Yes. That tall person.

61
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:27,280
That person did all of the treatments beforehand and even stitched you up by himself.

62
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,890
He did a really good job.

63
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,490
What hospital is he from?

64
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,620
- What about that person? 
 - He left a while ago.

65
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,430
Damn.

66
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,420
You can't move around yet.

67
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:53,300
There is a possibility of delayed bleeding due to shock. That person even arranged a CT scan for you before leaving.

68
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,160
 Missed calls from Investigator Eugene (5)

69
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:27,910
 Detective Cha Jae Hwan

70
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,950
 Detective Cha Jae Hwan

71
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:39,420
 Gyeong Po Hospital

72
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,440
Why did you go in alone without asking for any backup?

73
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,370
There wasn't enough time for all of that.

74
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,590
Even so, the Korean police force probably has a field protocol, right?

75
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,730
While we're on this topic, please don't mention this to

76
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,500
the head of the investigation team and the others at headquarters.

77
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,470
So you didn't even get prior permission?

78
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,930
Jesus.

79
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,170
Investigator, Investigator... Ah, my head.

80
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,940
I only need to identify one person. I'll just verify his identity.

81
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,130
Whoever Lee Jung Yeop is chasing has nothing to do with the direction of our investigation.

82
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,610
We're looking for the serial killer who murdered Son Wan Gi and Han Ju Seok.

83
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,340
Think about it. All of the people that Lee Jung Yeop pursued are dead.

84
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,780
What if that person last night was his next target?

85
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,560
It's just a hunch without any objective evidence.

86
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,710
Sometimes the right thing to do is just trust your gut.

87
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,300
Do you know how dangerous that way of thinking is?

88
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:09,530
Investigator, can you just trust me this once?

89
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,960
Lee Jung Yeop was adopted in 1984.

90
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,720
There are too many coincidences and odd things going on.

91
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,530
Here's what I think.

92
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,590
The Chimera incident from 35 years ago is the root of what is happening now.

93
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:31,360
Otherwise, how could the same thing happen again after 35 years?

94
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,920
There were dozens of reports yesterday.

95
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,860
People asking if there was an earthquake at dawn.

96
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,850
Well, there was a bit of a commotion.

97
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,800
Did something explode? There are no burn marks or anything.

98
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,360
It's as if it were the work of a ghost or something.

99
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,020
Hey miss! You can't come into a place like this!

100
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,620
No, no. That person...

101
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,460
Stay back. You can't inhale this.

102
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,910
It's a mixture of chlorine and brake fluid.

103
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,190
Chlorine explosions produce gas.

104
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,370
You shouldn't inhale it or let it come into contact with your skin.

105
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,150
It can cause damage to the respiratory tract, and in extreme cases, can even lead to death.

106
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:50,620
So what that means is you mix pool disinfectant with brake fluid to make an explosive material.

107
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,260
According to our profiler.

108
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,540
Profiler?

109
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,500
The Investigation Headquarters are doing all kinds of things nowadays.

110
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:19,830
Oh, right. Detective Paeng. The kids that came here yesterday. Can you tell me where they live?

111
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,660
I don't know.

112
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,910
The kids here have no traceable genealogies. No one asks questions as long as you do what you need to do and get on a boat.

113
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,090
 Gyeongpo Logistic

 Gyeongpo Logistic

115
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,050
What does that company do?

116
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,830
 Hajin Apartment Building 210, Room 603 
 Ham Yong Bok

117
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,190
Honey! If you're not drinking the beer now, I'm putting it in the fridge!

118
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,140
Oh? Who is it?

119
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,240
Who is it?

120
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,270
Who are you?

121
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,640
Honey...

122
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,850
What are you doing? Honey!

123
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:39,120
What, what?

124
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,290
Let me go!

125
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,530
Let go! Let go!

126
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,630
You remember the name Lee Sang Wu right?

127
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,350
Don't you remember?

128
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,060
Who are you?

129
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,620
I-I don't know anything.

130
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,690
A worker laid off by Taesam Chemical.

131
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:22,130
The person you identified and captured as the culprit of the Chimera case in July 1984.

132
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,560
You thought he was the criminal without any proof.

133
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,460
Without proof?

134
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,740
I thought you didn't know him.

135
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,510
What's it to you?

136
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,170
What are you to ask me these questions?

137
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,370
How did Lee Sang Wu die?

138
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:48,390
How do you think he died? It was already reported in the newspapers and the whole world knows.

139
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,370
Why are you bothering me about this?

140
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,020
It wasn't suicide, was it?

141
00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:00,690
What happened on August 8th, 1984, the day that Lee Seong Wu died?

142
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,170
You know, right?

143
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,650
Because you were the one on duty that day.

144
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,090
Did you kill him?

145
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,720
I asked if you killed him.

146
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:33,160
I have no idea what you're talking about.

147
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,620
You got the wrong address, man.

148
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,170
Go to the police station if you need to find someone.

149
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:43,360
What happens if you catch the wrong person like this?

150
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,170
Geez, I can't believe what just happened, damn it.

151
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,820
Are you trying to blackmail an innocent citizen?

152
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,420
Do you want to eat rice with beans  (jail food) ?

153
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,960
Come and find me one more time. I'll report you for stalking.

- Where are you going? 
 - I'm going to eat ramyeon.

164
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,370
 Kim Hyeong Guk Law Firm

165
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:25,010
I will never give you money, okay?

166
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:29,330
I mean, she's the one who left our home. What could she say?

167
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,510
Isn't that so, Lawyer?

168
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,800
Yes, it is.

169
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,920
But sir, she still has to raise the children, doesn't she need money?

170
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,690
No...

171
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,800
Don't mind that. Let's keep going.

172
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,530
Ah.

173
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,930
No...

174
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:10,740
She's the one who left the home. Why is she asking for money?

175
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:16,520
Besides, why does she need as much as 500,000 won (appx $500) to raise two kids?

176
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,320
Women have no idea what money is worth. Geez...

177
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,920
I don't know why she takes the kids to the hospital so often...

178
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,930
In my day, we used to pull teeth out at home.

179
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,200
You need more money than that to raise kids these days.

180
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,970
Child support? Who knows? She could've spent it, doing nothing at all!

181
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,780
Just give it to her...

182
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,320
- What? 
- It's child support. Nothing more.

183
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,590
- Or you try to raise kids with 500,000 won. 
 - Hyo Gyeong.

184
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:51,670
Hey, why are you interrupting? You're too young to know, b****!

185
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,570
I'm saying don't be like that over money for kids' food and clothes.

186
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,140
She's not asking for 5 million or 50 million won. It's at most 500,000 won.

187
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,410
- What? 
 - Are they someone else's kids?

188
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,640
- Are they not your kids? 
 - Hyo Gyeong, you...

189
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,250
Hey! Are you crazy?

190
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,430
Let's meet another time. Next time.

191
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:10,690
- What a crazy nut! S***... 
 - My apologies. I'm sorry.

192
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,560
- What a crazy nut! 
 - My apologies.

193
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,180
Yes, sir. Bye now.

194
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,600
What's with you again?

195
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,990
Dad, why do you listen to people like that?

196
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,520
He's saying that because he's upset, too.

197
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,890
He's upset, so he's refusing to pay child support?

198
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,490
The foreign car parked out there. Isn't it his?

199
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:43,450
You just don't know. When someone abandons them, men are the ones who are destroyed.

200
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:48,130
He should've been better then. I can tell right away why his wife left him.

201
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,140
You shouldn't say stuff like that.

202
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,730
Gosh, I'm hungry.

203
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,260
Make me some ramen, Dad. Make it very spicy.

204
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,950
Why eat ramen again? You should eat a proper meal.

205
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,830
I guess something's not working out. You're asking for spicy food.

206
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:17,120
I'm getting poor reactions compared to how much effort I put in.

207
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,420
I'm sure working in media isn't easy.

208
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,090
Well, I didn't start this wanting to get reactions in the beginning.

209
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,530
What kind of story is it this time?

210
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,350
Chimera.

211
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:38,490
It was an incident from 1984. You must've been young then.

212
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,370
It must've been around the time you set up your office.

213
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:46,220
Was it? I don't really remember...

214
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,630
That's the personnel record from the Capitol building.

215
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,560
Ham Yong Bok.

216
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,260
Mr. Ham was really a former cop.

217
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:11,060
People in this field are no different than thugs once they leave service.

218
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:14,100
He was working until 1984.

219
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,740
He worked at Macheon Police Station in Gyeonggi-do.

220
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,020
He was dismissed.

221
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:27,440
 Reason for leaving: Dismissed  
 Yes. It says the reason for dismissal was negligent management.

222
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,880
Detective Paeng, you don't get dismissed over stuff like this, right?

223
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,550
I'm not sure. You'll have to ask for specifics at the station where he worked.

224
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,870
 Macheon Police Station

225
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,940
Did you find anything?

226
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,920
Yes, this...

227
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,260
 Macheon City, Gyeonggi-do, serial arson murder cases, July 1984

228
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,890
 Investigation Daily Journal: Written by Han Ju Seok

229
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,170
 Investigation Daily Journal: Written by Han Ju Seok

230
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,450
- And this is the daily journal from the investigation headquarters 
 - Ah, okay.

231
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,400
It was a pretty big case. Is this everything for the case material?

232
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,280
When typhoon Rusa occurred back in 2002, a lot of data was destroyed then.

233
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,900
But it's pretty miraculous that even this remains.

234
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,670
- All right then. Take a look. 
 - Thank you.

235
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,150
Sure.

236
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:30,770
Oh? July 21st.

237
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,770
Suspect Lee Sang Wu was arrested without a warrant.

238
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,620
August 8th, suspect Lee Sang Wu commits suicide.

239
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,790
It's suspected that he killed himself by hanging himself with a belt inside the cell.

240
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,430
There's no autopsy report. Only his death certificate is here.

241
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,930
 Death Certificate

242
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,330
The cause of death is asphyxiation from compression of the neck.

243
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,330
Why didn't they do an autopsy?

244
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:05,320
They didn't do an autopsy and rushed the funeral?

245
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,090
 I regret what happened so much... I couldn't sleep...

246
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,000
- It's his suicide note.
 - Yes.

247
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,510
 I regret what happened so much... I couldn't sleep...

248
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,590
What's this?

249
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,360
What?

250
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,840
I'll take some pictures.

251
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,800
Let's see...

252
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,480
June 16th. The announcement by the investigation headquarters.

253
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,760
The person in charge of the investigation, Prosecutor Lee Min Gi of the Public Security Department of the Central District Prosecutor's Office.

254
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,770
- Public Security Department?
 - During the military regime in the past, the Public Security Department was responsible for

255
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:50,560
imprisoning political criminals or those who were anti-establishment.

256
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,800
- Is Chimera a political case? 
 - It was an explosion, so

257
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,800
there was a rumor that said Chimera was a North Korean spy.

258
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:01,340
Gosh, it's more complicated than I thought.

259
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:09,660
June 25th, report received. Start investigation.

260
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:13,760
That's too quick. As if cramming for an exam.

261
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,430
- When was he arrested? 
 - On the 21st.

262
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,330
July 21st... 21st...

263
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,400
A suspect was arrested without warrants.

264
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,070
Arrest team were Ham Yong Bok, Han Ju Seok, Bae...

265
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,160
- Huh? 
 - What is it?

266
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:40,970
Ham Yong Bok, Han Ju Seok, Bae Seung Gwan.

267
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,420
Bae Seung Gwan?

268
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,100
Who is it? Do you know him?

269
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,510
He's our station's chief.

270
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,660
I'm a busy man. You can't just tell me to meet you whenever you want.

271
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,060
What is it that you couldn't tell me over the phone?

272
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:10,310
Hyeongnim, I almost died yesterday.

273
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,410
What?

274
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,980
This guy came to my store.

275
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,730
Chimera–

276
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:27,070
He was throwing a fit and brought up that dead guy Lee Sang Wu.

277
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,560
- Who? 
 - Listen to me.

278
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,260
So I was lying low,

279
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,840
- but that guy came looking for me at my home today. 
  - How did he know where you live?

280
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:44,730
I don't know how he found out, but he found me out of nowhere and was ready to kill me.

281
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:49,430
So? What did he say?

282
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,430
He asked...

283
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,460
"Didn't you kill Lee Sang Wu?"

284
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:02,470
- So what did you say?
 - What else?

285
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:06,610
I denied it and took off.

286
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:10,450
So, where did he go?

287
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,140
Where's he from? What does he do? Did you follow him?

288
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:19,930
Aigoo, give me a break! When could I have done that? I'm telling you I almost died!

289
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:28,660
But Hyungnim, he's unusual.

290
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,170
He carries explosives. Explosives.

291
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,870
- Explosives?
 - Both Han Ju Seok and Reporter Son

292
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,380
died in the fire, right?

293
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,970
He must've done it. I'm sure of it.

294
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:48,330
He was tall and slender with a pale face.

295
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:52,330
My gosh, he was so scary.

296
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:56,130
Hyeongnim, do you know him by any chance?

297
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:00,160
How would I know him? You didn't ramble nonsense while scared, did you?

298
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,840
Aigoo! I didn't even open my mouth!

299
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,790
I won't ever say anything even if there's a knife at my throat.

300
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:20,010
Hyeongnim, don't worry.

301
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:25,900
I told you, I'll be blamed for everything that happened that day.

302
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,930
 You commie, who are you trying to screw?

303
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:58,410
 You killed three people, and you deny it?

304
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,880
 35 years earlier

305
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:11,950
Hey, you a**hole, can't you even take dictation?

306
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,430
Is it that hard?

307
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:18,060
Let's see who wins between you and me, a**hole!

308
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,990
You vicious a**...

309
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:45,520
How about it? Did you come to your senses now?

310
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,240
Is he faking it? Sh*t...

311
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,810
Hey!

312
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,460
Hey.

313
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,190
Hey, wake up, man!

314
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,390
Hey! Wake up...

315
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,590
Damn it, wake up, a**hole!

316
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:26,430
Wake up! Wake up!

317
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:40,980
Hyeongnim, you know the widows at the park out front?

318
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,970
Their hips are just so awesome.

319
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,190
Hyeong Seung Gwan.

320
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,720
Hyeong, what's wrong with him?

321
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,350
What's wrong with him?

322
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,030
 The present

323
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,160
Ham Yong Bok?

324
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:10,010
Yes, he worked under me during the Chimera case thirty-five years ago.

325
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:14,750
I know Detective Ham. He got fired then.

326
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,280
Is he still in Korea?

327
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,860
I'm sure I told you to send him off somewhere.

328
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,810
And?

329
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,000
Actually, someone went to visit Yong Bok yesterday.

330
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,780
Who?

331
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:33,100
He was asking Yong Bok if he killed Lee Sang Wu.

332
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,740
Who's the guy who came to see him?

333
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,920
I don't know who it was, but he sounds unusual.

334
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,930
I heard he uses explosives.

335
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,920
What? Explosives?

336
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,950
What are you saying? It's not like we're in the States.

337
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:50,030
Hey, he's a terrorist if he uses explosives.

338
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,990
We shouldn't be here like this. You should think about how to bring him in and beat him up.

339
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:04,500
But what if he's connected to the incident from 35 years ago?

340
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,470
What if we bring him in for nothing and he starts to ramble?

341
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,350
Saying Lee Sang Wu didn't commit suicide.

342
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:16,780
That he died while being tortured. What if he says that?

343
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:27,190
The prosecutor in charge of that case, Lee Min Gi. How can you guarantee that he won't name you?

344
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:31,340
After all this time? There's no proof that he died because of the torture.

345
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:36,110
Don't you get the ways of the world? When things become an issue, it beats having proof.

346
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,160
What will you do if things get noisier?

347
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,230
What else? The one who is at fault should step up.

348
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,830
Wait, Hyeongnim, you mean...

349
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:51,540
It's true that Yong Bok did kill a commie.

350
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:56,410
That idiot couldn't even get a confession out of him and messed around.

351
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,860
How could he not get one thing right? Huh?

352
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:04,520
We should've made him take complete responsibility and serve a sentence back then.

353
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,370
We shouldn't have pointlessly covered it up.

354
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,600
It's because you were protective of him for no reason then!

355
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,990
Covering up for that loser saying he's your hoobae*  (junior).

356
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:25,420
Let's set the record straight, Hyeongnim. Why did that incident turn out that way?

357
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,750
What?

358
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:32,280
Do you think we did that all for nothing on our own accord?

359
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,450
We did all that for your sake, Hyeongnim.

360
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,560
What?

361
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,490
If only you hadn't cornered us so unreasonably like that,

362
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:44,020
we would've never done what we did in the midst of all that mess!

363
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,180
Are you saying I should be grateful?

364
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,780
Did I tell you to kill a man?

365
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,770
Min Gi!

366
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:58,110
Honey, are you okay?

367
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,470
Don't worry about me. Go ahead and talk.

368
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,750
I'll ask Ajumma to clean this up later.

369
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,500
Does it hurt a lot?

370
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,680
Should we leave?

371
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,610
I'm okay.

372
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:39,660
I'm just confused. I don't know what's going on.

373
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:45,640
I wonder why the hell Lee Jung Yeop is chasing after the detectives of a case from 35 years ago.

374
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:52,890
It could be about a grudge or wanting to find out something.

375
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:57,330
If he's looking for some information, what the hell could that be?

376
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:00,000
Don't think about it anymore today and get some rest.

377
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:08,680
Something keeps bothering me.

378
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,000
The past, that Lee Jung Yeop spoke of in the interrogation room.

379
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,260
He was adopted, right?

380
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:18,440
How about his original family in Korea? Wouldn't we find something if we looked into them?

381
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,150
Everyone in his family died.

382
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,560
What?

383
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,540
Where did you investigate that?

384
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:37,190
At the adoption support center. I had gone there a couple of times before.

385
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:43,990
I just looked into it. I got interested in it professionally.

386
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,180
I think it's going to be a good case study.

387
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,650
It's going to go well with the book I'm writing as well.

388
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,800
Yes, I'm Cha Jae Hwan from Jungsan Police Station, Violent Crimes Unit.

389
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,650
 Good morning. Do you want to grab some coffee?

390
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,770
Coffee?

391
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,860
What happened to your face?

392
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:33,250
State secret. Are you worried about me?

393
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:39,790
What do you need that you barged in like this early in the morning?

394
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:44,080
Please help me find someone.

395
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:48,820
Just because you gave me some information, you're acting like a creditor asking for money.

396
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,230
Who?

397
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,900
The survivors.

398
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,860
What?

399
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,960
At Hanmyeong University graduate school in the chemistry department in 1984,

400
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,730
there were five researchers in the TH-5 development research team.

401
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,820
The three of them, including the professor, were killed by Chimera—

402
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,120
Now, now, now. Slow down.

403
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,800
It's morning. Slow down.

404
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,380
Out of five researchers, three died. Then how many remain?

405
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,190
I'm not sure.

406
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:18,790
Gosh, seriously. Baek Eun Cheol and Ryu Seong Hui remain. But I can't find those two.

407
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:19,720
Why would you look for them?

408
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,400
They were on the same team as the deceased.

409
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,530
Exploring those around the victim. Isn't that basic for a detective?

410
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,290
- Reporter Kim. 
 - Yes.

411
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:34,780
Why are you so interested in Chimera?

412
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,730
It's interesting.

413
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:43,070
Really? Is that all?

414
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,670
Are you going to help me or not?

415
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,870
If you don't want to help me, I'll just go.

416
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:52,360
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

417
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,820
I'm about to cooperate with you. Gosh, you're so impatient.

418
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,410
You promise, right? To help each other?

419
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,850
Help each other? I'm the only one helping you.

420
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:03,840
Yes.

421
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,860
Why don't we go to Hanmyeong University first?

422
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:10,020
I can't. I have to go somewhere today.

423
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:15,000
Okay.

424
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,080
Thank you.

425
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,330
Who are you meeting here?

426
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:38,500
I'm not meeting anyone. I'm here for treatment.

427
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,420
Goodbye.

428
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,320
You have to call me, okay?

429
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,060
I'm not sure. It's hard to conclude that TH-5 is the cause solely based on the chart.

430
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:04,150
Tomorrow?

431
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:07,460
Yes, I'll make time.

432
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:10,920
Hello.

433
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,130
I'm sorry, Doctor. I told him you haven't started seeing patients yet.

434
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,520
- I'll call you back. 
 - He's my doctor.

435
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,850
This is an emergency. Look at this. It hurts so much.

436
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,690
It's okay.

437
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:23,080
All right.

438
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,260
Should we take a look?

439
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,520
Yes, it's healing well.

440
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,740
We'll pull out the stitches in two weeks.

441
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:55,420
Would you like some tea?

442
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,640
You're taking your prescribed medicine on time, right?

443
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:05,020
I can't believe you worry about me.

444
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:09,570
How can you leave like that without saying anything? I was so disappointed.

445
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:13,210
We're close enough to be caretakers for each other, are we?

446
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:18,600
You make IEDs well.

447
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,670
I guess you learned stuff like that at SAS  (Special Air Service – British Army)?

448
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:26,410
We learn worse things. Like how to kill someone without any external injuries.

449
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:35,920
I got to take a CT scan, thanks to your setting it up for me.

450
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,000
Good.

451
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,060
Just in case you put something in my brain while I was unconscious.

452
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:46,720
I'm not that skilled, though.

453
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,900
Which side are you on?

454
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,840
You mentioned before.

455
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:57,090
"Chimera" represents an entity with two different genes in one body.

456
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:59,550
Which side are you?

457
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,210
On the side of saving people?

458
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:08,930
Or hurting people?

459
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:15,680
Alzheimer, Parkinson's. Most of my patients are heading for death.

460
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,690
I can't say I'm on the side of saving people's lives.

461
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,460
Why do you think I came here?

462
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:32,780
While searching for the answer, I came up with other questions instead of answers.

463
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,640
Ham Yong Bok. Who is he?

464
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,560
What is your relationship with him?

465
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,490
He was a former cop.

466
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:57,740
Why did you search for him?

467
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:02,020
Is he the next person you spoke of?

468
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:09,370
What kind of detective are you?

469
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:16,370
Could I trust you?

470
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:25,840
When you find the answer to that, let's talk again then.

471
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,570
 1982

472
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:51,570
 1983

473
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:53,030
 1984

474
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,720
 1984

475
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,880
 1984

476
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,360
 June 22, 1984

477
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:27,860
 Dear God, please forgive me.

478
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,160
 To protect this person,

479
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,910
 I commited a sin again today.

480
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:35,210
 I pray...

481
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:40,990
 Please let me alone take this karma with me.

482
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:49,160
 July 5, 1984: I'm sorry. If only I hadn't seen anything...

483
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,500
 July 19, 1984

484
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,570
 Good evening. (In German)

485
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:30,610
 I come as a stranger and leave again.

486
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:34,100
 My beloved, sleep tight.

487
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:38,980
 I will not disturb your dream and your rest.

488
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:42,620
 I will head to the door quietly without making any noise

489
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,650
 and write "good bye" there

490
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:50,940
 so that you may know my heart when you see it.

491
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:20,270
 1984

492
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:29,470
Yes?

493
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,140
What is all this?

494
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:46,020
It's the suicide note of the deceased Lee Sang Wu.

495
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,010
I was analyzing it.

496
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:50,830
What did you find that you summoned me early this morning?

497
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:53,600
First, would you like to see it?

498
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,020
Yes.

499
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:06,230
Do you know what's strange about this letter?

500
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:07,380
 I feel miserable.

501
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,730
 I tried to live a decent life...

502
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:10,150
 Since then, I couldn't find a job. So I struggled.

503
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:12,010
 I feel bad for my wife and my child, more than anything.

504
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,550
 I...

505
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:14,960
 I will reveal...

506
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,390
 I will reveal...

507
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:17,460
 I feel bad...

508
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,000
 I'm so ashamed.

509
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,390
 I feel bad toward the detectives, too.

510
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:23,070
 I'm deeply regretful.

511
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:27,820
This doesn't sound like a suicide note but a confession.

512
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,130
Bingo.

513
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:34,470
Generally speaking, the structure of confessions usually consists of before, during, and after the incident.

514
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:38,980
The ratio of those portions is usually 3:5:3 or 3:3:3.

515
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:41,970
But look at the portions for A, B, C.

516
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:46,230
Part B is the shortest although it's the meat of the content. Shouldn't that part be the longest?

517
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:48,140
And lastly, there.

518
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,050
 520401-134340 Lee Sang Wu

519
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:52,560
His ID number and his signature.

520
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,630
No one writes down their ID number when writing a suicide note.

521
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:58,830
That's right. Then this is...

522
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:03,640
That's not all. This letter has so many suspicious elements.

523
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,870
 News at this hour

524
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:23,370
 Ahjeossi Hyeong Guk

525
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:28,140
Yes, Ahjeossi. I'm almost there.

526
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:43,500
Scientific Content Analysis. It's called SCAN.

527
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,970
There's a method used to decipher false text developed in Israel.

528
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:49,610
This reveals a few characteristics of that.

529
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:52,530
- Could you look at what I've marked? 
 - Yes.

530
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:56,300
First, the language. Specifically the changes in addressing himself.

531
00:56:56,300 --> 00:57:00,290
In part A, he uses "I"

532
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:06,240
but in part B where it talks about the crime, he uses "I" or "He."

533
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,410
There are sentences without the subject, either.

534
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:11,350
That's right. There are changes in tenses, too.

535
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:15,040
In parts A and C, he is writing in the past tense.

536
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,950
But in part B, he says writing in the present tense.

537
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:22,610
I see some edits and additions in part B.

538
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,390
 Crossed out "House" and added "June 9th"

539
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:26,520
This is usually—

540
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,600
When you're writing something that is being dictated.

541
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,420
A dictation means...

542
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:33,080
Now, that's not all.

543
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,040
The next is the omission of information.

544
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,910
When you're writing down lies, you tend to be brief.

545
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:40,880
When you're describing what you experienced, you will get specific.

546
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:45,040
But when you're writing down lies, you subconsciously tend to skip portions of the story.

547
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:49,300
Look at part B. There are no detailed descriptions of the crime.

548
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:53,150
"I bought gasoline. I started the fire."

549
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:54,490
It's too simple.

550
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:56,170
And over here.

551
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:59,320
"In the meantime, a little while later."

552
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,110
This is to change the subject.

553
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:04,790
You usually use these phrases when you're omitting or skipping something.

554
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:07,860
It shows that he doesn't want to talk about it.

555
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,510
And next is here.

556
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:16,930
"I regret it. I'm sorry. I'm ashamed to face my wife."

557
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:19,430
This specifies unnecessary information.

558
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:24,440
It leaves out all the facts and fills out the paper with his feelings.

559
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:29,030
How about this part where he says, "I feel bad when I think of the victims' family"?

560
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:32,690
It expresses the feelings about the third party that he has no relation to.

561
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:36,990
You know how we usually say stuff like that when we watch others' tragedies on TV?

562
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:39,780
"My heart aches for them."

563
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:48,130
What would the real culprit have said under this circumstance?

564
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:53,690
Simply, "I'm sorry."

565
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:19,900
This isn't a suicide note. It's a confession.

566
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:24,080
A fake one that was written under coercion.

567
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:29,690
That means the person who wrote this isn't the real culprit.

568
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:35,100
Lee Sang Wu. Do you think he really committed suicide?

569
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:39,710
 Delivery

570
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:47,120
What is it?

571
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:49,840
It's for you.

572
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,210
Did you have something delivered?

573
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:55,270
I don't have a delivery.

574
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:57,350
Open it.

575
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:05,860
Why don't you open it?

576
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:08,770
Why are you acting like that?

577
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:30,780
What's this?

578
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:34,470
 Myths of Greece and Rome

579
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,840
Is it interesting? That book.

580
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:10,190
 Myths of Greece and Rome

581
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,830
 Myths of Greece and Rome

582
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:36,930
The philosophy of the Confucian era can't save us anymore.

583
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:43,360
But could the lessons learned in myths save us?

584
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:06,270
 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar;

585
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:09,760
 the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare. (2 Peter 3:10)

586
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:18,180
I have a different question.

587
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:21,310
If Lee Sang Wu wasn't Chimera,

588
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:34,810
then who could be the real Chimera?

589
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:05,450

590
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,530
 Chimera

591
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:29,690
 All the murder victims are connected to Lee Sang Wu's arrest and death.

592
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:31,800
 Revenge of the dead Lee Sang Wu'?

593
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,410
 Who is that guy?

594
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:35,780
 I'm only looking for an answer.

595
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:38,430
 Those guys got bigger and stronger since then.

596
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:40,390
 Don't waste your life on that!

597
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:44,290
 This case may be painful for you, Detective Cha. But it's interesting for me.

598
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:47,610
 He could've been framed and murdered.

599
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:50,920
 I am Chimera!
