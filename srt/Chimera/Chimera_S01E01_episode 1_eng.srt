1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,910

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,390
 Chimera

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,100
 The characters, locations, incidents, religious sects, etc. in this drama are fiction and have no relation to reality.

4
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:39,100
 A mythical creature with a lion's face, a goat's body and a snake's tail.

5
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,660
 A monster that kills humans by spewing fire out of his mouth.

6
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,430
 A chimera.

7
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,860
 Chimera, a monster in Greek mythology,

8
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,910
 also refers to an organism that has more than one DNA set.

9
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,010
Shoot.

10
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,670
I said to shoot.

11
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,120
Shoot!

12
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,360
 What was he trying to tell me in that instant?

13
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,790
 The eyes staring at me were warm and sad.

14
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,020
 Why did he say that?

15
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:35,220
 Why did the killer's eyes make my heart palpitate?

16
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:45,410
 Episode 1

17
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,410
 August, 2019, Seoul

18
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,050
 EOD 
 Explosive Ordnance Disposal

19
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,290
Hello.

20
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,010
Let me pass, okay? Passing through.

21
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,630
Thanks.

22
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,130
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

23
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,410
- Working hard? 
 - Yes.

24
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,130
This simulation will strengthen your ability to respond to an IED.

25
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:17,220
And in order to learn the on-site inspection function, with the support of the Air Force's EOD,

26
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,540
our police station's PBI Team (Post Blast Investigation) will simulate

27
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,390
the terrorist incidents that are recently occurring frequently in southeast Asia.

28
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,640
Today Eugene Hathaway, an FBI terrorist specialist

29
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,660
will personally supervise the test.

30
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:48,470
An IED, Improvised Explosive Device,

31
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:53,190
is a bomb made from chemicals that can be found in daily life.

32
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,190
Terrorism utilizing IEDs is increasing internationally.

33
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,680
We're using beef and blood, which I'm placing here

34
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,830
in order to test how and how far human tissue and blood

35
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,990
are scattered by an IED explosion.

36
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,090
The explosive that I'm going to use is an ANFO,

37
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,010
a mixture of ammonium nitrate and diesel.

38
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,290
It's typical of homemade bombs.

39
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,940
When used for crime or terrorism, metal beads and nails or something similar

40
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,180
will be placed here around the explosive.

41
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,070
You remember the incident at the Boston Marathon in the US in 2013, right?

42
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,840
There were many casualties because of metal beads placed in a pressure cooker.

43
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,990
What about Korea?

44
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:41,040
Do you say that terrorism has a remote chance in this country?

45
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,780
Explode it!

46
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,240
 Bomb Disposal Unit

47
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,460
Bomb! Bomb!

48
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,380
Bomb!

49
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,220
 Post Bomb Investigation

50
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,700
Awesome! Wow!

51
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,500
The force was incredible. An ANFO is so powerful.

52
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:32,480
Someday this image will become real in the middle of Seoul.

53
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,000
This was a simulation of a terrorist incident utilizing a homemade bomb.

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,600
 KCSI
  Forensics 
 POLICE

55
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,000
- Team Leader. 
 - Oh, you came?

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,010
Yes. But why does it look like a checkerboard today? The immediate scene of the incident?

57
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,900
It's the FBI style.  One-meter grid.

58
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,750
It's American style because an American planned it.

59
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,680
But is she really FBI?

60
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,440
She looks Korean. Is she Korean? A Korean living abroad?

61
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,270
Jeez, you have a lot of questions.

62
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,260
If you're going to be like that, instead of violent crimes, join the forensics team.

63
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,620
But isn't it good to be a strong arm in violent crimes?

64
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,500
Hey, hey! You! Wait! Wait!

65
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,980
You punks!

66
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,260
You guys think I am a pushover, don't you?

67
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,750
Do you think I don't know how you guys planned this?

68
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,070
Give me my money.  I said give me my money!

69
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,120
The old geezer is starting again.

70
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,170
- What kind of bad manners is this? 
 - Scammers!

71
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,460
How dare you talk to me like that?

72
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,470
You guys cheated me first.

73
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,550
You cheated the wrong guy.

74
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,720
Come on!

75
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,240
Hey.

76
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,260
The old geezer's screwing around again.

77
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,850
I told you if you screwed up one more time, you're out.

78
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,380
Why are you doing this to me?

79
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,540
The guy wearing glasses had a hidden card.

80
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,110
Look at the CCTV.

81
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,790
Okay, I won't do that.  Please cut me some slack for the last time.

82
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,840
Just once more.

83
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,810
Let me go. Punks.

84
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,060
What do people see, rainbows?

85
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,790
I am someone who used to kill and spare people with a pen stick (stab).

86
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:50,110
Have you ever met someone with brains?

87
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
What is this?

88
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,630
Why isn't it going up?

89
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,510
So annoying.

90
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,860
What is this about?

91
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,870
Everything is burnt.  Burnt.

92
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,080
- Is that a lighter? 
 - You startled me!

93
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,450
What does it look like? Anyway ...

94
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,590
Jeez, with your dirty hands. What happened to your gloves?

95
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,240
Hey.

96
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,050
Is the car defective?

97
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,720
It would cause a circus if it were recalled. (TN: Car manufacturer  would have to recall defective cars.)

98
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,500
I think it was suicide.

99
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,880
What did he kill himself with? There's no charcoal.

100
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,880
Isn't it all gone because it got burnt?

101
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,260
Charcoal fires leave a mark in a round shape.

102
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,430
There must have been butane gas somewhere.

103
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,500
It looks like he ate and slept in the car.

104
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,460
Didn't he have a house?

105
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,710
He's going to be hard to identify.

106
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,380
I can't smell anything.

107
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,600
Smell?  What kind of smell?

108
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,770
If a fire were lit, there should have been a  combustible substance.

109
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,620
If that was what happened, there would be a smell, whether it was gasoline or alcohol or something similar.

110
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,400
If there was a fire, wouldn't it all dissipate?

111
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,730
If it were ignited with oil, it would smell like oil. If it were ignited with gas, it would smell like gas.

112
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,420
Because what was left dissipated, it's not like the scene of a fire.

113
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,870
Something went wrong. If you're done with your investigation, turn it over to the traffic investigation department.

114
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,340
There's something strange.

115
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,360
- You can't see the point of origin of the fire. 
 - What's that?

116
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,280
Point of origin. Where the fire started or something like that. Point of origin.

117
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,980
How many urgent burglary and rape cases are there?

118
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,710
Seonbae! Are you sure this is a big deal?

119
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,420
You're the problem! Every time we have a case

120
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,100
the detective has doubts.

121
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,920
But, like the team leader said, there must have been butane gas or something like it.

122
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,750
Look at this. So haphazard.

123
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,680
It isn't butane gas.

124
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,790
What?

125
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,840
There is no gasoline or charcoal for lighting coal briquettes. There isn't even any thinner here.

126
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,580
Then what is it?

127
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,690
 Report of Fire Assessment Results

128
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,780
- There was no cause. 
 - What?

129
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,240
There was no cause for the fire.

130
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,780
 Report of Fire Assessment Results

131
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,720
There is no such thing as something without a cause. We just haven't been able to find it yet.

132
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,220
I guess that's true. You can't find things like cigarettes after they burn.

133
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,660
Cigarettes catching fire? Does that make sense to you?

134
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,170
As long as the cigarette can produce embers, it can burn. Why wouldn't it be possible?

135
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,990
- Inside the car? 
 - Yeah. On the seats.

136
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,570
Don't you think that the synthetic materials in the car ceiling and floor burn well if there is a spark?

137
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,850
What? So a spark from a lit cigarette or something like that caused the fire?

138
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,860
But I just sat there oblivious until my whole body burned?

139
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,100
You could have been drunk and fallen asleep.

140
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,370
- I don't think that's what happened. 
 - Why not?

141
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,530
You can't sleep while driving. The car was still running.

142
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,270
Exactly!

143
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,950
So did the car really just explode on its own?

144
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,930
There is a saying that you burn on the way to hell.

145
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,660
They say that the most agonizing death is to burn to death.

146
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,580
I don't know. There are a lot of charred bodies out there.

147
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,480
So, in the West, wasn't burning at the stake the worst execution?

148
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,650
Burning can also mean purification. So it depends on your religion.

149
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:21,460
But look at this. Combustion hematoma.

150
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,600
When a person's skull heats up, it bleeds. 
  Combustion hematoma: bleeding that appears as a result of thermal rupture of the skull.

151
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,950
There is no subdural hemorrhage or skull damage. This isn't the type of bleeding that happens when someone is alive.

152
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,470
How can you tell?

153
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,050
There is a burn on the mucous membrane of the airway.

154
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:39,460
That's a sign that flames were inhaled when the victim was still breathing.

155
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,840
- Geez. 
 - Usually, someone who has burned will have thermal fractures.

156
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:49,730
A thermal fracture happens when the body burns. It means that the heat has broken the bones.

157
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:55,960
- The bones? 
 In those cases, it can be difficult to distinguish from a fracture that occurred earlier on when the person was still alive.

158
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,280
But look here.

159
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,230
What is that?

160
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,860
It means that the bones were broken and fused back together at the same time.

161
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,070
Is this not a suicide then?

162
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,490
Doctor. Is it possible for someone to suddenly catch fire on their own?

163
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,320
You mean spontaneous combustion?

164
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,420
- There have been some cases where people have spontaneously caught fire and died. 
 - Aren't all of those cases in America?

165
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,660
Is there a rule that it couldn't happen in Korea?

166
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,190
Were the causes of those cases ever determined?

167
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:38,310
Since it is an American issue, you should go ask an American.

168
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,440

169
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,170
 Eugene Hathaway
 Criminal Behavior Science

170
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,160
Excuse me. Is this really a real case?

171
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,970
In English, it's called Spontaneous Human Combustion. It's one of the most well-recognized mysteries.

172
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,660
If it is a mystery, that means that we still don't know the cause, right?

173
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,760
But the case you brought up. Is it different from this one?

174
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,500
This is more like an explosion than a fire.

175
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,290
Explosion?

176
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,600
Sorry I couldn't be of more help.

177
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,730
Have you ever seen anything similar to this?

178
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,110
In America I mean?

179
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,590
I'm not sure.

180
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:45,750
There was nothing in this car. No material that could feed the fire, and nothing as the point of origin.

181
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,990
Is that possible?

182
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,830
The people from forensics also don't know the cause.

183
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:56,290
This is the first time we've had a case like this. It's not easy.

184
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:04,790
It is odd. It's hard to draw any conclusion from just a picture.

185
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,670
Can I visit the site in person?

186
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,960
You're here on assignment right? How long have you been here?

187
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,040
One year.

188
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,510
But your Korean is really good.

189
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:35,590
I hung out with a lot of Korean students, so I watched some Korean dramas too.

190
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,540
Looking at you, it would seem like you've lived in Korea for most of your life.

191
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,590
Since your last name is Hathaway, is your father an American?

192
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,320
Both my mother and father are Americans.

193
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,390
So, how did you get into the FBI?

194
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:09,280
My major was Social Psychology and I saw something interesting after going to a lecture about serial killers.

195
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,750
What was it?

196
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,520
The room of a serial killer who murdered 14 people.

197
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,650
What was interesting about that room?

198
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,140
It looked exactly like mine.

199
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,690
The car windows were smashed because of the blast.

200
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,330
Look over here.

201
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:05,660
If the car itself is the issue, the engine explodes and flames spread from one side to the other.

202
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,760
But that isn't what happened here.

203
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,420
Was there really nothing here?

204
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:18,820
That's impossible. A fire can start from just an ember, but an explosion is completely different.

205
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,490
There must have been something inside.

206
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:25,420
By that do you mean that someone put something inside the car?

207
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,190
Probably.

208
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,560
To go as far as to use fire to kill someone?

209
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,340
The fire probably served a specific purpose to the person who set it.

210
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,660
- Purpose? 
 - There are two options.

211
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,610
The first is to hide the scene. The second is to reveal it.

212
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,550
Hiding it makes sense to me, but what do you mean by using fire to reveal the scene?

213
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:52,590
Maybe they wanted the body to be found.

214
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,270
Why?

215
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,270
Well, for example, they could have wanted insurance money.

216
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,270
Once a body is found, you can confirm that someone died and collect life insurance.

217
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:05,130
Or you could manipulate alibis, you could set fires at a specific time.

218
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,430
Whatever the case, the goal is clear. They wanted us to look at this.

219
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:14,520
Like some sort of notice?

220
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,530
Did you identify the victim?

221
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,120
His name is Son Wan Gi. He was 65 and has been detained several times

222
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,560
for drunk driving and committing violent acts while drunk.

223
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,590
- What? 
 - This is Son Wan Gi's house, right?

224
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:46,250
That person doesn't live here! How many times do I have to say this?

225
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,760
This is the address listed for him though?

226
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,800
  Lee Geon Yeong 
 National Police Agency

227
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,910
It's been a while since that man left.

228
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,960
But why are you asking?

229
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,180
So he reported his girlfriend's address.

230
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,110
Can we trust her?

231
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,740
He could have been here.

232
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,330
Is there no CCTV here?

233
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,260
- Geon Yeong, let's take a look around. 
 - Sure.

234
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,240
I'll go right, you go left. Let's go!

235
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,100
Seonbae, this way is longer.

236
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,070
- Lee Geon Yeong 
 - What?

237
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,390
You must be too comfortable at work these days.

238
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,170
Seonbae, the way you talk is gradually starting to sound more and more like our team leader.

239
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,090
Wait. Now that I look closer, you look like him too!

240
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,800
Hey!

241
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,360
Hey, where is he? Where did he go?

242
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:57,450
It's obvious you're following me.  Good job.

243
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,850
- Did you come here looking for Son Wan Gi? 
 - Huh?

244
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,650
What are you? Are you hanging around someone?

245
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,250
Damn. It was so hard for me to find this address.

246
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,430
I'm in a rush to find that guy.

247
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,360
Do you know where he is?

248
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:20,660
No, we don't.  How would we know where he went?

249
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,720
It seems you know who Son Wan Gi is.

250
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:40,670
I guess you didn't hear the news. Son Wan Gi is dead.

251
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,430
You didn't know?

252
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,670
Hey, hey.

253
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:00,120
I guess you're not curious about how he died.

254
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,600
 Name:  Hong Yeong Sik/ Registration Number: 820928-199273/ Address: 354-2 Insu-dong, Nohyeong-gu, Seoul

255
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,060
Both of you have convictions for the illegal collection of high interest on private loans.

256
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,200
We're a licensed company. We don't do anything illegal.

257
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:20,590
You don't? The autopsy showed he had broken ribs.

258
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,140
Googil Capital. Team Leader Hong Gil Dong.

259
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,200
Team Leader Kang Ho Dong.

260
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,600
- That asshole—  
  - Oh, ho!

261
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,900
Show some respect for the deceased!

262
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,120
The deceased visited the woman's house from time to time.

263
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,420
Whenever he had money.

264
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,720
What money?  A person with poor credit ...

265
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,100
Detective. A couple of months ago, I deducted the interest for three months.

266
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,510
In cash. I can show you the ledger.

267
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,740
Where did he get the money?

268
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,760
There was a rumor he had latched on to a financier.

269
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,010
A financier?

270
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:04,520
In a gambling house, they say that when someone is clumsy at laundering money.

271
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,440
Where is it?  That house?

272
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,080
He's not from this neighborhood.

273
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,860
Who are you looking for?

274
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,900
A living person?  A dead person?

275
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,560
Do you know Son Wan Gi?

276
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,540
He was known here as Quick But No Talent.

277
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,140
Son Wan Gi?

278
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,470
- Reporter Son. 
 - He was a reporter?

279
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,520
I heard he was a reporter in the past.

280
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,840
Quick-witted and quick on his feet.

281
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,210
But he had no talent.  On the floor, he was a loser.

282
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,560
Did he hang out with anyone?

283
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,890
Or was there anyone with whom he didn't get along?

284
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,280
Did that human live as a person with resentment as his only ability?

285
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,330
I heard he had a financial backer.

286
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,490
A doctor.

287
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,230
Doctor?

288
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:40,480
Detective, does this look like a hand tremor?

289
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:44,700
That person knew immediately after seeing it once.

290
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,510
Do you know what Parkinson's Disease is?

291
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,800
Do you know the name of the doctor?

292
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,320
Where is the doctor?

293
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,740
I don't know that.

294
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,880
There's a camera in the store, right?

295
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,430
I'll take  a few recordings of Son Wan Gi.

296
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:20,200
Take whatever.  He's dead anyway.

297
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,140
I didn't say that he was dead.

298
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:33,070
Then, why would a detective come all the way here looking for someone alive?

299
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,490
You're right.

300
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:46,390
How did he die?

301
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,810
Lack of exercise and stress?

302
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,660
I'm sure he got bitten by an animal.

303
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,240
Pardon?

304
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,270
An animal raised by a human.

305
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,780
But it's bigger than an animal that can catch and eat people.

306
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:17,500
An animal smaller than a person.

307
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,340
Be careful.

308
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,020
If you want to extend your lifeline.

309
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,540
Seonbae, do you think it's this person?

310
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,430
Did a good one come out?

311
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,370
I think this guy knew where the camera was. This is the best one.

312
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,780
Doctor.

313
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:17,810
Doctor and reporter.

314
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,850
Reporter Son Wan Gi?

315
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,680
 Search Reporter Son Wan Gi

00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,700
What did you find?

322
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,750
Peace Times Reporter Son Wan Gi?

323
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,740
The arson murder case in Macheon City, Gyeonggi-do.

324
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:11,900
- There it is. 
 - Thank you.

325
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,400
There was a series of arson cases in Macheon City in 1984.

326
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:22,040
It was called the Chimera Case. Three people were killed in an explosion of unknown cause.

327
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,930
It is very similar to our case.

328
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:38,110
Oh, this case.  I heard about it when I was being trained.

329
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:42,630
There was a huge explosion in the 80's.  The MO  (method of crime)  was also unknown.

330
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,320
A strange story emerged.

331
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,110
Was the cause ever discovered?

332
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,400
I can't say. I heard it's just arson.

333
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:55,460
Do you have any other info?  About this incident.

334
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,380
There isn't any info left.

335
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:01,100
The only thing in the National Police Agency's official database is a summary of the case

336
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,520
and a set of photos.

337
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:10,290
The case is so similar and isn't the MO similar?

338
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,270
What happened in the old days?

339
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,080
Isn't there a seonbae  "senior"  who knows?

340
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,900
Seonbae who knows?  Oh, won't Team Leader know?

341
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,750
If he knew, he would have bragged about it.  That geezer.

342
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,920
Right, right.

343
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,220
It says this is the suspect, right?

344
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,660
Yes. 
   Suspect in the Macheon City Arson Murder.

  FireFire Firefighter's Journal.

347
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,660
But this blog ... where did he get all the info?

348
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,320
I'll ask when I meet him.

349
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,480
The investigator himself?

350
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,760
Where did I leave his contact?

351
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,070
C'mon.  Will he contact you?

352
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:03,130
She is FBI.  FBI, will you get a call soon?

353
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:06,390
If it's the FBI, the dude will think it's a joke.

354
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,510
- I'll bet 10,000 won she gets a call. 
 - Jeez.

355
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,800
- Twenty thousand he doesn't call. 
 - Deal.

356
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,760
 Chimera 1984

357
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,620
Chimera.

358
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:26,350
The others all have local names.  Why is this the only one called the "Chimera Case"?

359
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:31,060
Investigator, isn't chimera the name of a monster from Greek mythology?

360
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:36,630
Right.  A mythical creature with a lion's face, a goat's body and a snake's tail.

361
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:40,990
An evil monster that kills humans by spewing fire out of its mouth.

362
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,360
Why did it become a Western monster out of the blue?

363
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,800
It appears without fail at the scene of an incident.

364
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,060
What? A monster?

365
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,980
A lighter.  With a chimera design on it.

366
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,800
The criminal's signature.

367
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,450
Awesome. He was so sophisticated for an old-time criminal. Right?

368
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,490
 - Is that a lighter?
 - You startled me. It's nothing.

369
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,890
Team Leader Han.

370
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:32,800
I heard there's been a notice of an assembly this weekend, and we should be on standby.

371
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,190
Are they hiring strongarms?

372
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:39,430
Man, don't you know there was a fire in front of Seoul Bank headquarters last week?

373
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:42,090
The precinct captain there was demoted.

374
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,690
Let's not let such unpleasant things happen here.

375
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,260
Umm, chief.

376
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,850
Do you remember Son Wan Gi?

377
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,740
Who?

378
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:08,730
He was the reporter who gathered info on Lee Sang Wu during the Chimera Case.

379
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,770
About him? What?

380
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:18,120
This time, he's the one who died.

381
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:25,000
From a car explosion. It's the same as it was thirty-five years ago.

382
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,490
- Maybe— 
 - What?

383
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,660
Nothing.

384
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:51,470
Team Leader Han.  Don't you have a lot on your mind nowadays, right before retirement?

385
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:57,560
If so, why are you bringing up old stories for nothing?

386
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,630
Why here?

387
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,900
It wasn't just to kill.

388
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,500
He needed a spectacular stage

389
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,090
for the roar and fireworks of the explosion.

390
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,750
If he did,

391
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:57,350
he followed, stopped and decided where it should be carried out.

392
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,360
But why is it here?

393
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,060
It's secluded here.

394
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,430
It's on the verge of redevelopment, so there's almost no transient population.

395
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:11,950
It is visible but a place where other casualties would not occur.

396
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,180
The culprit is a cautious person.

397
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,300
Arsonists don't think deeply about anything.

398
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,890
Rather than saying the target is important, their main goal is to watch.

399
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:24,580
Right.  I'm positive he watched it.

400
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,930
But from where?

401
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,290
That's not it.

402
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,670
He put something in the car first.

403
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:25,850
No.  If I wanted to fill the car,

404
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,730
how would I fill the car with gas?

405
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,960
If you put a hose through a window,

406
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:43,090
it will leak. Did he put it in the air conditioner?

407
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:47,540
Then, the trunk is better. If you put a hose through and pull it out, like this.

408
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,190
Hold on.  Then, where did he get the canister of gas?

409
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,700
He would probably carry it in the car, right?

410
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:03,110
A big one? What about a suitcase?

411
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:06,730
The culprit drove a truck or something like a truck and could have passed through here.

412
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,800
How about it ... shall we look into trucks that frequented this area?

413
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,670
If not, could he be living in this neighborhood?

414
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,290
No way.

415
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,900
Hello.

416
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,190
Yes.  I'm the one who left a message.

417
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:37,120
Yes, I'm fine today. Yes, I'll go there.

418
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:42,220
- It's Fire Fire Firefighter. 
 - Oh, he really contacted you.

419
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,860
How much was our bet before?

420
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,230
You owe me another.

421
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,130
- I'm going. 
 - I will escort you.

422
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,770
No, I'm fine.

423
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:00,930
Call me if anything comes out. Huh?

424
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:04,170
 Police Line

425
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,100
Ah, left.  There.  Left, left.

426
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,510
Left, left.

427
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,120
Okay.

428
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,430
What are you looking at?

429
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:06,010
Regardless of what he does with the gas canisters, the person cannot be someone who stands out.

430
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,330
- Geon Yeong, what's the purpose of arson? 
 - The fire scene.

431
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:12,840
A bomb is installed here. If it were you, from where would you want to watch it?

432
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:18,560
Nearby, although, I think it would be dangerous because of the explosion.  But I could see it well.

433
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,560
That's the only building where you can see from the front.

434
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:26,760
Why are there new window frames in a building that will be redeveloped?

435
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:32,070
In a neighborhood that everyone has abandoned, this house is left alone.

436
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,960
- It's morning, but not early morning.  
 - What is it?

437
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,160
- It was originally supposed to explode in the morning. 
 - Huh?

438
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,900
The crooked gamblers' peak time.

439
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:53,020
Saying it was pushing it at 2 or 3 a.m. in the early morning, they would have started working after 4 a.m.

440
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,270
At the time Son Wan Gi is robbed clean and comes out,

441
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:01,430
the sun would have risen and be shining.

442
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:06,190
But the windows of that building face the sun to the east.

443
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:10,260
You can't watch it in the direct sunlight.

444
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,740
So you'd need to set something up.

445
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:18,860
I can see you, but you shouldn't be able to see me.

446
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,960
If so, then ...

447
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,430
Tinting ...

448
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,400
 Room 405, 416 Shinil-dong

449
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,100
 The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth

450
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,000
 and everything done in it will be laid bare. (2 Peters 3:10)

451
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,580
Room 405 is over there.

452
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,390
Excuse me.

453
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,070
Excuse me.

454
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:02,820
Do you happen to ...

455
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,410
Hey!

456
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,340
Punk.

457
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,210
Go around. Hurry.

458
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,970
Hello. You called me after seeing my blog, didn't you?

459
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:52,830
Yes.  Are you the Fire Fire firefighter?

460
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,410
Sorry for calling you all of a sudden.

461
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:57,030
That's okay.

462
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:00,530
But what brings you here?

463
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:04,360
I'm curious about some things you posted.

464
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,320
Hey, Geon Yeong.

465
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:10,340
He's gone. Gone.

466
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,310
He was so fast. Did you find anything?

467
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:16,630
Secure all the running away scenes in the CCTVs around the building.

468
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:19,130
I'll look through his home again.

469
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,710
That incident.  I personally investigated it because I was interested in it.

470
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:28,480
It's been 35 years since it was in 1984.

471
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,910
Why were you interested in the case?

472
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:33,680
There is no cause for why the fire broke out.

473
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,420
It's cool and terrifying.

474
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:44,070
It had a nickname too.  Mystery enthusiasts call it the Chimera Case.

475
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:45,600
Chimera?

476
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,750
You know that well.

477
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:52,250
Why was that design on the lighter found at the scene?

478
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:58,290
That was not publicized.

479
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:00,030
I heard it when I was in firefighter training.

480
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:04,770
Among us firefighters, we researched the causes of ignition and had discussions.

481
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:08,160
Do you know the point of origin of the ignition?

482
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,120
I found out later.

483
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,100
Of course, there's no way to prove it.

484
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,990
What was it?

485
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,790
Detective Cha.  I was going to call you anyway.

486
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:17,450
Um, Investigator.  Could you take a look at something?

487
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:33,030
This is a chimera, right?

488
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:35,870
There ... where is it?

489
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:38,480
It's near the scene. I think this is the hideout.

490
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,260
 How did you find it?

491
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:43,290
You know the building that you saw before in front?

492
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:46,250
I ran into a suspcious guy while searching here.

493
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,540
First, please look.

494
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,160
You can see it from right here.

495
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:57,360
The windows are obstruced now.

496
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:01,360
What do you mean obstructed? Can you show me the detail?

497
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,920
What else is in the room?

498
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,650
Wait ...

499
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,540
What is it?

500
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:26,250
- Get out. 
 - Huh?

501
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,220
Get out of there immediately!

502
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,490
What do you mean?

503
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:40,670
Get out of there immediately.  There's no time to explain.

504
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:09,150
The door won't open now.

505
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:11,500
I think it was broken deliberately.

506
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,130
Don't move.  It's dangerous.

507
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,900
Why?

508
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:21,100
It's filled there.

509
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:51,350
It's colorless. A colorless ...

510
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:57,470
Could it be ... oxygen?

511
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:03,570
 After experiencing it, the scariest thing is oxygen.

512
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:08,370
  Its natural concentration in air is about 20%.  Even if it is just 1% higher, it's dangerous.

513
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:10,040
That's over range.

514
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,760
If the concentration increases to even 30% in an unventilated space,

515
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,710
if there's a spark, there will be a fire.

516
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,810
Don't move. You can't move.

517
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:25,700
Fireworks, no, it's all over with just static electricity.

518
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,920
So that's why there's nothing here.

519
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,860
There will be nothing left after the fire.

520
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:41,380
Please wait. I'll come.

521
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:56,610
Investigator,

522
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,610
I think it's too late.

523
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:06,100
Detective Cha. Detective Cha!

524
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:00,190
 Emergency Room

525
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,830
The patient who fell arrived.

526
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:04,050
Please wake up. Wake up, Jae Hwan.

527
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:06,810
Please call an orthopedic surgeon. Stat!

528
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:11,130
One two three.

529
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:14,260
Can you go out and wait?

530
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:18,390
Pupils are okay. Check his vitals.

531
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:20,690
Yes.

532
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:26,370
Get a dressing cart and sutures ready.

533
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:30,260
Vitals are fine and oxygen saturation is normal.

534
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,150
Hurry.

535
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,650
Saline.

536
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,150
Forceps.

537
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:09,880
Are you conscious?

538
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,790
Detective Cha.

539
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,500
Investigator.

540
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,620
Are you okay?

541
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,730
Miss Eugene.

542
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:07,320
 Seoryun Hospital

543
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,860
Hello.

544
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:41,740
Where is he?

545
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:45,200
Mom. Hyeong. Did you come?

546
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,070
Seonbae, are you okay?

547
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:48,940
Can you just walk around like that?

548
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:51,150
I heard you fell from a building.

549
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:54,420
Hey, hey, hey. Look at him.

550
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,870
Hey, hey, who am I?

551
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:57,780
I'm not sure.  About 3 or 4 storys high?

552
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,050
There, well, I rotated three times mid air.

553
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:02,620
I fell backward.  End.

554
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:05,010
I'm fine.  I'm fine.

555
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:07,170
Patient, you can't move around like this.

556
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:10,440
A fine crack is more dangerous than a fracture.

557
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:17,100
Is there a crack?  Where?

558
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:21,440
- In the r— 
 - Won't you speak properly?

559
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,730
The rib. Everything else is fine.

560
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,530
I am sorry. I—

561
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:34,180
Where is an injured patient wandering off to?

562
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:37,770
The sun was nice so I took a walk. A walk.

563
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,520
Mother.

564
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:00,140
Now that I saw you, I'm satisfied.

565
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:03,340
Since I'm here, let's eat together.

566
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:06,050
Are you happy?

567
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:09,900
I can't leave the store empty for a long time. I'm leaving.

568
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:14,170
Goodbye, Mrs. Cha.

569
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:17,070
I will escort Sister-in-Law.

570
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,190
Are you okay?

571
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:37,990
I will take you home.

572
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:42,790
I'm okay.

573
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:41,080

574
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:45,780
♫  Some people want to live  ♫

575
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:49,680
♫  But turn their back on me  ♫

576
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:55,330
♫  The time I lived with me  ♫

577
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:57,950
♫  Some people say to me  ♫

 Chimera Preview

579
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:05,130
 Burning in a fire also means purifying.

580
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:07,630
 I heard there was an explosion in the middle of Seoul.

581
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:10,000
 Don't you think the culprit could have a next target?

582
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,340
  For people like us, even if we killed someone, it wouldn't be obvious.

583
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:15,760
 Doctor.

584
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,490
  Why is the pattern and sequence of events similar?

585
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:20,740
 1984 Han Ju Seok?

586
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,330
 Who are you?

587
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:24,170
 Who are you?

588
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:26,480
 Team Leader is missing.

589
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,850
 Please don't come.
